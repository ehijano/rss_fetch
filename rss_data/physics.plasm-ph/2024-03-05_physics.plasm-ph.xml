      <title>Tokamak to Stellarator Conversion using Permanent Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advances in the optimization of magnetic field equilibria, stellarators have become a serious alternative to the tokamak, bringing this concept to the forefront of the pursuit of fusion energy. In order to be successful in experimentally demonstrating the viability of optimized stellarators, we must overcome any potential hurdles in the construction of its electromagnetic coils. Finding cost-effective ways of increasing the number of operating optimized stellarators could be key in cementing this magnetic confinement concept as a contender for a reactor. In this work, an alternative to modular coils, permanent magnets, are studied and are shown to enable the possibility of converting a tokamak into a stellarator. This is then applied to the case of ISTTOK tokamak, where an engineering design study is conducted.</description>

      <title>Data-driven local operator finding for reduced-order modelling of plasma systems: I. Concept and verifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced-order plasma models that can efficiently predict plasma behavior across various settings and configurations are highly sought after yet elusive. The demand for such models has surged in the past decade due to their potential to facilitate scientific research and expedite the development of plasma technologies. In line with the advancements in computational power and data-driven methods, we introduce the "Phi Method" in this two-part article. Part I presents this novel algorithm, which employs constrained regression on a candidate term library informed by numerical discretization schemes to discover discretized systems of differential equations. We demonstrate Phi Method's efficacy in deriving reliable and robust reduced-order models (ROMs) for three test cases: the Lorenz attractor, flow past a cylinder, and a 1D Hall-thruster-representative plasma. Part II will delve into the method's application for parametric dynamics discovery. Our results show that ROMs derived from the Phi Method provide remarkably accurate predictions of systems' behavior, whether derived from steady-state or transient-state data. This underscores the method's potential for transforming plasma system modeling.</description>

      <title>Data-driven local operator finding for reduced-order modelling of plasma systems: II. Application to parametric dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world systems often exhibit dynamics influenced by various parameters, either inherent or externally controllable, necessitating models capable of reliably capturing these parametric behaviors. Plasma technologies exemplify such systems. For example, phenomena governing global dynamics in Hall thrusters (a spacecraft propulsion technology) vary with various parameters, such as the "self-sustained electric field". In this Part II, following on the introduction of our novel data-driven local operator finding algorithm, Phi Method, in Part I, we showcase the method's effectiveness in learning parametric dynamics to predict system behavior across unseen parameter spaces. We present two adaptations: the "parametric Phi Method" and the "ensemble Phi Method", which are demonstrated through 2D fluid-flow-past-a-cylinder and 1D Hall-thruster-plasma-discharge problems. Comparative evaluation against parametric OPT-DMD in the fluid case demonstrates superior predictive performance of the parametric Phi Method. Across both test cases, parametric and ensemble Phi Method reliably recover governing parametric PDEs and offer accurate predictions over test parameters. Ensemble ROM analysis underscores Phi Method's robust learning of dominant dynamic coefficients with high confidence.</description>

      <title>Application of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Tokamak Plasma Dynamics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quest for controlled thermonuclear fusion, tokamaks present complex challenges in understanding burning plasma dynamics. This study introduces a multi-region multi-timescale transport model, employing Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) to simulate the intricate energy transfer processes within tokamaks. Our methodology leverages Neural ODEs for the numerical derivation of diffusivity parameters from DIII-D tokamak experimental data, enabling the precise modeling of energy interactions between electrons and ions across various regions, including the core, edge, and scrape-off layer. These regions are conceptualized as distinct nodes, capturing the critical timescales of radiation and transport processes essential for efficient tokamak operation. Validation against DIII-D plasmas under various auxiliary heating conditions demonstrates the model's effectiveness, ultimately shedding light on ways to enhance tokamak performance with deep learning.</description>

      <title>Density jump for oblique collisionless shocks in pair plasmas: physical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are frequently analyzed using the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) formalism, even though MHD assumes a small mean free path. Yet, isotropy of pressure, fruit of binary collisions and assumed in MHD, may not apply in collisionless shocks. This is especially true within a magnetized plasma, where the field can stabilize an anisotropy.
  In a previous article \citep{BretJPP2022b}, a model was presented capable of dealing with the anisotropies that may arise at the front crossing. It was solved for any orientation of the field with respect to the shock front. Yet, for some values of the upstream parameters, several downstream solutions were found.
  Here, we complete the work started in \cite{BretJPP2022b} by showing how to pick the physical solution out of the ones offered by the algebra. This is achieved by 2 means: 1) selecting the solution that has the downstream field obliquity closest to the upstream one. This criterion is exemplified on the parallel case and backed up by Particle-in-Cell simulations. 2) Filtering out solutions which do not satisfy a criteria already invoked to trim multiple solutions in MHD: the evolutionarity criterion, that we assume valid in the collisionless case.
  The end result is a model in which a given upstream configuration results in a unique, or none (like in MHD), downstream configuration. The largest departure from MHD is found for the case of a parallel shock.</description>

      <title>Linear Theory of Visco-Resistive Tearing Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, a new linear theory of tearing instability is shown, where the modified LSC (Loureiro, Schekochihin, and Cowley) theory [36] developed from the original LSC theory [8] is extended from inviscid-resistive MHD to viscous-resistive MHD. In contrast to FKR [2] and original LSC theories, the upstream open boundary condition is implemented at a finite point $\xi_c$, which is an additional control parameter to determine the solutions. This paper firstly studies when the resistivity and viscosity are uniform in space. In addition, some variations in the nonuniformity are studied. It is shown that the non-uniformity can enhance the linear growth rate, rather than uniform case. Unexpectedly, this suggests that the forward cascade process of plasmoid instability (PI) does not stop, i.e., the finite differential MHD simulations fail. To stop the forward cascade, uniform viscosity is required not only in the inner region of the current sheet but also in the outer region. In the uniform case, the critical condition is predicted to be $2P_m/(S \xi_{c})=0.06$, beyond which the tearing instability, i.e., the forward cascade, stops. Here, $S$ is the Lundquist number, $P_m$ is the magnetic Prandtl number, and $\xi_{c}$ is the distance between the upstream open boundary and neutral sheet, where the current sheet thickness is fixed at $\xi_0=1.307$. According to the critical condition, the resistivity and viscosity employed in most MHD simulations of PI are too small to stop the forward cascade. This critical condition may be also applicable for the trigger problem of the current sheet destabilization in substorms and solar flares.</description>

      <title>Spectra of phosphorus ions for astrophysical modeling: P I - P XV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phosphorus (P), a basic element of life, has been a least studied element due to its poor presence in astrophysical spectra. However, search for the P lines has increased considerably with discoveries of exoplanets and are being detected by high resolution and sophisticated astronomical observatories, e.g. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). JWST may provide a clue for life with detection of P in its infrared (IR) region. Identification of the element and analysis of the observed spectra will require high accuracy data for atomic processes that produces lines and their predicted features. The present study focuses on these needs and reports systematically regions of wavelengths, from x-ray to IR, that show prominent lines by the 15 individual ionization stages of phosphorus, P I - P XV for the first time. We present large amount of relevant atomic data for energies, transition parameters, and lifetimes obtained in relativistic Breit-Pauli approximation using the R-matrix method and atomic structure program SUPERSTRUCTURE. Our spectral features for the fifteen ions, P I - P XV, predict strengths of lines in various wavelength regions. They show dominance of P~I and P~II in the infrared region and other ions in the ultraviolet and optical regions often stretching to IR in the continuum. For determination of accuracy, we have made extensive comparisons of our atomic data with available experimental and theoretical values. Based on these, our results and features are expected to provide precise plasma diagnostics and astrophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Modelling ion acceleration and transport in corotating interaction regions: the mass-to-charge ratio dependence of the particle spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of perpendicular diffusion in shaping energetic ion spectrum in corotating interaction regions (CIRs), focusing on its mass-to-charge ($A/Q$) dependence. We simulate a synthetic CIR using the EUropean Heliospheric FORcasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) and model the subsequent ion acceleration and transport by solving the focused transport equation incorporating both parallel and perpendicular diffusion. Our results reveal distinct differences in ion spectra between scenarios with and without perpendicular diffusion. In the absence of perpendicular diffusion, ion spectra near CIRs show a strong $(A/Q)^{\epsilon}$ dependence with $\epsilon$ depending on the turbulence spectral index, agreeing with theoretical predictions. In contrast, the incorporation of perpendicular diffusion, characterized by a weak $A/Q$ dependence, leading to similar spectra for different ion species. This qualitatively agrees with observations of energetic particles in CIRs.</description>

      <title>Ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations of warm dense two-component systems without fixed nodes: structural properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present extensive new \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for a variety of structural properties of warm dense hydrogen and beryllium. To deal with the fermion sign problem -- an exponential computational bottleneck due to the antisymmetry of the electronic thermal density matrix -- we employ the recently proposed [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{157}, 094112 (2022); \textbf{159}, 164113 (2023)] $\xi$-extrapolation method and find excellent agreement with exact direct PIMC reference data where available. This opens up the intriguing possibility to study a gamut of properties of light elements and potentially material mixtures over a substantial part of the warm dense matter regime, with direct relevance for astrophysics, material science, and inertial confinement fusion research.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional theory of superradiant free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The soliton-like superradiant regime of free-electron lasers (FEL) offers a promising path towards ultrashort pulses, beyond the natural limit dictated by the bandwidth of the high-gain FEL instability. In this work we present a three-dimensional theory of the superradiant regime. Our work takes advantage of recent developments in non-linear FEL theory to provide a fully analytical description of soliton-like superradiance. Our theory proves the existence of a diffraction-dominated steady-state regime in which the superradiant peak power grows indefinitely while leaving the pulse duration and on-axis intensity almost unchanged. These results are in excellent agreement with three-dimensional simulations and are supported by recent experimental results at the Linac Coherent Light Source. This work advances non-linear FEL theory and provides a theoretical framework for the next generation of attosecond x-ray FELs.</description>

      <title>Spectrotemporal shaping of attosecond x-ray pulses with a fresh-slice free-electron laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scheme for coherently shaping attosecond x-ray pulses at free-electron lasers. We show that by seeding an FEL with a short coherent seed that overfills the amplification bandwidth, one can shape the wigner function of the pulse by controlling the undulator taper profile. The examples of controllable coherent pulse pairs and trains, as well as isolated spectrotemporally shaped pulses with very broad coherent bandwidths are examined in detail. Existing attosecond XFELs can achieve these experimental conditions in a two-stage cascade, in which the coherent seed is generated by a short current spike in an electron bunch and shaped in an unspoiled region within the same bunch. We experimentally demonstrate the production of pulse pairs using this method at the Linac Coherent Light Source.</description>

Abstract: We present a formally exact and simulation-free approach for the normalization of X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) spectra based on the f-sum rule of the imaginary-time correlation function (ITCF). Our method works for any degree of collectivity, over a broad range of temperatures, and is applicable even in nonequilibrium situations. In addition to giving us model-free access to electronic correlations, this new approach opens up the intriguing possibility to extract a plethora of physical properties from the ITCF based on XRTS experiments.</description>

      <title>Dielectronic satellite emission from a solid-density Mg plasma: relationship to models of ionisation potential depression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on experiments where solid-density Mg plasmas are created by heating with the focused output of the Linac Coherent Light Source x-ray free-electron-laser. We study the K-shell emission from the Helium and Lithium-like ions using Bragg crystal spectroscopy. Observation of the dielectronic satellites in Lithium-like ions confirms that the M-shell electrons appear bound for these high charge states. An analysis of the intensity of these satellites indicates that when modelled with an atomic-kinetics code, the ionisation potential depression model employed needs to produce depressions for these ions which lie between those predicted by the well known Stewart-Pyatt and Ecker-Kroll models. These results are largely consistent with recent Density Functional Theory calculations.</description>
