      <title>High Negative Ion Gain MMThGEM-Micromegas Detector for Directional Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low pressure gaseous Negative Ion Time Projection Chambers (NITPCs) have been used previously by the DRIFT experiment to search for a directional Dark Matter (DM) signature. The main challenge with using a Negative Ion Drift (NID) gas target is the significantly lower gas gains to which they are typically limited. Recently, a MMThGEM device has been successfully demonstrated as an excellent gain stage device in the NID gas SF$_6$; capable of producing gas gains comparable with the electron drift gas CF$_4$. The next major challenge is to extend this high gain capability to multi-dimensional readout for the purpose of particle track reconstruction. The MMThGEM is therefore ideal for coupling to a strip readout detector like a Micromegas to achieve a high gain multi-dimensional Negative Ion (NI) readout plane, which is potentially suitable for the scale up required by future searches proposed by the CYGNUS consortium. In this paper, the first high gain demonstration of such a MMThGEM-Micromegas detector in low pressure SF$_6$ is described. This includes detector characterisation in a small test vessel resulting in the largest NI gas gain ever reported, 1.22 $\pm$ 0.08 $\times$ 10$^5$ , and directionality with alpha particles. Finally, this gain characterisation and tracking capability is leveraged to measure the energy and range of events, and identify those consistent with Nuclear Recoils (NRs), in a large cubic metre scale volume of SF$_6$ for the first time.</description>

      <title>Measurements of absolute gamma-ray energies using an ultra-high energy resolution magnetic microcalorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new measurements of 27 gamma ray energies ranging from 14 keV to 136 keV, obtained using high-energy-resolution magnetic microcalorimeters for energy-dispersive spectrometry. The spectrometer has eight pixels and achieves an energy resolution between 15 and 30 eV across the entire energy range. It faces a cryogenic source sampler with four movable sources. Each source contains a mixture of radionuclides, including Yb-169 and Co-57 used to calibrate the spectrometer and correct its non-linearity. The gamma-ray energies, emitted through the decay of Co-57, Cd-109, Ba-133, Gd-153, Eu-154, Eu-155, Yb-169, Tm-170, Pb-210, Np-239, Am-241 and Am-243, have been reassessed. The lowest absolute uncertainty achieved is 0.13 eV at 105.3 keV, which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of 1.3 ppm. Of the 27 measured gamma rays, the uncertainties of 19 energies were improved with respect to the available literature: 10 by a factor of 5 and 4 by more than one order of magnitude. Good agreement is observed with energies obtained elsewhere by wavelength-dispersive spectrometry. This work significantly improves upon previously reported gamma energies obtained by energy-dispersive spectrometry using semiconductor detectors, thanks to the ultra-high energy resolution of magnetic microcalorimeters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cherenkov imaging detectors will continue to play a central role for particle identification in future particle and nuclear physics experiments. Growing demands on momentum coverage, timing precision, radiation tolerance, and sustainability have driven extensive R&amp;D in detector concepts, radiator materials, and photon sensors. This article reviews recent efforts, focusing on experiments leading advances in sensor technology, radiator materials, and the exploitation of Cherenkov photon timing to push PID limits, while highlighting synergies across experiments in addressing common challenges.</description>

      <title>Simulation Study for Particle Identification with the dRICH of the ePIC Experiment at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dual-radiator Imaging Cherenkov detector (dRICH) is a key component of the forward particle identification system for the ePIC experiment at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This study evaluates the dRICH performance using Geant4 simulations in the context of the global ePIC simulation stack, focusing on the optimization of the aerogel radiator and the impact of sensor noise. We compare two aerogel configurations: the initial design (n=1.019) and the current default (n=1.026). The latter, characterized by improved optical properties and a higher refractive index, demonstrates enhanced $\pi-K$ separation at high momenta, effectively extending the operational overlap with the $\mathrm{C_2F_6}$ gas radiator. Additionally, the study investigates the impact of Silicon Photomultiplier (SiPM) dark noise, showing that a 300 kHz noise rate per channel leads to a moderate reduction (approximately 1.5 GeV/c) in the $3\sigma$ separation threshold. These results validate the current dRICH design and quantify the purity levels achievable for both radiators under expected experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlation on a single channel for resistance noise measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-correlation is an established tool to reduce the background in resistance noise measurements. However, the conventional method requires the amplifier, demodulator and digitizer channels to be duplicated, increasing the cost and complexity of the measurement circuit. We propose an alternating-current technique that allows cross-correlation with only a single channel by modulating the device under test with two carrier frequencies simultaneously. Using multiple software-based demodulators, we show that this method produces accurate amplitude measurements and noise spectra. The signal-to-noise-ratio is improved by 7 dB, and longer measurement durations increase this improvement.</description>

      <title>High-precision beam profile measurement with a microchannel-plate detector in the high magnetic field of the WISArD experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the development and characterization of a compact low-energy ion beam diagnostic for the WISArD (Weak Interaction Studies with $\mathrm{^{32}Ar}$ Decay) experiment at ISOLDE/CERN. The microchannel plate (MCP) detector, which is configured in a Z-stack and has a resistive position sensitive anode, was tested with both stable and radioactive beams. This work focuses on the image reconstruction method, which corrects the pincushion distortion inherent to the square-shaped resistive anode, and investigates the influence of the magnetic field on the detector performance. Our results demonstrate that the detector achieves beam profile measurements with sub-millimeter accuracy, while coping with the spatial and high-magnetic field (4 T) constraints of the experiment. These capabilities meet the precision requirements of the WISArD experiment for extracting the modified beta-neutrino angular correlation coefficient, \~a$_{\beta\nu}$, with an uncertainty of 0.1%.</description>

      <title>Maximum-Likelihood--Based Position Decoding of Laser Processed Converging Pixel CsI: Tl Detectors for High-Resolution SPECT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the feasibility of a novel fabrication technique for high spatial resolution CsI: Tl scintillation detectors tailored for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) systems. Building upon our previously developed laser induced optical barrier (LIOB) method, which achieved high spatial resolution, excellent sensitivity, and 100% fabrication yield in CsI: Tl detectors, we extend this approach to a converging-pixel architecture. A CsI: Tl crystal array with converging pixels was designed and fabricated, featuring entrance-face pixels of 1.6x1.6 mm2 and photodetector side pixels of 2x2 mm2. To localize gamma-ray interactions, both the center of gravity (CoG) algorithm and a maximum-likelihood (ML) based decoding method were implemented. A custom built four axis motion platform was developed to deliver a finely collimated pencil beam at precisely controlled positions and angles across the array, enabling generation of a comprehensive dataset for prior knowledge and validation. The results demonstrate an energy resolution of 11.79+/-0.53% (collimated experiment) and a position localization accuracy of 1.00+/-0.42 mm (nearest neighbor interpolation), confirming that the proposed converging-pixel architecture, combined with statistical decoding algorithms, provides a promising path toward the development of high-performance SPECT detectors.</description>

      <title>A Transformer-based Model for Rapid Microstructure Inference from Four-Dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Properties of crystalline materials are closely linked to microstructure arising from the spatial arrangement, orientation, and phase of nanocrystals. Rapid characterization of crystalline microstructure can accelerate the identification of these links and the development of materials with desired properties. Here, we combine a machine learning framework with four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM) to enable fast inference of crystalline microstructure over large fields of view. The framework employs a transformer-based architecture to predict crystallographic orientations and phases from 4D-STEM diffraction patterns, yielding spatially resolved maps of microstructural features at the nanoscale. With this framework, crystallographic orientations are inferred up to two orders of magnitude faster than widely used correlative template-matching approaches. This capability enables high-throughput characterization of complex crystalline materials and facilitates the establishment of structure-property relationships central to materials design and optimization.</description>

      <title>Design and Operation of Wafer-Scale Packages Containing &gt;500 Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packages capable of supporting large arrays of high-coherence superconducting qubits are vital for the realisation of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the necessary high-throughput metrology required to optimise fabrication and manufacturing processes. We present a wafer-scale packaging architecture supporting over 500 qubits on a single 3-inch die. The package is engineered to suppress parasitic RF modes, and to mitigate material loss through simulation-informed design while managing differential thermal contraction to ensure robust operation at millikelvin temperatures. System-level heat-load calculations from a large wiring payload show this package may be operated in commercial dilution refrigerators. Measurements of the qubits loaded into the package show median $T_1$, $T_{2e} \sim 100~\mu$s ($\sim$100 qubits) alongside readout with median fidelity of 97.5% (54 qubits) and a median qubit temperature of 36 mK (54 qubits). These results validate the performance of these packages and demonstrate that large-scale integration can be achieved without compromising device performance. Finally, we highlight the utility of these packages as a tool for high throughput feedback on qubit figures of merit over large sample sizes, allowing identification of performance outliers in the tails of the coherence distribution, a critical capability for informing fabrication and manufacture of high-quality quantum qubits and quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quantitative imaging of Abrikosov vortices by scanning quantum magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding vortex matter in type-II superconductors is central to controlling dissipation and flux pinning in superconducting materials and devices. Here, we use cryogenic scanning nitrogen vacancy magnetometry (NVM) to image Abrikosov vortices in the cuprate superconductors BSCCO-2212 and YBCO under controlled field-cooled conditions. Measurements, which are performed using continuous-wave optically detected magnetic resonance (cw-ODMR) in a closed-cycle cryostat, yield quantitative magnetic-field maps with nanoscale spatial resolution. In BSCCO-2212 at 71 K, we resolve a well-ordered triangular vortex lattice, whose symmetry and spacing are confirmed through 2D Fourier analysis and are consistent with flux quantization. YBCO thin films imaged at 3 K exhibit a more disordered vortex arrangement reflecting stronger pinning, while maintaining quantitative agreement between measured vortex density and the applied magnetic field. These results render our cryogenic scanning NVM a reliable quantitative tool for real-space studies of vortices in high-$T_c$ superconductors, in particular since such a remarkable magnetic resolution has been achieved within relatively short acquisition times of 2 to 4 h.</description>

      <title>Geant4 and FLUKA Simulations of a Cyclotron Based 30 MeV Proton-Beryllium Reaction: Benchmarking and Optimization of Neutron Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For studies where a reliable neutron source/beam is required and a nuclear reactor is not a viable option (considering their high neutron flux supply, which may not be suitable for research concerning low flux operations), alternative approaches may be sought. We present a comprehensive simulation analysis of 30 MeV proton induced ${}^9\mathrm{Be}\text{(p,n)}{}^9\mathrm{B}$ reaction, which can be utilized as an isotropic neutron source. This energy was chosen as it was the maximum allowed limit of protons supplied by IBA's Cyclone 30 XP proton cyclotron. Due to different underlying physics and transport mechanisms, when it comes to numerical calculations, slight variations in findings between different toolkits may occur. Hence it may require one to have a guide at hand to address the differences and interpret the data more accurately before conducting the actual experiment. In this work present the different numerical results of Geant4 and FLUKA. We conducted preliminary Monte Carlo runs to estimate the resulting neutron fluence and prompt gamma dose equivalents, while also assessing the degree of moderation achieved by different thicknesses of high density polyethylene. Furthermore, this work also presents an examplar modular irradiation station designed for target-moderator configurations, with the capability of generating thermal neutron fields.</description>

      <title>On the Measurability of True Coincidence Summing in the GRIFFIN Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of gamma-rays from decaying nuclei allow for the investigation into nuclear structure. True coincidence summing occurs when two gamma-rays from a single decay get detected in a single detector and their energies sum together to give false peaks in the energy spectrum. Corrections to this summing effect are crucial for an accurate determination of nuclear decay events. The summing correction formalism of Semkow et al. is generalized here into the \textit{Semkow matrix formalism} and is extended into a multiplicity expansion. This formalism is used to calculate the matrix probabilities for 180-degree coincidence events as a method for correcting coincidence summing; in doing so, the deviation between the full correction and this 180-degree correction is shown as a function of multiplicity. This formalism is extended to the \textit{partitioned matrix formalism}, to calculate probabilities for \textit{gated} gamma rays; where two gamma-rays of interest are taken in multi-detector coincidence. The summing correction probabilities for gated gamma-rays are provided and the deviation is shown in a manner similar to that of the singles. Terms such as measurability, event equivalence, and ontic and epistemic events are defined. It is shown that within these definitions, coincidence summing is not sufficiently measurable, or rather, its sufficient measurability is statistically bounded by the deviations derived.</description>

      <title>Reaching the intrinsic performance limits of superconducting strip photon detectors up to 0.1 mm wide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single-photon detection underpins a wide range of emerging photonic technologies, from quantum information processing and secure communications to photon-starved biomedical imaging. Among the available detector technologies, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) combine high detection efficiency, low noise, and excellent timing resolution, making them a leading platform for photon-counting applications. However, despite decades of materials and fabrication research, detector performance has never been shown to match theoretical performance expectations. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in situ tuning of a detector from its typical, suboptimal operation, to a regime limited only by material quality, allowing the device to reach its intrinsic performance limit. Our approach is based on current-biased superconducting "rails" placed on either side of the detector that redistribute current across its width to achieve its peak performance. This technique not only reduces the dark count rate by ten orders of magnitude, but also enables future detectors to overcome the Pearl limit for device width, paving the way for arbitrarily large detectors. We show operation at this intrinsic performance limit for devices up to 0.1 mm wide, and also demonstrate near-unity internal detection efficiency (IDE) at a wavelength of 4um for a 20um-wide detector--a factor of 20 wider than the current state of the art.</description>
