      <title>Unraveling the dynamical behaviors in a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiperiodic mosaic systems have attracted significant attention due to their unique spectral properties with exactly known mobility edges, which do not vanish even in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region, although the width of energy window of extended states becomes very narrow and decreases with the increase of strength of the quasiperiodic potential.In this work we study the dynamics of a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice and unravel its peculiar dynamical properties. By scrutinizing the expansion dynamics of wave packet and the evolution of density distribution, we unveil that the long-time density distribution display obviously different behaviors at odd and even sites in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region. Particularly, the time scale of dynamics exhibits an inverse relationship with the quasiperiodic potential strength. To understand these behaviors, we derive an effective Hamiltonian in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region, which is composed of decoupled Hamiltonians defined on the odd and even sites, respectively. While all eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian defined on even sites are localized, the eigenstates of effective Hamiltonian defined on odd sites include both localized and extended eigenstates. Our results demonstrate that the effective Hamiltonian can describe the dynamical behaviors well in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region and provides an intuitive framework for understanding the peculiar dynamical behaviors in the quasiperiodic mosaic lattice.</description>

      <title>Disordered Parity Anomalous Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The parity anomalous semimetal is a topological state of matter characterized by its semi-metallic nature and a quantum Hall conductance of one-half $e^{2}/h$ ($e$ is the elementary charge and $h$ is the Planck constant). Here we investigate the topological phase transition driven by disorder in a semi-magnetic structure of topological insulator, and narrow-gap weak topological insulator film. We demonstrate that strong disorder not only leads to a topological transition from the parity anomalous semimetal to a diffusive metal with non-quantized anomalous Hall conductance, but also induces the topological phase in a trivial insulating phase. Our calculations of the local density of states provide clear picture for the formation of a single gapless Dirac fermion, which emerges as the disorder strength increases. The half quantized Hall effect is attributed to the existence of the gapless Dirac cone. Our findings of disorder-induced parity anomalous semimetal and diffusive metal significantly advance our understanding of the disorder-driven topological phase transition in magnetic topological insulators, opening up new avenues for further exploration in the field of quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Effects of Disorder on Current Fluctuations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how the disorder impacts the current fluctuations in the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) within a heterogeneous environment. First, we analyze the SSEP with a defect site under the periodic boundary conditions. We derive the exact expression for the second moment of the current and observe deviations from that of the homogeneous system. Notably, the second moment of the current shows asymmetric density dependence around a density of 1/2 and surpassing that of the homogeneous system in the low-density region. Furthermore, based on the finding from the SSEP with a defect site, we present an approximate derivation of the second moment of the current in the SSEP on a quenched random energy landscape using a partial-mean-field approach. The second moment of the current is heavily influenced by the energy landscape, revealing unique effects arising from the interplay between the heterogeneous environment and the many-body system. Our findings provide valuable insights that can be applied to control current fluctuations in systems involving the interactions of many particles, such as biological transport.</description>

      <title>A short introduction to Neural Networks and their application to Earth and Materials Science Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks are gaining widespread relevance for their versatility, holding the promise to yield a significant methodological shift in different domain of applied research. Here, we provide a simple pedagogical account of the basic functioning of a feedforward neural network. Then we move forward to reviewing two recent applications of machine learning to Earth and Materials Science. We will in particular begin by discussing a neural network based geothermobarometer, which returns reliable predictions of the pressure/temperature conditions of magma storage. Further, we will turn to illustrate how machine learning tools, tested on the list of minerals from the International Mineralogical Association, can help in the search for novel superconducting materials.</description>

      <title>Nonequilbrium physics of generative diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models apply the concept of Langevin dynamics in physics to machine leaning, attracting a lot of interests from engineering, statistics and physics, but a complete picture about inherent mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of diffusion models, formulating the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, equilibrium measure, and Franz-Parisi potential to understand the dynamic process and intrinsic phase transitions. Our analysis is rooted in a path integral representation of both forward and backward dynamics, and in treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder akin to that in spin glass theory. Our study thus links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference and geometry based analysis together to yield a coherent picture about how the generative diffusion models work.</description>

      <title>Fundamental computational limits of weak learnability in high-dimensional multi-index models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-index models - functions which only depend on the covariates through a non-linear transformation of their projection on a subspace - are a useful benchmark for investigating feature learning with neural networks. This paper examines the theoretical boundaries of efficient learnability in this hypothesis class, focusing particularly on the minimum sample complexity required for weakly recovering their low-dimensional structure with first-order iterative algorithms, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples is $n=\alpha d$ is proportional to the covariate dimension $d$. Our findings unfold in three parts: (i) first, we identify under which conditions a trivial subspace can be learned with a single step of a first-order algorithm for any $\alpha\!&gt;\!0$; (ii) second, in the case where the trivial subspace is empty, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an easy subspace consisting of directions that can be learned only above a certain sample complexity $\alpha\!&gt;\!\alpha_c$. The critical threshold $\alpha_{c}$ marks the presence of a computational phase transition, in the sense that it is conjectured that no efficient iterative algorithm can succeed for $\alpha\!&lt;\!\alpha_c$. In a limited but interesting set of really hard directions - akin to the parity problem - $\alpha_c$ is found to diverge. Finally, (iii) we demonstrate that interactions between different directions can result in an intricate hierarchical learning phenomenon, where some directions can be learned sequentially when coupled to easier ones. Our analytical approach is built on the optimality of approximate message-passing algorithms among first-order iterative methods, delineating the fundamental learnability limit across a broad spectrum of algorithms, including neural networks trained with gradient descent.</description>
