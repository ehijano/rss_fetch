      <title>Mazur-Tate elements of non-ordinary modular forms with Serre weight larger than two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix an odd prime $p$ and let $f$ be a non-ordinary eigen-cuspform of weight $k$ and level coprime to $p$. Assuming $p&gt;k-1$, we compute asymptotic formulas for the Iwasawa invariants of the Mazur-Tate elements attached to $f$ in terms of the corresponding invariants of the signed $p$-adic $L$-functions. By combining this with a version of mod $p$ multiplicity one, we also obtain descriptions of the $\lambda$-invariants of Mazur-Tate elements attached to certain higher weight modular forms with Serre weight $&lt;p+1$, generalizing results of Pollack and Weston in the Serre weight 2 case.</description>

      <title>Lifting $L$-polynomials of genus 2 curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a genus $2$ curve over $\mathbb{Q}$. Harvey and Sutherland's implementation of Harvey's average polynomial-time algorithm computes the $\bmod \ p$ reduction of the numerator of the zeta function of $C$ at all good primes $p\leq B$ in $O(B\log^{3+o(1)}B)$ time, which is $O(\log^{4+o(1)} p)$ time on average per prime. Alternatively, their algorithm can do this for a single good prime $p$ in $O(p^{1/2}\log^{1+o(1)}p)$ time. While Harvey's algorithm can also be used to compute the full zeta function, no practical implementation of this step currently exists.
  In this article, we present an $O(\log^{2+o(1)}p)$ Las Vegas algorithm that takes the $\bmod \ p$ output of Harvey and Sutherland's implementation and outputs the full zeta function. We then benchmark our results against the fastest algorithms currently available for computing the full zeta function of a genus~$2$ curve, finding substantial speedups in both the average polynomial-time and single prime settings.</description>

      <title>Dyadically resolving trinomials for fast modular arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residue number systems based on pairwise relatively prime moduli are a powerful tool for accelerating integer computations via the Chinese Remainder Theorem. We study a structured family of moduli of the form $2^n - 2^k + 1$, originally proposed for their efficient arithmetic and bit-level properties. These trinomial moduli support fast modular operations and exhibit scalable modular inverses.
  We investigate the problem of constructing large sets of pairwise relatively prime trinomial moduli of fixed bit length. By analyzing the corresponding trinomials $x^n - x^k + 1$, we establish a sufficient condition for coprimality based on polynomial resultants. This leads to a graph-theoretic model where maximal sets correspond to cliques in a compatibility graph, and we use maximum clique-finding algorithms to construct large examples in practice. Using the theory of graph colorings, resultants, and properties of cyclotomic polynomials, we also prove upper bounds on the size of such sets as a function of $n$.</description>

      <title>On a remark of Serre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a remark of Serre, we extend the search for primes $p$ such that the maximum Hasse bound for the number of points on an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{F}_{p^5}$ is not achieved. We then give a list of all $q&lt;10^{70}$ such that the Hasse bound is not achieved over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. We explore the heuristics for how many such numbers should exist in each case. Finally, look at similar criteria for genus $2$ and $3$ curves.</description>

      <title>Local structure of classical sequences, regular sequences, and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notions of local realizability at a prime and algebraic realizability of an integer sequence. After discussing this notion in general we consider it for the Euler numbers, the Bernoulli denominators, and the Bernoulli numerators. This gives, for example, a dynamical characterization of the Bernoulli regular primes. Algebraic realizability of the Bernoulli denominators is shown at every prime, giving a different perspective on the great diversity of congruences satisfied by this sequence. We show that the sequence of Euler numbers cannot be realized on a nilpotent group, which may explain why it is less hospitable to congruence hunting.</description>

Abstract: For Shimura varieties of Hodge type, we show that there are natural isomorphisms between locally analytic complete cohomology groups and cohomology groups for flag varieties with coefficient which is given by their perfectoid covers. This result is a generalization of that of Pan for the modular curve and Qiu-Su for unitary Shimura curves.</description>

      <title>Short mollifiers of the Riemann zeta-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the calculus of variations to construct a new sequence of linear combinations of derivatives of the Riemann $\zeta$-function adapted to Levinson's method, which yield a positive proportion of zeros of the $\zeta$-function on the critical line, regardless of how short the mollifier is. Our construction extends readily to modular $L$-functions. Even with Levinson's original choice of mollifier, our method more than doubles the proportions of zeros on the critical line for modular $L$-functions previously obtained by Bernard and K\"uhn--Robles--Zeindler, while relying on the same arithmetic inputs. This indicates that optimizing the linear combinations, an approach that has received relatively little attention, has a more pronounced effect than refining the mollifier when it is short. Curiously, our linear combinations provide non-trivial smooth approximations of Siegel's $\mathfrak{f}$-function in the celebrated Riemann--Siegel formula.</description>

      <title>Number Fields With Large P\'olya Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The P\'olya group ${\rm Po}(K)$ of a number field $K$ is the subgroup of the ideal class group ${\rm Cl}(K)$ of $K$ generated by the classes of all the products of the prime ideals of $K$ with the same norm. Motivated by the classical "one class in each genus problem", we prove general finiteness theorems for the number fields $K$ with a fixed P\'olya index $\left[{\rm Cl}(K):{\rm Po}(K)\right]$ in the families of Galois number fields, solvable CM-fields, and real quadratic fields of extended R-D type. We also give classification results for specific families. Most notably, we classify, unconditionally, all imaginary bi-quadratic and imaginary tri-quadratic fields with the P\'olya index one. Furthermore, we classify all real quadratic fields of extended R-D type (with possibly only one more field) with the P\'olya index one. Also, under GRH, we give the complete list of 161 imaginary quadratic fields with the P\'olya index two. Finally, as a byproduct of our results, we extend, from narrow R-D types to the extended R-D types, Dohmae's classification of real quadratic fields of narrow R-D type whose narrow genus numbers equal their narrow class numbers.</description>

      <title>Positive density of primes of ordinary reduction for abelian varieties of simple signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a result of Serre, if $A$ is an elliptic curve without CM defined over a number field $L$, then the set of primes of $L$ for which $A$ has ordinary reduction has density $1$. Katz and Ogus proved the same is true when $A$ is an abelian surface, after possibly passing to a finite extension of $L$. More recently, Sawin computed the density of the set of primes of $L$ for which an abelian surface $A$ has ordinary reduction, depending on the endomorphism algebra of $A$. In this paper, we prove some generalizations of these results when $A$ is an absolutely simple abelian variety of arbitrary dimension whose endomorphism algebra is a CM field $F$, under specific conditions on the signature of the multiplication action of $F$ on $A$. We include explicit examples from Jacobians of curves of genus three through seven admitting cyclic covers to the projective line.</description>

      <title>Character sums to prime power moduli evaluated at binary quadratic forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish estimates for short character sums to prime power moduli evaluated at binary quadratic forms. This complements estimates established by Heath-Brown for such character sums to squarefree moduli. To this end, we use tools from the $p$-adic theory of exponential sums, as initiated by Mili\'cevi\'c.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(q_{\alpha, n})_{n \geq 0}$ be the sequence of convergent denominators to the simple continued fraction expansion of $\alpha$. For certain specific choices of $\alpha$, this sequence is a Lehmer sequence. In this paper, we show that there are only finitely many integers $c$ such that the equation $q_{\alpha, n} - q_{\beta, m} = c$ has at least two distinct solutions $(n,m)$, where $\alpha,\beta$ are quadratic irrationals with $\mathbb{Q}(\alpha)\neq \mathbb{Q}(\beta)$. In specific instances, we solve the equation $q_{\alpha, n} - q_{\beta, m} = c$ completely and explicitly list all solutions.</description>

      <title>Banach modules, almost mathematics and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between almost mathematics, condensed mathematics and the categories of seminormed and Banach modules over a Banach ring $A$, with submetric (norm-decreasing) $A$-module homomorphisms for morphisms. If $A$ is a Banach ring with a norm-multiplicative topologically nilpotent unit $\varpi$ contained in the closed unit ball $A_{\leq1}$ such that $\varpi$ admits a compatible system of $p$-power roots $\varpi^{1/p^{n}}$ with \begin{equation*}\lVert\varpi^{1/p^{n}}\rVert=\lVert\varpi\rVert^{1/p^{n}}\end{equation*}for all $n$, we prove that the "almost closed unit ball" functor \begin{equation*}M\mapsto M_{\leq1}^{a}\end{equation*}is an equivalence between the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps and the category of $\varpi$-adically complete, $\varpi$-torsion-free almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules. We also obtain an analogous result for Banach algebras and almost algebras. The main novelty in our approach is that we show that the norm on the Banach module $M$ is completely determined by the corresponding almost $A_{\leq1}$-module $M_{\leq1}^{a}$, rather than being determined only up to equivalence.
  We deduce from our results the existence of a natural fully faithful embedding of the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps into the category of (static) condensed almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules in the sense of Mann, which factors through the full subcategory of solid condensed $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-almost modules. If $A$ is perfectoid and the adic spectrum of $(A, A^{\circ})$ is totally disconnected, we show that this embedding transforms the complete tensor product of Banach $A$-modules into (an almost analog of) the solid tensor product of solid condensed almost modules.</description>

      <title>Alpay Folded Prime Enumerator via gcd and Floors: Exact Enumeration, Record-Lift, and Non-Synonymy/Minimality Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single closed expression $f_{\text{Alpay},U}(x)$ is presented which, for every integer $x\ge 0$, returns the $(x+1)$-th prime $p_{x+1}$. The construction uses only integer arithmetic, greatest common divisors, and floor functions. A prime indicator $I(j)$ is encoded through a short $\gcd$-sum; a cumulative counter $S(i)=\sum_{j\le i}I(j)$ equals $\pi(i)$; and a folded step $A(i,x)$ counts precisely up to the next prime index without piecewise branching. A corollary shows that for any fixed integer $L\ge 2$, the integer $P^\star=f_{\text{Alpay},U}(L)$ is prime and $P^\star&gt;L$. Two explicit schedules $U(x)$ are given: a square schedule $U_{\text{sq}}(x)=(x+1)^2$ and a near-linear schedule $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}(x)=\Theta(x\log x)$ justified by explicit bounds on $p_n$. We include non-synonymy certificates relative to Willans-type enumerators (schedule and operator-signature separation) and prove an asymptotic minimality bound: any forward-count enumerator requires $U(x)=\Omega(x\log x)$ while $U_{\text{Alpay-lin}}$ achieves $O(x\log x)$. We also provide explicit operation counts (''form complexity'') of the folded expression.</description>

      <title>Inscription, twistors, and $p$-adic periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a $p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve. These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting. We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of ``differential topology for diamonds."</description>

Abstract: We give a simple geometric characterization of the locus where the inscribed Banach--Colmez Tangent Spaces of moduli of mixed characteristic local shtukas with one leg and fixed determinant are connected. We conjecture that the structure morphism for the underlying diamond is cohomologically smooth over this locus and, applying the Fargues--Scholze Jacobian criterion, we prove this conjecture in the case of EL infinite level Rapoport--Zink spaces, generalizing a result of Ivanov--Weinstein in the basic case.</description>

      <title>Bounds for canonical Green's functions at cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.04452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a cofinite Fuchsian subgroup. The canonical Green's function associated with $\Gamma$ arises in Arakelov theory when establishing asymptotics for Arakelov invariants of the modular curve associated with some congruence subgroup of level $N$ with a positive integer $N$. More precisely, in the known cases, canonical Green's functions at certain cusps contribute to the analytic part of the asymptotics for the self-intersection of the relative dualizing sheaf. In this article, we prove canonical Green's function of a cofinite Fuchsian subgroup at cusps bounded by the scattering constants, the Kronecker limit functions, and the Selberg zeta function of the group $\Gamma$. Then as an application, we prove an asymptotic expression of the canonical Green's function associated with $\Gamma_0(N)$, for any positive integer $N$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous supersingular reductions of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a point $x_0$ in a Shimura variety attached to a Shimura datum of Hodge type $(G,X)$, we have an associated abelian scheme $A_0$. Fixing a non-empty finite set $\mathcal{S}$ of primes, we consider the simultaneous supersingular reduction modulo $\ell\in\mathcal{S}$ of (several copies of) $p$-adic Hecke orbits of $A_0$. We give a precise description of the image of this map. As an application, we give a more conceptual proof of Mazur's conjecture on non-torsionness of higher Heegner points on an abelian variety which is a quotient of the Jacobian of a Shimura curve. Our arguments simplify those of C.Cornut and V.Vatsal in two important aspects: (1) we do not need to assume the $p$-adic group $G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)/Z_{G^1(\mathbb{Q}_p)}$ to be simple; (2) we do not need to consider separately the ``geometric" part and ``chaotic" part in the Hecke orbits.</description>

      <title>Mod $\ell$ gamma factors and a converse theorem for finite general linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local converse theorem for Rankin-Selberg gamma factors of $\mathrm{GL}_2(\mathbb{F}_q)$ proved by Piatetski-Shapiro over $\mathbb{C}$ no longer holds after reduction modulo $\ell \neq p$. To remedy this, we construct new $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_m$ gamma factors valued in arbitrary $\mathbb{Z}[1/p, \zeta_p]$-algebras for Whittaker-type representations, show that they satisfy a functional equation, and then prove a $\mathrm{GL}_n \times \mathrm{GL}_{n-1}$ converse theorem for irreducible cuspidal representations. In the $\mathrm{GL}_2 \times \mathrm{GL}_1$ case, we define an alternative "new" gamma factor, which takes values in $k$ and satisfies a converse theorem that matches the converse theorem in characteristic $0$.</description>

      <title>The u-invariant of function fields in one variable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The u-invariant of a field is the largest dimension of an anisotropic quadratic torsion form over the field. In this article we obtain a bound on the u-invariant of function fields in one variable over a henselian valued field with arbitrary value group and with residue field of characteristic different from 2. This generalises a theorem due to Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen and its extension due to Scheiderer. Their result covers the special case where the valuation is discrete.
  We further give a new proof of a theorem due to Parimala and Suresh bounding by 8 the u-invariant of a function field in one variable over any henselian discretely valued field of characteristic 0 with perfect residue field of characteristic 2.</description>

      <title>On Root Capacity, Intersection Indicium, Minimal Generating Sets of Galois Closure &amp; Compositum Feasible Triplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry forward the work started by the author and Bhagwat in [2] and develop the Theory of root clusters further in this article and also apply similar methods to resolve certain problems in related areas. We establish the Inverse root capacity problem for number fields which is a generalization of Inverse cluster size problem for number fields proved in [2]. We introduce the concept of intersection indicium as a generalization of the concept of ascending index introduced in [2] and prove some of its properties. We then establish the Inverse intersection indicium problem for number fields (excluding certain cases) which is a generalization of Inverse ascending index problem for number fields proved in [2]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [10] and generalize a result in [10] for number fields and also establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We generalize a result in [6] by establishing that a certain family of triplets is compositum feasible over any number field and we also list all the irreducible triplets in this family. We also prove a partial case of a conjecture in [6]. In the concluding section of this article, we improve on the inverse problems proved in [2] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</description>

      <title>Generalised height pairings and the Albanese kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method in depth two describes the rational points on a curve in terms of a generalisation of Nekov\'a\v{r}'s $p$-adic height pairing which replaces $\mathbb{G}_m$ with a higher Chow group. It is unclear both what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it. This paper explores the relevance of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this problem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the Albanese kernel of $X\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm to compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the Jacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of the nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.</description>

      <title>Exact values and improved bounds on the clique number of cyclotomic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13213v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd power of a prime $p$, and $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ such that $S=-S$ and $S/S \neq \mathbb{F}_q^*$. We show that the clique number of the Cayley graph $\operatorname{Cay}(\mathbb{F}_q^+,S)$ is at most $\sqrt{|S/S|}+\sqrt{q/p}$, improving the best-known $\sqrt{q}$ upper bound for many families of such graphs substantially. Such a new bound is strongest for cyclotomic graphs and in particular, it implies the first nontrivial upper bound on the clique number of all generalized Paley graphs of non-square order, extending the work of Hanson and Pertidis. Moreover, our new bound is asymptotically sharp for an infinite family of generalized Paley graphs, and we further discover the first nontrivial family among them for which the clique number can be exactly determined. We also obtain a new lower bound on the number of directions determined by a large Cartesian product in the affine Galois plane $AG(2,q)$, which is sharp for infinite families.</description>

      <title>$c_\text{eff}$ from Surgery and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $\widehat{Z}$ invariants, rigorously defined for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds, are expected--on physical grounds--to exist for every closed, oriented 3-manifold. Several prescriptions have been proposed to extend their definition to generic plumbings by reversing the orientation of a negative definite plumbing, thus turning it into a positive definite one. Two existing proposals are relevant for this paper: (i) the regularized $+1/r$-surgery conjecture combined with the false-mock modular conjecture, and (ii) a construction based on resurgence and a false theta function duality. In this note, we compare these proposals on the class of Brieskorn homology spheres $\Sigma\left(s,t,rst\pm1\right)$ and find that they are incompatible in general. Our diagnostic is the effective central charge, $c_{\text{eff}}$, which governs the asymptotic growth of coefficients of $\widehat{Z}$. First, we prove that the upper bound on $c_{\text{eff}}$ from prescription (i) is governed by the Ramanujan theta function, which regularizes the surgery formula. Second, we develop numerical and modular tools that deliver the lower bounds as well as exact values via mixed mock-modular analysis. Complementing this, we also study $c_{\text{eff}}$ for negative definite plumbed 3-manifolds which allow for a better comparison of pairs of 3-manifolds related by orientation reversal. As a result, we find that for some Brieskorn spheres the surgery and false-mock prescriptions violate the expected relation between $c_{\text{eff}}$, Chern-Simons invariants and non-abelian flat connections. These findings underscore $\widehat{Z}$ as a sensitive probe of the "positive side" of $\widehat{Z}$-theory.</description>
