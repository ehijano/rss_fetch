      <title>On decoding the string from interfaces in 2d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General solutions of a gravitational junction between two copies of a three-dimensional Einstein manifold $\mathcal{M}$ correspond to the solutions of the non-linear Nambu-Goto equation for a string in $\mathcal{M}$. We show that, for the junctions in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetimes constituted by tensile strings, which are dual to interfaces between thermal states in conformal field theories, the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation describing the junction correspond to state-dependent wave-packets, which are perfectly reflected at the interface to future null infinity without shape distortion when incident from past null infinity. These wavepackets are realized by state-dependent half-sided conformal transformations and affect the expectation value of the displacement operator. We further show that the entanglement entropy of an interval straddling the interface deciphers the stringy modes of the dual junction even in the tensionless limit. We also demonstrate that the strong sub-additivity of entanglement entropy is satisfied and is saturated for symmetric intervals generally.</description>

      <title>Classical Spin Transitions and Absorptive Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an on-shell, amplitudes-based approach to incorporating radiation absorption effects in the post-Minkowskian scattering of generic, compact, spinning bodies. Classical spinning observables are recovered by extrapolating to large spin, results calculated with finite quantum spin-$s$ particles using the properties of spin universality and Casimir interpolation. At leading-order our results give a completely general and non-redundant parametrization of absorptive observables in terms of a finite number of Wilson coefficients associated with 3-particle mass and spin-magnitude changing on-shell amplitudes. We denote these semi-fictitious microscopic processes: \textit{classical spin transitions}. Explicit results for the leading-order impulse due to the absorption of scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational radiation, for spin transitions $\Delta s = 0,\pm 1, \pm 2$ are given in a fully interpolated form up to $\mathcal{O}\left(S^2\right)$, and Casimir independent contributions given up to $\mathcal{O}\left(S^4\right)$. Our explicit results reveal some surprising universal patterns. We find that, up to identification of Wilson coefficients, the Casimir independent contributions to the impulse for spinning-up and spinning-down by the same magnitude $|\Delta s|$ are identical. For processes where the quantum $\Delta s&lt;0$ transition is forbidden, the corresponding classical observable is suppressed in powers of $S$ by a predictable amount. Additionally we find that, while for generic non-aligned spin configurations there is a non-zero scattering angle at leading-order, for aligned spin, similar to non-spinning absorption, the scattering angle vanishes and the impulse is purely longitudinal.</description>

      <title>Fibre Inflation Meets Quintessence: Implications of Perturbative Stabilisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we have discovered a new avenue of fibre inflation in perturbative large volume scenario (pLVS) due to the redefinition of the base modulus. pLVS offers a novel regime where large volume of the internal space is guaranteed without the need of non-perturbative effects. In this setup, we study the possibility where a base redefinition allows to assess different versions of fibre inflation whose spectral index aligns with Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data \cite{ACT:2025fju, ACT:2025tim} and produces tensor-to-scalar ratio in the range $0.008\lesssim r\lesssim 0.01$ in different setups we have considered. The leading order flat direction - which in our case is the fibre modulus - is lifted with the combinations of string loop corrections, leading order $\alpha^{\prime 3}$$R^4$-correction, higher derivative $F^{4}$ corrections as well as our new ingredient redefinition of the modulus. Since recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) results appear to favour a dynamical explanation for late-time acceleration over a simple cosmological constant, exploring quintessence offers a more suitable approach. In this lore, we also examine the quintessence sector to complete our model and account for both early- and late-time cosmic acceleration. In this framework, the poly-instanton correction generates a potential along the axionic directions, and we find that the resulting quintessence behaviour and the subsequent cosmological predictions about dark matter closely resemble the predictions of the original fibre inflation scenario studied earlier.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric $\mathbb{WCP}^n$, AdS near horizons and orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and study the supersymmetry properties of the weighted projective spaces $\mathbb{WCP}^2$ and $\mathbb{WCP}^3$. These are topologically $\mathbb{CP}^n$ with $n+1$ orbifold singularities and as such are higher dimensional analogues of the ``spindle'' or $\mathbb{WCP}^1$. We use these to construct interesting supersymmetric orbifolds of canonical near horizon geometries of relevance to the AdS/CFT correspondence. Interestingly, for certain tunings of their integer weights, and unlike the spindle, round $\mathbb{WCP}^{2}$ and $\mathbb{WCP}^{3}$ are compatible with supersymmetry beyond the realm of gauged supergravity. This allows one to construct interesting supersymmetric solutions in type II supergravity such as AdS$_5\times\mathbb{WCP}^{2}\times\text{S}^1$ and AdS$_4\times \mathbb{WCP}^3$ via duality. We also leverage our results to construct a supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solution containing a topological $\mathbb{T}^{(1,1)}$ space with 4 orbifold singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the gauge-theoretic approach of gravity, the gauging of an enlarged symmetry of the tangent space in four dimensions allows gravity to be unified with internal interactions. We study the unification of the Conformal and Noncommutative (Fuzzy) Gravities with Internal Interactions based on the $SO(10)$ GUT.</description>

      <title>Geometric R\'enyi mutual information induced by localized particle excitations in quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum field theory exhibits rich spatial correlation structures even in the vacuum, where entanglement entropy between regions scales with the area of their shared boundary. While this vacuum structure has been extensively studied, far less is understood about how localized particle excitations influence correlations between field values in different spatial regions. In this work, we use the Schr\"odinger representation to study the R\'enyi mutual information between complementary spatial regions for a localized single-particle excitation of a free massless scalar field in $(d+1)$ dimensions. We find that the mutual information in this excited state includes both a vacuum term and an excitation-induced contribution. To obtain quantitative results, we specialize to $1+1$ dimensions and evaluate the R\'enyi-2 mutual information between the negative and positive halves of the real line.
  We find that the excitation generates finite, positive correlations that are maximized when the wave packet sits at the boundary and decrease with its distance from it, at a rate determined by the wave packet's width. Our findings offer a step towards understanding quantum correlations in multiparticle systems from a field-theoretical point of view.</description>

      <title>Fermionisation of the Aharonov--Bohm Phase on the Lightfront</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19756v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the phase space of the Maxwell field as a simplified framework to study the quantisation of holonomies (Wilson line operators) on lightlike (null) surfaces. Our results are markedly different from the spacelike case. On a spacelike surface, electric and magnetic fluxes each form a commuting subalgebra. This implies that the holonomies commute. On a lightlike hypersurfaces, this is no longer true. Electric and magnetic fluxes are no longer independent. To compute the Poisson brackets explicitly, we choose a regularisation. Each path is smeared into a thin ribbon. In the resulting holonomy algebra, Wilson lines commute unless they intersect the same light ray. We compute the structure constants of the holonomy algebra and show that they depend on the geometry of the intersection and the conformal class of the metric at the null surface. Finally, we propose a quantisation. The resulting Hilbert space shows a number of unexpected features. First, the holonomies become anti-commuting Grassmann numbers. Second, for pairs of Wilson lines, the commutation relations can continuously interpolate between fermionic and bosonic relations. Third, there is no unique ground state. The ground state depends on a choice of framing of the underlying paths.</description>

      <title>The Categorical 't Hooft Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review categorical aspects of 't Hooft's large $N$ expansion, which is expected to map any Quantum Field Theory of large matrices to a string theory. Our goal is to describe a general strategy to derive the string theory dual to given QFT, at least at the leading order in the 't Hooft expansion. The basic idea is to characterize the underlying worldsheet theory of the dual string theory as an extended two-dimensional differential graded Topological Field Theory (dg-TFT), i.e. present an $A_\infty$-category of boundary conditions ("D-branes"). A basic aspect of the 't Hooft expansion is that D-branes arise from the addition of vector-valued degrees of freedom to the QFT. We propose that formal deformations of such "fundamental modifications" must match the formal deformations of the dual D-branes, which in turn capture the $A_\infty$-category structure and thus the worldsheet dg-TFT. We discuss several systems for which a rigorous analysis along these lines is or should be possible.</description>

      <title>Yangian symmetry escapes from the Fishnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Yangian symmetry for the equations of motion and the action of the classical bi-scalar and supersymmetric fishnet models in four spacetime dimensions, and we subsequently discuss its applicability to planar correlation functions. We argue that Yangian symmetry is classically realised in these models subject to specific evaluation parameter patterns. Curiously, Yangian invariance does not extend to generic quantum correlation functions in the bi-scalar model beyond the well-established classes of Yangian invariant correlators. We present several concrete counter-examples of bi-scalar correlators given by sums of Feynman graphs and of bi-scalar graphs with octagon-shaped loops. This finding underlines the notion that a non-zero dual Coxeter number represents an obstacle towards quantum Yangian symmetry and possibly also for complete integrability in planar QFT models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Landau Paradigm for quantum phases and phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Landau paradigm is a central dogma for understanding phase and phase transitions in condensed matter systems, yet for decades it has been known that a variety of quantum phases exist beyond the framework. Is there a more general framework that provides a systematic understanding of phase and phase transitions in quantum many-body systems? Recent developments of the notion of generalized symmetry and generalized gauging seem to point to a way to generalize the Landau Paradigm. In this essay, we discuss how `beyond Landau' phases and phase transitions can be captured by a generalized Landau paradigm in terms of the breaking of generalized symmetries, often induced by the generalized gauging procedure facilitated through the topological holography formalism. We also discuss what needs to be understood to make the generalized Landau paradigm useful in the study of quantum phase and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of the Russo-Townsend formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the recent construction by Russo and Townsend, we propose a new approach to generate $\mathsf{U}(1)$ duality-invariant models for nonlinear electrodynamics. It is based on the use of two building blocks: (i) a fixed (but otherwise arbitrary) model for self-dual nonlinear electrodynamics with Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ depending on a duality-invariant parameter $g$; and (ii) an arbitrary potential $W(\psi)$, with $\psi$ an auxiliary scalar field. It turns out that the model $\mathfrak{L}(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) = L(F_{\mu\nu};\psi) + W(\psi)$ leads to a self-dual theory for nonlinear electrodynamics upon elimination of $\psi$. As an illustration, we work out an example in which the seed Lagrangian $L(F_{\mu\nu};g)$ corresponds to the Born-Infeld model and a particular potential $W(\psi)$ is chosen such that integrating $\psi$ out gives the ModMaxBorn theory. We also briefly discuss a supersymmetric generalisation of the proposed formulation.</description>

      <title>Mass Dependence of the Araki-Uhlmann Relative Entropy Across Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mass dependence of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy between a localized coherent excitation and the vacuum state of a free scalar quantum field on the $(1+d)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime for $d = 1, 2, 3$. In this context, the relative entropy admits a closed expression in terms of the smeared Pauli-Jordan distribution, whose analytic structure is sensitive to both the mass and the spacetime dimensionality. Prior studies in $(1+1)$ dimensions have shown a monotonic decay of the relative entropy with increasing mass. We extend that analysis to higher dimensions using numerical techniques and elucidate how the interplay between dimensionality and mass controls the behavior of the relative entropy. Our results provide new insights for the study of the Araki-Uhlmann relative entropy in QFT and its dependence on physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asymptotic analysis for the metric of a generic solution of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS theory is provided by solving the field equations in the Fefferman-Graham frame. Using standard holographic renormalization, the counterterms that render the action finite are found up to seven spacetime dimensions. In the case of 6D, an equivalent formulation that permits a fully covariant determination of the counterterms is introduced, based on the finiteness of conformal invariants. It is shown that both schemes end up in the same holographic stress-energy tensor. Physical properties of six-dimensional topological Boulware-Deser black holes in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-AdS$_6$ gravity, whose boundary has nontrivial conformal features, are worked out in detail. Employing both renormalization prescriptions, finite asymptotic charges are found, and the correct black hole thermodynamics is recovered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the couplings of Ramond-Ramond four-form axions in three ensembles of F-theory compactifications, with up to 181,200 axions. We work in the stretched K\"ahler cone, where $\alpha'$ corrections are plausibly controlled, and we use couplings to certain non-Abelian sectors as a proxy for couplings to photons. The axion masses, decay constants, and couplings to gauge sectors show striking universality across the ensembles. In particular, the axion-photon couplings grow with $h^{1,1}$, and models in our ensemble with $h^{1,1} \gtrsim$ 10,000 axions are in tension with helioscope constraints. Moreover, under mild assumptions about charged matter beyond the Standard Model, theories with $h^{1,1} \gtrsim$ 5,000 are in tension with Chandra measurements of X-ray spectra. This work is a first step toward understanding the phenomenology of quantum gravity theories with thousands of axions.</description>

      <title>Phases of Giant Magnetic Vortex Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen magnetic vortex strings in 3+1 dimensional Abelian Higgs models. We systematically analyze the giant vortex regime using a combination of analytic and numerical methods. In this regime the strings are infinitely long, axially symmetric, and support a large magnetic flux n along the symmetry axis in their core that causes them to spread out in the transverse directions. Extending previous observations, we show that the non-linear equations governing giant vortices can essentially be solved exactly. The solutions fall into different universality classes, reflecting the properties of the Higgs potential, that become sharply distinct phases in the large-n limit. We use this understanding to shed light on the binding energies and stability of vortex strings in each universality class.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of $Q$-functions for the ${\cal Z}_r$ invariant inhomogeneous XXZ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ chain near free fermion point</title>

Abstract: At the beginning of the 70's, Baxter introduced a multiparametric generalization of the six-vertex model. This integrable system has been found to exhibit a remarkable variety of critical behaviors. The work is part of a series of papers devoted to their systematic study. We focus on the case when the lattice model possesses an additional ${\cal Z}_r$ symmetry and consider the critical behavior near the so-called free fermion point. Among other things, discussed is the algebra of extended conformal symmetry underlying the universal behavior. The main result of the paper is the class of differential equations that describe the scaling limit of the solutions to the Bethe Ansatz equations. This is an instance of the correspondence between Ordinary Differential Equations and Integrable Quantum Field Theory (ODE/IQFT correspondence).</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>

      <title>GREA and Dark Energy: A holographic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of the cosmological constant is a mystery. We don't understand its quantum origin but we associate it with the actual acceleration of the universe because it is the simplest description we had until recently of the present cosmological observations. However, this may change with the next generation of experiments. If we can convince ourselves that the cosmic acceleration is not due to a constant, this would open up new fascinating avenues. By exploring the simplest cosmological model in the bulk, that of an empty and flat space with a cosmological constant $\Lambda$, we find that its holographic dual makes sense as a theory of fundamental quantum degrees of freedom at the boundary. Moreover, we find that an observer in the bulk, making long-range (electromagnetic and gravitational) observations, cannot distinguish the acceleration induced by the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ from that induced by the thermodynamic properties of the boundary, the de Sitter horizon. By including matter in the bulk we extend this holographic principle to GREA, where the quantum d.o.f. associated with the evolving boundary of the causal horizon induces an entropic acceleration that varies in time. Future observations will determine whether our causal horizon is responsible for the present acceleration and whether our universe will end in de Sitter or Minkowski.</description>

      <title>Monogamy of Mutual Information in Graph States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The monogamy of mutual information (MMI) is a quantum entropy inequality that enforces the non-positivity of tripartite information. We investigate the failure of MMI in graph states as a forbidden-subgraph phenomenon, conjecturing that every MMI-violating graph state is local-Clifford equivalent to one whose graph contains a four-star subgraph. We construct a family of star-like graphs whose states fail a specific class of MMI instances, and extend this analysis to general star topologies. Deriving adjacency matrix constraints that fix the MMI evaluation for these instances and interpreting them physically, we prove the forbidden-subgraph conjecture for this family of graphs. Finally, through an exhaustive search over graph representatives for all $8$-qubit stabilizer entropy vectors, we establish that MMI failure is not reducible to the cases within our scope.</description>

      <title>Topological BF Theory construction of twisted dihedral quantum double phases from spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonabelian topological orders host exotic anyons central to quantum computing, yet established realizations rely on case-by-case constructions that are often conceptually involved. In this work, we present a systematic construction of nonabelian dihedral quantum double phases based on a continuous $O(2)$ gauge field. We first formulate a topological $S[O(2)\times O(2)]$ BF theory, and by identifying the Wilson loops and twist operators of this theory with anyons, we show that our topological BF theory reproduces the complete anyon data, and can incorporate all Dijkgraaf--Witten twists. Building on this correspondence, we present a microscopic model with $O(2)$ lattice gauge field coupled to Ising and rotor matter whose Higgsing yields the desired dihedral quantum double phase. A perturbative renormalization group analysis further indicates a direct transition from this phase to a $U(1)$ Coulomb or chiral topological phase at a stable multicritical point with emergent $O(3)$ symmetry. Our proposal offers an alternative route to nonabelian topological order with promising prospects in synthetic gauge field platforms.</description>

      <title>Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a continuous-variable quantum computing (CVQC) algorithm to study Berry's phase on photonic quantum computers. We demonstrate that CVQC allows the simulation of charged particles with orbital angular momentum under the influence of an adiabatically changing $\vec{B}$ field. Although formulated entirely in the CVQC setting, our construction uses only passive linear-optical operations (beam splitters and phase shifts), which act identically in single-photon photonic architectures. This enables experimental realisation on the Quandella Ascella platform, where we observe the Berry's phase phenomenon with interferometric measurement. We also generalise the framework to more rapid non-adiabatic evolution. By concatenating Aharonov-Anandan cycles for opposing magnetic fields we demonstrate that one can engineer a circuit in which dynamical phases and leading non-geometric errors cancel by symmetry, leaving the intrinsically robust geometric phase contribution.</description>

      <title>Two Puzzles, One Solution: Neutrino Mass and Secluded Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a minimal secluded dark-matter (DM) framework based on an extra $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry. The model contains a Dirac DM particle $\chi$, three heavy neutrinos $N_I$ with masses $M_{N,I}$, and a singlet scalar $R$ that mixes with the Standard Model Higgs doublet $\Phi$ by an angle $\alpha$. A symmetry forbids the $\Phi$-$R$ portal at tree level; the leading portal then arises at one loop from the same Yukawa structures that generate active neutrino masses $m_{\nu,I}$, implying $\tan(2\alpha) \propto \sum_I m_{\nu,I} M^2_{N,I}/(v_h m_H^2)$, where $v_h$ and $m_H$ are the SM Higgs VEV and mass. For heavy-neutrino masses in the multi-TeV range, this yields a naturally tiny mixing, $\tan(2\alpha)\sim 5\times 10^{-11}\left(M_N/10~\mathrm{TeV}\right)^2$, which strongly suppresses DM signals in direct, indirect, and collider searches. For PeV-scale heavy neutrinos the DM-nucleon cross section can instead enter the reach of direct-detection experiments. The visible and dark sectors thermalize at temperatures of order a few times the mass of the lightest heavy neutrino, then subsequently decouple, and typically evolve with a slightly hotter dark bath. In the secluded regime, with $\tan(2\alpha)\ll 1$ and $m_\chi&gt;m_{H_p}$, the relic density is set by $p$-wave annihilation $\chi\bar\chi \to H_p H_p$ (with $H_p$ the Higgs-like particle of the dark sector), and the dark-sector Yukawa couplings required to reproduce the observed abundance are $\sim(0.1\text{-}1)$, as in the standard WIMP case. For heavy-neutrino masses $\gtrsim 10~\mathrm{TeV}$, the mediator decays before nucleosynthesis without spoiling BBN observables, while the tiny portal suppresses present-day signals below current and near-future sensitivities. This links two long-standing puzzles, the absence of DM signals and the smallness of neutrino masses, within a predictive thermal framework.</description>

      <title>Quintessential Inflation in Light of ACT DR6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a precision investigation of smooth quintessential inflation in which a single canonical scalar field unifies the two known phases of cosmic acceleration. Using a CMB-normalized runaway exponential potential, we obtain sharply predictive inflationary observables: a red-tilted spectrum with $n_s = 0.964241$ and an exceptionally suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.48 \times 10^{-5}$ at $N=60$, lying near the optimal region of current Planck+ACT constraints. Remarkably, all observable scales exit the horizon within an extremely narrow field interval $\Delta\phi \simeq 0.03\,M_{\rm Pl}$, tightly linking early and late-time dynamics and reducing theoretical ambiguities. While inflationary tensors remain invisible to CMB B-mode surveys, the subsequent stiff epoch-an intrinsic hallmark of quintessential cosmology-imprints a blue-tilted stochastic gravitational-wave background within the discovery reach of future interferometers such as LISA, DECIGO, ALIA, and BBO. Our results demonstrate that this minimal, featureless model not only survives current bounds, but provides concrete, falsifiable predictions across gravitational-wave frequencies spanning over twenty orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity is an alternative theory of gravity in which a rank-two antisymmetric tensor field, known as the Kalb-Ramond field, is nonminimally coupled to gravity and can induce spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking when it acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value. In this work, we revisit Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity and obtain two classes of exact static black hole solutions with general topological horizons in diverse dimensions within this framework, both with and without a cosmological constant. We further analyze their thermodynamic properties and employ the Wald formalism to compute the Noether mass and entropy, thereby establishing the corresponding first law of black hole thermodynamics. Finally, we discuss the implications of the Noether mass charge for constraining spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking within the framework of Einstein-Kalb-Ramond gravity.</description>

Abstract: We present an implementation of algorithms for the symbolic integration of hyperlogarithms multiplied by rational functions in the computer algebra system FORM. This implementation encompasses cases where hyperlogarithms have rational letters or a rational argument. It complements the previous implementation, HyperInt, in MAPLE by Erik Panzer, utilizing the advantages of FORM in the efficient handling of large symbolic expressions. Among a wide range of applications, this approach enables the computation of many Feynman integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By deriving and solving the gravitational and electromagnetic field equations in $f(R,T)$ gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics, we obtain a static spherically symmetric charged solution that incorporates higher-order correction terms along with an effective cosmological constant term. This solution reduces to the AdS/dS metric in the far-field region while exhibiting significant modifications in the strong-field regime due to the nonlinear electromagnetic effects and the matter-geometry coupling. We further analyze the black hole's horizon structure, revealing the complex phenomenon of multiple horizons emerging within specific parameter ranges. Additionally, by introducing an effective metric to study photon propagation, we systematically explore the influence of magnetic charge and the coupling parameter on the effective potential, the photon sphere radius, and the black hole shadow.</description>

      <title>The covariant equations of motion of massive spinning particles in a background Yang-Mills field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strong classical color field, known as the glasma, is generated in the earliest stage of relativistic heavy-ion collisions and can significantly influence the momentum and spin dynamics of hard probes such as quarks and jets. Most existing studies based on the classical equations of motion in a background Yang-Mills field, such as Wong equations, may not capture the full range of effects, for example, they neglect the Stern-Gerlach force experienced by spinning particles in non-uniform glasma fields. Although several extensions of Wong equations have been proposed to include spin degrees of freedom, they generally fail to satisfy all the required conditions simultaneously, such as Lorentz covariance, allowance for an arbitrary chromomagnetic moment, and respect for the necessary physical constraints. In this work, we extend the framework of a relativistic classical spinning particle in an electromagnetic field to describe spin one-half quarks propagating in a background non-Abelian Yang-Mills field. By systematically applying the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, we derive self-consistent equations of motion for the particle's coordinates, momenta, spin, and color charge that satisfy all these requirements. This formalism provides a more complete and physically relevant description for studying momentum diffusion and spin polarization phenomena of hard probes in the glasma.</description>

      <title>Character Identities Between Affine and Virasoro Vertex Operator Algebra Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The affine vertex operator algebras for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and the Virasoro minimal models are related by Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction and by the Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. In this work, we propose another connection based on certain character identities between these vertex operator algebras and their modules. This relates the simple affine vertex operator algebras $L_k(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ at admissible levels $k=-2+q/p$ to the rational $(q,3p)$-minimal models $L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3p},0)$, and also extends to the nonadmissible levels with $q=1$.
  Several special cases are particularly interesting. In the nonadmissible case $q=1$, the character identities extend to certain abelian intertwining algebras, specifically $\mathcal{V}^{(p)}$ and the doublet $\mathcal{A}^{(3p)}$. Specialising further to $p=2$, where $\mathcal{V}^{(2)}$ is the simple small $\mathcal{N}=4$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c=-9$, this recovers, via the 4d/2d-correspondence, a known identity between the Schur indices of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $(3,2)$ Argyres-Douglas theory.
  In the boundary admissible case $q=2$, in a similar vein, we obtain an identity between the Schur indices of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ Argyres-Douglas theories of types $(A_1,D_{2n+1})$ and $(A_1,A_{6n})$.
  On the other hand, for integral levels, $p=1$, where both involved vertex operator algebras are strongly rational, our character identity induces a Galois conjugation between the representation categories $\mathrm{Rep}(L_{-2+q}(\mathfrak{sl}_2))$ and $\mathrm{Rep}(L_\mathrm{Vir}(c_{q,3},0))$. We conjecture that the characters are related by the action of certain Hecke operators.
  Finally, we also sketch how to extend the results of this paper to relaxed highest-weight and Whittaker modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We recently showed that the two-dimensional Ising spin glass allows for a line of renormalization group fixed points. We observe that this exact result corresponds to enhancement to a one-generator continuous internal symmetry. This finally explains why no finite temperature transition to a spin glass phase is observed in two dimensions. In more than two dimensions, instead, the continuous symmetry can be broken spontaneously and yields a spin glass order parameter which, for fixed temperature and disorder strength, takes continuous values in an interval. Such a feature is shared by the order parameter of the known mean field solution of the model with infinite-range interactions, which corresponds to infinitely many dimensions.</description>

      <title>Matrix approximations of operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The approximate representation of operators by finite matrices is analysed in terms of accuracy and convergence. The identity operator, for example, can be reconstructed using a basis of harmonic oscillator states leading to a narrow peak approximation of the $\delta$ function, but this peak may be perturbed by small, residual, oscillations. The peak does not shrink nor grows quickly, and the oscillations only diminish slowly as the size of the matrix increases. For the kinetic energy operator, a triple peak (one positive, two negative) representation of $-\delta''$ is obtained, but that is affected also by residual oscillations. Again, convergence is slow as the matrix dimension increases. We find compact formulas to explain such oscillations. Similar observations are found for representations of local interactions, while separable potentials are better represented. As a comparison, in the context of a toy model, the effects of choosing an alternative single particle basis are studied. A formal approach for the approximation of operators is considered for comparison. We conclude with a word of caution for (finite) matrix approximations of operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized Uncertainty Principle theory with a single constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to analyze the consistency of the deformation of the Heisenberg algebra in the setting of constrained Hamiltonian systems, providing a procedure to induce the deformation on the Poisson algebra after symplectic reduction. We investigate this in the context of the classical interpretation of Generalized Uncertainty Principle theories, treating two cases separately. For the first case, we consider a group action on the phase space together with a set of first-class constraints that can be interpreted as a momentum map. We furnish an explicit example in the case of rotational invariant deformed algebras. In the second case, we consider a single constraint provided by the Hamiltonian, which is a common instance in General Relativity, with straightforward application in cosmology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmic inflation within a class of the scalar-tensor model with the scalar-dependent non-minimal kinetic couplings. The inflationary dynamical potential will be applied. Using the slow-roll approximation, we compute theoretical predictions for the key observables, like the spectral indexes $n_s$, scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$ and the running of the scalar spectral index $\alpha_s$ in terms of the free parameters of the model. Besides, we find the limitations of these parameters. In addition, these quantities will be compared with the latest observational data from the Planck data. Furthermore, we analyze the sensitivity of $r$, $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$ in terms of the model's free parameters.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Bianchi-I cosmological model in non-conservative unimodular gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose an anisotropic Bianchi-I type cosmological model in non-conservative Unimodular Gravity ($\mathrm{NUG}$). We show that simply using the Bianchi-I type metric does not resolve a striking characteristic of the field equations in $\mathrm{NUG}$: their underdetermination. This fact led us to implement extra conditions on the combination $\left(\rho+p\right)$ and, consequently, obtain a consistent background cosmological analysis. In the vacuum case, we obtain an analogy between the Kasner solutions and the equations in $\mathrm{NUG}$. We also propose a new analysis of a non-homogeneous equation of state, the combination $\left(\rho+p\right)=l$. We identify that the cosmological dynamics are strictly dependent on the value of the constant $l$. The physically interesting case is at the value $l&lt;0$, which seems to indicate a super-accelerated, ghost-like universe. This case still requires a more detailed analysis, for example, from a thermodynamic point of view, keeping in mind that $\left(\rho+p\right)$ may be interpreted as enthalpy of the system. For the cases $\left(\rho+p\right)\propto a^{-3}$ and $\left(\rho+p\right) \propto a^{-4}$, we obtain a description consistent with the anisotropic cosmological model described by $\mathrm{GR}$. In all cases analyzed, a small value for the anisotropic parameter $\Omega_{A}$ (on the order of $10^{-2}$) is required in order to have agreement, for example, with the age of the universe to be approximately $12-14\, \mathrm{Gyr}$, agreeing with the age of globular clusters. As the universe expands an isotropization is verified, with the anistropies going to zero asymptotically, similarly with what happens in an anistropic cosmological model based on $\mathrm{GR}$.</description>

Abstract: Weyl geometry is a natural extension of conformal geometry with Weyl covariance mediated by a Weyl connection. We generalize the Fefferman-Graham (FG) ambient construction for conformal manifolds to a corresponding construction for Weyl manifolds. We first introduce the Weyl-ambient metric motivated by the Weyl-Fefferman-Graham (WFG) gauge. From a top-down perspective, we show that the Weyl-ambient space as a pseudo-Riemannian geometry induces a codimension-2 Weyl geometry. Then, from a bottom-up perspective, we start from promoting a conformal manifold into a Weyl manifold by assigning a Weyl connection to the principal $\mathbb{R}_+$-bundle realizing a Weyl structure. We show that the Weyl structure admits a well-defined initial value problem, which determines the Weyl-ambient metric. Through the Weyl-ambient construction, we also investigate Weyl-covariant tensors on the Weyl manifold and define extended Weyl-obstruction tensors explicitly.</description>

Abstract: The Wakimoto-type free-field approach is applied to the boundary integer-level simple $\widehat{g}(k)$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models, with a renewed motivation. With the introduction of the Lauricella hypergeometric functions $F_{D}^{(n)}$ and their analytical extensions, we could obtain all genus-zero bulk $n$-point functions explicitly, for rational conformal field theories (RCFTs) that admit a free-field approach. I present free-field expressions for $\widehat{g}(k)$ Ishibashi states, and provide simple example calculations in the simplest models. An extreme short discussion on potential generalizations of free-field approach to the logarithmic WZW models at the admissible levels is also given.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence of infinitely many Bethe expansions for general four dimensional superconformal theories. We then propose an analytic method to systematically obtain all the Bethe solutions, both isolated and continuous, for general superconformal theories. In particular, we show that the contribution from the continuous manifold of solutions to the index comes from isolated points on this manifold. We check our proposals on $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. For $U(3)$ or $SU(3)$, which are the first examples with continuous solutions, we demonstrate the non-trivial cancellation between the tachyon contributions from the previously known isolated solutions and those from the continuous solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18458v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working in a sector of large charge is a powerful tool to analytically access models that are either strongly coupled or otherwise difficult to solve explicitly. In the context of integrable systems, Volin's method is exactly such a large-charge approach. In this note, we apply this method to the bi-Yang-Baxter deformed $SU(2)$ principal chiral model. Our main result is an explicit expression for the free energy density as an asymptotic expansion. We moreover determine the leading non-perturbative effects both via analytic methods and a resurgence analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10099v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient regularization method for functional determinants of radial operators using heat kernel coefficients. Our key finding is a systematic way to identify heat kernel coefficients in the angular momentum space. We explicitly obtain the formulas up to sixth order in the heat kernel expansion, which suffice to regularize up to 13-dimensional functional determinants. We find that the heat kernel coefficients accurately approximate the large angular momentum dependence of functional determinants, and make numerical computations more efficient. In the limit of a large angular momentum, our formulas reduce to the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin formulas in previous studies, but are extended to higher orders. All the results are available in both the zeta function regularization and the dimensional regularization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the chiral anomaly for systems with a wide class of Hermitian Dirac operators ${Q}$ in 4D Euclidean spacetime. We suppose that $ Q$ is not necessarily linear in derivatives and also that it contains a coordinate inhomogeneity unrelated to that of the external gauge field. We use the covariant Wigner-Weyl calculus (in which the Wigner transformed two point Greens function belongs to the two-index tensor representation of the gauge group) and point splitting regularization to calculate the global expression for the anomaly. The Atiyah-Singer theorem can be applied to relate the anomaly to the topological index of $ Q$. We show that the topological index factorizes (under certain assumptions) into the topological invariant $\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int \text{tr}(F\wedge F)$ (composed of the gauge field strength) multiplied by a topological invariant $N_3$ in phase space. The latter is responsible for the topological stability of Fermi points/Fermi surfaces and is related to the conductivity of the chiral separation effect.</description>

      <title>Exact Sum Rules and Zeta Generating Formulas from the ODE/IM correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a spectral-zeta framework for quantum mechanics with the ${\cal PT}$-symmetric potential $V_{{\cal PT}}(x)=x^{2K}(ix)^{\varepsilon}$ $(K,\varepsilon \in {\mathbb N})$ and the Hermitian potential $V_{{\cal H}}(x)=x^{2M}$ $(M \in {\mathbb N}+1)$, based on the fusion relations of the $A_{2M-1}$ T-system. Using the ODE/IM correspondence, we construct exact sum rules (ESRs) and zeta generating formulas (ZGFs) for the spectral zeta functions (SZFs) $\zeta_n(s)$. In contrast to recursive T-Q relations, the ZGFs provide fixed-source, closed-form mappings between different fusion sectors. For Hermitian $M=2$, our ESRs reproduce exact WKB results, extending them systematically to ${\cal PT}$ sectors and (half-)integer $M$. Our analysis reveals a phenomenon of \textit{algebraic information loss}, distinct from analytic ambiguity. The structure is governed by a selection rule ${\cal S}_n$, derived from the Chebyshev structure of fusion relations and $\mathbb{Z}_{2M+2}$ Symanzik symmetry. For odd integer $M$, we identify a structural non-invertibility: mapping from \textit{odd} to \textit{even} fusion sectors causes exact coefficient cancellation due to phase interference, rendering the map non-invertible. This implies even-sector data carry strictly less information than odd-sector data, yielding a \textit{no-go} statement for inverse spectral reconstruction. Conversely, for even and half-integer $M$, all relevant sectors form an information-equivalent, mutually invertible family. Finally, we provide a spectral-zeta formulation of the massless Ai-Bender-Sarkar (ABS) conjecture. By connecting ${\cal PT}$ and Hermitian spectra via ZGFs, we establish a purely spectral-theoretic route to the conjectured relation, avoiding explicit analytic continuation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex-valued Feynman integrals in the imaginary time formalism and zero-temperature limit suffer from particular types of infrared divergences that can not be regulated by integration dimension alone. Related problems leading to integration order dependent results are even further pronounced in the presence of additional scales such as external momenta. This plays a noticeable role in systems featuring fermionic degrees of freedom such as cold Quantum Chromodynamics, where loop integrals are complexified by chemical potential(s). Working in the limit of vanishing temperature, we utilize novel complex-valued extensions to bubble Feynman integrals and study momentum expansions of fermionic loop integrals. The expansions are then used to illustrate the mechanisms of manifested discrepancies between orders of integration, associated with the residue theorem. Finally, we address the issues by introducing a representation avoiding the observed ambiguity and briefly overview classes of integrals insensitive to problems from external momenta.</description>

Abstract: Heavy particle effective theory applied to spinning black holes provides a natural framework in which propagators linearize and numerators exponentiate. In this work, we exploit these two features to introduce Kerr generating functions, which describe the scattering of any probe on a Kerr black hole background to all loop orders. These generating functions can be used to perform the tensor reduction of multi-loop integrands simply by differentiation with respect to the spin. As a first application of the Kerr generating functions, we study a neutron star in a Kerr black hole background. We organize the integrand by the helicity configuration of the exchanged gravitons and provide compact all-loop-order results for several helicity sectors and a full four-loop $\mathcal{O}(G^5)$ result.</description>

Abstract: Models with classically degenerate vacua often support quasiclassical configurations of nontrivial topology. In (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanics with a double-well potential, for example, instantons induce mixing between the two perturbative ground states in the purely bosonic case, while in the supersymmetric version, the tunneling amplitude is suppressed.
  In this work, we investigate (1+1)-dimensional models featuring classically Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield saturated kinks with degenerate masses and identical topology. Recent studies suggest that such kinks may undergo mixing mediated by scalar-field instantons. We analyze this phenomenon in a supersymmetric framework and demonstrate that, whereas mixing indeed occurs in the bosonic theory, the presence of fermionic zero modes in the supersymmetric case leads to the vanishing of the transition amplitude. To illustrate these results, we examine two examples featuring Wess-Zumino models with two and four supercharges. The latter example is motivated by the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential. We also present a number of developments of instanton calculus in the case of instantons in kink backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: We study causal properties of the recently found rotating black-hole solution in the low-energy sector of Horava gravity as a viable Lorentz-violating (LV) gravity in four dimensions with the LV Maxwell field and a cosmological constant $\Lambda (&gt;-3/a^2)$ for an arbitrary rotation parameter $a$. The region of non-trivial causality violation containing closed timelike curves is exactly the same as in the Kerr-Newman or the Kerr-Newman-(Anti-)de Sitter solution. Nevertheless, chronology is protected in the new rotating black hole because the causality violating region becomes physically inaccessible by exterior observers due to the new three-curvature singularity at its boundary that is topologically two-torus including the usual ring singularity at $(r,\theta)=(0,\pi/2)$. As a consequence, the physically accessible region outside the torus singularity is causal everywhere.</description>

Abstract: Three-dimensional supersymmetric gauge theories with eight supercharges possess a unique duality known as 3d mirror symmetry. Under this correspondence, the Coulomb branch of one theory is equivalent to the Higgs branch of its mirror dual, and vice versa. Over the past decades, extensive effort has been devoted to charting the landscape of 3d mirror pairs, though progress has often been constrained by the need to identify suitable brane configurations. In this first instalment, we introduce a new quiver-based algorithm, termed Growth and Fusion, which completes a quartet of Higgsing algorithms alongside Decay and Fission, Quiver Subtraction, and Quiver Addition. Together, these four algorithms provide a systematic framework that circumvents the limitations of brane constructions, enabling us to determine the mirror dual of a given quiver and to systematically bootstrap new 3d mirror pairs. We demonstrate the power of this approach on a new class of circular 3d mirror pairs.</description>

      <title>Photonic Exceptional Points in Holography and QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, based on an analogy of holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build the holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work, which accompanies [1], is about constructing smooth solutions in type II and eleven dimensional supergravity which describe supersymmetry preserving RG flows from four-dimensional SCFTs in the UV to three-dimensional SQFTs in the IR, through holography. We show that all the different UV fixed points flow to theories which confine external quarks and have a mass gap. We proceed by presenting extended calculations of a plethora of observables and analyse the dual field theories in great detail. This includes a boundary analysis and application of holographic renormalization methods in the simplest case of the type IIB solution. Many of the observables computed here have a universal behaviour: they factorize into two parts, one of which includes information about the UV SCFTs, and the other describing the dynamics of the RG flow, which is the same regardless of the UV fixed point.</description>

      <title>Hasse Diagrams for Gapless SPT and SSB Phases with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00905v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss (1+1)d gapless phases with non-invertible global symmetries, also referred to as categorical symmetries. This includes gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, known as gapless SPT (or gSPT) phases; and gapless phases showing properties analogous to gapped spontaneous symmetry broken (SSB) phases, that we refer to as gapless SSB (or gSSB) phases. We fit these gapless phases, along with gapped SPT and SSB phases, into a phase diagram describing possible deformations connecting them. This phase diagram is partially ordered and defines a so-called Hasse diagram. Based on these deformations, we identify gapless phases exhibiting symmetry protected criticality, that we refer to as intrinsically gapless SPT (igSPT) and intrinsically gapless SSB (igSSB) phases. This includes the first examples of igSPT and igSSB phases with non-invertible symmetries. Central to this analysis is the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), where each phase corresponds to a condensable algebra in the Drinfeld center of the symmetry category. On a mathematical note, gSPT phases are classified by functors between fusion categories, generalizing the fact that gapped SPT phases are classified by fiber functors; and gSSB phases are classified by functors from fusion to multi-fusion categories. Finally, our framework can be applied to understand gauging of trivially acting non-invertible symmetries, including possible patterns of decomposition arising due to such gaugings.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical symmetries have recently been shown to generalize the classification of phases of matter, significantly broadening the traditional Landau paradigm. To test these predictions, we propose a simple spin chain model that encompasses all gapped phases and second-order phase transitions governed by the categorical symmetry $\mathsf{Rep}(D_8)$. This model not only captures the essential features of non-invertible phases but is also straightforward enough to enable practical realization. Specifically, we outline an implementation using neutral atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays. Employing a dual-species setup and Rydberg blockade, we propose a digital simulation approach that can efficiently implement the many-body evolution in several nontrivial quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg Uncertainty Inequality and Breaking of Isospin Symmetry in Atomic Nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty inequality is used to derive a rigorous lower bound to the amount of isospin impurities in $N=Z$ atomic nuclei, caused by the violation of isospin symmetry. The bound is fixed by the difference between the neutron and proton radii and the sum of the charge exchange monopole strengths. It can be used to check the consistency of advanced many-body calculations accounting for the breaking of isospin symmetry. The uncertainty inequality is also employed to derive an upper bound to the isovector dipole moment in terms of the amount of isospin impurities, providing an insightful connection between the violation of parity and isospin symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new formulation of non-dissipative relativistic spin hydrodynamics that incorporates spin degrees of freedom into the divergence-type theory framework. Due to the divergence-type structure, it is straightforward to enforce non-linear causality and symmetric hyperbolicity of the equations of motion, ensuring local well-posedness of the initial-value problem and stability of the theory. Furthermore, in a specific realization based on spin kinetic theory, we prove that the equations of motion remain non-linearly causal and symmetric-hyperbolic to all orders in the spin potential, provided a specific thermodynamic constraint is satisfied. This framework can be applied for numerical simulations to study the dynamics of spin-polarized fluids, such as the quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonperturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) while it is possible to find regimes with genuine Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-like tripartite entanglement, it is difficult find regimes where tripartite entanglement can be easily shown to be significant or classified. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field nonperturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the Unruh-DeWitt model. Along the way, we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>Doubly Separable Spacetimes and Symmetry Constraints on their Self-Gravitating Matter Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18706v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular approach to constructing exact stationary and axisymmetric nonvacuum solutions in general relativity has been to use solution-generating techniques. Here we revisit a recent variant of the Newman-Janis-Azreg-Ainou algorithm - restricted to asymptotically-flat spacetimes - and demonstrate that this method exclusively generates Konoplya-Stuchlik-Zhidenko spacetimes. Therefore, the equations for geodesic motion and scalar-wave propagation are both separable. We call these "doubly separable" spacetimes. Of these, we identify a "degenerate" subclass that might admit a separable Dirac equation by explicitly obtaining the Killing-Yano tensor. While the degenerate subclass is Petrov Type D, the general doubly separable spacetimes are of Type I. The high degree of symmetry in these spacetimes suggests that the self-gravitating matter must also be in specialized field configurations. For this reason, we investigate whether these spacetimes can even be sourced by arbitrary types of matter. We show that doubly separable spacetimes cannot be sourced by massless real scalar fields or by perfect fluids, and that electromagnetic fields lead only to the Kerr-Newman family. Notably, this rules out the correct spinning counterpart of the Janis-Newman-Winicour naked singularity spacetimes, which contains a scalar field, as a member of this metric class. While the algorithm generates spacetimes with rich symmetry structures, valuable for studying phenomena like black hole shadows and quasinormal modes, our results highlight the need for caution when using it to construct physically consistent solutions with prespecified matter content.</description>

      <title>Primordial Power Spectrum and Bispectrum from Lattice Simulations of Axion-U(1) Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present primordial non-Gaussianity predictions from a new high-precision code for simulating axion-U(1) inflation on a discrete lattice. We measure the primordial scalar curvature power spectrum and bispectrum from our simulations, determining their dependence on both scale and axion-gauge coupling strength. Both the gauge-sourced power spectrum and the bispectrum exhibit a strong blue tilt due to our choice of an $\alpha$-attractor inflaton potential. We provide fitting functions for the power spectrum and bispectrum that accurately reproduce these statistics across a wide range of scales and coupling strengths. While our fitting function for the bispectrum has a separable form, results from high-resolution simulations demonstrate that the full shape is not separable. Thus, our simulations generate realizations of primordial curvature perturbations with nontrivial correlators that cannot be generated using standard techniques for primordial non-Gaussianity. We derive bounds on the axion-gauge coupling strength based on the bispectrum constraints from the cosmic microwave background, demonstrating a new method for constraining inflationary primordial non-Gaussianity by simulating the nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Gluon Condensate via Dirac Spectral Density: IR Phase, Scale Anomaly and IR Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quark and gluon scalar densities, $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ and $\langle F^2 \rangle$, reflect the degree of scale-invariance violations in SU(N) gauge theories with fundamental quarks. It is known that $\langle \bar{\psi} \psi \rangle$ can be usefully scale-decomposed via spectral density $\rho(\lambda)$ of Dirac modes. Here I give such formula for $\langle F^2 \rangle$, which reveals that gluon condensate is a strictly UV quantity. For the recently-found IR phase [1,2], where the infrared (IR) degrees of freedom separate out and become independent of the system's bulk, it implies that $\langle F^2 \rangle$ due to this IR part vanishes. Its glue thus doesn't contribute to scale anomaly of the entire system and is, in this sense, scale invariant consistently with the original claim. Associated formulas are used to define IR decoupling of glue, which may serve as an alternative indicator of IR phase transition. Using the simplest form of coherent lattice QCD, we express the effective action of full QCD entirely via Dirac spectral density.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter-Herman Visualization as a Diagnostic Tool for Systematic Effects in Electromagnetic Form Factor Extractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The internal charge and magnetization distributions of the proton are characterized by electromagnetic form factors GE and GM. They are experimentally extracted via Rosenbluth separation, which measures the elastic scattering of electrons and protons at multiple beam energies and angles at fixed momentum transfer Q2. Conventionally, form factor values are obtained by plotting reduced cross sections against the virtual photon polarization parameter epsilon and then extracting the slope and intercept of the best fit lines. An alternative visualization method, proposed by Hofstadter and Herman in 1960, plots GM2 vs. GE2 curves instead. The best fit values of GE2 and GM2 are immediately visible from the intersection region of the curves and their uncertainty bands. In this work, we apply both conventional and Hofstadter-Herman visualizations to classic 1994 SLAC elastic scattering data. We demonstrate that the Hofstadter-Herman method reveals previously obscured regions of form factor parameter space and highlights subtle experimental discrepancies among data sets. Our results motivate adopting this visualization method as a routine diagnostic cross-check at the Electron-Ion Collider and elsewhere to flag normalization shifts and related adjustments before they enter global fits.</description>

      <title>Radiative Decays of Vector Mesons with Light-Cone Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic electromagnetic form factors and radiative decay properties offer a crucial window into the nonperturbative dynamics of Quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this work, we employ the light-cone sum rules (LCSR) method to systematically investigate the M1 radiative decay of vector mesons. Our study covers processes including $K^{*-}\rightarrow K^-\gamma$, $D^*\rightarrow D\gamma$, $B^*\rightarrow B\gamma$, $D^{*+}_s\rightarrow D^+_s\gamma$, and $B_s^*\rightarrow B_s\gamma$, and further extends to the excited charmonium state $\psi(2S)$. Our calculations yield decay widths for $K^*$ and $\psi(2S)$ that are in excellent agreement with experimental data. For the charm and bottom meson decays, where precise measurements are lacking, we provide theoretical predictions and compare them with other theoretical approaches. Most notably, our analysis reveals a universal linear dependence of the decay width on a function A(x) in the logarithmic coordinate system, which originates from the two-body decay dynamics and the ratio of the initial and final state decay constants. This relationship holds for the ground state $V \rightarrow P \gamma $ processes here and suggests a broader applicability to radiative decays of ground-state vector mesons.</description>
