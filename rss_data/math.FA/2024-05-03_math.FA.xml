      <title>Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality with H\"older norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality, known as an interpolation inequality, involves Lebesgue norms of functions and their derivatives. We established an interpolation lemma to connect Lebesgue and H\"older spaces, thus extending the Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality. This extension involved substituting arbitrary Sobolev norms with appropriate H\"older norms, allowing for a wider range of applicable parameters in the inequality.</description>

      <title>Power boundedness and related properties for weighted composition operators on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize those pairs $(\psi,\varphi)$ of smooth mappings $\psi:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{C},\varphi:\mathbb{R}^d\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^d$ for which the corresponding weighted composition operator $C_{\psi,\varphi}f=\psi\cdot(f\circ\varphi)$ acts continuously on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Additionally, we give several easy-to-check necessary and sufficient conditions of this property for interesting special cases. Moreover, we characterize power boundedness and topologizablity of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in terms of $\psi,\varphi$. Among other things, as an application of our results we show that for a univariate polynomial $\varphi$ with $\text{deg}(\varphi)\geq 2$, power boundedness of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R})$ for every $\psi\in\mathscr{O}_M(\mathbb{R})$ only depends on $\varphi$ and that in this case power boundedness of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ is equivalent to $(C_{\psi,\varphi}^n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ converging to $0$ in $\mathcal{L}_b(\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R}))$ as well as to the uniform mean ergodicity of $C_{\psi,\varphi}$. Additionally, we give an example of a power bounded and uniformly mean ergodic weighted composition operator $C_{\psi,\varphi}$ on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R})$ for which neither the multiplication operator $f\mapsto \psi f$ nor the composition operator $f\mapsto f\circ\varphi$ acts on $\mathscr{S}(\mathbb{R})$. Our results complement and considerably extend various results of Fern\'andez, Galbis, and the second named author.</description>

      <title>A missing theorem on dual spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We answer in the affirmative the surprisingly difficult questions: If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual X, then is X a complex Banach space?
  If a complex Banach space possesses a real predual, then does it have a complex predual? We also answer the analogous questions for operator spaces, that is spaces of operators on a Hilbert space, up to complete isometry. Indeed we use operator space methods to solve the Banach space question above.</description>

      <title>The Lp Polar bodies of shadow system and related inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L_p$ versions of the support function and polar body are introduced by Berndtsson, Mastrantonis and Rubinstein in \cite{Berndtsson-Mastrantonis-Rubinstein-2023} recently. In this paper, we prove that the $L_p$-support function of the shadow system $K_t$ introduced by Rogers and Shephard in \cite{rogers-1958-02,shephard-1964} is convex and the volume of the section of $L_p$ polar bodies of $K_t$ is $\frac{1}{n}$-concave with respect to parameter $t$, and obtain some related inequalities. Finally, we present the reverse Rogers-Shephard type inequality for $L_p$-polar bodies.</description>

      <title>On density and Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as type properties for the minimum norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the set $\operatorname{MA}(X,Y)$ of operators between Banach spaces $X$ and $Y$ that attain their minimum norm, and the set $\operatorname{QMA}(X,Y)$ of operators that quasi attain their minimum norm. We characterize the Radon-Nikodym property in terms of operators that attain their minimum norm and obtain some related results about the density of the sets $\operatorname{MA}(X,Y)$ and $\operatorname{QMA}(X,Y)$. We show that every infinite-dimensional Banach space $X$ has an isomorphic space $Y$ such that not every operator from $X$ to $Y$ quasi attains its minimum norm. We introduce and study Bishop-Phelps-Bollob\'as type properties for the minimum norm, including the ones already considered in the literature, and we exhibit a wide variety of results and examples, as well as exploring the relations between them.</description>

      <title>Schwarz-Pick type inequalities from an operator theoretical point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use (versions of) the von Neumann inequality for Hilbert space contractions to prove several Schwarz-Pick inequalities. Specifically, we derive an alternate proof for a multi-point Schwarz-Pick inequality by Beardon and Minda, along with a generalized version for operators. Connections with model spaces and Peschl's invariant derivatives are established. Finally, Schwarz-Pick inequalities for analytic functions on polydisks and for higher order derivatives are discussed. An enhanced version of the Schwarz-Pick lemma, using the notion of distinguished variety, is obtained for the bidisk.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the study of pseudodifferential operators with completely periodic symbols, we obtain results of continuity and invertibility of a class of Gabor operators on time-frequency invariant Banach spaces. As an applications we find sufficient conditions for the existence of Gabor frames on the space of square integrable functions, associated to a general lattice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d)$ boundedness for Riesz transforms of the form ${V^{a}(-\frac12\Delta+V)^{-a}},$ where $a &gt; 0$ and $V$ is a non-negative potential with power growth acting independently on each coordinate. We factorize the semigroup $e^{-tL}$ into one-dimensional factors, estimate them separately and combine the results to estimate the original semigroup. Similar results with additional assumption $a \leqslant 1$ are obtained on $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

      <title>On the existence of approximate problems that preserve the type of a bifurcation point of a nonlinear problem. Application to the stationary Navier-Stokes equations. Part 1. The overdetermined extended system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear problem $F(\lambda,u)=0$ on infinite-dimensional Banach spaces that correspond to the steady-state bifurcation case. In the literature, it is found again a bifurcation point of the approximate problem $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})=0$ only in some cases. We prove that, in every situation, given $F_{h}$ that approximates $F$, there exists an approximate problem $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})-\varrho_{h} = 0$ that has a bifurcation point with the same properties as the bifurcation point of $F(\lambda,u)=0$. First, we formulate, for a function $\widehat{F}$ defined on general Banach spaces, some sufficient conditions for the existence of an equation that has a bifurcation point of certain type. For the proof of this result, we use some methods from variational analysis, Graves' theorem, one of its consequences and the contraction mapping principle for set-valued mappings. These techniques allow us to prove the existence of a solution with some desired components that equal zero of an overdetermined extended system. We then obtain the existence of a constant (or a function) $\widehat{\varrho}$ so that the equation $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u)-\widehat{\varrho} = 0$ has a bifurcation point of certain type. This equation has $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u) = 0$ as a perturbation. It is also made evident a class of maps $C^{p}$ - equivalent (right equivalent) at the bifurcation point to $\widehat{F}(\lambda,u)-\widehat{\varrho}$ at the bifurcation point. Then, for the study of the approximation of $F(\lambda,u)=0$, we give conditions that relate the exact and the approximate functions. As an application of the theorem on general Banach spaces, we formulate conditions in order to obtain the existence of the approximate equation $F_{h}(\lambda_{h},u_{h})-\varrho_{h} = 0$.</description>

      <title>Amenability of finite energy path and loop groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that the groups of finite energy (that is, Sobolev class $H^1$) paths and loops with values in a compact Lie group are amenable in the sense of Pierre de la Harpe, that is, every continuous action of such a group on a compact space admits an invariant regular Borel probability measure. To our knowledge, the strongest previously known result concerned the amenability of groups of continuous paths and loops (Malliavin and Malliavin 1992).</description>

      <title>Strict Frechet Differentiability of the Metric Projection Operator in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove strict Frechet differentiability of the metric projection operator onto closed balls in Hilbert spaces and onto positive cones in Euclidean spaces. We find the exact expressions for Frechet derivatives. Since Frechet differentiability implies Gateaux directional differentiability, the results obtained in this paper strengthen the results obtained in [8] and [10] about the directional differentiability of the metric projection operator onto closed balls in Hilbert spaces and positive cones in Euclidean spaces and in the real Hilbert space l2.</description>

      <title>Real operator spaces and operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We verify that a large portion of the theory of complex operator spaces and operator algebras (as represented by the 2004 book by the author and Le Merdy for specificity) transfers to the real case. We point out some of the results that do not work in the real case. We also discuss how the theory and standard constructions interact with the complexification. For example, we develop the real case of the theory of operator space multipliers and the operator space centralizer algebra, and discuss how these topics connect with the complexification. This turns out to differ in some important details from the complex case. We also characterize real structure in complex operator spaces; and give `real' characterizations of some of the most important objects in the subject.</description>

      <title>On Positivity Preservers with constant Coefficients and their Generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we study positivity preservers $T:\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]\to\mathbb{R}[x_1,\dots,x_n]$ with constant coefficients and define their generators $A$ if they exist, i.e., $\exp(A) = T$. We use the theory of regular Fr\'echet Lie groups to show the first main result. A positivity preserver with constant coefficients has a generator if and only if it is represented by an infinitely divisible measure (Main Theorem 4.7). In the second main result (Main Theorem 4.11) we use the L\'evy--Khinchin formula to fully characterize the generators of positivity preservers with constant coefficients.</description>
