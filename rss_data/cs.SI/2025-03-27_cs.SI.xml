      <title>Semantic Web -- A Forgotten Wave of Artificial Intelligence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The history of Artificial Intelligence is a narrative of waves - rising optimism followed by crashing disappointments. AI winters, such as the early 2000s, are often remembered as barren periods of innovation. This paper argues that such a perspective overlooks a crucial wave of AI that seems to be forgotten: the rise of the Semantic Web, which is based on knowledge representation, logic, and reasoning, and its interplay with intelligent Software Agents. Fast forward to today, and ChatGPT has reignited AI enthusiasm, built on deep learning and advanced neural models. However, before Large Language Models dominated the conversation, another ambitious vision emerged - one where AI-driven Software Agents autonomously served Web users based on a structured, machine-interpretable Web. The Semantic Web aimed to transform the World Wide Web into an ecosystem where AI could reason, understand, and act. Between 2000 and 2010, this vision sparked a significant research boom, only to fade into obscurity as AI's mainstream narrative shifted elsewhere. Today, as LLMs edge toward autonomous execution, we revisit this overlooked wave. By analyzing its academic impact through bibliometric data, we highlight the Semantic Web's role in AI history and its untapped potential for modern Software Agent development. Recognizing this forgotten chapter not only deepens our understanding of AI's cyclical evolution but also offers key insights for integrating emerging technologies.</description>

      <title>Toward a Healthier Social Media Experience: Designing 'Inspiration' and 'Reality' Modes to Enhance Digital Well-Being for Generation Z</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a dual-mode interface design concept for social media platforms aimed at reducing social comparison in health-related content among Korean MZ (Millennials and Gen-Z) users. The proposed "Inspiration" and "Reality" modes allow users to toggle between curated, idealized posts and more realistic, candid content. This approach aims to alleviate negative psychological effects, such as decreased self-esteem and body dissatisfaction. The pre-study outlines the design framework and discusses potential implications for user satisfaction, perceived authenticity, and mental well-being.</description>

      <title>SEAGET: Seasonal and Active hours guided Graph Enhanced Transformer for the next POI recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important challenges for improving personalized services in industries like tourism is predicting users' near-future movements based on prior behavior and current circumstances. Next POI (Point of Interest) recommendation is essential for helping users and service providers by providing personalized recommendations. The intricacy of this work, however, stems from the requirement to take into consideration several variables at once, such as user preferences, time contexts, and geographic locations. POI selection is also greatly influenced by elements like a POI's operational status during desired visit times, desirability for visiting during particular seasons, and its dynamic popularity over time. POI popularity is mostly determined by check-in frequency in recent studies, ignoring visitor volumes, operational constraints, and temporal dynamics. These restrictions result in recommendations that are less than ideal and do not take into account actual circumstances. We propose the Seasonal and Active hours-guided Graph-Enhanced Transformer (SEAGET) model as a solution to these problems. By integrating variations in the seasons, operational status, and temporal dynamics into a graph-enhanced transformer framework, SEAGET capitalizes on redefined POI popularity. This invention gives more accurate and context-aware next POI predictions, with potential applications for optimizing tourist experiences and enhancing location-based services in the tourism industry.</description>

      <title>A Local Perspective-based Model for Overlapping Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Community detection, which identifies densely connected node clusters with sparse between-group links, is vital for analyzing network structure and function in real-world systems. Most existing community detection methods based on GCNs primarily focus on node-level information while overlooking community-level features, leading to performance limitations on large-scale networks. To address this issue, we propose LQ-GCN, an overlapping community detection model from a local community perspective. LQ-GCN employs a Bernoulli-Poisson model to construct a community affiliation matrix and form an end-to-end detection framework. By adopting local modularity as the objective function, the model incorporates local community information to enhance the quality and accuracy of clustering results. Additionally, the conventional GCNs architecture is optimized to improve the model capability in identifying overlapping communities in large-scale networks. Experimental results demonstrate that LQ-GCN achieves up to a 33% improvement in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) and a 26.3% improvement in Recall compared to baseline models across multiple real-world benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>"Whose Side Are You On?" Estimating Ideology of Political and News Content Using Large Language Models and Few-shot Demonstration Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of social media platforms has led to concerns about radicalization, filter bubbles, and content bias. Existing approaches to classifying ideology are limited in that they require extensive human effort, the labeling of large datasets, and are not able to adapt to evolving ideological contexts. This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) for classifying the political ideology of online content in the context of the two-party US political spectrum through in-context learning (ICL). Our extensive experiments involving demonstration selection in label-balanced fashion, conducted on three datasets comprising news articles and YouTube videos, reveal that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot and traditional supervised methods. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of metadata (e.g., content source and descriptions) on ideological classification and discuss its implications. Finally, we show how providing the source for political and non-political content influences the LLM's classification.</description>

      <title>Patients Speak, AI Listens: LLM-based Analysis of Online Reviews Uncovers Key Drivers for Urgent Care Satisfaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the public experience of urgent care facilities is essential for promoting community healthcare development. Traditional survey methods often fall short due to limited scope, time, and spatial coverage. Crowdsourcing through online reviews or social media offers a valuable approach to gaining such insights. With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), extracting nuanced perceptions from reviews has become feasible. This study collects Google Maps reviews across the DMV and Florida areas and conducts prompt engineering with the GPT model to analyze the aspect-based sentiment of urgent care. We first analyze the geospatial patterns of various aspects, including interpersonal factors, operational efficiency, technical quality, finances, and facilities. Next, we determine Census Block Group(CBG)-level characteristics underpinning differences in public perception, including population density, median income, GINI Index, rent-to-income ratio, household below poverty rate, no insurance rate, and unemployment rate. Our results show that interpersonal factors and operational efficiency emerge as the strongest determinants of patient satisfaction in urgent care, while technical quality, finances, and facilities show no significant independent effects when adjusted for in multivariate models. Among socioeconomic and demographic factors, only population density demonstrates a significant but modest association with patient ratings, while the remaining factors exhibit no significant correlations. Overall, this study highlights the potential of crowdsourcing to uncover the key factors that matter to residents and provide valuable insights for stakeholders to improve public satisfaction with urgent care.</description>

      <title>Resilience and Volatility in Academic Publishing, The Case of the University of Maribor 2004-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the dynamics of academic publishing resilience and volatility at Slovenia's University of Maribor (UM) from 2004 to 2023. This period was marked by significant economic pressures and policy shifts, including changes to higher education legislation and university funding. Using UM's employment data and OpenAlex publication records, the study examines the relationship between employed researcher numbers and unique authors publishing under the UM affiliation. Despite a substantial decrease in researcher employment during the 2009-2013 economic recession and austerity phase, the number of unique authors publishing with UM affiliation surprisingly increased. This growth was driven by factors such as a shift towards project-based funding, contributions from an expanding doctoral student cohort, and increased international collaborations. Analysis of author turnover reveals a notable contrast: high short-term volatility (annual churn rates of ~40-50%) versus significant mid-term stability (5-year churn rates of ~8-10%). Survival analysis confirms this trend, showing high initial attrition among publishing authors but long-term persistence for a core group. Furthermore, co-authorship network analysis indicates the UM research network has become more resilient over time. A critical finding is a fundamental shift in network structure around 2016, transitioning from dissassortative to assortative mixing, signaling profound changes in collaboration dynamics. The findings carry implications for research policy and university management, highlighting the necessity of balancing short-term performance indicators with the long-term stability and resilience essential for a thriving research community.</description>

      <title>Behavioral response to mobile phone evacuation alerts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines behavioral responses to mobile phone evacuation alerts during the February 2024 wildfires in Valpara\'iso, Chile. Using anonymized mobile network data from 580,000 devices, we analyze population movement following emergency SMS notifications. Results reveal three key patterns: (1) initial alerts trigger immediate evacuation responses with connectivity dropping by 80\% within 1.5 hours, while subsequent messages show diminishing effects; (2) substantial evacuation also occurs in non-warned areas, indicating potential transportation congestion; (3) socioeconomic disparities exist in evacuation timing, with high-income areas evacuating faster and showing less differentiation between warned and non-warned locations. Statistical modeling demonstrates socioeconomic variations in both evacuation decision rates and recovery patterns. These findings inform emergency communication strategies for climate-driven disasters, highlighting the need for targeted alerts, socioeconomically calibrated messaging, and staged evacuation procedures to enhance public safety during crises.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM), which aims to select a set of users from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users, is an evergreen hot research topic. Its research outcomes significantly impact real-world applications such as business marketing. The booming location-based network platforms of the last decade appeal to the researchers embedding the location information into traditional IM research. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing location-driven IM studies from the perspective of the following key aspects: (1) a review of the application scenarios of these works, (2) the diffusion models to evaluate the influence propagation, and (3) a comprehensive study of the approaches to deal with the location-driven IM problems together with a particular focus on the accelerating techniques. In the end, we draw prospects into the research directions in future IM research.</description>

      <title>A Social Dynamical System for Twitter Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of public opinion is crucial for informed decision-making in various domains, particularly public affairs. The rapid growth of social networks, such as Twitter (now rebranded as X), provides an unprecedented opportunity to analyze public opinion at scale without relying on traditional surveys. With the rise of deep learning, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in modeling online opinion dynamics. Notably, classical opinion dynamics models, such as DeGroot, can be reformulated within a GNN framework.
  We introduce Latent Social Dynamical System (LSDS), a novel framework for modeling the latent dynamics of social media users' opinions based on textual content. Since expressed opinions may not fully reflect underlying beliefs, LSDS first encodes post content into latent representations. It then leverages a GraphODE framework, using a GNN-based ODE function to predict future opinions. A decoder subsequently utilizes these predicted latent opinions to perform downstream tasks, such as interaction prediction, which serve as benchmarks for model evaluation. Our framework is highly flexible, supporting various opinion dynamic models as ODE functions, provided they can be adapted into a GNN-based form. It also accommodates different encoder architectures and is compatible with diverse downstream tasks.
  To validate our approach, we constructed dynamic datasets from Twitter data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LSDS, highlighting its potential for future applications. We plan to publicly release our dataset and code upon the publication of this paper.</description>

      <title>The relevance of higher-order ties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks effectively represent complex systems with group interactions. Existing methods usually overlook the relative contribution of group interactions (hyperlinks) of different sizes to the overall network structure. Yet, this has many important applications, especially when the network has meaningful node labels. In this work, we propose a comprehensive methodology to precisely measure the contribution of different orders to the overall network structure. First, we propose the order contribution measure, which quantifies the contribution of hyperlinks of different orders to the link weights (local scale), number of triangles (mesoscale) and size of the largest connected component (global scale) of the pairwise weighted network. Second, we propose the measure of order relevance, which gives insights in how hyperlinks of different orders contribute to the considered network property. Most interestingly, it enables an assessment of whether this contribution is synergistic or redundant with respect to that of hyperlinks of other orders. Third, to account for labels, we propose a metric of label group balance to assess how hyperlinks of different orders connect label-induced groups of nodes. We applied these metrics to a large-scale board interlock network and scientific collaboration network, in which node labels correspond to geographical location of the nodes. Experiments including a comparison with randomized null models reveal how from the global level perspective, we observe synergistic contributions of orders in the board interlock network, whereas in the collaboration network there is more redundancy. The findings shed new light on social scientific debates on the role of busy directors in global business networks and the connective effects of large author teams in scientific collaboration networks.</description>

      <title>From the CDC to emerging infectious disease publics: The long-now of polarizing and complex health crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention used Twitter to share updates about the virus and safety guidelines, reaching millions instantly, in what we call the CDC public. We analyze two years of tweets, from, to, and about the CDC using a mixed-methods approach to characterize the nature and credibility of COVID-19 discourse and audience engagement. We found that the CDC is not engaging in two-way communication with the CDC publics and that discussions about COVID-19 reflected societal divisions and political polarization. We introduce a crisis message journey concept showing how the CDC public responds to the changing nature of the crisis (e.g., new variants) using ``receipts'' of earlier, and at times contradictory, guidelines. We propose design recommendations to support the CDC in tailoring messages to specific users and publics (e.g., users interested in racial equity) and in managing misinformation, especially in reaction to crisis flashpoints.</description>
