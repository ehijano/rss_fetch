      <title>On the role of interfacial stabilization in the Rayleigh-B\'enard convection of liquid-liquid dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on mesoscale lattice Boltzmann numerical simulations, we characterize the Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convective dynamics of dispersions of liquid droplets in another liquid phase. Our numerical methodology allows us to modify the droplets' interfacial properties to mimic the presence of an emulsifier (e.g., a surfactant), resulting in a positive disjoining pressure that stabilizes the droplets against coalescence. To appreciate the effects of this interfacial stabilization on the RB convective dynamics, we carry out a comparative study between a proper emulsion, i.e., a system where the stabilization mechanism is present (stabilized liquid-liquid dispersion), and a system where the stabilization mechanism is absent (non-stabilized liquid-liquid dispersion). The study is conducted by systematically changing both the volume fraction, $\phi$, and the Rayleigh number, Ra. We find that the morphology of the two systems is dramatically different due to the different interfacial properties. However, the two systems exhibit similar global heat transfer properties, expressed via the Nusselt number Nu. Significant differences in heat transfer emerge at smaller scales, which we analyze via the Nusselt number defined at mesoscales, Nu$_{\mathrm{mes}}$. In particular, stabilized systems exhibit more intense mesoscale heat flux fluctuations due to the persistence of fluid velocity fluctuations down to small scales, which are instead dissipated in the interfacial dynamics of non-stabilized dispersions. For fixed Ra, the difference in mesoscale heat flux fluctuations depends non-trivially on $\phi$, featuring a maximum in the range $0.1 &lt; \phi &lt; 0.2$. Taken all together, our results highlight the role of interfacial physics in mesoscale convective heat transfer of complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Shear-Induced Activation and Transport of Platelets in Artificial Heart Valve Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Albeit the hemodynamics of artificial heart valves has been investigated for several decades, the local shear-induced activation potential and subsequent transport phenomena of activated platelets in different valve designs, which mediate thrombosis, remains poorly understood. Here, platelet activation due to local shear stresses and the associated transport phenomena are investigated in two designs of mechanical heart valves (MHVs), namely a trileaflet MHV (TMHV) and a bileaflet MHV (BMHV) and compared against a surgical bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV) as a control. It is observed that the local activation and transport of platelets in any aortic region reach a cyclic state, with MHVs showing higher levels of both activation and transport than BHV. When integrated over the volume of the aortic sinuses and central lumen, the local activation is, respectively, 5.90 and 2.26 times higher in BMHV whereas 2.97 and 1.39 times higher in TMHV than in BHV. The washout of activated platelets from the sinuses and central lumen is, respectively, 10.40 and 2.39 times higher in BMHV while 4.90 and 1.40 times higher in TMHV compared to BHV. The low washout of sinuses in BHV is also demonstrated by higher residence time in sinuses compared to MHVs. These findings indicate that the risk of clinical thrombosis in MHVs is likely due to higher levels of local shear-induced activation than BHV despite the lower residence time (i.e. a better washout). Conversely, the subclinical thrombosis in BHVs is probably due to prolonged platelet residence time relative to MHVs.</description>

      <title>Self-Induced Flapping Dynamics of a Horizontal Flexible sheet in a Uniform Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The case of a conventional flexible sheet in a uniform flow has been of interest in understanding the underlying physics of passive coupled dynamics between a flexible structure and a flow field. Gravity is known to influence the flapping instability and post-critical dynamics. Interestingly, the flapping instability and dynamics of a thin flexible structure have been investigated either by neglecting the effects of gravity or by considering gravity along the length/span of the sheet. This study experimentally investigates the self-induced and sustained flapping dynamics of a thin flexible sheet positioned horizontally, with gravity acting along its bending direction. To explore the coupled interplay between gravitational, aerodynamic, and structural effects on the onset of instability and post-critical flapping dynamics, wind tunnel experiments are conducted across a range of physical parameters of the flexible sheet, such as its length (L), and aspect-ratio ($\AR$) for different wind speeds. To further understand the effects of gravity, the flapping behaviour of a vertically mounted flexible sheet with gravity acting along its span has been investigated, and comparisons have been drawn with its horizontal counterpart. It has been observed that gravity along the bending does not influence the onset of flapping instability. The horizontally mounted flexible structures exhibit higher flapping amplitudes and frequencies when compared to their vertical counterparts. The observations in this study have direct relevance in the field of smart propulsion and energy harvesting devices.</description>

      <title>Pinning mediated coalescence-induced lateral droplet motion on nanotextured superhydrophobic surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22547v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplets coalescing on a superhydrophobic surface exhibit coalescence-induced droplet jumping. However, water vapor condensing on a superhydrophobic surface can result in simultaneous formation of condensate droplets with two distinct wetting states, cassie state (CS) and partially wetting (PW) state. Droplets in PW state exhibit high contact angle but are connected to the substrate though a thin liquid condensate column. Coalescence between CS and PW droplets has been recently identified as a possible mechanism for generating droplets exhibiting in-plane roaming motion during dropwise condensation on nanotextured superhydrophobic surfaces. Here, we systematically investigate this phenomenon through experiments on coalescence between sessile droplets in CS and PW state on a nanostructured superhydrophobic surface endowed with a micro-scale hydrophilic spot. Here, a sessile droplet carefully placed on the hydrophilic spot simulates the PW state. Overall, our investigations demonstrate that when a CS droplet coalesces with a PW droplet pinned to a hydrophilic defect, the interaction generates substantial in-plane momentum. We find that when the coalescing CS and PW droplets are nearly of the same size and about ~3 to ~3.5 times the size of the hydrophilic spot pinning the PW droplet, the vertical momentum generation is nearly completely suppressed, and the resulting maxima in in-plane momentum results in detachment of merged droplet from hydrophilic spot and its subsequent in-plane motion.</description>

      <title>Effects of strong turbulence for water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of direct numerical simulation of plane-symmetric turbulence of water waves for potential flows within the framework of conformal variables taking into account low-frequency pumping and high-frequency viscous dissipation are presented. In this model, for a wide range of pumping amplitudes, the weak turbulence regime was not detected. It is shown that for typical turbulence parameters, the main effects are the processes of wave breaking, the formation of cusps on wave crests, which make the main contribution to the turbulence spectra with a dependence on frequency and wavenumber with the same exponent equal to $-4$. In this strongly nonlinear regime, the probability density of wave steepness at large deviations has power-law tails responsible for the intermittency of turbulence.</description>

      <title>On the impact of the turbulent grazing flow development on the acoustic response of an acoustic liner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22714v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between acoustic waves and turbulent grazing flow over an acoustic liner is investigated using Lattice-Boltzmann Very-Large-Eddy simulations. A single-degree-of-freedom liner with 11 streamwise-aligned cavities is studied in a grazing flow impedance tube. The conditions replicate reference experiments from the Federal University of Santa Catarina. The influence of grazing flow (with a centerline Mach of 0.32), acoustic wave amplitude, frequency, and propagation direction relative to the mean flow is analysed. Impedance is computed using both the in-situ and the mode-matching methods. The in-situ method reveals strong spatial variations; however, averaged values throughout the sample show minimal differences between upstream and downstream propagating waves, in contrast to the mode-matching method. Flow analyses reveal that the orifices displace the flow away from the face sheet, with this effect amplified by acoustic waves and dependent on the wave propagation direction. Consequently, the boundary layer displacement thickness (${\delta}$*) increases along the streamwise direction compared to a smooth wall and exhibits localised humps downstream of each orifice. The growth of ${\delta}$* alters the flow dynamics within the orifices by weakening the shear layer at downstream positions. This influences the acoustic-induced mass flow rate through the orifices, suggesting that acoustic energy is dissipated differently along the liner. The role of near-wall flow features highlights the need to consider a spatially evolving turbulent flow when studying the acoustic-flow interaction and measuring impedance. The spatial development of the turbulent flow may also partly explain the upstream-downstream impedance differences, as current eduction methods do not account for it.</description>

      <title>TURB-Smoke. A database of Lagrangian pollutants emitted from point-sources and dispersed in turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the location and characteristics of pollution sources in turbulent flows is challenging, especially for environmental monitoring and emergency response, due to sparse, stochastic, and infrequent cue detection. Even in idealized settings, accurately modeling these phenomena remains highly complex, with realistic representations typically achievable only through experimental or simulation-based data. We introduce TURB-Smoke, a cutting-edge numerical dataset designed for investigating odor and contaminant dispersion in turbulent environments with and without mean wind. Generated via direct numerical simulations of the fully resolved three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, TURB-Smoke tracks hundreds of millions of Lagrangian particles released from five distinct point sources in fully developed turbulence, thus providing a reliable ground-truth framework for developing and evaluating source-tracking strategies using stationary sensors or mobile agents in realistic flows. Each particle's trajectory is continuously tracked on many characteristic turbulence timescales, recording both the position and the local flow velocity. Additionally, we provide coarse-grained concentration fields in 3D and in quasi-2D slabs containing the source, ideal for quickly testing and optimizing search algorithms under varying flow conditions.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning provides a versatile suite of methods for extracting structured information from complex datasets, enabling deeper understanding of underlying fluid dynamic phenomena. The field of turbulence modeling, in particular, benefits from the growing availability of high-dimensional data obtained through experiments, field observations, and large-scale simulations spanning multiple spatio-temporal scales. This report presents a concise overview of both classical and deep learningbased approaches to turbulence modeling. It further investigates two specific challenges at the intersection of fluid dynamics and machine learning: the integration of multiscale turbulence models with deep learning architectures, and the application of deep generative models for super-resolution reconstruction</description>

      <title>Controlling Tip Vortices and Cavitation through Tip Permeability for Tidal Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blade-tip vortices can lead to wakes, cavitation and noise, and their control remains a significant challenge for tidal and wind turbines. In the present work, we propose and investigate controlling tip vortices through local permeability. Blade-resolved Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation has been employed on a model-scale horizontal-axis turbine, following a rigorous validation and verification process. The tip-speed ratio of the turbine varies from 4.52 to 7.54. The tip permeability is modelled by including a porous zone over the blade tip section, within which Darcy's law is applied. The results demonstrate that there is an optimal range of permeability, corresponding to a non-dimensional Darcy number, Da, of around 10^{-5}, that can substantially decrease the tip vortex intensity. The revealed flow physics show that the permeable tip treatment can effectively enlarge the vortex viscous core radius with little change to the vortex circulation. As the tip vortex intensity is significantly reduced, the permeable tip treatment can increase the minimal pressure-coefficient at the vortex core by up to 63%, which significantly alleviates the cavitation risk due to tip vortices. This approach has negligible influence on the turbine's energy-harvesting performance because the spanwise extent of the permeable tip treatment is only in the order of 0.1% turbine diameter. Our findings demonstrate this approach's great promise to break the upper tip-speed ratio limit capped by cavitation for tidal turbines. These will contribute to developing more efficient and resilient turbines.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of the rotational viscosity transfer across scales in Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mechanical effects that span multiple physical scales -- such as the influence of vanishing molecular viscosity on large-scale flow structures under specific conditions -- play a critical role in real fluid systems. The spin angular momentum-conserving Navier--Stokes equations offer a theoretical framework for describing such multiscale fluid dynamics by decomposing total angular momentum into bulk and intrinsic spin components. However, this framework still assumes locally non-solid rotational flows, a condition that remains empirically unverified. This study addresses such unvalidated assumptions intrinsic to the model and extends it within the framework of turbulence hierarchy theory. The theory suggests that under certain conditions, small-scale structures may transfer to larger scales through the rotational viscosity. To verify this, we conducted spectral analyses of freely decaying two-dimensional turbulence initialized with a vortex-concentrated distribution. The results indicate that rotational viscosity exhibits interscale transfer behavior, revealing a new mechanism by which order can propagate from small to large scales in Navier--Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>On physical consistency of HLL-type Riemann solvers for ideal MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate Riemann solvers are widely used for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, including those of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). However, due to the nonlinearity and complexity of MHD, obtaining accurate and robust numerical solutions to MHD equations is non-trivial, and it may be challenging for an approximate MHD Riemann solver to preserve the positivity of scalar variables, particularly when the plasma beta is low. As we have identified that the inconsistency between the numerically calculated magnetic field and magnetic energy may be responsible for the loss of positivity of scalar variables, we propose a physical consistency condition and implement it in HLL-type MHD Riemann solvers, thus alleviating the erroneous magnetic field solutions breaking scalar positivity. In addition, (I) for the HLLC-type scheme, we have designed a revised two-state approximation, specifically reducing numerical error in magnetic field solutions, and (II) for the HLLD-type scheme, we replace the constant total pressure assumption by a three-state assumption for the intermediate thermal energy, which is more consistent with our other assumptions. The proposed schemes perform better in numerical examples with low plasma \b{eta}. Moreover, we explained the energy error introduced during time integration.</description>
