      <title>A CPFSK Transceiver with Hybrid CSS-DSSS Spreading for LPWAN PHY Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) transceivers typically compromise data rates to achieve deep coverage. This paper presents a novel transceiver that achieves high receiver sensitivity and low computational complexity. At the transmitter, we replace the conventional direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) preamble with a chirp spread spectrum (CSS) preamble, consisting of a pair of down-chirp and up-chirp signals that are conjugate to each other, simplifying packet synchronization. For enhanced coverage, the payload incorporates continuous phase frequency shift keying (CPFSK) to maintain a constant envelope and phase continuity, in conjunction with DSSS to achieve a high spreading gain. At the receiver, we develop a double-peak detection method to improve synchronization and a non-coherent joint despreading and demodulation scheme that increases receiver sensitivity while maintaining simplicity in implementation. Furthermore, we optimize the preamble detection threshold and spreading sequences for maximum non-coherent receiver performance. The software-defined radio (SDR) prototype, developed using GNU Radio and USRP, along with operational snapshots, showcases its practical engineering applications. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations and field-test trials demonstrate that our transceiver outperforms traditional ones in terms of receiver sensitivity, while also being low in complexity and cost-effective for LPWAN requirements.</description>

      <title>Optimal compressed sensing for mixing stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jalali and Poor introduced an asymptotic framework for compressed sensing of stochastic processes, demonstrating that any rate strictly greater than the mean information dimension serves as an upper bound on the number of random linear measurements required for (universal) almost lossless recovery of $\psi^*$-mixing processes, as measured in the normalized $L^2$ norm. In this work, we show that if the normalized number of random linear measurements is strictly less than the mean information dimension, then almost lossless recovery of a $\psi^*$-mixing process is impossible by any sequence of decompressors. This establishes the mean information dimension as the fundamental limit for compressed sensing in this setting (and, in fact, the precise threshold for the problem). To this end, we introduce a new quantity, related to techniques from geometric measure theory: the correlation dimension rate, which is shown to be a lower bound for compressed sensing of arbitrary stationary stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Near-optimal Universal Coding of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal Coding of Integers (UCI) is suitable for discrete memoryless sources with unknown probability distributions and infinitely countable alphabet sizes. The UCI is a class of prefix codes, such that the ratio of the average codeword length to $\max\{1, H(P)\}$ is within a constant expansion factor $K_{\mathcal{C}}$ for any decreasing probability distribution $P$, where $H(P)$ is the entropy of $P$. For any UCI code $\mathcal{C}$, define \emph{the minimum expansion factor} $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ to represent the infimum of the set of extension factors of $\mathcal{C}$. Each $\mathcal{C}$ has a unique corresponding $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$, and the smaller $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ is, the better the compression performance of $\mathcal{C}$ is. A class of UCI $\mathcal{C}$ (or family $\{\mathcal{C}_i\}_{i=1}^{\infty}$) achieving the smallest $K_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ is defined as the \emph{optimal UCI}. The best result currently is that the range of $C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}$ for the optimal UCI is $2\leq C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}\leq 2.5$. In this paper, we prove that there exists a class of near-optimal UCIs, called $\nu$ code, to achieve $K_\nu=2.0386$. This narrows the range of the minimum expansion factor for optimal UCI to $2\leq C_{\mathcal{C}}^{*}\leq 2.0386$. Another new class of UCI, called $\Delta\delta$ code, is specifically constructed. We show that the $\Delta\delta$ code and $\nu$ code are currently optimal in terms of minimum expansion factor. In addition, we propose a new proof that shows the minimum expansion factor of the optimal UCI is lower bounded by $2$.</description>

      <title>Efficient DFT of Zadoff-Chu Sequences using lmFH Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Having established that Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences are inherently linear micro-frequency hopping (lmFH) symbols, this paper first presents an intuitive and visual exposition of the computation of the DFT and IDFT of ZC sequences using the lmFH pattern. This yields interesting results. Subsequently, an alternative form for computing the cumulative sum of ZC sequences using the Generalized Quadratic Gauss Sum is introduced. Furthermore, building on the micro-frequency hopping (mFH) concept, this paper shows that the DFT of ZC sequences can be transformed into an lmFH symbol with frequency shift and phase offset. Therefore, the DFT of ZC sequences can be computed via cumulative frequency points, similar to the computation of normal mFH symbols.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Networks: Stochastic Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stochastic security performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system in a downlink scenario. A base station (BS) transmits a multi-functional signal to simultaneously communicate with a user, sense a target's angular location, and counteract eavesdropping threats. The attack model considers a passive single-antenna communication eavesdropper intercepting communication data, as well as a multi-antenna sensing eavesdropper attempting to infer the target's location. We also consider a malicious target scenario where the target plays the role of the communication eavesdropper. The BS-user and BS-eavesdroppers channels follow Rayleigh fading, while the target's azimuth angle is uniformly distributed. To evaluate the performance in this random network, we derive the ergodic secrecy rate (ESR) and the ergodic Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB), for target localization, at both the BS and the sensing eavesdropper. This involves computing the probability density functions (PDFs) of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and CRB, leveraging the central limit theorem for tractability. We characterize the boundary of the CRB-secrecy rate region, and interpret the performance tradeoffs between communication and sensing while guaranteeing a level of security and privacy in the random ISAC networks.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Movable Elements of Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Enhancement of Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to exploit movable elements of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to enhance the overall performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. Firstly, focusing on a single-user scenario, we reveal the function of movable elements by performance analysis, and then design a joint beamforming and element position optimization scheme. Further, we extend it to a general multi-user scenario, and also propose an element position optimization scheme according to the derived performance expressions. Finally, simulation results confirm that the movement of IRS elements can improve the communication rate and the sensing accuracy, and especially broaden the coverage of ISAC.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Generative Semantic and Bit Communications in Satellite Networks: Trade-offs in Latency, Generation Quality, and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As satellite communications play an increasingly important role in future wireless networks, the issue of limited link budget in satellite systems has attracted significant attention in current research. Although semantic communications emerge as a promising solution to address these constraints, it introduces the challenge of increased computational resource consumption in wireless communications. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-layer hybrid bit and generative semantic communication framework which can adapt to the dynamic satellite communication networks. Furthermore, to balance the semantic communication efficiency and performance in satellite-to-ground transmissions, we introduce a novel semantic communication efficiency metric (SEM) that evaluates the trade-offs among latency, computational consumption, and semantic reconstruction quality in the proposed framework. Moreover, we utilize a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm group relative policy optimization (GRPO) to optimize the resource allocation in the proposed network. Simulation results demonstrate the flexibility of our proposed transmission framework and the effectiveness of the proposed metric SEM, illustrate the relationships among various semantic communication metrics.</description>

      <title>From Link Diversity to Cross-Band Feedback Collaboration: A New Perspective on Hybrid Optical-RF Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest a re-examination of the conventional view that hybrid optical-radio frequency (O-RF) systems are primarily diversity-driven networks that switch between RF and optical links for robustness. Instead, we uncover a new architectural opportunity: repurposing the optical downlink to enable real-time feedback channel coding over the RF uplink, where structured decoder feedback is delivered from the access point to guide the transmitter's coding strategy. This insight marks a conceptual paradigm shift from passive link diversity to active cross-band collaboration, where the wideband, interference-free optical wireless communication (OWC) is no longer merely a downlink backup but a functional enabler of uplink reliability. To realize this vision, we propose a novel architecture, O-RF with Cross-Band Feedback (O-RF-CBF), that exploits the optical downlink feedback to facilitate adaptive RF uplink coding. Numerical results reveal that O-RF-CBF achieves significant uplink throughput gains over traditional O-RF systems. Our findings highlight that inter-band synergy, not redundancy, is the key to unlocking the full potential of hybrid wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Massive MIMO SWIPT with Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the integration of beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (BDRISs) into cell free massive multiple input multiple output (CFmMIMO) systems to enhance simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). To simultaneously support two groups of users energy receivers (ERs) and information receivers (IRs) without sacrificing time frequency resources, a subset of access points (APs) is dedicated to serving ERs with the aid of a BDRIS, while the remaining APs focus on supporting IRs. A protective partial zero forcing precoding technique is implemented at the APs to manage the non coherent interference between the ERs and IRs. Subsequently, closed form expressions for the spectral efficiency of the IRs and the average sum of harvested energy at the ERs are leveraged to formulate a comprehensive optimization problem. This problem jointly optimizes the AP selection, AP power control, and scattering matrix design at the BDRIS, all based on long term statistical channel state information. This challenging problem is then effectively transformed into more tractable forms. To solve these sub problems, efficient algorithms are proposed, including a heuristic search for the scattering matrix design, as well as successive convex approximation and deep reinforcement learning methods for the joint AP mode selection and power control design. Numerical results show that a BDRIS with a group or fully connected architecture achieves significant energy harvesting gains over the conventional diagonal RIS, especially delivering up to a seven fold increase in the average sum of harvested energy when a heuristic based scattering matrix design is employed.</description>

      <title>DNN-based Methods of Jointly Sensing Number and Directions of Targets via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, the heterogeneous hybrid analog-digital H2AD MIMO architecture has been shown to own a great potential to replace the massive or extremely large-scale fully-digital MIMO in the future wireless networks to address the three challenging problems faced by the latter: high energy consumption, high circuit cost, and high complexity. However, how to intelligently sense the number and direction of multi-emitters via such a structure is still an open hard problem. To address this, we propose a two-stage sensing framework that jointly estimates the number and direction values of multiple targets. Specifically, three target number sensing methods are designed: an improved eigen-domain clustering (EDC) framework, an enhanced deep neural network (DNN) based on five key statistical features, and an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) utilizing full eigenvalues. Subsequently, a low-complexity and high-accuracy DOA estimation is achieved via the introduced online micro-clustering (OMC-DOA) method. Furthermore, we derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the H2AD under multiple-source conditions as a theoretical performance benchmark. Simulation results show that the developed three methods achieve 100\% number of targets sensing at moderate-to-high SNRs, while the improved 1D-CNN exhibits superior under extremely-low SNR conditions. The introduced OMC-DOA outperforms existing clustering and fusion-based DOA methods in multi-source environments.</description>

      <title>Improved Simulation of Asynchronous Entanglement Distribution in Noisy Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a lightweight simulation framework for evaluating asynchronous entanglement distribution protocols under realistic error models. We focus on two contemporary protocols: sequential, where entanglement is established one node at a time, and parallel, where all nodes attempt to generate entanglement simultaneously. We evaluate the performance of each protocol using two key metrics: the fidelity of distributed entangled states, and the hashing rate, a measure of entanglement efficiency. These metrics are compared between both protocols across a range of network sizes and noise parameters. We demonstrate that the parallel protocol consistently outperforms the sequential, particularly in the hashing rate metric due to reduced runtime, suggesting that parallel protocols are a strong candidate for a realizable quantum Internet. Our framework offers an accessible and scalable tool for evaluating entanglement distribution strategies, by reducing the simulation of complex quantum processes to simple memory time calculations.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomy, cyclotomic cosets and arimetic propeties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arithmetic properties of some families in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are obtained by using the cyclotomic classes of order 2 with respect to $n=p^sq^t$, where $p\equiv3 \mathrm{mod} 4$, $\gcd(\phi(p^s),\phi(q^t))=2$, $l$ is a primitive root modulo $q^t$ and $\mathrm{ord}_{p^s}(l)=\phi(p^s)/2$. The form of these cyclotomic classes enables us to further generalize the results obtained in \cite{ref1}. The explicit expressions of primitive idempotents of minimal ideals in $\frac{\mathbb{F}_l[x]}{\langle x^{p^sq^t}-1\rangle}$ are also obtained.</description>

      <title>From Timestamps to Versions: Version AoI in Single- and Multi-Hop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely and informative data dissemination in communication networks is essential for enhancing system performance and energy efficiency, as it reduces the transmission of outdated or redundant data. Timeliness metrics, such as Age of Information (AoI), effectively quantify data freshness; however, these metrics fail to account for the intrinsic informativeness of the content itself. To address this limitation, content-based metrics have been proposed that combine both timeliness and informativeness. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly focused on evaluating average metric values, leaving the complete distribution-particularly in multi-hop network scenarios-largely unexplored. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the stationary distribution of the Version Age of Information (VAoI), a content-based metric, under various scheduling policies, including randomized stationary, uniform, and threshold-based policies, with transmission constraints in single-hop and multi-hop networks. We derive closed-form expressions for the stationary distribution and average VAoI under these scheduling approaches. Furthermore, for threshold-based scheduling, we analytically determine the optimal threshold value that minimizes VAoI and derive the corresponding optimal VAoI in closed form. Numerical evaluations verify our analytical findings, providing valuable insights into leveraging VAoI in the design of efficient communication networks.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for 6G Near-Field Wireless Communications: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are expected to adopt extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs), novel antenna architectures, and operate in extremely high-frequency bands to meet growing data demands. ELAAs significantly increase the number of antennas, enabling finer spatial resolution and improved beamforming. At high frequencies, ELAAs shift communication from the conventional far-field to near-field regime, where spherical wavefronts dominate and the channel response depends on both angle and distance, increasing channel dimensionality. Conventional far-field channel estimation methods, which rely on angular information, struggle in near-field scenarios due to increased pilot overhead and computational complexity. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of recent advances in near-field channel estimation. It first defines the near- and far-field boundary from an electromagnetic perspective and discusses key propagation differences, alongside a brief review of ELAA developments. Then, it introduces mainstream near-field channel models and compares them with far-field models. Major estimation techniques are reviewed under different configurations (single/multi-user, single/multi-carrier), including both direct estimation and RIS-assisted cascaded estimation. These techniques reveal trade-offs among estimation accuracy, complexity, and overhead. This survey aims to provide insights and foundations for efficient and scalable near-field channel estimation in 6G systems, while identifying key challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of L\'evy processes and financial models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the information geometry of L\'evy processes. As a starting point, we derive the $\alpha$-divergence between two L\'evy processes. Subsequently, the Fisher information matrix and the $\alpha$-connection associated with the geometry of L\'evy processes are computed from the $\alpha$-divergence. In addition, we discuss statistical applications of this information geometry. As illustrative examples, we investigate the differential-geometric structures of various L\'evy processes relevant to financial modeling, including tempered stable processes, the CGMY model, and variance gamma processes.</description>

      <title>Cellular, Cell-less, and Everything in Between: A Unified Framework for Utility Region Analysis in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework for analyzing utility regions of wireless networks, with a focus on the signal-to-interference-noise-ratio (SINR) and achievable rate regions. The framework provides valuable insights into interference patterns of modern network architectures, such as cell-less and extremely large MIMO networks, and it generalizes existing characterizations of the weak Pareto boundary. A central contribution is the derivation of sufficient conditions that guarantee convexity of the utility regions. Convexity is an important property because it ensures that time sharing (or user grouping) cannot simultaneously increase the utility of all users when the network operates on the weak Pareto boundary. These sufficient conditions also have two key implications. First, they identify a family of (weighted) sum-rate maximization problems that are inherently convex without any variable transformations, thus paving the way for the development of efficient, provably optimal solvers for this family. Second, they provide a rigorous justification for formulating sum-rate maximization problems directly in terms of achievable rates, rather than SINR levels. Our theoretical insights also motivate an alternative to the concept of favorable propagation in the massive MIMO literature -- one that explicitly accounts for self-interference and the beamforming strategy.</description>

      <title>Graph Reconstruction from Noisy Random Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing an undirected graph $G$ on $n$ vertices given multiple random noisy subgraphs or "traces". Specifically, a trace is generated by sampling each vertex with probability $p_v$, then taking the resulting induced subgraph on the sampled vertices, and then adding noise in the form of either (a) deleting each edge in the subgraph with probability $1-p_e$, or (b) deleting each edge with probability $f_e$ and transforming a non-edge into an edge with probability $f_e$. We show that, under mild assumptions on $p_v$, $p_e$ and $f_e$, if $G$ is selected uniformly at random, then $O(p_e^{-1} p_v^{-2} \log n)$ or $O((f_e-1/2)^{-2} p_v^{-2} \log n)$ traces suffice to reconstruct $G$ with high probability. In contrast, if $G$ is arbitrary, then $\exp(\Omega(n))$ traces are necessary even when $p_v=1, p_e=1/2$.</description>

      <title>A New Upper Bound for Distributed Hypothesis Testing Using the Auxiliary Receiver Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14148v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper employs the add-and-subtract technique of the auxiliary receiver approach to establish a new upper bound for the distributed hypothesis testing problem. This new bound has fewer assumptions than the upper bound proposed by Rahman and Wagner, is at least as tight as the bound by Rahman and Wagner, and can outperform it in certain Gaussian settings. Conceptually speaking, unlike Rahman and Wagner, who view their additional receiver as side information, we view it as an auxiliary receiver and use a different manipulation for single-letterization.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Rydberg Atomic Receivers: From Quantum Physics to Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intrinsic integration of Rydberg atomic receivers into wireless communication systems is proposed, by harnessing the principles of quantum physics in wireless communications. More particularly, we conceive a pair of Rydberg atomic receivers, one incorporates a local oscillator (LO), referred to as an LO-dressed receiver, while the other operates without an LO and is termed an LO-free receiver. The appropriate wireless model is developed for each configuration, elaborating on the receiver's responses to the radio frequency (RF) signal, on the potential noise sources, and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) performance. The developed wireless model conforms to the classical RF framework, facilitating compatibility with established signal processing methodologies. Next, we investigate the associated distortion effects that might occur, specifically identifying the conditions under which distortion arises and demonstrating the boundaries of linear dynamic ranges. This provides critical insights into its practical implementations in wireless systems. Finally, extensive simulation results are provided for characterizing the performance of wireless systems, harnessing this pair of Rydberg atomic receivers. Our results demonstrate that LO-dressed systems achieve a significant SNR gain of approximately 40~50 dB over conventional RF receivers in the standard quantum limit regime. This SNR head-room translates into reduced symbol error rates, enabling efficient and reliable transmission with higher-order constellations.</description>

      <title>Totally Disjoint 3-Digit Decimal Check Digit Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1969 J. Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three versions of such a code that he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. This paper presents 3 pairwise disjoint 3-digit codes. The codes developed herein, have the property that the knowledge of the multiset of digits included in a word is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. Thus the codes are permutation-free, and this fulfills Verhoeff's desire to eliminate "cyclic errors". Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Near-Optimal Adaptive Vector Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization is a fundamental optimization for many machine-learning use cases, including compressing gradients, model weights and activations, and datasets. The most accurate form of quantization is \emph{adaptive}, where the error is minimized with respect to a given input, rather than optimizing for the worst case. However, optimal adaptive quantization methods are considered infeasible in terms of both their runtime and memory requirements.
  We revisit the Adaptive Vector Quantization (AVQ) problem and present algorithms that find optimal solutions with asymptotically improved time and space complexity. We also present an even faster near-optimal algorithm for large inputs. Our experiments show our algorithms may open the door to using AVQ more extensively in a variety of machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>Explaining vague language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why is language vague? Vagueness may be explained and rationalized if it can be shown that vague language is more useful to speaker and hearer than precise language. In a well-known paper, Lipman proposes a game-theoretic account of vagueness in terms of mixed strategy that leads to a puzzle: vagueness cannot be strictly better than precision at equilibrium. More recently, \'Egr\'e, Spector, Mortier and Verheyen have put forward a Bayesian account of vagueness establishing that using vague words can be strictly more informative than using precise words. This paper proposes to compare both results and to explain why they are not in contradiction. Lipman's definition of vagueness relies exclusively on a property of signaling strategies, without making any assumptions about the lexicon, whereas \'Egr\'e et al.'s involves a layer of semantic content. We argue that the semantic account of vagueness is needed, and more adequate and explanatory of vagueness.</description>

      <title>InfAlign: Inference-aware language model alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19792v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Language model alignment is a critical step in training modern generative language models. Alignment targets to improve win rate of a sample from the aligned model against the base model. Today, we are increasingly using inference-time algorithms (e.g., Best-of-N, controlled decoding, tree search) to decode from language models rather than standard sampling. We show that this train/test mismatch makes standard RLHF framework sub-optimal in view of such inference-time methods. To this end, we propose a framework for inference-aware alignment (InfAlign), which aims to optimize inference-time win rate of the aligned policy against the base model. We prove that for any inference-time decoding procedure, the optimal aligned policy is the solution to the standard RLHF problem with a transformation of the reward. This motivates us to provide the calibrate-and-transform RL (InfAlign-CTRL) algorithm to solve this problem, which involves a reward calibration step and a KL-regularized reward maximization step with a transformation of the calibrated reward. For best-of-N sampling and best-of-N jailbreaking, we propose specific transformations offering up to 3-8% improvement on inference-time win rates. Finally, we also show that our proposed reward calibration method is a strong baseline for optimizing standard win rate.</description>

Abstract: The syndrome decoding problem is one of the NP-complete problems lying at the foundation of code-based cryptography. The variant thereof where the distance between vectors is measured with respect to the Lee metric, rather than the more commonly used Hamming metric, has been analyzed recently in several works due to its potential relevance for building more efficient code-based cryptosystems. The purpose of this article is to present a zero-knowledge proof of knowledge for this variant of the problem.</description>

      <title>Cross-layer Integrated Sensing and Communication: A Joint Industrial and Academic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) enables radio systems to simultaneously sense and communicate with their environment. This paper, developed within the Hexa-X-II project funded by the European Union, presents a comprehensive cross-layer vision for ISAC in 6G networks, integrating insights from physical-layer design, hardware architectures, AI-driven intelligence, and protocol-level innovations. We begin by revisiting the foundational principles of ISAC, highlighting synergies and trade-offs between sensing and communication across different integration levels. Enabling technologies (such as multiband operation, massive and distributed MIMO, non-terrestrial networks, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, and machine learning) are analyzed in conjunction with hardware considerations including waveform design, synchronization, and full-duplex operation. To bridge implementation and system-level evaluation, we introduce a quantitative cross-layer framework linking design parameters to key performance and value indicators. By synthesizing perspectives from both academia and industry, this paper outlines how deeply integrated ISAC can transform 6G into a programmable and context-aware platform supporting applications from reliable wireless access to autonomous mobility and digital twinning.</description>
