      <title>Algebraic realization of stable Poincar\'e-Reeb graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of domain of finite type $\mathscr{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ generalizing an earlier work of Bodin, Popescu-Pampu and Sorea. Then, we prove that every finite graph admitting a good orientation whose vertices have degree 1 or 3 can be realized as the Poincar\'e-Reeb graph of a stable (globally) algebraic domain of finite type $\mathscr{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, for every $n\geq 2$. If in addition $n\geq 3$, we construct a class of graphs allowing vertices of degree $2$ also. Algebraic approximation techniques \`a la Nash-Tognoli and stable Morse functions are fundamental tools in our approach. In particular, the recent extensions over $\mathbb{Q}$ of such algebraic approximation techniques developed by Ghiloni and the author allow us to reduce the coefficients of the describing polynomials over $\mathbb{Q}$ and to extend our constructions over real closed fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the moduli space of \'etale Klein coverings (i.e. Galois with deck group $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$) of hyperelliptic curves of genus 3. We prove that the Prym map on each component is injective. As an application, we show that the Prym map of \'etale Klein coverings of genus 3 curves is generically finite.</description>

      <title>Picard bundles and Twisted Picard bundles on the Jacobian of a curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Y$ denote an irreducible projective curve with at most nodes as singularities and defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. We study the restriction of the twisted Picard bundles on the compactified Jacobian $\overline{J}(Y)$ of $Y$ to the embedded curve in $\overline{J}(Y)$. As an application, we show that for $g =2$ and each integer $r \ge 3$, there is a two-dimensional family of stable ACM bundles on the compactified Jacobian which has the Picard bundle in its limit. We define an embedding $\alpha_Y$ of the (generalised) Jacobian $J(Y)$ in the moduli space $U^s_Y(n,d)$ of stable vector bundles on $Y$ using a twisted restriction $E_Y$ of a Picard bundle to $Y \subset J(Y)$. We show that (under suitable conditions) the restriction of the universal bundle $\mathcal{U}$ to $Y \times J(Y)$ is stable for suitable polarisation. For the embedding of a smooth curve $Y$ given by $E_Y \otimes B, B$ a line bundle of degree $b$, we show that the restriction of the Picard bundle on $U^s_Y(n, d+nb)$ to $J(Y)$ is $\theta$-semistable for $b \ge 2g-1$ and $\theta$-stable for $b \ge 2g$. We also determine the relation between the restriction of the theta divisor on $U^s_Y(n,d+nb)$ to $J(Y)$ and the theta divisor $\theta$ on $\overline{J}(Y)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his proof of the fundamental lemma of the Langlands program, Ng\^o initiated the study of the decomposition theorem for abelian fibrations. When an abelian fibration admits a duality structure, the decomposition theorem and the perverse filtration on cohomology exhibit rich structures. The purpose of these notes is to describe a framework for dualizable abelian fibrations and to discuss some recent progress and applications.</description>

      <title>Universal extension spaces and modular maps: unveiling irreducible components of Brill-Noether loci of stable bundles on a general $\nu$-gonal curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Brill-Noether theory of rank-two, degree-$d$ stable vector bundles of speciality $3$ on a general $\nu$-gonal curve of genus $g$, $3 \leq \nu &lt; \lfloor \frac{g+3}{2} \rfloor$. Our approach leverages universal extension spaces, modular maps, and recent advancements in rank-one Brill-Noether theory over Hurwitz spaces.
  We establish existence criteria for the corresponding Brill-Noether loci and provide a comprehensive description of their irreducible components. We moreover prove that these components exhibit diverse geometric behaviors, categorized by their regularity, superabundance, and the properties of their general points. Notably, for specific degrees $d$, we prove the coexistence of multiple superabundant components alongside a regular one. Using specialization techniques, we uncover a stratification into locally closed subschemes within these components and provide insights into their birational geometry and local structure. Furthermore, our results yield also consequences for Brill-Noether loci of stable, rank-two bundles with a fixed general determinant.</description>

      <title>A cohomological interpretation for stringy Hodge numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a cohomological interpretation for Batyrev's stringy Hodge numbers in the full generality in which they are defined. In a previous paper, the second and third authors used motivic integration to define the stringy Hodge--Deligne invariant of a smooth Artin stack $\mathcal{X}$ and proved that when $\mathcal{X}$ is a crepant resolution of a variety $Y$ with log-terminal singularities, the generating function for the stringy Hodge numbers of $Y$ is equal to the stringy Hodge--Deligne invariant of $\mathcal{X}$. In this paper, we introduce a cohomology theory $H_{\mathrm{str}}^*(\mathcal{X})$ that computes the stringy Hodge--Deligne invariant of $\mathcal{X}$. Since, by previous work of the second and third authors, all varieties with log-terminal singularities admit a crepant resolution by an Artin stack, this gives a cohomological interpretation for stringy Hodge numbers of any variety with log-terminal singularities. We also show that in the special case where $\mathcal{X}$ is Deligne--Mumford, $H_{\mathrm{str}}^*(\mathcal{X})$ coincides with the orbifold cohomology of $\mathcal{X}$.</description>

      <title>Classification of double octic Calabi-Yau threefolds defined by an arrangement of eight planes II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of all arrangements of eight planes in projective threespace that give rise to double octic Calabi-Yau threefolds. Building on earlier work, we determine all 455 combinatorial types and describe the projective automorphism groups associated with each arrangement. These automorphisms allow us to identify geometrically distinguished subfamilies and elements, and to construct a rich collection of elliptic and K3 fibrations arising naturally from the singularities of the arrangements.
  As applications, we exhibit two one-parameter families of Calabi-Yau threefolds that each possess three pairwise non-equivalent maximally unipotent monodromy points-phenomena that are rare in known examples. We further construct two Calabi-Yau threefolds whose third cohomology decomposes, via complex multiplication, into complementary two-dimensional Hodge structures of types (1,0,1,0) and (0,1,0,1). This decomposition yields new instances of modularity not previously observed in the Calabi-Yau setting.</description>

      <title>Notes on rational chain connectedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Hacon--M\textsuperscript{c}Kernan's rational chain connectedness theorem to the complex analytic setting. As a consequence, we prove that the fibers of any resolution of singularities of complex analytic kawamata log terminal singularities are rationally chain connected. In contrast to the original approach, we avoid the use of extension theorems and instead rely on the minimal model program.</description>

      <title>Multigraded Hurwitz forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hurwitz form of a projective variety characterizes linear spaces of complementary dimension which meet the variety non-transversally. We extend this notion to varieties in a product of projective spaces. This parallels the multigraded Chow forms due to Osserman and Trager. We study the degrees of multigraded Hurwitz forms. An explicit degree formula is given for complete intersections. This offers a new tool for elimination theory that has many applications, ranging from Nash equilibria to Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Relevant maps and the algebraic skeleton of simplicial toric prevarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphisms between schemes arising from multigraded rings are essential for understanding geometric relationships in algebraic geometry, yet a systematic theory for such maps has been lacking. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive framework for rational maps between multigraded Proj schemes by introducing several notions of maps between their underlying multigraded rings. A key challenge is that to induce actual morphisms (rather than just rational maps), the ring homomorphism $\varphi\colon R \to S$ must hit every relevant element in $S$. To address this, we introduce the use of relevant subsets $B \subseteq S_+$ (where $S_+$ is the ideal generated by all relevant elements), $B \unlhd S$, which allow us to control this condition more flexibly.
  As an application, we show that multigraded noetherian polynomial rings naturally encode combinatorial data, giving rise to systems of fans and thus to toric prevarieties. By leveraging our notion of rational maps with those relevant subsets, we prove that the category of triples $(D, S, B)$ - where $D$ is a finitely generated abelian group, $S$ is a $D$-graded noetherian polynomial ring, and $B \unlhd S$ is a subset of $S_+$ - together with rational maps of conical rings, is anti-equivalent to the category of simplicial toric prevarieties.</description>

      <title>Explicit formulas and exact values for the number of rational points on singular curves over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide new explicit formulas for bounding the number of rational points on singular curves over finite fields. This enables us to obtain exact values of N q (g, $\pi$) which is defined as the maximum number of rational points over F q on a curve of geometric genus g and arithmetic genus $\pi$. We also give special attention to the case g = 2 in order to extend the work of Aubry and Iezzi on N q (0, $\pi$) and N q (1, $\pi$).</description>

      <title>Monodromy rank and the semisimple Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two main results concerning the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties. First, we prove the conjecture for the semisimplified $\ell$-adic Galois representations attached to hyper-K\"ahler varieties with second Betti number $b_2 \geq 4$. As a direct consequence, we deduce that the Hodge conjecture implies the Tate conjecture for powers of hyper-K\"ahler varieties. Second, we show that the Mumford-Tate conjecture for hyper-K\"ahler varieties is invariant under deformation. The proofs rely on comparing the ranks of $\ell$-adic algebraic monodromy groups in higher degrees to those in degree $2$ via the theory of Frobenius tori and the Looijenga-Lunts-Verbitsky Lie algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the values of the Siegel-Veech constants associated with saddle connections having distinct endpoints on translation surfaces in Prym eigenform loci in $\Omega \mathcal{M}_3(2,2)^{\rm odd}$. In particular, we show that these constants are actually the same for all of these loci. As a by-product, we show that the Euler characteristic of the Hilbert modular surfaces which parametrize Abelian surfaces with $(1,2)$-polarization admitting a real multiplication and the Euler characteristic of their product locus are related by a simple formula. For principally polarized Abelian surfaces, a similar phenomenon has been observed by Bainbridge.</description>

      <title>On the birational isotriviality of the Albanese morphism of a log Calabi-Yau pair with a torus action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20027v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,\Delta)$ be a projective, log canonical, $K$-trivial pair over the complex numbers. Let $Z$ be a minimal log canonical center of $(X,\Delta)$ and suppose that there exists a torus $\mathbb{T}\subseteq\operatorname{Aut}(X)$ preserving $\Delta$ and such that $\dim\mathbb{T}=\operatorname{codim}_X Z$. Then we show that two general fibers of the Albanese morphism $\operatorname{alb}_X$ are birationally equivalent. In particular, the pathological example of a projective, log canonical, $K$-trivial variety whose Albanese morphism is not generically birationally isotrivial, recently constructed by Bernasconi, Filipazzi, Patakfalvi and Tsakanikas, can be avoided under the additional hypothesis that there exists a torus of large enough dimension in the automorphism group of the given pair.</description>

      <title>Serre duality, Mukai pairing and universal Auslander--Reiten triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between Serre duality and the Mukai pairing for smooth and proper dg-algebras. We introduce an alternative definition of the Mukai pairing and prove that it coincides with the Mukai pairings defined by C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru--Willerton and by Shklyarov. Our construction places both the Mukai pairing and Serre duality within a unified framework based on an elementary pairing between Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology. As a consequence, the adjointness of the boundary--bulk and bulk--boundary maps follows naturally.
  As an application, we investigate Auslander--Reiten theory for the perfect derived category of a non-positive smooth and proper dg-algebra. We construct an exact triangle of dg-$A$-$A$-bimodules, called a universal Auslander--Reiten triangle in the sense that the derived tensor product of this triangle with an indecomposable dg-$A$-module $M$ yields an Auslander--Reiten triangle starting from $M$. In particular, this provides a functorial construction of Auslander--Reiten triangles. In the case of path algebras of quivers, our construction recovers the universal Auslander--Reiten triangle associated with quiver Heisenberg algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We geometrize the basic cohomology set $H^{1}(\text{Kal}_{F}, G)_{\text{basic}}$ for a global function field $F$. We do this by constructing a v-stack $\text{Bun}_{G,F}^{e}$ which has localization maps to Fargues' analogous stack $\text{Bun}_{G,F_{v}}^{e}$ for all places $v$ of $F$ and whose semistable locus is the disjoint union of $\text{Bun}_{G_{b},F}$ for all $b \in H^{1}(\text{Kott}_{F} \times_{F} \text{Kal}_{F},G)_{\text{basic}}$. We also prove a version of Tate-Nakayama duality for $H^{1}(\text{Kott}_{F} \times_{F} \text{Kal}_{F},G)_{\text{basic}}$, which lets us state a conjectural multiplicity formula for discrete automorphic representations of $G(\mathbb{A}_{F})$ adapted to this new cohomology set.</description>

      <title>On factorization of matrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H} = \mathcal{H}(W,S)$ be the Hecke algebra of the Coxeter system $(W,S)$ over $\mathbb{Z}[q^{\pm1}]$, where $W$ is the Weyl group of a symmetrizable Kac-Moody algebra. In this paper, we show that the matrix of Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of $\mathcal{H}$ factorizes into a product of $|S|$ many matrices, each of which has entries as polynomials in $q$ with nonnegative coefficients. To achieve this goal, we use hybrid basis $TC^J$ for $J\subseteq S$ of $\mathcal{H}$, defined by Grojnowski-Haiman. The intermediate matrices in the aforementioned factorization turn out to be the transition matrices from $TC^J$-basis to $TC^I$-basis for $I\subset J$. Equivalently, these coefficients can be computed using a natural restriction map from $\mathcal{H}$ to the parabolic Hecke algebra $\mathcal{H}_J$. Moreover, following the ideas from Grojnowski-Haiman, we also give a geometric proof of the positivity of these coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.19771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ be the Deligne--Rapoport modular stack of elliptic curves endowed with a cyclic rational $N$-isogeny over a number field $F$. Let $N\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,16,18,25\},$ which are precisely the values for which the coarse moduli space of $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{P}^1$. We show that the stacky Batyrev--Manin conjecture [DY24] holds for the naive height on $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ when $F=\mathbb{Q}$. In the process, we give a concrete description of $\mathscr{X}_0(N)$ as a square root stack over a stacky curve.</description>

      <title>On the Ramanujan Vector Field modulo $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.20109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every prime $p \geq 5$, we compute the $p$-th power of the Ramanujan vector field that arises from the differential relations discovered by Ramanujan for the Eisenstein series $E_2,E_4$ and $E_6$. Our method results in explicit equations for the $p$-th power and uses classical results of Serre and Swinnerton-Dyer about modular forms modulo $p$. From this, we verify that a general conjecture by Sheperd-Barron and Ekedahl is valid for the Ramanujan vector field. Furthermore, we consider the affine realization of a certain moduli space of elliptic curves where the Ramanujan vector field is defined, and describe - in characteristic $p$ - the locus given by supersingular elliptic curves in two ways: a classical one - using equations for the supersingular polynomial - and a new one as the singular set of some vector fields. Additionally, we prove that the Ramanujan vector field is transversal to this locus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.04787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe locally the representation varieties of fundamental groups for smooth complex varieties at representations coming from the monodromy of a variation of mixed Hodge structure. Given such a manifold $X$ and such a linear representation $\rho$ of its fundamental group $\pi_1(X,x)$, we use the theory of Goldman-Millson and pursue our previous work that combines mixed Hodge theory with derived deformation theory to construct a mixed Hodge structure on the formal local ring $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_\rho$ to the representation variety of $\pi_1(X,x)$ at $\rho$. Then we show how a weighted-homogeneous presentation of $\widehat{\mathcal{O}}_\rho$ is induced directly from a splitting of the weight filtration of its mixed Hodge structure. In this way we recover and generalize theorems of Eyssidieux-Simpson ($X$ compact) and of Kapovich-Millson ($\rho$ finite).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01670v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [CS01, Page 109] Grothendieck sketches the construction of a complex J_*(X) or commutative pro-algebraic groups, associated to a smooth variety X, and for which each J_i(X) is a product of local factors called the local generalized jacobians. The purpose of this note is to recast this construction in the setting of higher algebraic group stacks for the fppf topology. For this, we introduce a notion of algebraic homology associated to a scheme which is a universal object computing fppf cohomology with coefficients in group schemes. We endow this algebraic homology with a filtration by dimension of supports, and prove that, when X is smooth, J_*(X) appears as the E1-page of the corresponding spectral sequence. In a final part we partially extends our constructions and results over arbitrary bases.</description>

      <title>The Complete Intersection Discrepancy of a Curve II: Families of Curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16558v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study equisingularity of families of reduced curves over smooth parameter spaces of arbitrary positive dimension, using the difference between two analytic invariants of a curve singularity: the multiplicity of its Jacobian ideal and its complete intersection discrepancy. This difference provides a fiberwise multiplicity criterion for Whitney equisingularity. We prove that Whitney equisingularity (equivalently, strong simultaneous resolution) is characterized by equidimensionality of the fibers of the exceptional locus of either the relative conormal space or the relative Nash blowup. We further show that this condition is equivalent to the emptiness of the relative polar variety of smallest dimension. In addition, we establish that the Milnor number of a reduced curve is Zariski upper semicontinuous. As an application, we show that the constancy of the Milnor number in a family of reduced curves is equivalent to its topological equisingularity.</description>

Abstract: We develop foundations for abstract homotopy theory based on Grothendieck's idea of a "derivator". The theory is model-independent, and does not depend on model categories, nor on simplicial sets. It is designed to accomodate all the usual potential applications, such as e.g. enhancements for derived categories of coherent sheaves, in a way that is as close as possible to usual category theory.</description>

      <title>Complete classification of irreducible components of the Brill-Noether locus of rank-$2$ vector bundles of degree $d$ and speciality $2$ on a general $\nu$-gonal curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper replaces the previous longer version and focuses on the specialty $2$ case. More precisely, in this paper we address the Brill-Noether theory for rank-two, degree $d$ stable bundles of speciality $2$ on a general $\nu$-gonal curve $C$ of genus $g$, $3 \leq \nu &lt; \lfloor \frac{g+3}{2}\rfloor$, leveraging universal extension spaces, modular maps and recent developments in rank-one Brill-Noether theory over Hurwitz spaces on $C$.
  We completely classify the irreducible components of such Brill-Noether loci in the whole range of interest for $d$, namely $2g-2 \leq d \leq 4g-4$. Using specialization techniques, we further uncover a stratification into locally closed subsets within some of these components, and we also provide additional insight into the birational geometry and the local structure of every such a component. Our methods yield descriptions of the irreducible components of any such Brill-Noether locus and, as a by-product of our more general results, also derive interesting consequences for Brill-Noether loci of stable, rank-two bundles with a fixed general determinant, rather than fixed degree.</description>

In particular, we prove that any such covering can be reconstructed from its Prym variety, that is, the Prym-Torelli theorem holds for these coverings. We also investigate the Prym map of unramified $G$-coverings of genus 2 curves for an arbitrary abelian group $G$. We show that the generic fiber of the Prym map is finite unless $G$ is cyclic of order less than 6</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show the resolution of indeterminacy of rational maps from a regular surface to a tame stack locally of finite type over an excellent scheme. The proof uses the valuative criterion for proper tame morphisms, which was proved by Bresciani and Vistoli, together with the resolution of singularities for excellent surfaces and the root stack construction. Using Hironaka's results on the resolution of singularities over fields of characteristic zero, we extend the result to rational maps from a regular scheme of arbitrary dimension to a tame stack locally of finite type over a field of characteristic zero. We also provide a Purity Lemma for higher dimensional tame stacks, generalizing results of Abramovich, Olsson, and Vistoli, which also plays an essential role in the proof.</description>

      <title>On the algebraic $K$-theory of smooth schemes over truncated Witt vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the algebraic $K$-theory of smooth schemes over $W_n(\Bbbk)$, where $\Bbbk$ is a perfect field of characteristic $p&gt;0$. For a $p$-adic smooth scheme $X_{\centerdot}$ over $W_{\centerdot}(k)$, we introduce complexes $p^{r,m}_{r,n}\Omega^{\bullet}_{X_{\centerdot}}$ and infinitesimal motivic complexes $\mathbb{Z}_{X_n}(r)$, and for $0 \leq i \leq p-4$, we establish a Chern character isomorphism between the sheaf $\mathcal{K}_{X_n,X_{m},i}$ and the direct sum of certain cohomology sheaves of $p^{r,m}_{r,n}\Omega^{\bullet}_{X_{\centerdot}}$ with $1\leq r\leq i$. This leads to a criterion for $K$-theoretic infinitesimal deformations, which is related to Emerton's $p$-adic variational Hodge conjecture. By taking the limit $n \rightarrow \infty$ with $m=1$, we recover a theorem of Bloch, Esnault, and Kerz on continuous relative algebraic $K$-theory.
  The proof combines Brun's isomorphism relating $K$-theory to derived cyclic homology, computations of relative cyclic homology over $W(\Bbbk)$, and an analysis of multiplicative structures of the mod $p$ relative $K$-theory.</description>

Abstract: We study finite abelian groups acting on three-dimensional rationally connected varieties. We concentrate on the groups of K3 type, that is, abelian extensions by a cyclic group of groups that faithfully act on a K3 surface. In particular, if a finite abelian group faithfully acts on a threefold preserving a K3 surface (with at worst du Val singularities), then such a group is of K3 type. We prove a classification theorem for the groups of K3 type which can act on three-dimensional rationally connected varieties. We note the relation between certain groups of K3 type and K3 surfaces with higher Picard number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We list all connected components of sets of non-discriminant functions within versal deformations of all {\em parabolic} function singularities. These singularities are the second most common family of singularity classes of smooth functions after {\em simple singularities}. Thus, we prove (and improve in one particular case) the corresponding conjectures from the previous work \cite{para} with the same title. As an application, we enumerate all local Petrovskii lacunas near arbitrary parabolic singularities of wavefronts of hyperbolic PDEs. We also show that the complements of the discriminant varieties of $X_9^+$ and $P_8^1$ singularities have nontrivial one-dimensional homology groups, in contrast to all simple singularities.
  These results are applications of a general method for investigating non-singular perturbations of real function singularities. An important part of this method is a computer program that formalizes Picard--Lefschetz theory and surgeries of Morse functions.</description>

Abstract: The 121 real schemes, i.e., ambient isotopy classes, of smooth real plane algebraic curves of degree seven were classified by Viro (1984). By constructing one patchwork of the dilated triangle $7\cdot\Delta_2$ for each real scheme, we provide an explicit method for constructing polynomials realizing each real scheme. In particular, every real scheme of degree seven can be realized as a T-curve; this settles a question raised by Itenberg and Viro (1996).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute an explicit closed formula for the Hilbert polynomial of the Jacobian algebra $M(f)$ of a reduced surface $X:f=0$ in $\mathbb P^3$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of the algebra $M(f)$. When $X$ has only isolated singularities, a result by A. du Plessis and C. T. C. Wall yields new necessary condition for a set of positive integers to be the graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra of such a surface. The comparison with the plane curve case is discussed in detail and additional information is given in the case of nodal surfaces. In the final section we construct four natural Jacobian syzygies for surfaces $X$ coming from pencils of surfaces.</description>

Abstract: Constructing permutation polynomials over finite fields, particularly those with simple algebraic structure in multiple variables, is a fundamental problem with applications in cryptography and coding theory. Recently, Li and Kaleyski (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2024) generalized two sporadic quadratic APN permutations into infinite families of trivariate functions. Motivated by their work, we investigate conditions under which generalized trivariate functions fail to be permutations. We establish necessary conditions on coefficient parameters that prevent the permutation property, provide a complete computational classification for small field extensions, and prove general non-permutation results. As a key application of our algebraic geometry approach, we resolve the permutation part of a conjecture by Beierle, Carlet, Leander, and Perrin (Finite Fields Appl., 2022) regarding a related trivariate form. Specifically, we prove that for all odd characteristic-2 extension degrees $m \geq 23$, their function $C_u$ is not a permutation over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}^3$ for any $u \in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}^*$, resolving the permutation part of their conjecture for sufficiently large fields.</description>

      <title>Plabic Tangles and Cluster Promotion Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BCFW recurrence for tilings of the amplituhedron, we introduce the general framework of `plabic tangles' that utilizes plabic graphs to define rational maps between products of Grassmannians called `promotions'. The central conjecture of the paper is that promotion maps are quasi-cluster homomorphisms, which we prove for several classes of promotions. In order to define promotion maps, we utilize $m$-vector-relation configurations ($m$-VRCs) on plabic graphs. We relate $m$-VRCs to the degree (a.k.a `intersection number') of the amplituhedron map on positroid varieties and characterize all plabic trees with intersection number one and their VRCs. Finally, we show that promotion maps admit an operad structure and, supported by the class of `$4$-mass box' promotions, we point at new positivity properties for non-rational maps beyond cluster algebras. Promotion maps have important connections to the geometry and cluster structure of the amplituhedron and singularities of scattering amplitudes in planar $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Non-negative polynomials without hyperbolic certificates of non-negativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the relationship between the set of all non-negative multivariate homogeneous polynomials and those, which we call hyperwrons, whose non-negativity can be deduced from an identity involving the Wronskians of hyperbolic polynomials. We give a sufficient condition on positive integers $m$ and $2y$ such that there are non-negative polynomials of degree $2y$ in $m$ variables that are not hyperwrons. Furthermore, we give an explicit example of a non-negative quartic form that is not a sum of hyperwrons. We partially extend our results to hyperzouts, which are polynomials whose non-negativity can be deduced from an identity involving the B\'ezoutians of hyperbolic polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Beilinson-Bloch conjecture for some non-isotrivial varieties over global function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Beilinson--Bloch conjecture is a generalization of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, which relates the ranks of Chow groups of smooth projective varieties over global fields to the order of vanishing of $L$-functions. We prove the conjecture for certain classes of non-isotrivial varieties over $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, including some cubic threefolds and fivefolds. We deduce the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for their intermediate Jacobians, and use it to establish new cases of the Tate conjecture over finite fields. We also prove further results on the arithmetic of these intermediate Jacobians. To that end, we show that a few classes of varieties over an arbitrary field have motive of abelian type, generalizing previously known examples over the complex numbers.</description>

      <title>On the Classification of Dillon's APN Hexanomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01003v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically analyze a class of hexanomial functions over finite fields of characteristic $2$ proposed by Dillon (2006) as candidates for almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions, significantly extending earlier partial-APN results. For functions over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $q=2^n$, of the form \[ F(x)=x(Ax^2+Bx^q+Cx^{2q})+x^2(Dx^q+Ex^{2q})+x^{3q}, \] we derive necessary conditions on the coefficients $A,B,C,D,E$ for APNness using algebraic number theory and algebraic-geometry methods over finite fields.
  Our main contribution is a comprehensive case-by-case analysis that excludes large classes of Dillon hexanomials via vanishing patterns of key coefficient polynomials. We identify algebraic obstructions -- including absolutely irreducible components of associated varieties and degree incompatibilities in polynomial factorizations -- that prevent these functions from attaining optimal differential uniformity. These results substantially narrow the search space for new APN functions in this family and provide a framework applicable to other APN candidates.
  We complement the theory with extensive computations: exhaustive searches over $\mathbb{F}_{2^2}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^4}$, and random sampling over $\mathbb{F}_{2^6}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{2^8}$, yielding hundreds of APN hexanomials. Complete CCZ-equivalence testing shows that, although many examples occur, they fall into few distinct classes. For $q\in\{2,4\}$, all examples are CCZ-equivalent to the Budaghyan--Carlet family, while in larger dimensions none appear equivalent to that family.</description>

      <title>Manin's conjecture for $\mathcal{M}$-points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07654v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a general quantitative study of sets of $\mathcal{M}$-points, which are special subsets of rational points, generalizing Campana points, Darmon points, and squarefree solutions of Diophantine equations. We propose an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on rationally connected varieties, extending Manin's conjecture as well as its generalization to Campana points by Pieropan, Smeets, Tanimoto and V\'arilly-Alvarado. Finally, we show that the conjecture explains several previously established results in arithmetic statistics.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish an asymptotic formula for the number of $\mathcal{M}$-points of bounded height on split toric varieties, for the height induced by any big and nef divisor class. This formula establishes new cases of the extension of Manin's conjecture to $\mathcal{M}$-points, as introduced by the author. As a special case of our result, we strengthen the results obtained by Pieropan and Schindler on Campana points of bounded height on toric varieties. As another special case, we obtain an asymptotic for the number of weak Campana points of bounded height, which is novel even for projective space. We illustrate this result by giving an asymptotic for the number of points on projective space of bounded height for which the product of coordinates is powerful.
  Finally, we derive an asymptotic for the number of rational points in the image of a toric rational map, in the spirit of the Loughran-Smeets conjecture.</description>

      <title>Center-freeness of finite-step solvable groups arising from anabelian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anabelian geometry suggests that, for suitably geometric objects, their \'etale fundamental groups determine the geometric objects up to isomorphism. From a group-theoretic viewpoint, this philosophy requires rigidity properties, which often follow from their center-freeness of the associated \'etale fundamental groups. In fact, some profinite groups arising from anabelian geometry are center-free. For any integer $m\geq 2$, we investigate how such center-freeness behaves under passage to the maximal $m$-step solvable quotients. In particular, we show that the maximal $m$-step solvable quotients of the \'etale and tame fundamental groups of a hyperbolic curve over a separably closed field are torsion-free and center-free. Furthermore, we show that this implies the rigidity property of the $m$-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture.</description>
