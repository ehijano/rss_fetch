      <title>Engaging young people for a more inclusive national energy transition: A participatory modelling framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Participatory research in energy system modelling can generate bottom-up knowledge to explore co-designed future net-zero energy system scenarios. However, it often fails to facilitate collective learning, explore explicitly informed perspectives, and frequently ignores underrepresented groups like youth, among whom distrust about the energy transformation process is growing. By modifying a national electricity system model to reflect young people's socio-techno-environmental insights gathered through school workshops, this study presents a framework for envisioning future net-zero power systems in Norway. Given pupil priorities regarding certain power system aspects and their cumulative impact, substantial shifts occur in national renewable capacity potentials (approximately plus or minus 50%), system costs (-7% to +25%), technology mixes (notably onshore wind from 40% to 0%), transmission capacities (near doubling), and regional equity assessments. We find that costly youth-driven system designs do not necessarily guarantee equitable systems. Although applied to young people in Norway, the proposed workshop-informed modelling framework serves as a tool to meaningfully engage diverse groups and capture their perspectives, thereby further democratising energy system planning. The approach is expected to help address social acceptance challenges through enhanced understanding of trade-offs in the energy transformation process.</description>

      <title>Trust@Health: A Trust-Based Multilayered Network for Scalable Healthcare Service Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the intricate relationships within healthcare systems, focusing on interactions among doctors, departments, and hospitals. Leveraging an evolutionary graph framework, the proposed model emphasizes both intra-layer and inter-layer trust relationships to better understand and optimize healthcare services. The trust-based network facilitates the identification of key healthcare entities by integrating their social and professional interactions, culminating in a trust-based algorithm that quantifies the importance of these entities. Validation with a real-world dataset reveals a strong correlation (0.91) between the proposed trust measures and the ratings of hospitals and departments, though doctor ratings demonstrate skewed distributions due to potential biases. By modeling these relationships and trust dynamics, the framework supports scalable healthcare infrastructure, enabling effective patient referrals, personalized recommendations, and enhanced decision-making pathways.</description>

      <title>Urban Sprawl Is Associated with Reduced Access and Increased Costs of Water and Sanitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many cities are expanding in areas with scarce rainfall and limited water retention capacity, and are also becoming elongated and sprawled, making it harder to deliver services. This study quantifies the impact of urban form on access to water. We craft comparable urban forms for over 100 cities in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. For each city, we analyse the distance to the centre, one of the most critical features of cities. We introduce two metrics: remoteness, which quantifies the distance of any location to the city centre, and sparseness, a population-weighted average of all locations. We find that less remote areas have higher average income, are closer to critical infrastructure and have higher access to sewage and piped water. Sparser cities have higher water tariffs, lower proximity to critical infrastructure, and lower access to sewage and piped water. Finally, we model urban expansion under three scenarios: compact, persistent, and horizontal growth. When cities expand through compact growth rather than horizontal expansion, 220 million more people could gain access to piped water, and 190 million more to sewage services.</description>

      <title>Continuing progress toward fusion energy breakeven and gain as measured against the Lawson criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03834v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is an update to our earlier paper ''Progress toward fusion energy breakeven and gain as measured against the Lawson criterion'' [Phys. Plasmas 29, 062103 (2022)]. Plots of Lawson parameter and triple product vs. ion temperature and triple product vs. date achieved are updated with recently published experimental results. A new plot of scientific energy gain vs. date achieved is included. Additionally, notes on new experimental results, clarifications, and a correction are included.</description>
