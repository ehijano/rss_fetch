      <title>Sharp Estimates for Large N Weingarten Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weingarten functions provide a tool for computing Haar measure matrix integrals of polynomials in the matrix entries. An important property of Weingarten functions, is their particularly simple large $N$ limits. In 2017 Benoit Collins and Sho Matsumoto studied when this limit holds for Weingarten functions associated to integrals of products of $2n$ matrix entries, as $n \to \infty$, together with the matrix size $N$. They showed that the large $N$ limit is uniformly achieved as long as $n=o(N^{4/7})$, a result which already has applications to strong asymptotic freeness. However, their result is not optimal. They conjectured that their result should actually hold up to $n=o(N^{2/3})$ which is optimal. We prove this conjecture for the matrix groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{Sp}(N)\}$. The proof proceeds by introducing a Markov process on permutations (pairings) which we call the unitary (orthogonal) \textit{Weingarten process}. We believe this process may have further applications to the theory of Weingarten functions. We also prove two new bounds regarding the large $N$ limit of the Weingarten function in the regimes when $n=o(N^{4/5})$, and $n=o(N)$.</description>

      <title>On empty balls of critical 2-dimensional branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\{Z_n\}_{n\geq 0 }$ be a critical $d$-dimensional branching random walk started from a Poisson random measure whose intensity measure is the Lebesugue measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Denote by $R_n:=\sup\{u&gt;0:Z_n(\{x\in\mathbb{R}^d:|x|&lt;u\})=0\}$ the radius of the largest empty ball centered at the origin of $Z_n$. In \cite{reves02} , R\'ev\'esz shows that if $d=1$, then $R_n/n$ converges in law to an exponential distribution as $n\to\infty$. Moreover, R\'ev\'esz (2002) conjectured that
  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{R_n}{\sqrt n}\overset{\text{law}}=\text{non-degenerate~for~} d=2,\lim_{n\to\infty}{R_n}\overset{\text{law}}=\text{non-degenerate~for~} d\geq3.$$ Later, Hu (2005) \cite{hu05} confirmed the case of $d\geq3$. In this work, we have completely confirmed the case of $d=2$. It turns out that the limit distribution can be precisely characterized through the super-Brownian motion. Moreover, we also give complete results of the branching random walk without finite second moment. As a by-product, this article also improves the assumption of maximal displacements of branching random walks \cite[Theorem 1]{lalley2015} to optimal.</description>

      <title>Entropic Selection Principle for Monge's Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the small regularization limit of entropic optimal transport when the cost function is the Euclidean distance in dimensions $d &gt; 1$, and the marginal measures are absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. Our results establish that the limiting optimal transport plan is supported on transport rays. Furthermore, within each transport ray, the limiting transport plan uniquely minimizes a relative entropy functional with respect to specific reference measures supported on the rays. This provides a complete and unique characterization of the limiting transport plan. While similar results have been obtained for $d = 1$ in \cite{Marino} and for discrete measures in \cite{peyr\'e2020computationaloptimaltransport}, this work resolves the previously open case in higher dimensions $d&gt;1.$</description>

      <title>Heavy traffic limit with discontinuous coefficients via a non-standard semimartingale decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a single server queue in heavy traffic, with general inter-arrival and service time distributions, where arrival and service rates vary discontinuously as a function of the (diffusively scaled) queue length. It is proved that the weak limit is given by the unique-in-law solution to a stochastic differential equation in $[0,\infty)$ with discontinuous drift and diffusion coefficients. The main tool is a semimartingale decomposition for point processes introduced in \cite{dal-miy}, which is distinct from the Doob-Meyer decomposition of a counting process. Whereas the use of this tool is demonstrated here for a particular model, we believe it may be useful for investigating the scaling limits of queueing models very broadly.</description>

      <title>Friedman vs P\'olya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose an urn contains initially any number of balls of two colours. One ball is drawn randomly and then put back with $\alpha$ balls of the same colour and $\beta$ balls of the opposite colour. Both cases, $\beta=0$ and $\beta&gt;0$ are well known and correspond respectively to P\'olya's and Friedman's replacement schemes. We consider a mixture of both: with probability $p\in(0,1]$ balls are replaced according to Friedman's recipe and with probability $1-p$ to the one by P\'olya. Independently of the initial urn composition and independently of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and the value of $p&gt;0$, we show that the proportion of balls of one colour converges almost surely to $\frac12$. The latter is the limit behaviour obtained by using Friedman's scheme alone, i.e. when $p=1$. Our result follows by adapting an argument due to D. S. Ornstein.</description>

      <title>Random matrices acting on sets: Independent columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study random matrices with independent subgaussian columns. Assuming each column has a fixed Euclidean norm, we establish conditions under which such matrices act as near-isometries when restricted to a given subset of their domain. We show that, with high probability, the maximum distortion caused by such a matrix is proportional to the Gaussian complexity of the subset, scaled by the subgaussian norm of the matrix columns. This linear dependence on the subgaussian norm is a new phenomenon, as random matrices with independent rows or independent entries typically exhibit superlinear dependence. As a consequence, normalizing the columns of random sparse matrices leads to stronger embedding guarantees.</description>

      <title>The Kelly Criterion And Utility Function Optimisation For Stochastic Binary Games: Submartingale And Supermartingale Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reformulation of the Kelly Criterion is presented. Let $\mathfrak{G}$ be a generic stochastic Bernoulli binary game with outcomes $\mathscr{Z}(I)\in\lbrace -1,1\rbrace$ of N trials for $I=1...N$. The binomial probabilities are $\mathsf{P}(\mathscr{Z}(I)=1)=p$ and ${\mathsf{P}}(\mathscr{Z}(I)=-1)=q$ with $p+q=1$. For a fair game $p=q=\tfrac{1}{2}$ and for a biased game $p&gt;q$. If $\mathscr{W}(0)$ is the initial wealth then at the $I^{th}$ trial one bets a fraction $\mathcal{F}$ so that the bet is $B(I)=\mathcal{F}\mathscr{W}(I-1)$. If one wagers $B(I)$ and wins one recovers the original wager plus $B(I)$ if $\mathscr{Z}(I)=+1$, or a loss of $B(I)$ if $\mathscr{Z}(I)=-1$. The wealth at the $N^{th}$ trial/bet for large $N$ is the random walk $\mathscr{W}(N)=\mathscr{W} (0)+\sum_{I=1}^{N}B(I)\mathscr{Z}(I)=\mathscr{W}(0)\prod_{I=1}^{N}(1+\mathcal{F}\mathscr{Z}(I))$ with expectation $\mathsf{E}[\mathscr{W}(N)]$. Defining a 'utility function' $\mathsf{U}(\mathcal{F},p)=\mathsf{E}[\log(\mathscr{W}(N)/\mathscr{W}(0))^{1/N}]$ then $\mathsf{U}(\mathcal{F},p)$ is optimised by the Kelly fraction $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_{K}=p-q=2p-1$, which is essentially a critical point of $\mathsf{U}(\mathcal{F},p)$. Also $\mathsf{U}(\mathcal{F}_{K},p)$ can be related to the Shannon entropy. If $[0,1]=[0,\mathcal{F}_{*})\bigcup [\mathcal{F}_{*}]\bigcup (\mathcal{F}_{*},1]$ with $\mathsf{U}(\mathcal{F}_{*},p)=0$ then $\mathsf{U}(\mathcal{F},p)&gt;0, \forall\mathcal{F}\in[0,\mathcal{F}_{*})$ and $\mathscr{W}(N)$ is a submartingale for $p&gt;1/2$; also $\mathsf{U}(\mathcal{F},p)&lt;0,\forall \mathcal{F}\in(\mathcal{F}_{*},1]$, and $\mathscr{W}(\mathcal{F},p)$ is a supermartingale. Estimates are derived for variance and volatility $\mathsf{VAR}(\mathscr{W}(N))$ and $\sigma(\mathscr{W}(N))=\sqrt{\mathsf{VAR}(\mathscr{W}(N)})$. For large $N$ and $\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_{K}$, $\mathsf{E}[\mathscr{W}(N)]$ grows exponentially.</description>

      <title>Sharp Concentration of Simple Random Tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes sharp dimension-free concentration inequalities and expectation bounds for the deviation of the sum of simple random tensors from its expectation. As part of our analysis, we use generic chaining techniques to obtain a sharp high-probability upper bound on the suprema of multi-product empirical processes. In so doing, we generalize classical results for quadratic and product empirical processes to higher-order settings.</description>

      <title>Conformal welding and the matter--Liouville--ghost factorisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the action of local conformal transformations on several measures related to the Gaussian free field and Schramm--Loewner evolutions. The main novelty of our work is a Cameron--Martin-type formula for the welding homeomorphism of the SLE loop measure ($\kappa\in(0,4]$); its proof relies on a rigorous interpretation (and computation) of the "Jacobian" of the conformal welding map, which we relate to the "$bc$-ghost system" from bosonic string theory. We also give an intrinsic definition of the trace of the GFF on SLE, and prove a characterisation of the free boundary GFF in $\mathbb{D}$. As an application, we introduce a new and intrinsic approach to the conformal welding of quantum surfaces.</description>

      <title>Transition energy fields in the method of correlation equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the well-known method of correlation equations for constructing Gibbs measures is generalized based on the concept of the transition energy field. Using the properties of transition energies, we obtain the system of correlation equations for lattice systems with finite spin space. It is shown that for a sufficiently small value of the one-point transition energies, the corresponding system of correlation functions, considered in infinite space, has a solution which is unique. Finally, the convergence of finite-volume correlation functions to the limiting correlation function is shown.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits for Exponential Hedging in the Brownian Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider scaling limits of exponential utility indifference prices for European contingent claims in the Bachelier model. We show that the scaling limit can be represented in terms of the \emph{specific relative entropy}, and in addition we construct asymptotic optimal hedging strategies. To prove the upper bound for the limit, we formulate the dual problem as a stochastic control, and show there exists a classical solution to its HJB equation. The proof for the lower bound relies on the duality result for exponential hedging in discrete time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A rooted network consists of a connected, locally finite graph G, equipped with edge conductances and a distinguished vertex o. A nonnegative function on the vertices of G which vanishes at o, has Laplacian 1 at o, and is harmonic at all other vertices is called a potential. We prove that every infinite recurrent rooted network admits a potential tending to infinity. This is an analogue of classical theorems due to Evans and Nakai in the settings of Euclidean domains and Riemannian surfaces.</description>

      <title>Singular diffusion limit of a tagged particle in zero range processes with Sinai-type random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a singular diffusion limit for the position of a tagged particle in zero range interacting particle processes on a one dimensional torus with a Sinai-type random environment via two steps. In the first step, a regularization is introduced by averaging the random environment over an $\varepsilon N$-neighborhood. With respect to such an environment, the microscopic drift of the tagged particle is in form $\frac{1}{N}W_\varepsilon'$, where $W_\varepsilon'$ is a regularized White noise. Scaling diffusively, we find the nonequilibrium limit of the tagged particle $x^\varepsilon_t$ is the unique weak solution of $d x_t^{\varepsilon} = 2\frac{\Phi(\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^{\varepsilon}))}{\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^\varepsilon)} \,W_{\varepsilon}'(x_t^\varepsilon) + \sqrt{\frac{\Phi(\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^\varepsilon))}{\rho^{\varepsilon}(t, x_t^\varepsilon)}} \,dB_t$, in terms of the hydrodynamic mass density $\rho^\varepsilon$ recently identified and homogenized interaction rate $\Phi$.
  In the second step, we show that $x^\varepsilon$, as $\varepsilon$ vanishes, converges in law to the diffusion $x^0$ described informally by $d x_t^0 = 2\frac{\Phi(\rho^{0}(t, x_t^{0}))}{\rho^{0}(t, x_t^0)} \,W'(x_t^0) + \sqrt{\frac{\Phi(\rho^{0}(t, x_t^0))}{\rho^{0}(t, x_t^0)}} \,dB_t$, where $W'$ is a spatial White noise and $\rho^0$ is the para-controlled limit of $\rho^\varepsilon$ also recently identified, solving the singular PDE $ \partial_t \rho^0 = \frac{1}{2}\Delta \Phi(\rho^0) - 2\nabla \big(W' \Phi(\rho^0)\big)$.</description>

      <title>Invariance principle for the Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos via a high dimensional CLT with low rank increments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) is a canonical random fractal measure obtained by exponentiating log-correlated Gaussian processes, first constructed in the seminal work of Kahane (1985). Since then it has served as an important building block in constructions of quantum field theories and Liouville quantum gravity. However, in many natural settings, non-Gaussian log-correlated processes arise. In this paper, we investigate the universality of GMC through an invariance principle. We consider the model of a random Fourier series, a process known to be log-correlated. While the Gaussian Fourier series has been a classical object of study, recently, the non-Gaussian counterpart was investigated and the associated multiplicative chaos constructed by Junnila in 2016. We show that the Gaussian and non-Gaussian variables can be coupled so that the associated chaos measures are almost surely mutually absolutely continuous throughout the entire sub-critical regime. This solves the main open problem from Kim and Kriechbaum (2024) who had earlier established such a result for a part of the regime. The main ingredient is a new high dimensional CLT for a sum of independent (but not i.i.d.) random vectors belonging to rank one subspaces with error bounds involving the isotropic properties of the covariance matrix of the sum, which we expect will find other applications. The proof relies on a path-wise analysis of Skorokhod embeddings as well as a perturbative result about square roots of positive semi-definite matrices which, surprisingly, appears to be new.</description>

Abstract: We study a one-dimensional gas of $n$ charged particles confined by a potential and interacting through the Riesz potential or a more general potential. In equilibrium, and for symmetric potential the particles arrange themselves symmetrically around the origin within a finite region. Various models will be studied by modifying both the confining potential and the interaction potential. Focusing on the statistical properties of the system, we analyze the position of the rightmost particle, $x_{\text{max}}$, and show that its typical fluctuations are described by a limiting distribution different from the Tracy-Widom distribution found in the one-dimensional log-gas. We also derive the large deviation functions governing the atypical fluctuations of $x_{\text{max}}$ far from its mean.</description>

      <title>A Generalisation of Ville's Inequality to Monotonic Lower Bounds and Thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Essentially all anytime-valid methods hinge on Ville's inequality to gain validity across time without incurring a union bound. Ville's inequality is a proper generalisation of Markov's inequality. It states that a non-negative supermartingale will only ever reach a multiple of its initial value with small probability. In the classic rendering both the lower bound (of zero) and the threshold are constant in time. We generalise both to monotonic curves. That is, we bound the probability that a supermartingale which remains above a given decreasing curve exceeds a given increasing threshold curve. We show our bound is tight by exhibiting a supermartingale for which the bound is an equality. Using our generalisation, we derive a clean finite-time version of the law of the iterated logarithm.</description>

      <title>The Lov\'asz number of random circulant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the behavior of the Lov\'asz number for dense random circulant graphs. The Lov\'asz number is a well-known semidefinite programming upper bound on the independence number. Circulant graphs, an example of a Cayley graph, are highly structured vertex-transitive graphs on integers modulo $n$, where the connectivity of pairs of vertices depends only on the difference between their labels. While for random circulant graphs the asymptotics of fundamental quantities such as the clique and the chromatic number are well-understood, characterizing the exact behavior of the Lov\'asz number remains open. In this work, we provide upper and lower bounds on the expected value of the Lov\'asz number and show that it scales as the square root of the number of vertices, up to a log log factor. Our proof relies on a reduction of the semidefinite program formulation of the Lov\'asz number to a linear program with random objective and constraints via diagonalization of the adjacency matrix of a circulant graph by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT). This leads to a problem about controlling the norms of vectors with sparse Fourier coefficients, which we study using results on the restricted isometry property of subsampled DFT matrices.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic construction of the $\mathbb{H}^3$-Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory and correspondence with Liouville theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) models are among the most basic and most studied Conformal Field Theories (CFT). They have had a huge influence not only in physics but also in mathematics, in representation theory and geometry. However their rigorous probabilistic construction and analysis starting from the path integral is still missing and all their properties have been obtained algebraically from their postulated affine Lie algebra symmetry. Initially considered as taking values in a compact semisimple Lie Group G, the WZW model also has a "dual" formulation where the group $G$ is replaced by the homogenous space $G^{\mathbb{C}}/G$, where $G^{\mathbb{C}}$ is the complexification of $G$, and it has been argued that the former can be (re-)constructed from the latter. For $G={\rm SU}(2)$, the space ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/{\rm SU}(2)$ can be identified with the three dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^3$ and, in physics, the corresponding CFT has been studied as the simplest example of the AdS/CFT correspondence. A surprising correspondence between the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW CFT and the Liouville CFT was found by Ribault and Teschner and later generalised by Hikida and Shomerus. This correspondence has been dubbed by Gaiotto-Teschner as the "quantum analytic Langlands correspondence" since the analytic Langlands correspondence of Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan seems to emerge in its formal semi classical limit. In this paper we give a rigorous construction of the path integral for the $\mathbb{H}^3$-WZW model on a closed Riemann surface $\Sigma$, twisted by an arbitrary smooth gauge field on $\Sigma$. Using the probabilistic path integral we prove a correspondence between the correlation functions of the primary fields of the $\mathbb{H}^3$ model and those of Liouville CFT extending the expressions proposed by Ribault-Teschner and by Hikida-Schomerus to this general setup.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a martingale-based approach to constructing decision trees that efficiently approximate a target variable through recursive conditioning. We introduce MinimaxSplit, a novel splitting criterion that minimizes the worst-case variance at each step, and analyze its cyclic variant, proving an exponential error decay rate under mild conditions. Our analysis builds upon partition-based martingale approximations, providing new insights into their convergence behavior. Unlike traditional variance-based methods, MinimaxSplit avoids end-cut preference and performs well in noisy settings. We derive empirical risk bounds and also explore its integration into random forests.</description>

Abstract: In 2014, during a study on the connectivity structures of quantum entanglement, I specifically introduced the notion of ''the connectivity structure of a family of random variables'' -- a structure that expresses the dependency relations between the variables in question -- and I stated the following proposition, which can be described as Brunnian in reference to Hermann Brunn's work on links (1892) : "Every finite connectivity structure is that of a family of random variables". At the time, however, I neglected to write down the proof of this assertion, merely providing an intuitive idea of it. The purpose of this article is to present such a proof.</description>

      <title>The feasibility of multi-graph alignment: a Bayesian approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish thresholds for the feasibility of random multi-graph alignment in two models. In the Gaussian model, we demonstrate an "all-or-nothing" phenomenon: above a critical threshold, exact alignment is achievable with high probability, while below it, even partial alignment is statistically impossible. In the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, we rigorously identify a threshold below which no meaningful partial alignment is possible and conjecture that above this threshold, partial alignment can be achieved. To prove these results, we develop a general Bayesian estimation framework over metric spaces, which provides insight into a broader class of high-dimensional statistical problems.</description>

Abstract: Conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis for certain Dedekind zeta functions, we show that the characteristic polynomial of a class of random tridiagonal matrices of large dimension is irreducible, with probability exponentially close to one; moreover, its Galois group over the rational numbers is either the symmetric or the alternating group. This is the counterpart of the results of Breuillard--Varj\'u (for polynomials with independent coefficients), and with those of Eberhard and Ferber--Jain--Sah--Sawhney (for full random matrices). We also analyse a related class of random tridiagonal matrices for which the Galois group is much smaller.</description>

      <title>On a class of high dimensional linear regression methods with debiasing and thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a unified framework, inspired by classical regularization theory, for designing and analyzing a broad class of linear regression approaches. Our framework encompasses traditional methods like least squares regression and Ridge regression, as well as innovative techniques, including seven novel regression methods such as Landweber and Showalter regressions. Within this framework, we further propose a class of debiased and thresholded regression methods to promote feature selection, particularly in terms of sparsity. These methods may offer advantages over conventional regression techniques, including Lasso, due to their ease of computation via a closed-form expression. Theoretically, we establish consistency results and Gaussian approximation theorems for this new class of regularization methods. Extensive numerical simulations further demonstrate that the debiased and thresholded counterparts of linear regression methods exhibit favorable finite sample performance and may be preferable in certain settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by parallels between mean field games and random matrix theory, we develop stochastic optimal control problems and viscosity solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the setting of non-commutative variables. Rather than real vectors, the inputs to the equation are tuples of self-adjoint operators from a tracial von Neumann algebra. The individual noise from mean field games is replaced by a free semi-circular Brownian motion, which describes the large-$n$ limit of Brownian motion on the space of self-adjoint matrices. We introduce a classical common noise from mean field games into the non-commutative setting as well, allowing the problems to combine both classical and non-commutative randomness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we continue to rigorously establish the predictions in ground breaking work in statistical physics by Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborov\'a (2011) regarding the block model, in particular in the case of $q=3$ and $q=4$ communities.
  We prove that for $q=3$ and $q=4$ there is no computational-statistical gap if the average degree is above some constant by showing it is information theoretically impossible to detect below the Kesten-Stigum bound. The proof is based on showing that for the broadcast process on Galton-Watson trees, reconstruction is impossible for $q=3$ and $q=4$ if the average degree is sufficiently large. This improves on the result of Sly (2009), who proved similar results for regular trees for $q=3$. Our analysis of the critical case $q=4$ provides a detailed picture showing that the tightness of the Kesten-Stigum bound in the antiferromagnetic case depends on the average degree of the tree. We also prove that for $q\geq 5$, the Kestin-Stigum bound is not sharp.
  Our results prove conjectures of Decelle, Krzakala, Moore, Zdeborov\'a (2011), Moore (2017), Abbe and Sandon (2018) and Ricci-Tersenghi, Semerjian, and Zdeborov\'a (2019). Our proofs are based on a new general coupling of the tree and graph processes and on a refined analysis of the broadcast process on the tree.</description>

Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a Borel probability measure on a $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 1$, with a compact support, and let $(p_0, p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_N)$ be a probability vector with $p_j&gt;0$ for $0\leq j\leq N$. Let $\{S_j: 1\leq j\leq N\}$ be a set of contractive mappings on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Then, a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb R^d$ such that $\mu=\sum_{j=1}^N p_j\mu\circ S_j^{-1}+p_0\nu$ is called an inhomogeneous measure, also known as a condensation measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. For a given $r\in (0, +\infty)$, the quantization dimension of order $r$, if it exists, denoted by $D_r(\mu)$, of a Borel probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ represents the speed at which the $n$th quantization error of order $r$ approaches to zero as the number of elements $n$ in an optimal set of $n$-means for $\mu$ tends to infinity. In this paper, we investigate the quantization dimension for such a condensation measure.</description>

      <title>Local geometry of NAE-SAT solutions in the condensation regime</title>

Abstract: The local behavior of typical solutions of random constraint satisfaction problems (CSP) describes many important phenomena including clustering thresholds, decay of correlations, and the behavior of message passing algorithms. When the constraint density is low, studying the planted model is a powerful technique for determining this local behavior which in many examples has a simple Markovian structure. The work of Coja-Oghlan, Kapetanopoulos, M\"{u}ller (2020) showed that for a wide class of models, this description applies up to the so-called condensation threshold.
  Understanding the local behavior after the condensation threshold is more complex due to long-range correlations. In this work, we revisit the random regular NAE-SAT model in the condensation regime and determine the local weak limit which describes a random solution around a typical variable. This limit exhibits a complicated non-Markovian structure arising from the space of solutions being dominated by a small number of large clusters. This is the first description of the local weak limit in the condensation regime for any sparse random CSPs in the one-step replica symmetry breaking (1RSB) class. Our result is non-asymptotic, and characterizes the tight fluctuation $O(n^{-1/2})$ around the limit. Our proof is based on coupling the local neighborhoods of an infinite spin system, which encodes the structure of the clusters, to a broadcast model on trees whose channel is given by the 1RSB belief-propagation fixed point. We believe that our proof technique has broad applicability to random CSPs in the 1RSB class.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein-p Bounds via Cumulant-Based Edgeworth Expansion for $\alpha$-Mixing Random Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07031v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress has been made in establishing normal approximation bounds in terms of the Wasserstein-$p$ distance for i.i.d. and locally dependent random variables. However, for $p &gt; 1$, no such results have been demonstrated for dependent variables under $\alpha$-mixing conditions. In this paper, we extend the Wasserstein-$p$ bounds to $\alpha$-mixing random fields. We show that, under appropriate conditions, the rescaled average of random fields converges to the standard normal distribution in the Wasserstein-$p$ distance at a rate of $O(|T|^{-\beta})$, where $|T|$ is the size of the index set, and $\beta \in (0, 1/2]$ depends on $p$, the dimension $d$ of the random fields, and the decay rate of the $\alpha$-mixing coefficients. Notably, $\beta = 1/2$ is achievable if the mixing coefficients decay at a sufficiently fast polynomial rate. Our results are derived through a carefully constructed cumulant-based Edgeworth expansion and an adaptation of recent developments in Stein's method.

      <title>Liquid-Gas phase transition for Gibbs point process with Quermass interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a liquid-gas phase transition for continuous Gibbs point process in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with Quermass interaction. The Hamiltonian we consider is a linear combination of the volume $\mathcal{V}$, the surface measure $\mathcal{S}$ and the Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic $\chi$ of a halo of particles (i.e. an union of balls centred at the positions of particles). We show the non-uniqueness of infinite volume Gibbs measures for special values of activity and temperature, provided that the temperature is low enough. Moreover we show the non-differentiability of the pressure at these critical points. Our main tool is an adaptation of the Pirogov-Sina\"i-Zahradnik theory for continuous systems with interaction exhibiting a saturation property.</description>

      <title>Conditioning of Banach Space Valued Gaussian Random Variables: An Approximation Approach Based on Martingales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03453v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the conditional distributions of two Banach space valued, jointly Gaussian random variables. In particular, we show that these conditional distributions are again Gaussian and that their means and covariances can be determined by a general finite dimensional approximation scheme. Here, it turns out that the covariance operators occurring in this scheme converge with respect to the nuclear norm and that the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Furthermore, we discuss how our approximation scheme can be implemented in several classes of important Banach spaces such as (reproducing kernel) Hilbert spaces, spaces of continuous functions, and other spaces consisting of functions. As an example, we then apply our general results to the case of continuous Gaussian processes that are conditioned to partial but infinite observations of their paths. Here we show that conditioning on sufficiently rich, increasing sets of finitely many observations leads to consistent approximations, that is, both the mean and covariance functions converge uniformly and the conditional probabilities converge weakly. Moreover, we discuss how these results improve our understanding of the popular Gaussian processes for machine learning. From a technical perspective our results are based upon a Banach space valued martingale approach for regular conditional probabilities.</description>

      <title>Geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains with applications to the swapping algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the factorizability and geometry of transition matrices of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that the induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. This perspective yields Han-Shearer type inequalities and submodularity of the entropy rate of Markov chains, as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. As a concrete algorithmic application, we introduce a projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm, which resamples the highest-temperature coordinate at stationarity at each step. We prove that such practice accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space when compared with the original swapping algorithm.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus for the Theta Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theta process is a stochastic process of number theoretical origin arising as a scaling limit of quadratic Weyl sums. It can be described in terms of the geodesic flow and an automorphic function on a homogeneous space. This process has several properties in common with Brownian motion such as its H\"older regularity, uncorrelated increments and quadratic variation. However, crucially, we show that the theta process is not a semimartingale, making It\^o calculus techniques inapplicable. Instead, we use the celebrated rough paths theory to develop the stochastic calculus for the theta process. We do so by constructing the iterated integrals - the ``rough path" - above the theta process. Rough paths theory takes a signal and its iterated integrals and produces a vast and robust theory of stochastic differential equations. In addition, the rough path we construct can be described in terms of higher rank theta sums, via equidistribution of horocycle lifts.</description>

      <title>Weak recovery, hypothesis testing, and mutual information in stochastic block models and planted factor graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is a canonical model of communities in random graphs. It was introduced in the social sciences and statistics as a model of communities, and in theoretical computer science as an average case model for graph partitioning problems under the name of the ``planted partition model.'' Given a sparse stochastic block model, the two standard inference tasks are: (i) Weak recovery: can we estimate the communities with non trivial overlap with the true communities? (ii) Detection/Hypothesis testing: can we distinguish if the sample was drawn from the block model or from a random graph with no community structure with probability tending to $1$ as the graph size tends to infinity?
  In this work, we show that for sparse stochastic block models, the two inference tasks are equivalent except at a critical point. That is, weak recovery is information theoretically possible if and only if detection is possible. We thus find a strong connection between these two notions of inference for the model. We further prove that when detection is impossible, an explicit hypothesis test based on low degree polynomials in the adjacency matrix of the observed graph achieves the optimal statistical power. This low degree test is efficient as opposed to the likelihood ratio test, which is not known to be efficient. Moreover, we prove that the asymptotic mutual information between the observed network and the community structure exhibits a phase transition at the weak recovery threshold.
  Our results are proven in much broader settings including the hypergraph stochastic block models and general planted factor graphs. In these settings we prove that the impossibility of weak recovery implies contiguity and provide a condition which guarantees the equivalence of weak recovery and detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Examples of stochastic processes whose state space representations involve functions of an integral type structure $$I_{t}^{(a,b)}:=\int_{0}^{t}b(Y_{s})e^{-\int_{s}^{t}a(Y_{r})dr}ds, \quad t\ge 0$$ are studied under an ergodic semi-Markovian environment described by an $S$ valued jump type process $Y:=(Y_{s}:s\in\mathbb{R}^{+})$ that is ergodic with a limiting distribution $\pi\in\mathcal{P}(S)$. Under different assumptions on signs of $E_{\pi}a(\cdot):=\sum_{j\in S}\pi_{j}a(j)$ and tail properties of the sojourn times of $Y$ we obtain different long time limit results for $I^{(a,b)}_{}:=(I^{(a,b)}_{t}:t\ge 0).$ In all cases mixture type of laws emerge which are naturally represented through an affine stochastic recurrence equation (SRE) $X\stackrel{d}{=}AX+B,\,\, X\perp\!\!\!\perp (A, B)$. Examples include explicit long-time representations of pitchfork bifurcation, and regime-switching diffusions under semi-Markov modulated environments, etc.</description>

      <title>Mixing rate exponent of planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022) recently proved the scaling relations for planar Fortuin-Kasteleyn (FK) percolation. In particular, they showed that the one-arm exponent and the mixing rate exponent are sufficient to derive the other near-critical exponents. The scaling limit of critical FK percolation is conjectured to be a conformally invariant random collection of loops called the conformal loop ensemble (CLE). In this paper, we define the CLE analog of the mixing rate exponent. Assuming the convergence of FK percolation to CLE, we show that the mixing rate exponent for FK percolation agrees with that of CLE. We prove that the CLE$_\kappa$ mixing rate exponent equals $\frac{3 \kappa}{8}-1$, thereby answering Question 3 of Duminil-Copin and Manolescu (2022). The derivation of the CLE exponent is based on an exact formula for the Radon-Nikodym derivative between the marginal laws of the odd-level and even-level CLE loops, which is obtained from the coupling between Liouville quantum gravity and CLE.</description>

      <title>Approximation theorems for stochastic differential equations concerning weak solutions with the spatial variable involved</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Watanabe's textbook, a classical approximation result indicates that if a solution exists to a stochastic differential equation, then by an approximation of the Wiener process, a sequence of solutions converges to the solution of the stochastic differential equation in probability. In the traditional approximation theorem, solutions do not contain the spatial variable. When consider the solution to a stochastic differential equation a weak one with the spatial variable involved, we may not be able to directly apply this classical approximation result. In this work, we try to extend the existing approximation result from Watanabe's textbook to the case when the solution of the stochastic differential equation a weak one with the spatial variable involved. We show that in this case, the approximation result still holds.</description>

      <title>A unifying view on the irreversible investment exercise boundary in a stochastic, time-inhomogeneous capacity expansion problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper devises a way to solve by the Bank and El Karoui Representation Theorem a quite complex stochastic, continuous time capacity expansion problem with irreversible investment on the finite time interval $[0, T]$ in the presence of a state dependent scrap value at the terminal time $T$. Standard variational methods are not feasible but the functional to be maximized admits a supergradient, hence the optimal control satisfies some first order conditions which are solved by means of the Representation Theorem. The devise introduced is new in singular stochastic control and of interest in its own right. As far as we know the Representation Theorem has never been applied to this extent. Contrary to the no scrap value case, a non integral term depending on the initial capacity $y$ arises in the supergradient making non trivial the application of the Representation Theorem and the existence of the so-called base capacity $l^{\star}_y(t)$, a positive level depending on $y$ which the optimal investment process is shown to become active at. In the special case of deterministic coefficients, the base capacity equals the boundary ${\hat y}(t)$ obtained by variational methods but only under a further assumption that allows to obtain monotonicity and positiveness of ${\hat y}(t)$ by means of probabilistic methods. Therefore getting a unifying view on the curve at which is optimal to invest is possible even in the presence of scrap value but it requires adding some extra conditions. The advantage is that the integral equation of the base capacity may then be used to characterize ${\hat y}(t)$.</description>

Abstract: We derive stochastic compressible Euler Equation from a Hamiltonian microscopic dynamics. We consider systems of interacting particles with H\"older noise and potential whose range is large in comparison with the typical distance between neighbouring particles. It is shown that the empirical measures associated to the position and velocity of the system converge to the solutions of compressible Euler equations driven by additive H\"older path(noise), in the limit as the particle number tends to infinity, for a suitable scaling of the interactions. Furthermore, explicit rates for the convergence are obtained in Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin spaces. Our proof is based on the It\^o-Wentzell-Kunita formula for Young integral.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of robust optimization problems under drift and volatility uncertainty</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine optimization problems in which an investor has the opportunity to trade in $d$ stocks with the goal of maximizing her worst-case cost of cumulative gains and losses. Here, worst-case refers to taking into account all possible drift and volatility processes for the stocks that fall within a $\varepsilon$-neighborhood of predefined fixed baseline processes. Although solving the worst-case problem for a fixed $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is known to be very challenging in general, we show that it can be approximated as $\varepsilon\to 0$ by the baseline problem (computed using the baseline processes) in the following sense: Firstly, the value of the worst-case problem is equal to the value of the baseline problem plus $\varepsilon$ times a correction term. This correction term can be computed explicitly and quantifies how sensitive a given optimization problem is to model uncertainty. Moreover, approximately optimal trading strategies for the worst-case problem can be obtained using optimal strategies from the corresponding baseline problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the higher-order connectivity of scale-free networks using algebraic topology. We model scale-free networks as preferential attachment graphs, and we study the algebraic-topological properties of their clique complexes. We focus on the Betti numbers and the homotopy-connectedness of these complexes. We determine the asymptotic almost sure orders of magnitude of the Betti numbers. We also establish the occurence of homotopical phase transitions for the infinite complexes, and we determine the critical thresholds at which the homotopy-connectivity changes. This partially verifies Weinberger's conjecture on the homotopy type of the infinite complexes. We conjecture that the mean-normalized Betti numbers converge to power-law distributions, and we present numerical evidence. Our results also highlight the subtlety of the scaling limit of topology, which arises from the tension between topological operations and analytical limiting process. We discuss such tension at the end of the Introduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is proposed to use stochastic differential equations with state-dependent switching rates (SDEwS) for sampling from finite mixture distributions. An Euler scheme with constant time step for SDEwS is considered. It is shown that the scheme converges with order one in weak sense and also in the ergodic limit. Numerical experiments illustrate the use of SDEwS for sampling from mixture distributions and confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Parallel Backpropagation for Inverse of a Convolution with Application to Normalizing Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inverse of an invertible convolution is an important operation that comes up in Normalizing Flows, Image Deblurring, etc. The naive algorithm for backpropagation of this operation using Gaussian elimination has running time $O(n^3)$ where $n$ is the number of pixels in the image. We give a fast parallel backpropagation algorithm with running time $O(\sqrt{n})$ for a square image and provide a GPU implementation of the same. Inverse of Convolutions are usually used in Normalizing Flows in the sampling pass, making them slow. We propose to use the Inverse of Convolutions in the forward (image to latent vector) pass of the Normalizing flow. Since the sampling pass is the inverse of the forward pass, it will use convolutions only, resulting in efficient sampling times. We use our parallel backpropagation algorithm for optimizing the inverse of convolution layer, resulting in fast training times also. We implement this approach in various Normalizing Flow backbones, resulting in our Inverse-Flow models. We benchmark Inverse-Flow on standard datasets and show significantly improved sampling times with similar bits per dimension compared to previous models.</description>

Abstract: We derive a general change of variables formula for score functions, showing that for a smooth, invertible transformation $\mathbf{y} = \phi(\mathbf{x})$, the transformed score function $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q(\mathbf{y})$ can be expressed directly in terms of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p(\mathbf{x})$. Using this result, we develop two applications: First, we establish a reverse-time It\^o lemma for score-based diffusion models, allowing the use of $\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_t(\mathbf{x})$ to reverse an SDE in the transformed space without directly learning $\nabla_{\mathbf{y}} \log q_t(\mathbf{y})$. This approach enables training diffusion models in one space but sampling in another, effectively decoupling the forward and reverse processes. Second, we introduce generalized sliced score matching, extending traditional sliced score matching from linear projections to arbitrary smooth transformations. This provides greater flexibility in high-dimensional density estimation. We demonstrate these theoretical advances through applications to diffusion on the probability simplex and empirically compare our generalized score matching approach against traditional sliced score matching methods.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and zeroes of $L$-functions via probability in $\lambda$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings designed to efficiently describe random variables valued in multisets of complex numbers, varieties over a field, or other similar enriched settings. A key role is played by the $\sigma$-moment generating function based on the plethystic exponential, which allows us to describe distributions and argue with independence in a way that is as simple as classical probability theory. As a first application, we use this theory to obtain a concise description of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions describing distributions of eigenvalues of Haar random matrices in compact classical groups. Beyond the theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings, the proof uses only classical invariant theory. Using our description we reprove the results of Diaconis and Shahshahani on the joint distributions of traces of powers of matrices, and we also treat symmetric groups. Next, we use Poonen's sieve to establish equidistribution results for the zeroes of $L$-functions in some natural families: simple Dirichlet characters for $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$ and the vanishing cohomology of smooth hypersurface sections. We give concise descriptions of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions in these families, then compare them to the associated random matrix distributions. These equidistribution results are sideways in that we fix $q$ and take the degree $d$ to infinity, as opposed to Deligne equidistribution for fixed $d$ as $q \rightarrow \infty$, and the large $d$-limits are related to explicit descriptions of stable homology with twisted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations are essential for balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling AI systems to adjust decision granularity dynamically. However, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study applies CST to grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>

      <title>Finite-time blowup of a Brownian particle in a repulsive potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Brownian particle performing an overdamped motion in a power-law repulsive potential. If the potential grows with the distance faster than quadratically, the particle escapes to infinity in a finite time. We determine the average blowup time and study the probability distribution of the blowup time. In particular, we show that the long-time tail of this probability distribution decays purely exponentially, while the short-time tail exhibits an essential singularity. These qualitative features turn out to be quite universal, as they occur for all rapidly growing power-law potentials in arbitrary spatial dimensions. The quartic potential is especially tractable, and we analyze it in more detail.</description>

      <title>Finite sample bounds for barycenter estimation in geodesic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the barycenter of a distribution given i.i.d. data in a geodesic space. Assuming an upper curvature bound in Alexandrov's sense and a support condition ensuring the strong geodesic convexity of the barycenter problem, we establish finite-sample error bounds in expectation and with high probability. Our results generalize Hoeffding- and Bernstein-type concentration inequalities from Euclidean to geodesic spaces. Building on these concentration inequalities, we derive statistical guarantees for two efficient algorithms for the computation of barycenters.</description>
