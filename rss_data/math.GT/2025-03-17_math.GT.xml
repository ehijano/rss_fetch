      <title>Knots and Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study knots created by galleries in the affine Coxeter complex of type \widewedge{B3}. We bound the stick number by 40 and prove that the smallest length of threefold rotationally symmetric trefoils is 42. We construct explicit galleries that knot as 9_35, 9_40, 9_41 and 9_47 in a way that has threefold rotational symmetry. We explain the construction of these galleries for 9_47 carefully. We conclude with three questions inspired by this work.</description>

      <title>Differential topology of the spaces of asymptotically stable vector fields and Lyapunov functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of the space of smooth asymptotically stable vector fields on $\R^n$, as well as the space of all proper smooth Lyapunov functions for such vector fields. We prove that both spaces are path-connected and simply connected when $n\neq 4,5$ and weakly contractible when $n\leq 3$. Moreover, both spaces have the weak homotopy type of a certain subset of the nonlinear Grassmannian of submanifolds of $\R^n$ diffeomorphic to the $n$-disc.
  The proofs rely on Lyapunov theory and differential topology, such as the work of Smale and Perelman on the generalized Poincar\'{e} conjecture and results of Smale, Cerf, and Hatcher on the topology of diffeomorphism groups of discs. Applications include a partial answer to a question of Conley, a parametric Hartman-Grobman theorem for nonyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria, and a parametric Morse lemma for degenerate minima. We also study the related topics of hyperbolic equilibria, Morse minima, and relative homotopy groups of the space of asymptotically stable vector fields inside the space of those vanishing at a single point.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Pontryagin's Proof of Stable Stems 1 and 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce fundamental notions of homotopy theory, including homotopy excision and the Freudenthal suspension theorem. We then explore framed cobordism and its connection to stable homotopy groups of spheres through the Pontryagin-Thom construction. Using this framework, we compute the stable stems in dimensions $0$, $1$, and $2$. This work is primarily expository, revisiting proofs from \cite{Pont1} with slight modifications incorporating modern notation. Furthermore, in the final section, we discuss 2-dimensional framed manifolds with Arf invariant one and examine why the result of \cite{Pont2} regarding $\pi_2^S$ is incorrect.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuous mappings, differential forms and the Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop analysis of H\"older continuous mappings with applications to geometry and topology of the Heisenberg groups. We cover the theory of distributional Jacobians of H\"older continuous mappings and pullbacks of differential forms under H\"older continuous mappings. That includes versions of the change of variables formula and the Stokes theorem for H\"older continuous mappings. The main applications are in the setting of the Heisenberg groups, where we provide a simple proof of a generalization of the Gromov non-embedding theorem, and new results about the H\"older homotopy groups of the Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <title>The pro-nilpotent Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a 3-variable enrichment of the Lawrence-Krammer-Bigelow (LKB) representation of the braid groups, which is the limit of a pro-nilpotent tower of representations having the original LKB representation as its bottom layer. We also construct analogous pro-nilpotent towers of representations of surface braid groups and loop braid groups.</description>

      <title>Non-density results in high dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We push forward the study of higher dimensional stable Hamiltonian topology by establishing two non-density results. First, we prove that stable hypersurfaces are not $C^3$-dense in any isotopy class of embedded hypersurfaces on any ambient symplectic manifold of dimension $2n\geq 8$. Our second result is that on any manifold of dimension $2m+1\geq 5$, the set of non-degenerate stable Hamiltonian structures is not $C^2$-dense among stable Hamiltonian structures in any given stable homotopy class that satisfies a mild assumption. The latter generalizes a result by Cieliebak and Volkov to arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Relative knot probabilities in confined lattice polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08835v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the relative knotting probabilities in a lattice model of ring polymers confined in a cavity. The model is of a lattice knot of size $n$ in the cubic lattice, confined to a cube of side-length $L$ and with volume $V=(L{+}1)^3$ sites. We use Monte Carlo algorithms to approximately enumerate the number of conformations of lattice knots in the confining cube. If $p_{n,L}(K)$ is the number of conformations of a lattice polygon of length $n$ and knot type $K$ in a cube of volume $L^3$, then the relative knotting probability of a lattice polygon to have knot type $K$, relative to the probability that the polygon is the unknot (the trivial knot, denoted by $0_1$), is $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1) = p_{n,L}(K)/p_{n,L}(0_1)$. We determine $\rho_{n,L}(K/0_1)$ for various knot types $K$ up to six crossing knots. Our data show that these relative knotting probabilities are small so that the model is dominated by lattice polygons of knot type the unknot. Moreover, if the concentration of the monomers of the lattice knot is $\varphi = n/V$, then the relative knot probability increases with $\varphi$ along a curve that flattens as the Hamiltonian state is approached.</description>
