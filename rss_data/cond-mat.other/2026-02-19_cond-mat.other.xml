      <title>Exceptional horns in $n$-root graphene and Lieb photonic ring lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices whose Bloch spectra are $n$th roots of those of Hermitian parent two-dimensional (2D) lattices, namely graphene and the Lieb lattice. The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an "exceptional horn" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\sim\vert \mathbf{q}\vert^{\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\sim\phi^{\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$. Finally, we propose a realistic photonic implementation based on coupled ring resonators with a split configuration of optical gain and loss.</description>

      <title>The extensive photo response on metal/n-Si clarified by the zero-gap with inter-band phonon scatterings</title>

Abstract: UVA to NIR with multi-directional photo responses have been found on metal (Au)/n-Si device. A reasonable explanation has not been found in various physical models of Si-devices for the phenomena. We approached a zero-gap at X (reciprocal point) in two conduction bands of Si to analysis the optical response with the inter-band phonon scatterings. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-$\Gamma$ and X-W successfully simulated the sensitivities in visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the carrier density profile well fitted the response in NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Filling up the zero-gap by doping electrons ($\sim 10^{18}$/cm$^3$) at around X, a lower limit of 0.6 eV arose in the measurement below Si-band gap of 1.17 eV. Indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with phonon scattering, gave a variety of directional photo-responses. The carrier scattering model for the inter bands (X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L) were consistent with the directional dependence of photo-currents under UVA (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.06 eV) excitations. Band to band scatterings assisted to extend the available optical range and increase its variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle, a new frontier will be opened in the photo-conversion system by using indirect-transition semiconductors and thus, it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.</description>

      <title>Resistance of refractory high-entropy alloys to ultrafast laser irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Response of refractory high-entropy alloys MoNbTaVW and HfNbTaTiZr to ultrafast laser radiation is modelled with the hybrid code XTANT-3, combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with the transport Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation. A two-temperature state with elevated electronic temperature and a cold atomic lattice is studied. The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are evaluated: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state.</description>
