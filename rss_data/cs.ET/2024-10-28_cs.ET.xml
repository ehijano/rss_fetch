      <title>Energy Efficient Dual Designs of FeFET-Based Analog In-Memory Computing with Inherent Shift-Add Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-memory computing (IMC) architecture emerges as a promising paradigm, improving the energy efficiency of multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations within DNNs by integrating the parallel computations within the memory arrays. Various high-precision analog IMC array designs have been developed based on both SRAM and emerging non-volatile memories. These designs perform MAC operations of partial input and weight, with the corresponding partial products then fed into shift-add circuitry to produce the final MAC results. However, existing works often present intricate shift-add process for weight. The traditional digital shift-add process is limited in throughput due to time-multiplexing of ADCs, and advancing the shift-add process to the analog domain necessitates customized circuit implementations, resulting in compromises in energy and area efficiency. Furthermore, the joint optimization of the partial MAC operations and the weight shift-add process is rarely explored. In this paper, we propose novel, energy efficient dual designs of FeFET based high precision analog IMC featuring inherent shift-add capability. We introduce a FeFET based IMC paradigm that performs partial MAC in each column, and inherently integrates the shift-add process for 4-bit weights by leveraging FeFET's analog storage characteristics. This paradigm supports both 2's complement mode and non-2's complement mode MAC, thereby offering flexible support for 4-/8-bit weight data in 2's complement format. Building upon this paradigm, we propose novel FeFET based dual designs, CurFe for the current mode and ChgFe for the charge mode, to accommodate the high precision analog domain IMC architecture.Evaluation results at circuit and system levels indicate that the circuit/system-level energy efficiency of the proposed FeFET-based analog IMC is 1.56$\times$/1.37$\times$ higher when compared to SOTA analog IMC designs.</description>

      <title>MAP: Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring that generative AI systems align with human values is essential but challenging, especially when considering multiple human values and their potential trade-offs. Since human values can be personalized and dynamically change over time, the desirable levels of value alignment vary across different ethnic groups, industry sectors, and user cohorts. Within existing frameworks, it is hard to define human values and align AI systems accordingly across different directions simultaneously, such as harmlessness, helpfulness, and positiveness. To address this, we develop a novel, first-principle approach called Multi-Human-Value Alignment Palette (MAP), which navigates the alignment across multiple human values in a structured and reliable way. MAP formulates the alignment problem as an optimization task with user-defined constraints, which define human value targets. It can be efficiently solved via a primal-dual approach, which determines whether a user-defined alignment target is achievable and how to achieve it. We conduct a detailed theoretical analysis of MAP by quantifying the trade-offs between values, the sensitivity to constraints, the fundamental connection between multi-value alignment and sequential alignment, and proving that linear weighted rewards are sufficient for multi-value alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate MAP's ability to align multiple values in a principled manner while delivering strong empirical performance across various tasks.</description>

      <title>FeBiM: Efficient and Compact Bayesian Inference Engine Empowered with Ferroelectric In-Memory Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scenarios with limited training data or where explainability is crucial, conventional neural network-based machine learning models often face challenges. In contrast, Bayesian inference-based algorithms excel in providing interpretable predictions and reliable uncertainty estimation in these scenarios. While many state-of-the-art in-memory computing (IMC) architectures leverage emerging non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies to offer unparalleled computing capacity and energy efficiency for neural network workloads, their application in Bayesian inference is limited. This is because the core operations in Bayesian inference differ significantly from the multiplication-accumulation (MAC) operations common in neural networks, rendering them generally unsuitable for direct implementation in most existing IMC designs. In this paper, we propose FeBiM, an efficient and compact Bayesian inference engine powered by multi-bit ferroelectric field-effect transistor (FeFET)-based IMC. FeBiM effectively encodes the trained probabilities of a Bayesian inference model within a compact FeFET-based crossbar. It maps quantized logarithmic probabilities to discrete FeFET states. As a result, the accumulated outputs of the crossbar naturally represent the posterior probabilities, i.e., the Bayesian inference model's output given a set of observations. This approach enables efficient in-memory Bayesian inference without the need for additional calculation circuitry. As the first FeFET-based in-memory Bayesian inference engine, FeBiM achieves an impressive storage density of 26.32 Mb/mm$^{2}$ and a computing efficiency of 581.40 TOPS/W in a representative Bayesian classification task. These results demonstrate 10.7$\times$/43.4$\times$ improvement in compactness/efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art hardware implementation of Bayesian inference.</description>

      <title>A potpourri of results on molecular communication with active transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is a model of information transmission where the signal is transmitted by information-carrying molecules through their physical transport from a transmitter to a receiver through a communication channel. Prior efforts have identified suitable "information molecules" whose efficacy for signal transmission has been studied extensively in diffusive channels (DC). Although easy to implement, DCs are inefficient for distances longer than tens of nanometers. In contrast, molecular motor-driven nonequilibrium or active transport can drastically increase the range of communication and may permit efficient communication up to tens of micrometers. In this paper, we investigate how active transport influences the efficacy of molecular communication, quantified by the mutual information between transmitted and received signals. We consider two specific scenarios: (a) active transport through relays and (b) active transport through a mixture of active and diffusing particles. In each case, we discuss the efficacy of the communication channel and discuss their potential pitfalls.</description>

      <title>x-RAGE: eXtended Reality -- Action &amp; Gesture Events Dataset</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of the Metaverse and focus on wearable devices in the recent years gesture based human-computer interaction has gained significance. To enable gesture recognition for VR/AR headsets and glasses several datasets focusing on egocentric i.e. first-person view have emerged in recent years. However, standard frame-based vision suffers from limitations in data bandwidth requirements as well as ability to capture fast motions. To overcome these limitation bio-inspired approaches such as event-based cameras present an attractive alternative. In this work, we present the first event-camera based egocentric gesture dataset for enabling neuromorphic, low-power solutions for XR-centric gesture recognition. The dataset has been made available publicly at the following URL: https://gitlab.com/NVM_IITD_Research/xrage.</description>

      <title>Available Degrees of Spatial Multiplexing of a Uniform Linear Array with Multiple Polarizations: a Holographic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly enhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) with Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) presents a promising solution for enhancing communication networks within campus environments. This paper explores the unique advantages of combining these two technologies, including scalability, energy efficiency, flexibility, and support for diverse applications. LoRaWAN low power consumption and extended range capabilities address the challenges of traditional communication methods, enabling reliable data transmission across various campus scenarios, such as emergency alerts, event coordination, and real-time monitoring. We also identify key challenges faced in this integrated architecture, including signal interference, data packet collisions, and energy management. By providing a comprehensive survey of existing techniques and solutions categorized by the network protocol stack layers, this study aims to inform future research and development efforts in creating robust, energy efficient communication systems tailored for modern educational institutions. Ultimately, the findings highlight the potential of LoRaWAN MANET architectures to transform campus communication into a more reliable, adaptable, and cost effective framework.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a fast system technology co-optimization (STCO) framework that optimizes power, performance, and area (PPA) for next-generation IC design, addressing the challenges and opportunities presented by novel materials and device architectures. We focus on accelerating the technology level of STCO using AI techniques, by employing graph neural network (GNN)-based approaches for both TCAD simulation and cell library characterization, which are interconnected through a unified compact model, collectively achieving over a 100X speedup over traditional methods. These advancements enable comprehensive STCO iterations with runtime speedups ranging from 1.9X to 14.1X and supports both emerging and traditional technologies.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Electro-optic Resonant Phase Shifting for Multi-dimensional, Ultra-dynamic Photonic Switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.</description>
