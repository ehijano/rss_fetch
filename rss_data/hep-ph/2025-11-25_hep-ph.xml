      <title>Geometry-induced azimuthal anisotropy in coherent $J/\psi$ photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropies in heavy-ion collisions are conventionally interpreted as signatures of hydrodynamic flow. We demonstrate that in peripheral collisions, a significant $\cos 2\phi$ asymmetry in the decay leptons of coherently photoproduced $J/\psi$ mesons arises purely from the initial-state geometry of the nuclear electromagnetic field. This modulation originates from the linear polarization of coherent photons, which is radially aligned in impact parameter space and transferred to the vector meson. By employing light-cone perturbation theory within the dipole formalism, we calculate the centrality dependence of this asymmetry for collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. Our predictions quantitatively reproduce STAR data. This observable thus provides a rigorous benchmark for distinguishing electromagnetic initial-state effects from collective medium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity in Heavy Quark Fragmentation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At high energies a form of fragmentation function for a heavy quark into a hadron is substantiated to agree with a reciprocity relation to the distribution of heavy quark as the virtual parton in the hadron. The relevance of the relation is analysed in its application to empirical data.</description>

      <title>A simple introduction to soft resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an elementary pedagogical introduction to some basic concepts and techniques of soft (or Sudakov) resummation, specifically in QCD, paying particular attention to simple but useful tricks of the trade. We briefly review collinear (Altarelli-Parisi) and infrared (eikonal)factorization, cancellation of infrared singularities and factorization of mass singularities. We recall basic concepts on renormalization group invariance and the solution of renormalization group equations. We then show how threshold resummation can be derived from a renormalization group argument following from the cancellation of infrared singularities. We discuss various equivalent forms of the resummed result, and we briefly present transverse momentum resummation.</description>

      <title>Characterising hadronisation across the phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leading hadronisation corrections to two-jet global event shapes amount to a shift in the corresponding perturbative distributions. It has been recently established that this shift depends significantly on the value of the considered event shape. These analyses consider perturbative configurations with only three partons emitting an ultra-soft non-perturbative gluon. These are dominant in the three-jet region. However, multiple soft and/or collinear emissions need to be considered to accurately describe event shape distributions near their Sudakov peak. In this region, non-perturbative shifts are usually computed by considering only two hard emitters. In this paper, we find that this approximation misses an important correction to the shift due to the emission of an additional soft wide-angle gluon. We then compute its contribution, and embed it in a general treatment for the shift that is valid in both the two-jet and three-jet regions.</description>

      <title>Collinear spin correlations of final-state radiation in dense QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin correlations are required to reproduce the correct azimuthal dependence of matrix elements for successive branchings at disparate angles in QCD jets. In this paper, we study modifications to this, $\cos(2\psi_{12})$, azimuthal pattern in the presence of a quark-gluon plasma. To that end, we consider a simplified setup in which a narrow and energetic QCD antenna is formed inside a medium of fixed length and radiates a collinear emission outside it. The calculation includes both light and heavy-quarks. Further, we do not include medium-induced spin-flip interactions since they are energy suppressed in our formalism. We show that the amplitude of the azimuthal modulation in the presence of a medium is always suppressed with respect to the vacuum baseline, with its magnitude depending on the medium properties and splitting kinematics. For a medium with a momentum space anisotropy, we find that the azimuthal modulation acquires a phase shift, i.e., $\cos(2\psi_{12}) \to \cos(2\psi_{12}+\phi_{\rm med })$, where $\phi_{\rm med}$ is a process-dependent function that again depends on the medium properties and splitting kinematics. This work provides theory guidance for implementing spin-driven interference effects in phenomenological studies of jet quenching in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Decay matrix of B-\bar{B} mixing: Mixing of dimension-seven operators into dimension-six operators under renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the width difference \Delta\Gamma_s among the mass eigenstates of the B_s-\bar{B}_s system requires the calculation of the corresponding decay matrix to order \alpha_s/m_b. QCD corrections to power-suppressed terms in the Heavy Quark Expansion involve the renormalization of dimension-7 four-quark operators for which no general methodology is available yet. In the \overline{MS} scheme one-loop corrections to matrix elements of dimension-7 operators violate the power counting, but we find the responsible terms to be infrared-finite and show that they can be absorbed into finite counterterms proportional to dimension-6 operators. We calculate all these counterterms and subsequently verify the consistency of our results with hadronic matrix elements calculated in the limit of a large number N_c of colours. The condition of correct power counting implies constraints on the possible definitions of evanescent operators.</description>

      <title>Long-lived particles: theory and experimental probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-lived particles (LLPs) are particles that are stable or that live long enough for their decays to be experimentally distinguishable in time or position from their production point. We provide an overview of the phenomenology and experimental signatures of LLPs, focusing on LLPs at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We explain what determines a particle's lifetime and we show that LLPs are ubiquitous both within the Standard Model and beyond. We survey the methods used to experimentally detect and characterize particles at collider-based experiments, and discuss how searches for LLPs present both experimental challenges and exciting new possibilities for detection. Finally, we situate LHC searches for LLPs within the broader experimental landscape with a brief overview of searches for LLPs at lower-energy experiments and a discussion of astrophysical and cosmological probes offering complementary insight into the physics of LLPs beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>The purely leptonic and semileptonic decays of $D^{*}_{s}$ meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the potential prospects of the $D^{*}_{s}$ at high-luminosity heavy-flavor experiments in the future, we investigated the CKM-favored and tree-dominated leptonic $D^{*}_{s}\to\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and semileptonic $D^{*}_{s}\to M\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ ($M=\phi, \eta^{(\prime)}$ and $\ell=e, \mu$) weak decays in the Standard Model (SM). The theoretical predictions and some discussions for the observable quantities including the total width of $D^{*}_{s}$ mesons, the branching fractions of leptonic $D^{*}_{s}\to\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and semileptonic $D^{*}_{s}\to M\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ weak decays, the lepton spin asymmetry and forward-backward asymmetry are presented. Numerically, the weak decays of $D^{*}_{s}\to\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ and $D^{*}_{s} \to M\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ have relatively large branching fractions of the order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-5})$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ respectively, which are expected to be observed in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Topological diagrams of doubly charmed baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doubly charmed baryon was first observed by LHCb via the non-leptonic decay $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to \Lambda^+_cK^-\pi^+\pi^+$ in 2017. Subsequently, ongoing efforts have been made to identify other doubly charmed baryons. However, there is no systematic analysis of the topological decomposition for non-leptonic decays of doubly charmed baryons. In this work, we study the topological amplitudes of doubly charmed baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. Tree- and penguin-induced topological diagrams for the $\mathcal{B}_{cc}\to \mathcal{B}_c M$ and $\mathcal{B}_{cc}\to \mathcal{B} D$ decays are presented. The linear relations between the topological amplitudes and the $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes are derived through tensor contraction and $SU(3)$ decomposition. The magnitude pattern of the topological diagrams is analyzed in the rescattering dynamics and the large $N_c$ expansion. In addition, some amplitude relations are derived to test the K\"orner-Pati-Woo theorem in the isospin limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we studied the \tcs state production through the meson loop mechanism in the $B^+$ meson decays, where \tcs is considered as a $\bar{D}K^*$ molecular state with $J^P=1^+$. By employing the effective Lagrangian approach, we estimated the branching ratio of the $B^+ \to D^+ T_{\bar{c}\bar{s}1}^0 $ and $B^+ \to D^{*+} T_{\bar{c}\bar{s}1}^0$ processes and found them to be on the order of $10^{-5}\sim 10^{-4}$. The fit fraction of \tcs in different processes was also estimated. We propose to search for \tcs in the $B^+ \to D^{*+}\bar{D}^{*-}K^+$ process, which should be accessible to the Belle II and LHCb Collaborations.</description>

      <title>Detection prospects for the Cosmic Neutrino Background using matter interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss how the Cosmic Neutrino Background can affect the measured phase difference in a matter interferometer. This phase is proportional to a difference in potential energies along the two interferometer paths. The relevant potentials here are the well-known neutrino matter potential and a potential related to the Stodolsky effect. We show how they can be rewritten in terms of scalar potentials, pseudo magnetic fields and spin-spin interactions. Unfortunately, current technology is unlikely to detect this effect and we discuss prospects for the future. We also briefly comment on fermionic Dark Matter which can give rise to very similar effects which can easily be larger than the neutrino case.</description>

      <title>Entropy and DIS structure functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy in Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) from the DIS structure functions has emerged as a novel tool for probing observable quantities. The method proposed by Kharzeev-Levin to determine entanglement entropy in DIS from parton distribution functions (PDFs) improves on the momentum-space approach proposed by Lappi et al.[Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf84}, 84 (2024)] and future developed by Boroun and Ha [Phys. Rev. D {\bf109}, 094037 (2024)] using Laplace transform techniques. The entropy of charged hadrons is obtained from the parameterization of the proton structure function and compared with H1 data and HSS and HERA PDFs. Our results for the entanglement entropy align very well with the H1 data across a wide range of $x$ and $Q^2$. Finally, the behavior of the entanglement entropy is described at fixed $\sqrt{s}$ to the minimum value of $x$ given by $Q^2/s$ which indicates that the polarization of the exchanged photon for entropy determination is transverse
  at this specific kinematic point.</description>

      <title>Proton mass decompositions in the NNLO QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton matrix elements of the QCD energy-momentum tensor are expressed by the gravitational form factors. The forward values of the gravitational form factors allow for a decomposition of the proton mass into the contributions from quarks and gluons, and the further subdivisions into the contributions from quark masses and from the QCD trace anomaly may be considered. We present the most recent evaluations of these mass decompositions, using a recent quantitative evaluation of the forward values of relevant gravitational form factors at the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD. We also calculate the renormalization scale dependence of each component within these decompositions. The results indicate several shortcomings of those decompositions. We propose a new decomposition according to the twist of the relevant operators, i.e., classifying the effects via the partonic motion according to asymptotic freedom and the parton correlation by non-perturbative QCD interactions. We demonstrate the improvements by our new decomposition. We also present the results for the pion, which exhibit quite different parton-correlation behaviors from the proton.</description>

      <title>Pion Valence-Quark TMD from Continuum Schwinger Function Methods and Gaussian GTMD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the continuum Schwinger function method to investigate the unpolarized valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMD) of the pion at the hadron scale. The first seventeen generalized Mellin-transverse moments, constructed from lightlike and transverse vectors, are computed and found to be well described by a factorized ansatz, in which the longitudinal component coincides with the distribution function (DF) and the transverse momentum follows a Gaussian form. The Gaussianity relation between the mean and mean-squared transverse momenta is satisfied with approximately $99\%$ accuracy in our numerical results, with the mean-squared transverse momentum equal to $0.231\,\text{GeV}^2$. Using the extracted TMD, we test the hypothesis that the quark's transverse spatial distribution also follows a Gaussian form and find that the resulting electromagnetic form factor is in good agreement with existing data. These results indicate that the intrinsic transverse-momentum and transverse-spatial distributions of valence quarks in the pion can be accurately approximated by a Gaussian ansatz, supporting its use in phenomenological analyses and experimental fits.</description>

      <title>KNO scaling, memorylessness and maximal entanglement at universal fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the experimental data of $\mathtt{p}\mathtt{-}\mathtt{p}$ collisions by the ATLAS and confront it with the AGK model developed by two of the authors, the Kharzeev-Levin~(KL) model and the simple exponential behavior for the Koba, Nielsen and Olesen~(KNO) scaling function. We show that all three models virtually coincide with all available experimental curves crossed at value $z=n/\langle n \rangle$ of the KNO scaling parameter in the broad range of the center-of-mass energies. The theoretical results and the experimental data show that the KNO violating terms are highly suppressed in the vicinity of $z=2$. The special status of the universal scaling point $z=2$, where the KNO scaling is restored for $\mathtt{p}\mathtt{-}\mathtt{p}$ collisions, suggests that it originates from statistical saturation of the optical theorem.
  We claim that any unitary model that approximates memoryless distribution in the high energy limit must have the same KNO scaling function $e^{-z}$ in the vicinity of $z=2$ with KNO violating corrections of the order of one over average multiplicity squared. This reflects the maximal entanglement of the final states.</description>

      <title>Probing CP-violating Higgs-Gauge couplings with Higgsstrahlung at $e^-e^+$ collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of a future high-luminosity $e^-e^+$ collider operating at $\sqrt{s}=250~\text{GeV}$ to CP-violating and CP-conserving anomalous $hVV$ interactions via the Higgsstrahlung process. The effects of new physics are parameterized in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory~(SMEFT) framework through six dimension-6 operators modifying the $hVV$ vertices. Using polarized beams and exploiting polarization and spin correlation asymmetries reconstructed from Higgs decay products, we perform a comprehensive analysis across the three dominant decay modes, $h\to b\bar{b}$, $WW^\star$, and $ZZ^\star$. The $h\to WW^\star$ channel exhibits the highest sensitivity to $\mathcal{O}_{HW}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{H\widetilde{W}}$, while the $b\bar{b}$ mode constrains the remaining operators with high statistical precision. Sensitivity studies incorporating luminosity scaling and systematic uncertainties show that the projected bounds improve significantly with increasing integrated luminosity, but saturate once experimental systematics exceed the few-percent level. These results highlight the crucial role of spin-based observables and beam polarization in achieving sub-percent precision on SMEFT coefficients at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Induced Nucleon Decay Through the Neutron Portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron portal operator provides a theoretically motivated connection between the visible and dark sectors and features in several well-studied asymmetric dark matter models. This operator leads to dark matter induced nucleon decays that mimic the experimental signature of "ordinary" nucleon decays. In this work, we reinterpret Super-Kamiokande nucleon decay searches for $n \rightarrow \pi^0 \nu$ and $p \rightarrow \pi^+ \nu$ to constrain dark matter induced nucleon decays. For GeV-scale dark matter, we obtain lower bounds of $\mathcal{O}(1~\rm{TeV})$ on the scale of the effective neutron portal operator. We also discuss the prospects for future searches at Hyper-Kamiokande and highlight the importance of a dedicated experimental analysis with reduced systematic uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Higgs Production Classifier using Weak Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reliable determination of the Higgs production mechanism in hadron collider experiments is essential in the program of the measurements of the Higgs couplings. We employ weak supervision, CWoLa in particular, to train deep neural networks using real data of the diphoton events, in the hope of reducing biases resulting from Monte Carlo simulations. Models based on the convolutional neural network and the transformer are tested and compared. In particular, the classification performance gets slightly better when the photon information is removed from training on the low-luminosity region of $H \to \gamma \gamma$. We explicitly show that the performance can be improved when the training dataset is enlarged by data augmentation using physics-motivated methods. We further demonstrate that the trained model can be successfully applied to the $H \to ZZ$ and $H \to Z\gamma$ events, showing that such classifiers are agnostic to Higgs decay modes provided they do not involve strong QCD corrections.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule predictions on gluonic tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=0^{+-},0^{--}$ and $1^{\pm \pm}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic calculation of the mass spectrum for tetraquark hybrid states, focusing on the $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[G]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ color configuration, within the framework of QCD sum rules. As an extension of our previous work on $0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ states, we now construct 18 distinct interpolating currents with $J^{PC} = 0^{+-}$, $0^{--}$, and $1^{\pm\pm}$. Using operator product expansion (OPE) techniques and including nonperturbative contributions up to dimension six, we obtain key results: for the $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$ states, the predicted masses lie in the range of $7.2-7.3$ GeV, while the $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$ states have slightly lower masses, between 6.9 and 7.1 GeV. These predictions provide strong support for the possible existence of an $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes 8_{[G]}\otimes 8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ component within the di-$J/\psi$ structure reported by LHCb. Moreover, our analogous calculations for tetrabottom hybrid states yield mass ranges of $19.4-19.5$ GeV (for $0^{+-}$, $1^{--}$, and $1^{-+}$) and $19.2-19.3$ GeV (for $1^{+-}$ and $1^{++}$), offering crucial references for future searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review paper, I present a study of the structure of the hadrons computed in the covariant Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model as the chiral effective quark theory of QCD. I describe how the NJL model is treated to imitate the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and confinement QCD properties. The consistency for the parton distribution functions and electromagnetic form factors, as internal structure observables, in comparison with existing data and other theoretical predictions, is also shown. The implications of mimicking the QCD properties in the NJL model for hadron structure observables, as well as the relevance of the results to EIC, EicC, and COMPASS/AMBER future experiments, are discussed.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ process including full $\tau^+ \tau^-$ spin information in Pb--Pb ultraperipheral collision and at lepton colliders. We present the predictions for the corresponding cross sections and spin correlations at NLO electroweak precision, and find that the NLO electroweak contributions are numerically small for the observables considered. Additionally, we use the spin correlations obtained in this paper to analyze the quantum entanglement in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system of the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ process. Our results show that there is a genuine entangled configuration near the $\tau^+\tau^-$ invariant mass threshold. This work is helpful for studying the $\tau$-pair production induced by photon-photon collision at high energy colliders.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquark production in forward rapidity $pp$ collisions at LHC and FCC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the production of a fully charmed tetraquark state $T_{4c}$ in $pp$ collisions at forward rapidities through the fragmentation mechanism considering the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) formalism and the solution of the running coupling Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. The contributions of gluon - and charm - initiated processes are taken into account, and the impact of an intrinsic charm component in the proton's wave function is estimated. Predictions for the transverse momentum distribution of the $T_{4c}$ state are presented assuming different rapidities, distinct quantum numbers of the state and center-of-mass energies. Our results indicate that the higher cross-section is associated with the production of a tensor state $T_{4c}(2^{++})$, which is dominated by the gluon-initiated process. In contrast, the production of the axial-vector state $T_{4c}(1^{+-})$ is dominated by the charm-initiated process and is very sensitive to the presence (or not) of an intrinsic charm.</description>

      <title>Traces of the $X(3960)$ state in the femtoscopic $D_s^+ D_s^- $ correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The femtoscopic $ D_s^+D_s^-$ correlations are investigated to predict the signature of the not-yet-established $X(3960)$ state reported by the LHCb Collaboration, in three scenarios: resonant, virtual, or bound. In the last two scenarios, it might also be identified as the state $X(3930)$. The formalism employed to generate this structure dynamically is based on the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a general $S$-wave potential. We investigate how the relevant properties and observables characterizing this state--such as the pole position, scattering length, and effective range--might be affected by variations in the model parameters. The amplitudes encoding the distinct interpretations of the $X(3960)$ state are then used as input to calculate the femtoscopic correlation function of the $D_s^+ D_s^- $ pair, which is analyzed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of 2+1-flavor QCD from an Einstein-dilaton-flavor holographic model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a holographic QCD model based on the Einstein--dilaton--flavor framework with 2+1 flavors and investigate its phase structure using machine-learning techniques. At zero chemical potential, the model reproduces the equation of state and chiral transition in quantitative agreement with lattice QCD results. By varying the light and strange quark masses, we map out the quark-mass dependence of the transition order and obtain the corresponding phase diagram, which is consistent with phase structures extracted from lattice simulations and other nonperturbative approaches. In particular, the predicted first-order region is found to be small, in line with the most recent lattice QCD analyses. We also examine the critical behavior along the second-order boundaries and the tricritical region, finding that the critical exponents exhibit mean-field scaling characteristic of classical holographic constructions. Integrating machine learning with holographic QCD significantly enhances the efficiency of parameter optimization, providing a robust and practical strategy for improving the predictive power of holographic modeling of QCD thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We revisit scalar emissions in double beta decays of nuclei, often discussed in the context of Majoron models, in light of the latest developments on the study of neutrinoless double beta decay amplitudes from an effective field theory approach. The sensitivity of double beta decay experiments to this process is assessed through an analysis of spectral shapes, and the study is extended to massive scalars, scalars coupling to sterile neutrinos, and exotic right-handed effective couplings.</description>

      <title>Magnetic susceptibility of hot hadronic medium and quark degrees of freedom near the QCD cross-over point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the lattice QCD results for the temperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of the medium below the cross-over temperature are difficult to reconcile with the available hadronic models. In particular, in the widely used Hadron Resonance Gas model, reproducing well numerous other features of the medium, one observes a substantially too strong diamagnetism compared to the lattice simulations. One thus needs a significant source of paramagnetism below the QCD cross-over temperature, possible to achieve with sufficiently light fermions. We thus consider a quark-meson model, where the temperature-dependent quark masses are fixed from the baryon-baryon and baryon-strangeness susceptibility data from the lattice at zero magnetic field. We show that in such a framework one can describe the magnetic susceptibility, with the vacuum contributions duly incorporated. In the hadronic picture, we also evaluate the contribution of the pion--vector-meson loops to the magnetic susceptibility evaluated via the photon polarization, showing it is small and paramagnetic.</description>

      <title>Constraining Yukawa-type interaction and coupling constant of axionlike particles to nucleons from recent measurement of the Casimir-Polder interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive constraints on the parameters of the Yukawa-type interaction and on the coupling constant of axionlike particles to nucleons from the results of recent diffraction experiment on measuring the Casimir-Polder interaction between Ar atoms and a silicon nitride nanograting. It is shown that within the interaction range from 1 to 2 nm the obtained constraints are by up to a factor of 33.4 stronger than all the other ones found previously from measurement of the Casimir force. The derived constraints are weaker in strength than those deduced from the experiments on neutron scattering. The constraints on the coupling constants of axionlike particles to nucleons following from the diffraction experiment are up to a factor of 24.2 stronger withing the range of axion masses from 32.4 to 100 eV than the previously derived ones from experiments on measuring the Casimir force. They are weaker only in comparison to the constraints found from the experiment using the beams of molecular hydrogen. The potential of the Casimir effect for obtaining stronger constraints on the parameters of hypothetical interactions is discussed.</description>

Abstract: Four formulations of perfect spin hydrodynamics for spin-1/2 particles, distinguished by their treatment of spin (classical vs. quantum) and by the underlying particle statistics (Boltzmann vs. Fermi-Dirac), are analyzed and shown to satisfy the requirements of a divergence-type theory. Moreover, for all the formulations, we define the generating functions associated with the relevant thermodynamic currents and demonstrate that the constructed hydrodynamic theory is nonlinearly causal and stable. The latter is achieved by employing the exact expressions for the distribution functions, indicating a nonperturbative character of our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transverse Momentum Dependent (TMD) Parton Branching (PB) method incorporates elements of TMD physics into a Monte Carlo (MC) framework to produce high-energy QCD predictions for collider processes. It derives TMDs from the PB evolution equation - solvable with MC techniques - fits them to
  data, and then enables their use in MC event generators for QCD predictions. In this article, we describe the relation of the PB Sudakov form factor to the Sudakov factor in the CSS formalism. We discuss both perturbative and non-perturbative components. We present recent developments to include NNLL coefficient in the PB Sudakov. We discuss the CS kernel extractions for different evolution scenarios. We remark the recent studies on intrinsic-kt vs center-of-mass (in)dependence in different approaches and their relation to the non-perturbative Sudakov.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor violation in Higgs boson decays at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects for discovering lepton flavor-violating Higgs decays in proton-proton collisions, focusing on $h \to \ell_i\ell_j$ ($\ell_i\neq \ell_j, \ell=e,\,\mu,\,\tau$). The analysis is carried out within a Froggatt-Nielsen model, which provides a natural mechanism for such processes. By scanning the phenomenologically viable parameter space, we identify scenarios that yield observable signals at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). For an integrated luminosity of $2400~\text{fb}^{-1}$, we project that $h \to e\mu$ could reach the $5\sigma$ discovery threshold, while $h \to \tau\mu$ may achieve about $4\sigma$. We also obtain $2\sigma$ exclusion limits of $\mathcal{BR}(h \to e\mu) \lesssim 4.3 \times 10^{-6}$ and $\mathcal{BR}(h \to \tau\mu) \lesssim 5.2 \times 10^{-5}$. These findings underscore the HL-LHC's unique sensitivity to probe new physics through rare Higgs decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear boson diffusion equation is taken as a basis to account for the fast thermalization of gluons in the initial stages of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. For constant drift and diffusion coefficients with schematic initial conditions, this equation has previously been solved exactly. In order to achieve a more realistic time evolution towards thermalization, energy-dependent transport coefficients are introduced, requiring numerical solutions of the nonlinear equation. Their accuracy is tested against the exact analytical results in the limit of constant coefficients. The consequences for transient gluon-condensate formation through elastic scatterings in overoccupied systems are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate an one loop radiative neutrino mass model, where the loop particles, notably a singlet fermion ($\chi$), a doublet fermion ($\Psi$) and three generations of singlet scalars ($\phi_i, i=\{1,2,3\}$) are assumed to be odd under an additional $\mathcal{Z}_2$-symmetry. In this setup, the singlet fermion mixes with the neutral component of the doublet to give rise singlet-doublet Majorana dark matter. The addition of $\mathcal{Z}_2$ odd scalars in the model provides rich phenomenological implications. We find that the quartic interaction terms between the SM Higgs and $\phi_i$s play a significant role in modifying the scalar potential to have a first-order phase transition (FOPT) leading to observable gravitational waves (GWs) spectra. We also examine the non-trivial role played by the singlet-doublet fermion DM and the scalars in loop-induced neutrino mass, $(g-2)_\mu$, and lepton flavor violation. We find that the model is predictive due to the combined constraints and can be verified at different terrestrial experiments.</description>

      <title>Viability of $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ Flavour Symmetries in Light of the First JUNO Result</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the analysis of the viability of the lepton mixing patterns originating from $A_4$, $S_4$ and $A_5$ discrete flavour symmetries and leading to predictions for the solar neutrino mixing angle, $\theta_{12}$. We perform a statistical analysis using as an input (i) the results of the latest global fit to neutrino oscillation data, and (ii) the first JUNO measurement of $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. Out of the five (four) cases compatible with the global data at $3\sigma$ for normal (inverted) neutrino mass ordering, only three (two) cases remain compatible with the global data at the same confidence level after taking into account the JUNO result.</description>

      <title>Refractive neutrino masses in the solar DM halo: Can the dark-LMA solution be revived?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrinos can acquire "refractive masses" as a consequence of their interactions with ultralight dark matter (DM). We explore a model with two additional sterile neutrinos and an ultralight scalar field which acts as DM and interacts with all five neutrinos. We show that the effective $5 \times 5$ Hamiltonian for neutrino propagation can be diagonalized by a unitary matrix $\mathbb{P}$ parametrized by 6 mixing angles and 1 complex phase. When active-sterile mixing angles are small, we identify a parametrization for $\mathbb{P}$ that reduces neutrino propagation inside the Sun to a two-flavor problem for a uniform DM background. In the presence of a DM halo inside the Sun, however, the propagation shows additional features in the region of halo dominance. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the electron neutrino survival probability in the presence of the DM halo. We show that this probability has a strong dependence on the neutrino production region even for a fixed energy, and numerically calculate the effects of averaging over these production regions. Comparisons with the re-interpreted solar data, in the light of possible active-sterile neutrino conversions, would allow putting bounds on the halo parameters. Finally, we examine the possibility of reviving the dark-LMA solution in this context, where the survival probability spectrum can have attractive features aligned with the measurements at Super-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Axion Cosmology with Multi-Branch Yang-Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that Yang-Mills theories, especially in the large-$N$ limit, exhibit a $\theta$-vacuum structure with a multi-branched vacuum energy. In this work, we demonstrate that this multi-branch structure can play a crucial role in axion cosmology when the axion acquires its mass from the Yang-Mills sector, even when that sector is never reheated by the inflaton. The key observation is that the axion potential is directly tied to the tunneling rate between adjacent branches. We find qualitatively new phenomena, including a new class of first-order phase transitions, bouncing bubbles, and nested "bubbles-within-bubbles." When the axion has a decay constant around the Planck scale, as motivated by the string Axiverse, the axion can be driven near the hilltop by inflationary dynamics, allowing the phase transition to be triggered. The associated energy release can be large enough to generate a significant stochastic gravitational-wave background, produce primordial black holes, or populate the Yang-Mills sector with particles. These phenomena represent novel predictions of the Axiverse and should be taken into account when assessing the cosmological impact of axions or axion-like particles. To recover conventional axion cosmology, one must suppress or avoid the dynamics discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>Tensor network simulations of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Parton Distribution functions (GPDs) are off-diagonal light-cone matrix elements that encode the internal structure of hadrons in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom. In this work, we present the first nonperturbative study of quasi-GPDs in the massive Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 dimensions (QED2), within the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice field theory. Quasi-distributions are spatial correlation functions of boosted states, which approach the relevant light-cone distributions in the luminal limit. Using tensor networks, we prepare the first excited state in the strongly coupled regime and boost it to close to the light-cone on lattices of up to 400 lattice sites. We compute both quasi-parton distribution functions and, for the first time, quasi-GPDs, and study their convergence for increasingly boosted states. In addition, we perform analytic calculations of GPDs in the two-particle Fock-space approximation and in the Reggeized limit, providing qualitative benchmarks for the tensor network results. Our analysis establishes computational benchmarks for accessing partonic observables in low-dimensional gauge theories, offering a starting point for future extensions to higher dimensions, non-Abelian theories, and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of chiral 2-flavor QCD based on an effective approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite intense experimental and theoretical research, the QCD phase diagram at finite baryon density remains to a large extent unexplored. From the theoretical side, the obvious non-perturbative approach is lattice QCD simulations, which are, however, obstructed by a severe sign problem. Here we employ the O(4) non-linear $\sigma$-model as an effective theory for 2-flavor QCD in the chiral limit. The identical pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking indicates that they belong to the same universality class. We assume high temperature dimensional reduction to the 3d O(4) model, with topological charge taking the role of the baryon number, along the lines of Skyrme's model. In this effective formulation, the baryonic chemical potential $\mu_{B}$ can be included in the lattice formulation without causing any sign problem in Monte Carlo simulations. This allows us to pin down the critical line, i.e. the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}(\mu_{B})$, which decreases monotonically for increasing $\mu_{B}$. In the range $0 &lt; \mu_{B} \lesssim 309~{\rm MeV}$ and $132~{\rm MeV} \gtrsim T_{\rm c} \gtrsim 106~{\rm MeV}$, we do not find a Critical Endpoint (CEP), although there are hints for it to be in the vicinity of the maximal $\mu_{B}$-value that we could explore.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the two-pion exchange contributions to the nucleon-nucleon interaction up to next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N$^3$LO) in covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory. Both one-loop and two-loop diagrams are calculated with the spectral functional regularization. We show that the phase shifts for partial waves with total angular momentum $3\le J\le 5$ are in better agreement with the partial wave analysis from the Nijmegen or the SAID group than their N$^2$LO counterparts. In addition, the relativistic chiral force exhibits better convergence than its non-relativistic counterpart, suggesting the importance of relativistic corrections.</description>

      <title>Universal scalarization in topological AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universal behavior of black hole scalarization induced by a charged scalar field in the extended phase space of the asymptotic AdS spacetime with three distinct horizon topologies. The results indicate that in all the three cases, the charged black hole spacetime undergoes scalarization at low temperatures. Notably, the spherical topology is unique in that its domain of scalarization theoretically extends to much higher temperatures under low pressure in the extended phase space. Moreover, the scalarization process in the spherical case exhibits complex phase transition behaviors without additional non-linear terms, which are similar to those in the planar and hyperbolic topologies with the assistance of non-linear terms. With increasing pressure in the extended phase space, the condensate of the scalarization in all three cases undergoes a transition from the first-order style to a cave-of-wind style. This study provides deeper insight into the zeroth-order phase transition during black hole scalarization and reveals the complete phase structure of black holes in the extended phase space.</description>

      <title>Verifying the failing supernova constraint on dark photons with two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on the dark photon (DP) production in collapsing stars argue that the cooling effect induced by DPs can hinder supernova explosions and lead to a ``failing supernova" constraint on the photon-DP mixing parameter $\epsilon$. In order to verify the idea, we perform two-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the DP production with the mass of 0.3 MeV. We find that the shock revival does not happen until the end of the simulations when $\epsilon\gtrsim3\times10^{-9}$. The photon-DP mixing parameter above this value can be excluded by the failing supernova argument. Interestingly, our constraint is close to the one reported by the previous studies which adopted the post-processing framework. This result motivates one to investigate a wider parameter range of DPs with self-consistent simulations and evaluate uncertainties in the constraint.</description>

      <title>Curvature Perturbations from Higgs Modulated Reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate curvature perturbations and non-Gaussianity arising from Higgs modulated reheating in the early Universe. We employ three different methods -- the period-averaging (PA) method, the exact method, and the non-perturbative $\delta N$ formalism -- to compute the power spectrum and bispectrum of curvature perturbations. Our results show that the non-perturbative $\delta N$ method provides a reliable estimate across a wide range of reheating time and Higgs field values, including regimes where the Higgs field oscillates significantly after inflation. We find that a smaller Higgs self-coupling ($\lambda$) leads to a larger curvature perturbation, with the non-Gaussianity predominantly taking a local shape. This highlights the importance of considering non-perturbative effects in calculating the curvature perturbation during Higgs modulated reheating, especially for smaller values of $\lambda$. Our findings offer valuable insights into the dynamics of reheating and the generation of primordial perturbations in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological research using hundred-meter-class radio telescopes: 21-cm intensity mapping survey strategies with QTT, JRT, and HRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding dark energy requires precision measurements of the expansion history of the universe and the growth of large-scale structure. The 21 cm intensity mapping (21 cm IM) technique enables rapid large-area surveys that can deliver these measurements. China is constructing three hundred-meter-class single-dish radio telescopes, including the QiTai 110 m Radio Telescope (QTT), the 120 m Jingdong Radio Telescope (JRT), and the 120 m Huadian Radio Telescope (HRT), whose designs are well suited for 21 cm IM cosmology. We use a Fisher-to-MCMC forecasting framework to evaluate the baryon acoustic oscillations / redshift space distortions (BAO/RSD) measurement capabilities of QTT, JRT, and HRT and propagate them to dark-energy constraints in the $w_0w_a$CDM model. Our results show that achieving a redshift coverage up to $z_{\mathrm{max}} = 1$ is crucial for fully realising the potential of hundred-meter-class single-dish telescopes for 21 cm cosmology. If all three telescopes carry out 21 cm IM surveys over the same redshift range up to $z_{\mathrm{max}}=1$ and combine their BAO/RSD measurements, QTT+JRT+HRT yield $\sigma(w_0)=0.094$ and $\sigma(w_a)=0.487$, providing tighter constraints than DESI DR2 results.</description>

      <title>How Primordial Black Holes Change BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) provide a powerful probe of early-universe physics, linking inflationary fluctuations to observable cosmological phenomena. In this work, we use a bottom-up approach to study how PBHs with masses in the range $10^{8} \leq M \leq 10^{13}\,\mathrm{g}$ modify Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) through Hawking radiation. We incorporate PBH evaporation into a reaction-network code to evaluate its impact on light-element abundances. Our analysis shows that PBH evaporation acts as an entropy injection mechanism, increasing the comoving entropy density. To reproduce the observed comoving entropy density per baryon $(s/n_{\mathrm{b}})$ from the CMB, BBN simulations must therefore begin with a smaller initial entropy than in the standard scenario without PBHs. The results also reveal a threshold near $M \approx 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$ that separates two distinct regimes of BBN behavior. As an example, for $M \geq 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$, the $^4{\mathrm{He}}$ mass fraction $Y_{\mathrm{P}}$ increases monotonically with $\beta$, driven by the enhanced Hubble expansion from PBH energy density. In contrast, for $M \leq 10^{10}\,\mathrm{g}$, $Y_{\mathrm{P}}$ exhibits non-monotonic behavior shaped by the timing of PBH evaporation and its influence on nuclear reaction rates. These findings highlight the sensitivity of BBN to PBH evaporation and establish a framework for understanding how PBH populations influence the thermal history of the early universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain localized field configurations with finite energy in a ($2+1$)-dimensional model with Maxwell and Chern-Simons gauge terms coupled to a massive complex scalar field. These non-topological solitons are characterized by the $U(1)$ frequency and a winding number. Thus, the solutions possess Noether charge and non-trivial angular momentum, which is not quantized in contrast to the topological case. We study the solitons and their integral characteristics numerically and demonstrate that they are kinematically stable. The obtained solutions allow for the thin-wall approximation in some region of frequencies. For each winding number, the Noether charge has a lower bound that coincides with an isolated point, where the non-relativistic conformal symmetry seems to be restored.</description>

      <title>Black hole binaries in shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity experience a slower merger phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, stationary black holes have a non-vanishing scalar charge. During the inspiral, the phase evolution is modified by several effects, primarily an additional scalar dipole radiation, which enters at -1PN order. This effect accelerates the inspiral when compared to general relativity, when including corrections up to 2PN. Using fully non-linear numerical simulations of quasi-circular, comparable mass binaries, we find that in the late stages the orbital dynamics are altered so that the overall effect is instead a decelerated merger phase for the modified gravity case. We attribute this to a change in the conservative dynamics, and show that at the late inspiral stage more energy must be emitted in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity to induce a given change in frequency. In longer signals, this should lead to a distinctive switch between a faster and slower frequency evolution relative to general relativity as the binary approaches merger. This work suggests we should revisit existing constraints on the theory that are obtained assuming PN approximations apply up to merger, or based on order by order approximations that neglect backreaction effects on the metric, and shows the importance of including non-linear effects that modify the gravitational sector in the strong field regime.</description>

      <title>Separating the Inseparable: Constraining Arbitrary Primordial Bispectra with Cosmic Microwave Background Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To efficiently probe primordial non-Gaussianity using Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, we require theoretical predictions that are factorizable, \textit{i.e.}\ those whose kinematic dependence can be separated. This property does not hold for many models, hindering their application to data. In this work, we introduce a general framework for constructing separable approximations to primordial bispectra, enabling direct CMB constraints on arbitrary models including those computed using numerical tools. In contrast to other approaches such as modal decompositions, we learn the basis functions directly from the data, allowing high-fidelity representations with just a handful of terms. This is practically implemented using machine-learning techniques, utilizing neural network basis functions and a loss function designed to mimic the CMB cosine similarity. We validate our pipeline using a variety of input bispectra, demonstrating that the approximations are $&gt;99.5\%$ correlated with the truth with just three terms. By incorporating the neural basis into the \textsc{PolySpec} code, we derive KSW-type CMB estimators, which reproduce local- and equilateral-type non-Gaussianity to within $0.1\sigma$. As a proof-of-concept, we constrain two inflationary bispectra from the `cosmological collider' scenario; these feature an additional strongly-mixed particle sector and cannot be computed analytically. By combining the numerical predictions from \textsc{CosmoFlow} with our factorizable approach (with just three terms), we place novel constraints on the collider models using \textit{Planck} PR4 data, finding no detection of non-Gaussianity. Our method facilitates detailed studies of the inflationary paradigm, connecting modern theoretical tools with high-resolution observational data.</description>

      <title>SL(2N,C) Hyperunification: Dynamical Tetrads, Induced Gravity, and Composite Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a four-dimensional hyperunified gauge framework in which local Lorentz symmetry and internal gauge interactions are embedded into a special noncompact $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ group acting on spinors. The accompanying tetrads are promoted to dynamical fields whose contracted invertibility condition is interpreted as a nonlinear sigma-model type length constraint. This triggers tetrad condensation and spontaneously breaks $\mathrm{SL}(2N, \mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(N)$, lifting all noncompact directions. A special ghost-free curvature-squared Lagrangian provides a consistent quadratic sector, while an Einstein--Cartan linear curvature term is shown to arise radiatively from fermion loops. Below the breaking scale only the neutral tetrad (graviton) and $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ vector fields remain massless, whereas axial-vector and tensor fields of the entire gauge multiplet acquire heavy masses. Applying the same $\mathrm{SL}(2N,\mathbb{C})$ symmetry to underlying preons in fundamental spin-$\tfrac12$ representations, rather than directly to quarks and leptons, together with the anomaly matching for the preon chiral symmetry, singles out $N=8$. The chain $\mathrm{SL}(16,\mathbb{C})\to \mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})\times\mathrm{SU}(8)$ then naturally yields three composite quark--lepton families, while filtering out extraneous heavy states.</description>

      <title>Three-loop banana integrals with three equal masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain and solve the canonical differential equations for the three-loop banana integrals in dimensional regularisation when three of the four masses are equal. The K3 surface associated with the maximal cuts factorises into a product of two elliptic curves. This allows us to express the differential forms in the canonical differential equations in terms of meromorphic modular forms. We present a rigorous proof that these differential forms only have simple poles and that they define independent cohomology classes. We also present explicit results for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals of meromorphic modular forms (and integrals thereof). This is the first time that it was possible to express the results of a Feynman integral associated with a K3 geometry and depending on two dimensionless ratios in terms of functions that have previously been studied in the literature.</description>

      <title>Limits on GeV-scale WIMP Annihilation in Dwarf Spheroidals with IceCube DeepCore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter is approximately five times more abundant than baryonic matter in the universe, but its physical nature continues to elude physicists. One potential candidate for dark matter is a weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP), which is predicted by various extensions to the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. After becoming gravitationally bound in cosmic structures, WIMPs can self-annihilate and produce SM particles including neutrinos, which are observable by detectors like IceCube. We present a search for neutrinos from low-mass $(\leq 300 \, \mathrm{GeV})$ WIMP annihilation in dwarf spheroidal galaxies with over seven years of IceCube livetime. We find no statistically significant evidence of neutrinos produced by WIMP annihilation, and therefore set upper limits on the velocity-averaged annihilation cross section $\left&lt;\sigma v\right&gt;$. Our strongest upper limits at the 90\% confidence level are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-22} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$ for WIMP annihilation directly into neutrino-antineutrino pairs. For our least sensitive channel, the corresponding limits are $\mathcal{O}\!\left(10^{-20} \, \mathrm{{cm}^{3} \, s^{-1}}\right)$, which is an improvement of over two orders of magnitude over previous IceCube limits from dwarf galaxies at the upper end of our mass range.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonium dynamics at next-to-leading order in the binding energy over temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.10289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the potential non-relativistic quantum chromodynamics (pNRQCD) effective field theory, we derive a Lindblad equation for the evolution of the heavy-quarkonium reduced density matrix that is accurate to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the ratio of the binding energy of the state to the temperature of the medium. The resulting NLO Lindblad equation can be used to more reliably describe heavy-quarkonium evolution in the quark-gluon plasma at low temperatures compared to the leading-order truncation. For phenomenological application, we numerically solve the resulting NLO Lindblad equation using the quantum trajectories algorithm. To achieve this, we map the solution of the three-dimensional Lindblad equation to the solution of an ensemble of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger evolutions with Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps. Averaging over the Monte-Carlo sampled quantum jumps, we obtain the solution to the NLO Lindblad equation without truncation in the angular momentum quantum number of the states considered. We also consider the evolution of the system using only the complex effective Hamiltonian without stochastic jumps and find that this provides a reliable approximation for the ground state survival probability at LO and NLO. Finally, we make comparisons with our prior leading-order pNRQCD results and experimental data available from the ATLAS, ALICE, and CMS collaborations.</description>

      <title>Oscillating nuclear charge radii as sensors for ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that coupling of ultralight dark matter (UDM) to quarks and gluons would lead to an oscillation of the nuclear charge radius for both the quantum chromodynamics (QCD) axion and scalar dark matter. Consequently, the resulting oscillation of electronic energy levels could be resolved with optical atomic clocks, and their comparisons can be used to investigate UDM-nuclear couplings, which were previously only accessible with other platforms. We demonstrate this idea using the ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow {}^2F_{7/2} (F=3)$ electric octupole and ${}^2S_{1/2} (F=0)\leftrightarrow \,{}^2D_{3/2} (F=2)$ electric quadrupole transitions in ${}^{171}Yb^+$. Based on the derived sensitivity coefficients for these two transitions and a long-term comparison of their frequencies using a single trapped ${}^{171}Yb^+$ ion, we find bounds on the scalar UDM-nuclear couplings and the QCD axion decay constant. These results are at a similar level compared to the tightest spectroscopic limits, and future investigations, also with other optical clocks, promise significant improvements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.12271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quasistatic electric current density of fermions in the presence of an external electric field is determined through the utilization of a time-ordered Schwinger propagator. The study encompasses the necessary conditions for establishing a well-defined time-ordered propagator within the Schwinger formalism, specifically concentrating on constant and uniform electromagnetic fields. Within this theoretical framework, a chemical potential is introduced, resulting in non-zero values for the electric current and charge number density. Consequently, the dependence of electric conductivity on the strength of the electric field and the charge number density is investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate possible bound states of the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ system in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism in the ladder and instantaneous approximations. By numerically solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a kernel that includes the contributions from $\phi$ and $J/\psi$ exchanges, we confirm the existence of a bound state in the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ system. We further investigate the partial decay widths of the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ bound state into $D\bar{D}$, $\eta_c\eta$, and $J/\psi\omega$, finding that these partial widths are sensitive to the parameter $\alpha$ in our model. Notably, we observe that the dominant decay channel for the $D_s\bar{D}_s$ bound state is that into $D\bar{D}$.</description>

      <title>Interplay between Vector-like Lepton and Seesaw Mechanism:Oblique Corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-vanishing neutrino mass strongly hints the existence of right-handed neutrinos (RHNs), singlets of the standard model (SM). However, they are highly decoupled from the SM and difficult to probe. In this work, we consider the Majorana RHNs from the type-I seesaw mechanism may well mix with the heavy neutral lepton dwelling in certain vector-like lepton (VLL), thus acquiring a sizable electroweak charge. Such a simple scenario yields many interesting consequences, and the imprint on oblique corrections, well expected from the mass splitting between components of VLL by virtue of VLL-RHN mixing, is our focus here. We analytically calculate the Peskin-Takeuchi parameters S, T and U with full details, carefully treating the Majorana loop to obtain the self consistent expressions free of divergence. Then, we constrain on the VLL-RHN system which only gives a sizable $T$ parameter using the PDG-2021 data and CDF-II data, separately, by imposing $T\lesssim{\cal O}(0.1)$. It is found that for the RHN and VLL below the TeV scale, with a properly large mixing, stands in the frontier of the electroweak precision test such as W-boson mass.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity dependence of (multi)strange hadrons in oxygen-oxygen collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}~=~7$ TeV using EPOS4 and AMPT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04096v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is anticipated that the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collect data from oxygen-oxygen ($O+O$) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV to explore the effects observed in high multiplicity proton-proton ($p+p$) and proton-lead ($p+pb$) collisions that closely related to lead-lead ($Pb+Pb$) collisions. These effects include azimuthal asymmetries in particle production, as well as variations in the abundances and momentum distributions across different hadron species, which are indicative of collective particle production mechanisms induced by the interactions in the presence of a QGP. The upcoming data on $O+O$ collisions at the LHC are expected to constrain the model parameters and refine our understanding of theoretical models. In this work, the predicted transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra, rapidity density distributions ($dN/dy$), particle yield ratios, and $p_T$-differential ratios of (multi)strange hadrons produced in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 7 TeV using AMPT and EPOS4 models are presented. AMPT focuses on preformed hadronic interactions, while EPOS4 incorporates a QGP phase. Stronger radial flow in EPOS4 as compared to AMPT is also observed. AMPT incorporates some flow effects, but the implementation of full hydrodynamic flow in EPOS4 appears to be significantly more effective in reproducing the existing experimental data. Both models predict the final state multiplicity overlap with $p+p$, $p+pb$, and $Pb+Pb$ collisions.</description>

Abstract: We present a general analytical expression for the fixed-order structure of the distribution of a generic non-global observable with the k$_t$ jet algorithm at any perturbative order. This novel formulation is obtained within the framework of the Eikonal approximation, assuming strong-energy ordering of emitted partons. The proposed formula is applicable to a wide range of processes at both lepton and hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Statistics for Pulsar Timing Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluctuations in ultralight dark matter produce significant metric perturbations, which may be detected by monitoring the arrival times of light from millisecond pulsars. While searches using this technique are already underway, they do not consistently account for the statistical properties of the dark matter field. The statistics of this field depend on the velocity dispersion of dark matter and, consequently, its coherence length. In the mass range relevant for pulsar timing arrays, the coherence length is comparable to separations between pulsars, making it crucial to incorporate its effects into the analysis. This work presents a consistent statistical method for gravitational direct detection of ultralight dark matter. Our key result is the derivation of the two-point function of the metric fluctuations, which we apply to pulsar timing and discuss its implementation in future searches.</description>

      <title>Tensor Meson Pole contributions to the HLbL piece of $a_{\mu}$ within R$\chi$T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the tensor meson pole contributions to the Hadronic Light-by-Light piece of $a_\mu$ in the purely hadronic region, using Resonance Chiral Theory. Given the differences between the dispersive and holographic groups determinations, we consider timely to present an alternative evaluation. In our approach, the lightest tensor meson nonet and two vector meson resonance nonets are considered in the chiral limit. Disregarding operators with derivatives, only the form factor $\mathcal{F}_1^T$ is non-vanishing, as assumed in the dispersive study. All parameters are determined by imposing a set of short-distance QCD constraints, and the radiative decay widths. In this case, we obtain (in units of $10^{-11}$): $ a_2$-pole: $-\left(1.02(10)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.00}_{-0.12})_{\rm syst}\right)$, $f_2$-pole: $-\left(3.2(3)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.0}_{-0.4})_{\rm syst}\right)$ and $f_2^\prime$-pole: $-\left(0.042(13)_{\rm stat}\right)$, which add up to $a_\mu^{a_2+f_2+f_2^\prime \rm -pole}=-\left(4.3^{+0.3}_{-0.5}\right)$, in close agreement with the holographic result when truncated to $\mathcal F_1^T$ only. However, with an ad-hoc extended Lagrangian, that also generates $\mathcal F_3^T$, as in the holographic approach, we have found: $ a_2$-pole: $+0.47(1.43)_{\rm norm}(3)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.06}_{-0.00})_{\rm syst}$, $f_2$-pole: $+1.18(4.18)_{\rm norm}(12)_{\rm stat}(^{+0.24}_{-0.00})_{\rm syst}$ and $f_2^\prime$-pole: $+0.040(78)_{\rm norm}(2)_{\rm stat}$, summing to $a_\mu^{a_2+f_2+f_2^\prime \rm - pole}=+1.7(4.4)$, which agree with these recent determinations within uncertainties (dominated by the $\mathcal F_3^T$ normalization). We point out that $R\chi T$ generates all form factors, the contributions to $a_\mu$ of $\mathcal F_{2,4,5}$ cannot be evaluated in the current basis, preventing for the moment a complete calculation of $a_\mu^{\rm T-poles}$ within our framework.</description>

      <title>Indications for freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the quark-gluon plasma at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The D-measure of net-charge fluctuations quantifies the variance of net charge in strongly interacting matter. It was introduced over 20 years ago as a potential signal of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, where it is expected to be suppressed due to the fractional electric charges of quarks. Measurements have been performed at RHIC and LHC, but the conclusion has been elusive in the absence of quantitative calculations for both scenarios. We address this issue by employing a recently developed formalism of density correlations and incorporate resonance decays, local charge conservation, and experimental kinematic cuts. We find that the hadron gas scenario is in fair agreement with the ALICE data for \sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.76 TeV Pb-Pb collisions only when a very short rapidity range of local charge conservation is enforced, while the QGP scenario is in excellent agreement with experimental data and largely insensitive to the range of local charge conservation. A Bayesian analysis of the data utilizing different priors yields moderate evidence for the freeze-out of charge fluctuations in the QGP phase relative to hadron gas. The upcoming high-fidelity measurements from LHC Run 2 will serve as a precision test of the two scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give the most up-to-date determinations of the normalization of the leading renormalons of the pole mass, the singlet static potential, the octet static potential, and the gluelump energy. They read $Z^{\rm MS}_m=-Z^{\rm MS}_{V_s}/2=\{0.604(17),0.551(20)\}$, $Z^{\rm MS}_{V_o}=\{0.136(8),0.121(13)\}$, and $Z^{\rm MS}_A=\{-1.343(36),-1.224(43)\}$, for $n_f=0$ and $n_f=3$ respectively. We obtain two independent renormalization group invariant and renormalization scale independent determinations of the energy of the ground state gluelump in the principal value summation scheme: $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.47(9)r_0^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.38(11)r_0^{-1}$. They combine in $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.44(7)r_0^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Pion Phenomenology from the Thermal Soft-Wall Model of Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the thermal soft-wall model of AdS/QCD, we investigate phenomenological properties of pions at finite temperature. This includes the electromagnetic (EM) form factor $F_{\pi}(Q^{2}, T)$, the thermal mass $M_{\pi}(T)$, charge radius $r_{\pi}(T)$, the generalized parton distribution (GPD) $H_{\pi}(x, Q^{2}, T)$, the charge density $\rho_{\pi}(b, T)$ of the pion, the pion-nucleon coupling constant $g_{\pi NN}(T)$, and pion-$\Delta$ baryon coupling constant $g_{\pi \Delta \Delta}(T)$ coupling constant at finite temperature. The thermal pion form factor is extrapolated from the zero-temperature case. Subsequently, the GPD is obtained at finite temperature from this form factor. The above-mentioned quantities were analyzed using a thermal dilaton field in the five-dimensional AdS action. Moreover, we determine the theoretical expression for the temperature-dependent pion-nucleon coupling constant, and the pion-$\Delta$ baryon coupling constant using thermal profile functions of the nucleon, $\Delta$ baryon and the pion. Our results show that the values of these quantities decrease with increasing temperature and vanish near the critical temperature $T_c$; except for the pion radius, which diverges at $T_c$. Our results reproduce expected features of low-energy hadron dynamics, thus validating the phenomenological utility of the thermal soft-wall model.</description>

      <title>Ultimate Quantum Precision Limit at Colliders: Conditions and Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether collider experiments can reach the quantum limit of precision, defined by the quantum Fisher information (QFI), using only classical observables such as particle momenta. As a case study, we focus on the $\tau^+\tau^-$ system and the decay channel $\tau \to \pi \nu$, which offers maximal spin-analyzing power and renders the decay a projective measurement. We develop a general framework to determine when collider measurements can, in principle, saturate the QFI in an entangled biparticle system, and this framework extends naturally to other such systems. Within this framework, QFI saturation occurs if and only if the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) commutes with a complete set of orthonormal separable projectors associated with collider-accessible measurements. This separability condition, reflecting the independence of decay amplitudes, is highly nontrivial. To meet this condition, a key requirement is that the spin density matrix be rank-deficient, allowing the SLD sufficient freedom. We show that the classical Fisher information asymptotically saturates the QFI for magnetic dipole moments and CP-violating Higgs interactions in selected phase-space regions, but not for electric dipole moments. These results bridge quantum metrology and collider physics, providing a systematic method to identify quantum-optimal sensitivity in collider experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $ n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034 $. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of non-minimally coupled inflation models such as Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$. Here we revisit the unitarity-conserving non-minimally coupled inflation model proposed in [1]. We show that when the inflaton is a complex non-minimally coupled gauge singlet scalar with additional interactions in the Jordan frame to maintain unitarity, the model predicts $n_s = 0.9730$ and $r \approx 9 \times 10^{-6}$ for scalar self-coupling $\lambda = 0.1$.</description>

Abstract: We compute the fixed-order distribution of the non-global hemisphere mass observable in $e^+ e^-$ annihilation up to four loops for various sequential recombination jet algorithms. In particular, we focus on the $k_t$ and Cambridge/Aachen algorithms. Using eikonal theory and strong-energy ordering of the final-state partons, we determine the complete structure of both abelian (clustering) and non-abelian non-global logarithms through four loops in perturbation theory. We compare the resulting resummed expressions for both jet algorithms with the standard Sudakov form factor and demonstrate that neglecting these logarithms leads to unreliable phenomenological predictions for the observable's distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an equation of state describing cold and dense matter in the core of neutron stars which includes an admixture of fermionic dark matter and incorporates nucleon effective masses derived from the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) many-body approach within a relativistic mean-field model. Such a BHF-informed mixed-model approach increases stellar compactness, with mass-radius configurations which are consistent with smaller, lighter pulsars. The model displays the expected non-monotonic behavior of sound speed hinted at by neutron star data, and is closer to the conformal bound at maximum mass. We find that the model displays tension with bounds on heavier pulsars, suggesting that the hypothesis of an aggregated dark component in neutron stars needs further critical study.</description>

      <title>Investigating DUNE oscillations sensitivity to sterile Pseudo-Dirac Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) to sterile neutrino oscillations within a $3+$(pseudo-Dirac pair) framework. We first consider a pair of two sterile neutrinos forming a pseudo-Dirac pair, then we consider a low-scale seesaw realization, that we name ``Linear-Inverse Seesaw" model. This scenario features two nearly degenerate sterile neutrino states at the keV scale, characterized by a small mass splitting arising from a small amount of lepton number violation. In this scenario, the oscillation behavior can be described in three distinct regimes depending on the sterile-sterile mass-squared difference : low ($&lt; 1\,\mathrm{eV}^2$), resonant ($1$--$100\,\mathrm{eV}^2$), and high ($&gt; 100\,\mathrm{eV}^2$) regimes, recovering in both low- and high-mass regimes an effective non-unitarity of the leptonic mixing matrix. A distinctive feature of this framework is that observable effects persist even in the low-mass limit, unlike the case of standard $3+1$ scenarios, due to rapid oscillation averaging from larger keV-scale splittings. We leverage the complementarity of both near and far detectors to explore the sensitivity for $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ disappearance and $\nu_e$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ appearance oscillation probabilities. Our analysis reveals that DUNE can achieve significant improvements over current experimental constraints, especially in neutrino appearance modes. Additionally, we show that new CP-violating phases associated with the sterile sector can dramatically alter the sensitivity, with destructive interference potentially suppressing signals by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As upcoming experiments aim to probe muon conversion with unprecedented precision, equally precise theoretical predictions are crucial to maximize discovery potential. This applies not only to the new physics signal, muon-electron conversion, but also to its only irreducible background, muon decay-in-orbit (DIO) near the endpoint. Accurate computation of higher-order corrections in bound states is a long-standing challenge due to the difficulty of systematically organizing contributions. In previous work, we developed an Effective Field Theory framework to address this issue and applied it to muon conversion. Here, we extend this approach to the DIO endpoint, a more complex problem due to the presence of a neutrino-antineutrino pair in the final state. We present the most precise prediction to date of the background spectrum relevant for future muon conversion searches, achieving next-to-leading logarithmic prime accuracy for QED corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel strategy to uncover indirect signs of new physics in collider data using the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework, offering notably improved sensitivity compared to traditional global analyses. Our approach leverages genetic algorithms to efficiently navigate the high-dimensional space of operator subsets, identifying deformations that improve agreement with data without relying on prior UV assumptions. This enables the systematic detection of SMEFT scenarios that outperform the Standard Model in explaining observed deviations. We validate the approach on current LHC and LEP measurements, perform closure tests with injected UV signals, and assess performance under high-luminosity projections. The algorithm successfully recovers relevant operator subsets and highlights directions in parameter space where deviations are most likely to emerge. Our results demonstrate the potential of SMEFT-based discovery searches driven by model selection, providing a scalable framework for future data analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles can be generated in the early universe through mechanisms such as misalignment production, thermal processes, and the decay of topological defects. In this study, we show that scalar perturbations in the early universe can produce a significant amount of these particles primarily through mass parametric resonance effects. Scalar perturbations induce temperature fluctuations during the particle mass transition era, e.g., during the QCD phase transition. These temperature fluctuations modulate the particle mass, transferring energy into the field through parametric mass resonance, a nonlinear process. This mechanism exhibits substantially unstable regions that could lead to explosive particle production. Notably, it does not generate additional isocurvature perturbations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) can seed additional small-scale matter fluctuations, leading to the formation of dense, early-collapsing dark matter structures known as minihalos. These minihalos may dramatically amplify the dark matter annihilation signal if dark matter is composed of self-annihilating thermal relic particles such as WIMPs. In this work, we analyse the annihilation signal from minihalos with prompt central cusps, $\rho \propto r^{-3/2}$, formed due to the enhanced power spectrum induced by PMFs, using gamma-ray observations of the Virgo cluster. We consider benchmarks motivated by cosmological phase transitions, focusing in particular on the electroweak and QCD transitions, where we assume maximal magnetic energy density and horizon-sized coherence length at generation (upper-limit scenarios). In addition, we include a data-driven case corresponding to the best-fit present-day PMF amplitude inferred from DESI BAO and Planck CMB measurements. Under these assumptions, we find that PMFs can place stringent bounds on WIMP annihilation. Magnetic fields with amplitudes matching the DESI-Planck best-fit values are in strong tension with self-annihilating WIMPs across a wide mass range extending beyond the TeV scale, while the electroweak- and QCD-phase-transition toy-model benchmarks would exclude thermal relics with masses below $300\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $3\,\mathrm{TeV}$, respectively. Although weaker PMFs would yield weaker annihilation signals, our results demonstrate that whenever PMFs enhance small-scale structure, indirect-detection limits on dark matter must be revisited.</description>

      <title>Optimal estimation of Higgs-Gauge Boson couplings at the future $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposed $e^+e^-$ collider offers an ideal environment for precise estimation of Higgs boson properties which are of utmost importance to validate the Standard Model of particle physics. We investigate $hVV$ couplings, where $V\in \{Z,\gamma\}$ with single Higgs production associated with $Z$ boson at the proposed $e^+e^-$ machine with $\sqrt{s}=250$ GeV, within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) framework. We employ the recoil mass of the dilepton system, to select the signal phase space, i.e, $Zh \to l^+l^-b\Bar{b}$ events. The constraints on the Wilson coefficients (WCs) are obtained using the optimal observable technique (OOT). On comparison with the current experimental limits at $68\%$ CL with $138$ fb$^{-1}$ luminosity, our limits are tighter by a factor ranging from $1.5-10$ for CP even operators, while CP-odd WCs shows comparable limits.</description>

      <title>The spectra of $bc\bar{b}\bar{c}$ tetraquark states from a diquark-antidiquark perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the diquark-antidiquark framework, this study investigates the masses of ground-state tetraquarks composed of heavy charm ($c$) and bottom ($b$) quarks and antiquarks, using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. We establish the Bethe-Salpeter equations for the fully heavy $bc\bar{b}\bar{c}$ tetraquarks to the leading order in $1/m_Q$ expansion. These equations are subsequently solved numerically under the covariant instantaneous approximation with kernels containing scalar confinement and one-gluon exchange terms. Our results show that the spectra of all possible $S$-wave tetraquark states are above the corresponding two lowest meson decay thresholds via the quark rearrangement. This implies that the ground $bc\bar{b}\bar{c}$ tetraquark states should be broad.</description>

Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of supervised machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish between isotropic and jet-like event topologies in heavy-ion collisions via the spherocity observable. State-of-the-art ML algorithms, optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, are employed to predict both traditional transverse spherocity $S_{0}$ and unweighted transverse spherocity $S_{0}^{p_{\rm T}=1}$ directly from raw event data. Moreover, the results from this study demonstrated that our approach remains largely model-independent, underscoring its potential applicability in future experimental heavy-ion physics analyses.</description>

      <title>$\lambda$ and $\rho$ Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the newly proposed tetraquark Regge trajectory relations, we investigate three series of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$ with $q,q'=u,d,s$: the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda$-trajectories. We provide rough estimates for the masses of the $\rho_1$-, $\rho_2$-, and $\lambda$-excited states. Except for the $\lambda$-trajectories, the complete forms of the other two series of Regge trajectories for bottom-charm tetraquarks are lengthy and cumbersome. We show that the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories cannot be obtained by simply imitating meson Regge trajectories, because mesons have no substructures. To derive these trajectories, the tetraquarks' structure and substructure must be taken into consideration. Otherwise, the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories would have to rely solely on fitting existing theoretical results or future experimental data. Consequently, the fundamental relationship between the slopes of the obtained trajectories and string tension would become unobvious, and the predictive power of the Regge trajectories would be compromised. Moreover, we show that the lengthy complete forms of the $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories can be well approximated by simple fitted formulas. For the bottom-charm tetraquarks $(bq)(\bar{c}\bar{q}')$ and $(cq)(\bar{b}\bar{q}')$, $\rho_1$- and $\rho_2$-trajectories exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{1/2}$ $(x=n_{r_1},n_{r_2},l_1,l_2)$, whereas $\lambda$-trajectories exhibit a behavior of $M{\sim}x^{2/3}$ $(x=N_{r},L)$. All three series of trajectories display concave downward behavior in the $(M^2,\,x)$ plane when the confining potential is linear. This conclusion holds irrespective of whether light-quark masses are included, owing to the large masses of the heavy quarks.</description>

Abstract: Generative modeling of high-energy collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) offers a data-driven route to simulations, anomaly detection, among other applications. A central challenge lies in the hybrid nature of particle-cloud data: each particle carries continuous kinematic features and discrete quantum numbers such as charge and flavor. We introduce a transformer-based multimodal flow that extends flow-matching with a continuous-time Markov jump bridge to jointly model LHC jets with both modalities. Trained on CMS Open Data, our model can generate high fidelity jets with realistic kinematics, jet substructure and flavor composition.</description>

      <title>Self-Interaction Controls Vortex Scale in Soliton Mergers</title>

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of self-interaction strength on the formation and scale of turbulent vortex structures during the merger of Bose stars, using numerical simulations of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson (GPP) equations. We find that vortex formation is a universal outcome of soliton mergers, with the vortex size strongly dependent on the self-interaction coupling parameter $g$. Through analysis of velocity correlations, kinetic energy spectra, and vorticity distributions, we conclude that for repulsive self-interaction, the vortex region expands as self-interaction strength increases; conversely, for attractive self-interaction, the vortex region shrinks as self-interaction strength increases.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass and mixing, resonant leptogenesis and charged lepton flavor violation in a minimal seesaw model with $S_4$ symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a minimal inverse seesaw model with $S_4$ symmetry for the Majorana neutrinos with only one real ($m_0$)-and two complex ($\alpha, \beta$) parameters in neutrino sector which gives reasonable predictions for the neutrino oscillation parameters, the observed baryon asymmetry of the Universe and the charged lepton flavor violation. The resulting model reveals a favor for normal neutrino mass ordering, a higher octant of $\theta_{23}$ and a lower half-plane of Dirac CP violation phase. The predictions of the model for sum of neutrino masses and the effective Majorana neutrino mass are centered around 58.98 meV and 6.2 meV, respectively. The model also provides the predictions of the baryon asymmetry and charged lepton flavour violation processes which are consistent with the experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Discovering the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ in $B$ semileptonic decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass and width of the lightest scalar open-charm state listed in the Review of Particle Physics, the $D_0^\ast(2300)$, are in puzzling tension with predictions from unitarized chiral perturbation theory (UChPT) and lattice QCD, which favor a lighter state at around $2100$ MeV. However, to date, no direct experimental evidence for this lighter state exists. In an effort to facilitate a direct observation, we introduce angular asymmetries of $B\rightarrow D \pi \ell \nu$ decays that allow for a direct extraction of the $D\pi$ S-wave phase shift and discuss a novel measurement strategy for the Belle II experiment. We conduct a sensitivity study, finding that the Belle II experiment can determine the pole location with sufficient precision to firmly establish the $D_0^\ast(2100)$ using the currently available data set. We also investigate the possibility and necessary statistics of measuring the $D\pi$ isospin 1/2 scattering length with an accuracy sufficient to distinguish between the predictions from both UChPT and lattice QCD and the measurement by ALICE using femtoscopy.</description>

      <title>Unified coupled-channel description for the five near-threshold structures $\psi(3770)$, $G(3900)$, $R(3760)$, $R(3780)$ and $R(3810)$ from $e^+e^-$ annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent observation of multiple near-threshold structures in $e^+e^-$ annihilation-including $\psi(3770)$, $G(3900)$, $R(3760)$, $R(3780)$, and $R(3810)$-reveals limitations in existing models of charmonium and exotic hadrons. In this paper, we propose a unified coupled-channel description that simultaneously incorporates all five near-threshold structures using parameters constrained by hadron spectroscopy. Our model accurately reproduces the line shapes in both $D\bar{D}$ and nonopen-charm hadron (nOCH) channels, resolves the asymmetric profile of $\psi(3770)$, and produces the $G(3900)$ bump. We identify the $R(3780)$ as the dominant manifestation of $\psi(3770)$, attribute $R(3760)$ to $D\bar{D} \to \text{nOCH}$ rescattering and suggest that $R(3810)$ arises from coupling between the $\psi(1D)$ state and the $h_c\pi\pi$ channel. The significant non-$D\bar{D}$ decay of $\psi(3770)$ is explained by its near-threshold position. This analysis provides a coherent, unquenched framework centered on a charmonium $\psi(1D)$ core for near-threshold phenomena and offers a predictive approach extendable to bottomonium systems and future data from Belle II.</description>

      <title>Flavor Imprints on Novel Low Mass Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Majorana scotogenic-like loop framework in which neutrino mass generation and dark matter stability are intrinsically connected to the breaking of the discrete flavor symmetry $A_4$. This breaking leads to the emergence of the scoto-seesaw mechanism and a $Z_2$ symmetry. This naturally explains the solar and atmospheric mass-squared differences, $\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$, while simultaneously ensuring dark matter stability. Our model accommodates normal ordering of neutrino masses, with a generalized $\mu$-$\tau$ reflection symmetry shaping the structure of leptonic mixing and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Moreover, the model provides predictions for the octant of $\theta_{23}$ and a strong correlation between $\Delta m_{sol}^{2}$ and $\Delta m_{atm}^{2}$. This correlation puts a lower bound on the fermionic DM mass. In contrast, scalar dark matter remains viable over a broad mass spectrum. A notable feature is that the low mass regime ($\sim 15$ GeV onwards) survives owing to the presence of efficient co-annihilation channels, which are typically absent in the Majorana scotogenic scenario. Additionally, the model aligns with current and future limits from lepton flavor violation experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A false vacuum could be a profound ingredient of fundamental physics, yet its direct detection in laboratories is hindered when the lifetime is exponentially long. Conventional static phase diagrams often discard metastable false vacuum, we show that, however, in a dynamical treatment of a first-order QCD phase transition at large quark chemical potential that strongly suppresses tunneling, cosmologically longevous, and thus indispensable false vacuum naturally arises, and makes nontrivial contribution to constituting primordial quark objects. We identify two distinct branches of such primordial quark objects: quark star crusted with false vacuum, and nugget specifically referring to quark star in global false vacuum, which may account for a population of small compact stars. False vacuum in primordial objects hopefully decays during the long time since the early Universe, and its vacuum energy can power ultra-energetic long {\gamma}-ray bursts and kHz gravitational waves within multi-messenger facilities, rendering itself an astrophysical and thus testable phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that there exists a remarkable correlation among the three elements in the first row of the $3\times 3$ lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$: $|U^{}_{e1}|^2 = 2 \left(|U^{}_{e2}|^2 + |U^{}_{e3}|^2\right)$, which holds even though $U$ is non-unitary in the canonical seesaw mechanism. This ``first-row correlation" is fully consistent with $\sin^2\theta^{}_{12} = \left(1 - 2\tan^2\theta^{}_{13}\right)/3$ for the two active neutrino mixing angles derived from the TM1 flavor mixing pattern, and it will be {\it directly} tested by the upcoming JUNO precision data combined with the Daya Bay precision measurement.</description>

Abstract: We study chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in accelerating and rotating frames using low-energy effective models. By analyzing the chiral condensate in Rindler coordinates, we show that different renormalization schemes lead to distinct conclusions in accelerating frame: the scheme with subtracting divergences in Rindler vacuum supports an acceleration-independent critical temperatures, while the other scheme with subtracting divergences in Minkowski vacuum suggests enhanced critical temperature. We further investigate system with both rotation and acceleration. We find that the critical acceleration (see definition in Section V) for chiral symmetry restoration decreases with angular velocity, indicating cooperative effects from acceleration-induced thermalization and rotation-induced effective chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Impact of reactor antineutrinos on the neutrino floor in low-mass WIMP-like dark matter searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sensitivity of conventional direct dark matter searches for weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) is ultimately limited by coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS), which produces nuclear recoils indistinguishable from WIMP signals and defines the so-called neutrino floor. While the effects of solar neutrinos, geoneutrinos, diffuse supernova neutrinos, and atmospheric neutrinos have been extensively studied in this context, the contribution from reactor antineutrinos has received comparatively little attention. We present the first systematic evaluation of how reactor antineutrino fluxes, modeled as a function of reactor-detector distance, modify the neutrino floor for low-mass WIMP searches using SuperCDMS-like high-voltage germanium detectors. Both discovery-limit and opacity-based formulations of the neutrino floor are examined under consistent assumptions. We find that proximity to gigawatt-scale reactors within 10 km can raise the neutrino floor by up to a few orders of magnitude, significantly reducing the sensitivity to sub-10 GeV/c^2 dark matter. Beyond 100 km, the reactor contribution becomes negligible. These conclusions hold for both definitions of the neutrino floor and remain stable under reasonable variations in detector quenching, site-dependent geoneutrino flux, and reactor antineutrino flux uncertainties, emphasizing reactor proximity as a critical factor in site selection for future low-threshold dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Masses of Purely Top-Quark Bound States: Toponium and the Triply-Top Baryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudoscalar ($\eta_t$) and vector ($\psi_t$) toponium states, as well as the triply-top baryon ($\Omega_{ttt}$), using the QCD sum-rule method. This study was motivated by the recent observation of a pseudoscalar enhancement near the $t\bar{t}$ threshold, reported by the CMS and ATLAS collaborations with a statistical significance exceeding $5\sigma$. In the calculations, we consider both the perturbative and nonperturbative contributions, with the nonperturbative operators taken into account up to dimension eight. The results obtained for the pseudoscalar toponium provide a theoretical estimate that is consistent with the near-threshold events observed in recent experimental studies. The calculated negative binding energy for both the pseudoscalar and vector toponium states reflects the strong correlation within the $t\bar{t}$ system and can be interpreted as $t\bar{t}$ bound states, while the calculated central mass for the $\Omega_{ttt}$ slightly exceeds the central value of the sum of the constituent top-quark masses. The results of this study can provide a precise theoretical guide for future experimental investigations of these states, which are composed entirely of top quarks, at high-energy colliders such as the LHC and future facilities like the FCC.</description>

      <title>Modified TM2 for Reproducing All Best-Fit Values of Neutrino Mixing Angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As measurements of neutrino mixing angles continue to become more precise, it is increasingly likely that in the very near future a realistic neutrino mixing model will be required to precisely reproduce their best-fit values. In this study, a modified TM$_2$ mixing model which reproduces the best-fit values of all three neutrino mixing angles is proposed. The model reproduces the correct mixing angles within 1$\sigma$ of the current central values and is robust against any future changes of the best-fit values.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial Matter Effects on Reactor Antineutrino Oscillations: Constant vs. Fluctuated Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JUNO Collaboration has recently released its first reactor antineutrino oscillation result, achieving unprecedented precision in the measurement of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\sin^2\theta_{12}$. We emphasize that the accurate determination and modeling of the terrestrial matter density profile are fundamental for extracting the oscillation parameters and probing the neutrino mass ordering. This paper presents a realistic piecewise-constant model for the shallow crustal density profile along the baselines from Taishan and Yangjiang to the experimental hall, based on geological and petrophysical information. The uncertainty in the density profiles arises from variations in the density and length of each segment, both of which are conservatively estimated to be 10%. A careful comparison of constant and fluctuated density profiles is provided and the implications for the precision measurement of oscillation parameters are discussed. Finally, we also discuss the prospect of shallow crust tomography in future reactor neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Modified Tri-bimaximal neutrino mixing confronted by JUNO $\theta_{12}$ measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The JUNO collaboration has released its first measurement of reactor neutrino oscillations results, obtaining $\sin^2\theta_{12} = 0.3092\pm 0.0087$, an improvement in precision by a factor of 1.6 over previous combined results. We confront the minimally modified tri-bimaximal mixing pattern with the new data. Before the measurement of a non-zero $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle, the tri-bimximal mixing pattern is one of the most popular simple mixing scheme for neutrinos. Modifications have been proposed to keep some features of tri-bimaximal mixing and make it to be consistent with data. Minimal modifications preserving one column of the tri-bimaximal mixing matrix, yielding three patterns: a) unchanged third, b) unchanged second and c) unchanged first column. Pattern a) is excluded since it keeps $\theta_{13}=0$. Pattern b) predicts $V_{e2} = 1/\sqrt{3}$ and specific CP phase correlations, but JUNO's smaller $|V_{e2}|$ disfavors it at more than 3.5$\sigma$. Pattern c), predicting $V_{e2} = \cos\tau/\sqrt{3}$, can be in agreement with current data within 1$\sigma$, and implies $\sin^2\theta_{12} = (1-3\sin^2\theta_{13})/3(1-\sin^2\theta_{13})$ and CP violating quantity $\sin \theta = \pm 0.998$. The negative sign favors the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy. Upcoming experiments can further test this scenario.</description>

      <title>Spinodal Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.15478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We uncover a new gravitational-wave production mechanism in cosmological, first-order, thermal phase transitions. These are usually assumed to proceed via the nucleation of bubbles of the stable phase inside the metastable phase. However, if the nucleation rate is sufficiently suppressed, then the Universe may supercool all the way down the metastable branch and enter the spinodal region. In this case the transition proceeds via the exponential growth of unstable modes and the subsequent formation, merging and relaxation of phase domains. We use holography to follow the real-time evolution of this process in a strongly coupled, four-dimensional gauge theory. The resulting gravitational wave spectrum differs qualitatively from that in transitions mediated by bubble nucleation. We discuss the possibility that the spinodal dynamics may be preceded by a period of thermal inflation.</description>

      <title>Diamagnetic microchip traps for levitated nanoparticle entanglement experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Gravity Mediated Entanglement (QGEM) protocol offers a novel method to probe the quantumness of gravitational interactions at non-relativistic scales. This protocol leverages the Stern-Gerlach effect to create $\mathcal{O}(\sim \mu m)$ spatial superpositions of two nanodiamonds (mass $\sim 10^{-15}$ kg) with NV spins, which are then allowed to interact and become entangled solely through the gravitational interaction. Since electromagnetic interactions such as Casimir-Polder and dipole-dipole interactions dominate at this scale, screening them to ensure the masses interact exclusively via gravity is crucial. In this paper, we propose using magnetic traps based on micro-fabricated wires, which provide strong gradients with relatively modest magnetic fields to trap nanoparticles for interferometric entanglement experiments. The design consists of a small trap to cool the center-of-mass motion of the nanodiamonds and a long trap with a weak direction suitable for creating macroscopic superpositions. In contrast to permanent-magnet-based long traps, the micro-fabricated wire-based approach allows fast switching of the magnetic trapping and state manipulation potentials and permits integrated superconducting shielding, which can screen both electrostatic and magnetic interactions between nanodiamonds in a gravitational entanglement experiment. The setup also provides a possible platform for other tests of quantum coherence in macroscopic systems and searches for novel short-range forces.</description>

      <title>Study of primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ with the cross-correlations between the scalar-induced gravitational waves and the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02500v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background originating from cosmic sources contains vital information about the early universe. In this work, we comprehensively study the cross-correlations between the energy-density anisotropies in scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) and the temperature anisotropies and polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). In our analysis of the angular power spectra for these cross-correlations, we consider all contributions of the local-type primordial non-Gaussianity $f_{\mathrm{NL}}$ and $g_{\mathrm{NL}}$ that can lead to large anisotropies. We show that the angular power spectra are highly sensitive to primordial non-Gaussianity. Furthermore, we project the sensitivity of future gravitational-wave detectors to detect such signals and, consequently, measure the primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is important to explore the potential existence of lepton asymmetry in the neutrino sector. Conducting a joint analysis of DESI DR2 BAO data and \emph{Planck} 2018 CMB data, we obtain the upper limits on the neutrino degeneracy parameter, i.e., $\xi&lt;0.56$ for the normal mass hierarchy while $\xi&lt;0.62$ for the inverted mass hierarchy, at 95\% confidence level. Considering the influence of the dynamical dark energy, we find that these upper limits remain to be robust. This work may provide helpful implications for model buildings of the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11047v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of geons, physical states of self-bound gravitons, has long been proposed. In the context of four-dimensional causal dynamical triangulation simulations we investigate this possibility by measuring curvature-curvature correlators of different gravitational operators. We find a behavior consistent with a massive state, independent of the operators considered, over a certain distance window. While at most a hint, this is tantalizing due to its possible implications for dark matter or (primordial) black holes. We also find indications that the phase of rapid expansion of the obtained de Sitter universe impacts the mass, and relates to quantum fluctuations of space-time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) data from observed binary black hole coalescences (BBHC) have been demonstrated in recent analyses to validate the Hawking Area Theorem (HAT) for black hole horizons. The result of such analyses is imposed here as a criterion of {\it absolute} consistency on the logarithmic (in horizon area) corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking Area Formula (BHAF) for the black hole entropy, when these corrections are computed both from non-perturbative quantum fluctuations of spacetime in matter-free quantum general relativity, as well as arising due to perturbative quantum matter field fluctuations around a stationary classical black hole background spacetime. This criterion of absolute consistency is seen to be obeyed provided certain restrictions ensue on the spin-parity and number of species of the spectrum of quantum matter fluctuations. Such constraints appear to restrict the Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) part of the matter fluctuation spectrum. Some species of the constrained, yet-unobserved BSM particle spectrum are currently under active consideration in particle cosmology as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there are no scale-invariant one-loop corrections to the superhorizon tensor perturbations from small-scale (potentially enhanced) scalar perturbations, irrespective of the details of inflationary background time evolution. For this purpose we derive a soft tensor effective field theory at leading order in the gradient expansion by integrating out small-scale scalar fluctuations in a general time-dependent background over the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, i.e., we perform loop calculations in the soft limit of external momentum. The absence of scale-invariant corrections originates from the diffeomorphism invariance of general relativity and is therefore unavoidable.</description>

      <title>20 GeV halo-like excess of the Galactic diffuse emission and implications for dark matter annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fifteen years of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) data in the halo region of the Milky Way (MW) are analyzed to search for gamma rays from dark matter annihilation. Gamma-ray maps within the region of interest ($|l| \le 60^\circ$, $10^\circ \le |b| \le 60^\circ$) are modeled using point sources, the GALPROP models of cosmic-ray interactions, isotropic background, and templates of Loop I and the Fermi bubbles, and then the presence of a halo-like component is further examined. A statistically significant halo-like excess is found with a spectral peak around 20 GeV, while its flux is consistent with zero below 2 GeV and above 200 GeV. Examination of the fit residual maps indicates that a spherically symmetric halo component fits the map data well. The radial profile agrees with annihilation by the smooth NFW density profile, and may be slightly shallower than this, especially in the central region. Various systematic uncertainties are investigated, but the 20 GeV peak remains significant. In particular, the halo excess with a similar spectrum is detected even relative to the LAT standard background model, which contains non-template patches adjusted to match the observed map. The halo excess spectrum can be fitted by annihilation with a particle mass $m_\chi \sim$ 0.5-0.8 TeV and cross section $\langle \sigma \upsilon \rangle \sim$ (5-8)$\times 10^{-25} \ \rm cm^3 \, s^{-1}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ channel. This cross section is larger than the upper limits from dwarf galaxies and the canonical thermal relic value, but considering various uncertainties, especially the density profile of the MW halo, the dark matter interpretation of the 20 GeV ``Fermi halo'' remains feasible. The prospects for verification through future observations are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Testing signatures of phantom crossing through full-shape galaxy clustering analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey, when combined with measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNIa), provide compelling evidence for a phantom crossing at late times, along with statistically significant deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate the role of redshift-space galaxy clustering data by employing the pre-reconstruction full-shape (FS) galaxy power spectrum from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) data release 12 (DR12) sample. This dataset is analyzed in combination with BAO measurements from DESI data release 2 (DR2) and various SNIa samples. Our analysis demonstrates that the joint combination of these datasets can yield deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at a significance level of up to $\sim 5\sigma$, suggesting strong indications that the dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)$ may have crossed the phantom divide ($w = -1$) in the redshift range $z \sim 0.4$-$0.5$. The precise location and strength of this crossing depend on the adopted theoretical parameterizations. Importantly, our results reveal that this trend persists even in the absence of CMB data, underscoring the robustness of the FS power spectrum as a powerful and independent probe for testing dark energy models and for distinguishing between competing cosmological scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We consider phenomenological models for nonsingular black holes that satisfy the limiting curvature condition (i.e., that have curvatures that are always sub-Planckian in size) while having a more general dependence on the black hole mass than the most studied examples. These models allow black holes to exist while having regulators that are larger than the horizon scale; it has been shown previously that this can lead to observable consequences in an astrophysical setting, for allowed choices for the regulator scale. Noting that substantial horizon-scale modifications of the metric will affect black hole thermodynamics and Hawking radiation, we study these metrics in the context of primordial black hole dark matter. Considering examples with de\,Sitter and Minkowski cores, respectively, we study the effect of the regulator in these metrics on the allowed black hole mass ranges (or ``bands"), the black hole temperature, specific heat and lifetime, and the bounds on the primordial black hole fraction of the total dark matter density from the observed extragalactic gamma ray background.</description>

      <title>$A_{\beta}[E_{\beta}]$ in $^{37}$K decay: new physics with opposite $\beta$ helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By extending our analysis and simulations of our $^{37}$K $\beta$-decay data set to allow the $\beta$ asymmetry with respect to nuclear spin to vary with $\beta$ energy $E_{\beta}$, we have gained sensitivity to new physics that depends on a helicity factor for the $\beta$, $m_\beta/E_\beta$.
  In particular, we constrain Lorentz scalar and tensor quark-lepton interaction strengths at a sensitivity complementary to the similar Fierz interference term in neutron $\beta$ decay.
  Our result for that new physics is a Fierz interference term $b$ = 0.033 $\pm$ 0.084 (stat) $\pm$ 0.039 (syst),
  consistent with the standard model electroweak interaction value $b=0$. We consider presently achieved complementarity to $\beta$-decay and particle physics experiments, along with projectable technical improvements to our method.</description>

      <title>New GPU developments in the Madgraph CUDACPP plugin: kernel splitting, helicity streams, cuBLAS color sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first production release of the CUDACPP plugin for the Madgraph5 aMC@NLO generator, which speeds up matrix element (ME) calculations for leading-order (LO) processes using a data parallel approach on vector CPUs and GPUs, was delivered in October 2024. This has been described in previous publications by the team behind that effort. In this paper, I describe my work on some additional developments and optimizations of CUDACPP, mainly but not exclusively for GPUs. The new approach, which represents a major restructuring of the CUDACPP computational engine, mainly consists in splitting the calculation of the ME, which was previously performed using a single large GPU kernel, into many smaller kernels. A first batch of changes, involving the move to separate "helicity streams" and the optional offloading of QCD color sums to BLAS, also via GPU tensor cores, was recently merged into a new production release of CUDACPP, in collaboration with my colleagues. Since then, I have completed a second batch of changes, which I now also consider ready to be merged in production, involving the possibility to split the calculation into groups of Feynman diagrams in separate source code files. This new feature makes it possible to compute QCD matrix elements for physics processes with a larger number of final state gluons: in particular, I present the first performance results from CUDACPP for the $2\!\rightarrow\!6$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}gggg$ on CPUs and GPUs and the $2\!\rightarrow\!7$ process $gg\!\rightarrow\!t\bar{t}ggggg$ on CPUs, which involve over 15k and 230k Feynman diagrams, respectively. I also take this opportunity to describe in detail some features of the CUDACPP software which had not yet been documented, both in the GPU and vector CPU implementations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Very High Energy Gamma-Ray Absorption in Cosmic Propagation under the Combined Effects of Axion-Like Particles and Lorentz Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very high energy (VHE) gamma rays with energies above 100 GeV are expected to experience strong attenuation during cosmic propagation due to pair production with the extragalactic background light (EBL). However, recent observations-particularly the detection of GRB 221009A with photons up to 18 TeV by LHAASO and a 300 TeV photon by Carpet-3,pose a significant challenge to conventional EBL absorption models. These extraordinarily high-energy photons suggest the presence of new physics influencing photon propagation over cosmological distances. The gamma-ray spectrum in the tens-to-hundreds of TeV range provides a powerful probe of possible Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) or photon-axion-like particle (ALP) mixing in cosmic magnetic fields. Yet, when treated independently, neither LIV nor ALPs can fully explain the observed transparency of the Universe to VHE gamma rays. In this work, we propose a unified framework that combines both effects-ALPs and LIV-to account for the unexpectedly high survival probability of VHE photons. We analyze the multi-wavelength spectrum of GRB 221009A under this hybrid model and demonstrate that the combined influence of ALPs, characterized by a coupling constant $g_{a\gamma} = 1.685 \times 10^{-10},\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}$ and mass ($m_a = 9.545 \times 10^{-8},\mathrm{eV}$) alongside second-order LIV characterized by an energy scale $E_{\rm LIV,2} = (1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56}) \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ adopted from the literature, significantly enhances the photon survival probability across the 10-300 TeV range. This synergistic ALP-LIV model provides a coherent explanation for the observed extreme-energy transparency of the Universe and the delayed arrival of ultra-high-energy photons, offering valuable insights into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. Entanglement growth occurs inside the causal cone, and saturates through a string-breaking mechanism driven by screening excitations. In dipole-dipole scattering, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.</description>

      <title>Effects of short-range correlations at high densities on neutron stars with and without DM content: role of the repulsive self-interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how short-range correlations affect relativistic hadronic models at high densities, with direct consequences for the structure of neutron stars, both with and without dark matter content. Two versions of the model are examined: one with vector self-interactions up to second order ($\omega_0^2$) and another including a fourth-order term ($\omega_0^4$). We show that SRC tend to soften the equation of state when only the quadratic term is present, but produce a noticeable stiffening once the $\omega_0^4$ term is included. The corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff solutions for pure neutron stars indicate that short-range correlations reduce the maximum mass in the first case but increase it in the second. Extending the analysis to stars containing a fermionic dark matter component, within the two-fluid formalism, we verify that the same features appear in the respective mass-radius diagrams. In particular, the decrease of the maximum mass with increasing dark matter fraction is partly compensated by the SRC effects in the hadronic sector for the model with the fourth-order term. In all cases, the resulting parametrizations are consistent with recent astrophysical constraints, including the joint NICER-XMM-Newton analyses of the pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0740+6620, as well as the gravitational-wave event GW190425.</description>
