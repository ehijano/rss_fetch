      <title>Quasi-confined modes produced by the Lugiato-Lefever model with a localized pump and the pseudo-Raman term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an extended nonlinear Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE) with the pseudo-stimulated-Raman-scattering (pseudo-SRS) cubic term, linear damping/gain, and spatial inhomogeneous (weakly or strongly localized) pump. The LLE is derived, in the extended adiabatic approximation, from the underlying Zakharov system (ZS), which includes a viscosity term, acting on its low-frequency (LF) component, and the pump supporting the high-frequency (HF) one. Dynamics of quasi-solitons in the model is addressed by means of analytical and numerical methods. The sech-based approximation for the quasi-soliton predicts it as a stable fixed point (FP) of the system of evolution equations for the moments of the system moments (the HF norm, wave momentum, and center-of-mass coordinate). The attraction basin of the FP is identified too. The prediction is corroborated by direct simulations of the full LLE. A quasi-singular mode, supported by the delta-functional pump, is briefly considered too.</description>

      <title>Kink-Driven Chimera Motion with Quantized Velocity in a Chain of Interacting Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate chimera synchronization of internal oscillator states in a ring of interacting particles, using the damped dc-driven Frenkel--Kontorova chain model as an example. In a system with a spatially periodic potential, a dc external force, and dissipation, kinks spontaneously emerge and stabilize. We show that these kinks induce and govern a collective motion of the entire chimera pattern of internal states along the ring. In particular, the average velocity of this motion depends linearly on the number of kink pairs. This number is effectively determined by localized initial perturbations of particle positions, thereby opening a pathway for controlling macroscopic transport through microscopic excitations.</description>

      <title>Atypical Chimera States in an Ensemble of Partially Mobile Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of nonuniform motion of oscillators in a ring chain with nonlocal coupling on their collective dynamics and reveal the mechanism behind the emergence of an atypical chimera state in such systems. The mechanism relies on regular spatially inhomogeneous motion of oscillators, which breaks the symmetry of the effective interaction kernel. This symmetry breaking induces spatial phase correlations in the asynchronous part of the system, giving rise to nonuniformly twisted and previously unobserved coherent-incoherent-twisted states.</description>

      <title>Dynamics due to competitive flip cycles in active Potts models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium spatiotemporal patterns have been extensively studied. However, a single oscillator or cyclic loop of states is typically employed at each site in theories and simulations. Here, we investigated how competition among multiple identical cyclic loops at each site alters patterns. We simulated active Potts models with standard Potts interactions between neighboring sites in two-dimensional square lattices. When multiple three-state cycles exist in state flips, such as in octahedral and square-antiprism networks, all types of spiral waves comprising the three states are formed simultaneously at high flip energies. However, at lower energies, only one or a few types emerge and switch stochastically into different types. At even lower energies, cyclic changes in single-state dominant homogeneous phases emerge [homogeneous cycling (HC) mode]. At intermediate flip energies, the spiral wave and HC modes temporally coexist in small systems but do not switch between each other in large systems. Conversely, when multiple four-state cycles exist in six-state and cubic networks, one state remains dominant for the entire range of flip energies, whereas the other states occasionally form domains at intermediate flip energies. Therefore, the number of spatially coexisting states can be controlled using flip networks and energies.</description>

      <title>Multi-pole solitons and breathers with spatially periodic modulation induced by the helicoidal spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report analytical solutions for diverse multi-pole (MP) soliton and breather states in spatially inhomogeneous binary Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with the helicoidally shaped spin-orbit coupling (SOC), including MP stripe solitons on zero background, MP beating stripe solitons on a nonzero plane-wave background, as well as MP beating stripe solitons and MP breathers on periodic backgrounds. The results indicate that modulation effects produced by the helicoidal SOC not only induce stripe patterns in MP solitons, but also generate the spatially-periodic background for the MP beating stripe solitons and breathers. An asymptotic analysis reveals curved trajectories with a logarithmically increasing soliton/breather separation for these MP excitations, fundamentally distinguishing them from periodic trajectories of bound-state solitons/breathers or straight trajectories of conventional multi-soliton/breather sets. With complex periodic structures in individual components, the total density distribution is nonperiodic, due to their configurations which are out-of-phase with respect to the two components. We further examine several degenerate structures of MP solitons and breathers under varying SOC and spectral parameters. Numerical simulations validate the analytical results and demonstrate stability of these MP excitations. These findings may facilitate deeper understanding of soliton/breather interactions beyond conventional multi-soliton systems and bound-state complexes in SOC BEC.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and fluctuations of CMOS ring oscillators close to criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a thermodynamically consistent model of CMOS-based ring oscillators near the onset of coherent voltage oscillations. For driving voltages close to the critical value, we derive the normal form of the Hopf bifurcation that underlies the oscillation transition in the thermodynamic limit. Using this normal form, we determine the phase and amplitude dynamics, and demonstrate that entropy dissipation decreases in the oscillating state for ring oscillators with more than three inverters. These findings culminate in a stability-dissipation relation, which links the observed decrease in dissipation to an increase in the local stability of the oscillating state. Next, we characterize finite-size fluctuations of the amplitude and phase near the critical voltage, using a stochastic version of the normal form. We demonstrate that close to the transition, finite-size fluctuations remain important at arbitrary system size, introducing oscillations even below the critical voltage. We further show that these noise-induced oscillations have an anomalously short decoherence time that scales sub-linearly with the system-size, in contrast to the behavior far from criticality.</description>

      <title>Observation of linear and nonlinear light trapping on topological dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological dislocations in otherwise periodic lattices represent global structural defects that, nevertheless, typically leave the lattice periodicity intact far from the dislocation. Such dislocations arise in diverse physical systems ranging from crystalline solids, acoustic and photonic lattices and crystals to matter waves in optical lattices. Dislocations drastically affect the evolution of wave excitations in their vicinity, enabling novel mechanisms for trapping on topological defects and controlling the energy flow. Moreover, when combined with nonlinearity, such systems give rise to new types of self-sustained states of topological origin that have never been observed to date. Here we demonstrate experimentally, for the first time at optical frequencies, the waveguiding at various types of topological edge dislocations, resulting in the formation of localized photonic eigenstates with distinct and tunable shapes. Using femtosecond laser-writing techniques, we fabricated waveguide arrays with precisely tailored dislocation parameters, enabling full control over the degree of localization and internal structure of the associated modes. We further demonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that in the high-power regime, the families of thresholdless dislocation solitons bifurcate from such modes, which inherit shape diversity of their linear counterparts. Our results reveal a nontrivial interplay between nonlinearity and global lattice deformations and establish dislocation solitons as a new class of nonlinear topological states. They may stimulate the observation of new types of nonlinear states and interaction scenarios for excitations in nonlinear physical systems, where lattices with controllable global deformations can be created.</description>

      <title>The stochastic discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation: microscopic derivation and finite-temperature phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic version of the one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation (DNSE), which is derived from first principles, and thus possesses all the properties required by statistical mechanics, such as detailed balance and the H-theorem. The stochastic version shows disordered and localised dynamics, and displays a corresponding phase transition at a finite temperature value. The phase transition can be captured in a quantitative way by a mean-field type approach. The corresponding coarsening dynamics shows an unexpected dependence on the noise strength, which is reminiscent of stochastic resonance. The phase transition is linked with negative temperature phase transitions, which have been reported recently for the Hamiltonian dynamics of the DNSE. Our approach gives a clue to how these negative temperature phase transitions can be implemented in experimental setups, which are inevitably coupled to a positive temperature heat bath.</description>

      <title>From Toggle to Tuning: Controlling Turing Patterns in Gene Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling spatial patterns in synthetic biological systems remains challenging due to poor parameter robustness and limited experimental tunability. We introduce two complementary mechanisms-the pattern switch and the pattern dial-to systematically control Turing pattern formation in gene circuits. The switch toggles pattern onset via a single parameter, while the dial enables transitions between distinct pattern types using weakly nonlinear amplitude equations. Analyzing network size reveals a key trade-off: small networks are easier to control but less robust, while larger networks gain robustness at the cost of tunability-suggesting a sweet spot for both evolvability and designability. Our results offer practical design rules for engineering programmable patterns in living systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11584v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: {The problem of laser beam concentration in a focal spot via wavefront variations is formulated as a maximization of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$ defined as the light power passing through aperture of an arbitrary shape located in the far field. Variational principle provides the necessary and sufficient conditions for at least the $local$ $maximum$ of the $beam$ $propagation$ $functional$. The wavefront shape is obtained as an exact solution of nonlinear integral equation. }</description>
