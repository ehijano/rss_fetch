      <title>Universal thermalization dynamics in (1+1)d QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the universal mechanism behind the thermalization of (1+1)d QFTs at high and low temperatures. Viewing these theories as CFTs perturbed by relevant or irrelevant deformations, we show that conformal perturbation theory in the thermal state breaks down at late times allowing for the emergence of hydrodynamics. This breakdown occurs universally due to the unsuppressed exchange of stress tensors near the lightcone. Furthermore, for theories with central charge $c\rightarrow\infty$ we solve for the emergent hydrodynamic theory to all orders in the gradient expansion by arguing that all transport parameters appearing in two-point functions have universal expressions in terms of the scaling dimension $\Delta$ of the perturbation. The radius of convergence of the hydrodynamic dispersion relations provides an early time cutoff for hydrodynamics, which agrees with the time scale at which conformal perturbation theory breaks down.</description>

      <title>Cambridge Lectures on The Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These lecture notes cover the Standard Model (SM) course for Part III of the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos, taught during the years 2020-2023. The course comprised 25 lectures and 4 example classes. Following a brief historical introduction, the SM is constructed from first principles. We begin by demonstrating that essentially only particles with spin/helicity $0, \frac{1}{2}, 1, \frac{3}{2}, 2$ can describe matter and interactions, using spacetime symmetries, soft theorems, gauge redundancies, Ward identities, and perturbative unitarity. The remaining freedom lies in the choice of the Yang-Mills gauge group and matter representations. Effective field theories (EFTs) are a central theme throughout the course, with the 4-Fermi interactions and chiral perturbation theory serving as key examples. Both gravity and the SM itself are treated as EFTs, specifically as the SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory). Key phenomenological aspects of the SM are covered, including the Higgs mechanism, Yukawa couplings, the CKM matrix, the GIM mechanism, neutrino oscillations, running couplings, and asymptotic freedom. The discussion of anomalies and their non-trivial cancellations in the SM is detailed. Simple examples of calculations, such as scattering amplitudes and decay rates, are provided. The course concludes with a brief overview of the limitations of the SM and an introduction to the leading proposals for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points of Quantum Gravity from Dimensional Regularisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $\beta$-functions of quantum gravity using dimensional regularisation. In contrast to minimal subtraction, a non-minimal renormalisation scheme is employed which is sensitive to power-law divergences from mass terms or dimensionful couplings. By construction, this setup respects global and gauge symmetries, including diffeomorphisms, and allows for systematic extensions to higher loop orders. We exemplify this approach in the context of four-dimensional quantum gravity. By computing one-loop $\beta$-functions, we find a non-trivial fixed point. It shows two real critical exponents and is compatible with Weinberg's asymptotic safety scenario. Moreover, the underlying structure of divergences suggests that gravity becomes, effectively, two-dimensional in the ultraviolet. We discuss the significance of our results as well as further applications and extensions to higher loop orders.</description>

      <title>Geometric phase assisted detection of Lorentz-invariance violation from modified dispersion at high energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many theories of quantum gravity propose Lorentz-violating dispersion relations of the form $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}=|\mathbf{k}|f(|\mathbf{k}|/M_\star)$, which approximately recover to the Lorentz invariance, $\omega_{|\mathbf{k}|}\approx|\mathbf{k}|$, at the energy scales much below $M_\star$. However, usually such a scale is assumed to be near the Planck scale, thus the feature of the Lorentz-violating theory is weak and its experimental test becomes extremely challenging. Since the geometric phase (GP) is of accumulative and sensitive nature to weak effects, here we explore the GP acquired by an inertial atomic detector that is coupled to a quantum field with this kind of Lorentz-violating dispersion. We show that for the Lorentz-violating field theory case the GP depends on the velocity of the detector, which is quite different from the Lorentz symmetry case where the GP is independent of the detector's velocity. In particular, we show that the GP may present a drastic low-energy Lorentz violation for any $f$ that dips below unity somewhere. We apply our analysis to detecting the polymer quantization motivated by loop quantum gravity, and show the detector acquires an experimentally detectable GP with the assist of detector's velocity that below current ion collider rapidities. Furthermore, the accumulative nature of GP might facilitate the relevant detection significantly.</description>

      <title>Dissipative dynamics of an open quantum battery in the BTZ spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider how charging performances of a quantum battery, modeled as a two-level system, are influenced by the presence of vacuum fluctuations of a quantum field satisfying the Dirichlet, transparent, and Neumann boundary conditions in the BTZ spacetime. The quantum battery is subjected to an external static driving which works as a charger. Meanwhile, the quantum field is assumed to be coupled to both longitudinal and transverse spin components of the quantum battery including decoherence and pure dephasing mechanisms. Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum battery are derived by extending the previous open quantum system approach in the relativistic framework to this more general scenario including both the driving and multiple coupling. Analytic expressions for the time evolution of the energy stored are presented. We find that when the driving amplitude is stronger/weaker than the energy-level spacing of the quantum battery the pure dephasing dissipative coupling results in better/worse charging performances than the decoherence dissipative coupling case. We also find that higher Hawking temperature helps to improve the charging performance under certain conditions compared with the closed quantum buttery case, implying the feasibility of energy extraction from vacuum fluctuations in curved spacetime via dissipation in charging protocol. Different boundary conditions for quantum field may lead to different charging performance. Furthermore, we also address the charging stability by monitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched off. Our study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects in curved spacetime, and reveals how spacetime properties and field boundary condition affect the charging process, which in turn may shed light on the exploration of the spacetime properties and thermodynamics via the charging protocol.</description>

      <title>Nonplanar Four-Loop Anomalous Dimensions of Twist-Two Operators in N=4 Super Yang-Mills Theory: Higher Moment, General Result, and Cusp Anomalous Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the nonplanar universal anomalous dimension of twist-two operators at four loops in N=4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and push its direct diagrammatic calculation through Lorentz spin j=20, one unit beyond the state of the art, so as to confirm the correctness of the general, all-j result conjectured previously by us [1] imposing certain constraints on its analytic form. Thanks to our new result, such constraints can be eliminated altogether. By the same token, this allows us to re-derive, in a completely independent way, the nonplanar four-loop cusp anomalous dimension by taking the large-j limit of the general result.</description>

      <title>New Soft Theorems for Two-Scalar Sigma Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the scattering amplitudes and soft theorems for the sigma models with two scalars. We show that if the particles are Goldstone bosons, then you necessarily get Adler zero with no possibility for non-trivial soft theorems. For non-Goldstone bosons, the soft behavior is generically captured by the geometric soft theorem studied by Cheung et al., and the right-hand side contains derivatives of lower-point amplitudes. Inspired by the recent work on the 2D sigma models, we study one special two-scalar sigma model, where the presence of symmetries in the target space translates into a special but non-trivial soft theorem without derivatives. We further generalize the construction to two larger classes of such models and derive certain soft theorem sum rules, again avoiding the derivatives of amplitudes. Our analysis provides an interesting hierarchy of two-scalar sigma models and soft theorems, ranging from Goldstone boson case to a generic target space, and showing that there are interesting theories in between.</description>

      <title>On Unitarity of the Hypergeometric Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypergeometric amplitude is a one-parameter deformation of the Veneziano amplitude for four-point tachyon scattering in bosonic string theory that is consistent with $S$-matrix bootstrap constraints. In this article we construct a similar hypergeometric generalization of the Veneziano amplitude for type-I superstring theory. We then rule out a large region of the $(r,m^2,D)$ parameter space as non-unitary, and establish another large subset of the $(r, m^2, D)$ parameter space where all partial wave coefficients are positive. We also analyze positivity in various limits and special cases. As a corollary to our analysis, we are able to directly demonstrate positivity of a wider set of Veneziano amplitude partial wave coefficients than what has been presented elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Bouncing Cosmology in 1+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, I construct a bouncing cosmology by considering the backreaction of the winding condensate on a 1+1 dimensional cosmological model with a periodic spatial coordinate. I based my work on previous results that considered the backreaction of the winding condensate on a 1+1 dimensional Euclidean black hole. This cosmological model is obtained as an analytic continuation of a Euclidean black hole. I solved the equations and obtained non-singular solutions at near-Hagedorn temperatures, both numerically and analytically. To remain within the weak coupling regime, it is necessary to connect two solutions; otherwise, the dilaton, which determines the string coupling, would grow quadratically. This connection is achieved through a smooth coordinate transformation, ensuring the model's validity. As a result, the model becomes geodesically complete and non-singular. The connection is made at a time in which the curvature is small, thereby avoiding higher-order $\alpha'$ corrections.</description>

      <title>Geometrically constrained sine-Gordon field: BPS solitons and their collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an enlarged $(1+1)$-dimensional model with two real scalar fields, $\phi$ and $\chi$ whose scalar potential $V(\phi,\chi)$ has a standard $\chi^4$ sector and a sine-Gordon one for $\phi$. These fields are coupled through a generalizing function $f(\chi)$ that appears in the scalar potential and controls the nontrivial dynamics of $\phi$. We minimize the effective energy via the implementation of the BPS technique. We then obtain the Bogomol'nyi bound for the energy and the first-order equations whose solutions saturate that bound. We solve these equations for a nontrivial $f(\chi)$. As the result, BPS kinks with internal structures emerge. They exhibit a two-kink profile. i.e. an effect due to geometrical constrictions. We consider the linear stability of these new configurations. In this sense, we study the existence of internal modes that play an important role during the scattering process. We then investigate the kink-antikink collisions, and present the numerical results for the most interesting cases. We also comment about their most relevant features.</description>

      <title>New shape for cross-bispectra in Chern-Simons gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern-Simons gravity is known to suffer from graviton ghost production during inflation, which suppresses the parity-violating power spectrum at scales relevant to cosmic microwave background observations. In this work, we show that allowing the initial conditions of inflation to deviate from the standard Bunch-Davies state can enhance parity-violating non-Gaussianity in the scalar-tensor cross-bispectra. Our results reveal a significant additional contribution to the cross-bispectra in the flattened configuration, offering a new avenue to constrain parity-violating gravity.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative approach for scalar particle production in Higgs-$R^2$ inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the non-perturbative production of scalar particles within the Higgs-$R^2$ inflation model, focusing on a massive spectator field that interacts gravitationally via a non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar $R$. By transforming the model to the Einstein frame, where direct couplings between inflationary dynamics and the spectator field emerge, we analyze both perturbative and non-perturbative particle production. We solve the spectator field equation numerically, using the Bogolyubov transformation, to calculate the comoving particle density. Our findings indicate that particle production occurs for light particles with conformal coupling and for masses $m_\chi &gt; M/2$ in the minimally coupled scenario.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Gravity Scale and the Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the role of the quantum gravity cut-off for effective field theories (EFTs) coupled to Einstein gravity, with an emphasis on its implications at low energies within the context of the Swampland program. Part I reviews the relevant aspects of string theory compactifications in different number of spacetime dimensions and with different amounts of supersymmetry preserved. In Part II a model-independent approach is employed so as to determine the maximum regime of validity of any such EFT, identifying the species scale as the natural candidate for the quantum gravity cut-off. We review various arguments proposed in the literature as well as include several new considerations on the matter. Part III provides a systematic study of this framework in string theory compactifications, yielding significant agreement with the previous perturbative and non-perturbative analysis. We also analyze various applications of this concept within the Swampland program, including the purported phenomenon of Emergence. Finally, in Part IV we explore the most immediate implications that this picture would have in the infrared regime, thus uncovering intriguing universal properties associated to the aforementioned energy scale, such as precise lower bounds on its exponential decay rates as well as certain patterns holding within the infinite distance corners of moduli space. The thesis includes new results scattered over the different chapters therein, which have not appeared in the author's original publications.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal coupling of supersymmetric SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the off-diagonal coupling between two supersymmetric SYK models, which preserves both supersymmetry and solvability. We found that the interaction terms of the N=2 supersymmetric SYK have a holographic interpretation as a possible supersymmetric traversable wormhole. First we introduce the coupling in the trivial Homologic N=1 SYK model as a simplified example. Similar couplings can be implied in N=2 chiral SYK model with BPS states. We propose a special form of N=4 SYK by introducing supermultiplets, and which also naturally include the coupling terms. The holographic picture of N=4 SYK does not have an eternal solution in the low energy limit. And the effective actions are studied in both thermal limit and low energy limit. We also investigate the SYK-like thermal field double states of the supersymmetric SYK and the transmission amplitude between single-side N=2 models in Lorentz time. Additionally, the multi-side N=2,4 OTOCs are also studied.</description>

      <title>The power of the anomaly consistency condition for the Master Ward Identity: Conservation of the non-Abelian gauge current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending local gauge tansformations in a suitable way to Faddeev-Popov ghost fields, one obtains a symmetry of the total action, i.e., the Yang-Mills action plus a gauge fixing term (in a lambda-gauge) plus the ghost action. The anomalous Master Ward Identity (for this action and this extended, local gauge transformation) states that the pertinent Noether current -- the interacting ``gauge current'' -- is conserved up to anomalies.
  It is proved that, apart from terms being easily removable (by finite renormalization), all possible anomalies are excluded by the consistency condition for the anomaly of the Master Ward Identity, recently derived in refenrence [8].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String scattering amplitudes in the high energy asymptotic region have been studied by saddle point approximation. Recently, it was pointed out that infinitely many complex saddles contribute to string amplitudes even at tree-level after redefining the original formal integration contour so that the new contour analytically continues amplitudes appropriately. It is a challenging problem to identify which saddles contribute to higher genus corrections of string amplitudes. In this paper, we construct QFT toy models which have the same infinite mass tower as string amplitudes but ignoring degeneracies. Their higher loop Feynman diagrams are evaluated by identifying their contributing complex saddles. We find that the saddles associated with infinitely many stringy excitations provide highly oscillatory terms to the amplitudes. We conjecture that string amplitudes, as functions of momenta, approach multi-fractal functions in the high energy asymptotic regions if higher genus contributions are fully included. Their fractal dimensions should be determined purely by the type of string theory and the spacetime dimension where string scatterings occur.</description>

      <title>The propagator field theory revisited: a Lorentz symmetry breaking approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the propagator for a massive scalar field is ill-defined in the coordinate space for $d\geq2$, in particular it diverges at the light-cone; we show that by using Lorentz symmetry breaking weighted measures, an infinite family of propagators can be constructed in an in\-finite\-simal strip near the light-cone, which are labeled by the weight of the measure; hence, the results will provide a finite quantum amplitude for a massive particle for propagating on the light-cone. The propagators regarded as smooth two-points functions, increase within a region smaller than the Compton wavelength, and decrease beyond that wavelength, and eventually drop off for large arguments. Although the time ordered propagators retain negative values regions for arbitrary values of the weight $s$ for the measures, the restriction $2&lt;s\leq d+1$ will guarantee the positivity for the amplitudes near the light cone.</description>

      <title>Quantum Anomalies and Parity-odd CFT Correlators for Chiral States of Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral currents influence the parity-odd sector of CFT correlators in momentum space, playing a crucial role in the evolution of the quark-gluon plasma in the early universe. We demonstrate that these parity-odd interactions, which couple quarks and gluons to gravitons, can be fully determined in terms of their anomaly content by solving the conformal constraints in momentum space. This process involves a single nonlocal, massless axion-like interaction in the longitudinal channel, which remains protected against thermal and finite density effects.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the Einstein-Cartan Theory in First-Order Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory in first-order form, which has a diffeomorphism as well as a local Lorentz invariance. We study the renormalizability of this theory in the framework of the Batalin-Vilkovisky formalism, which allows for a gauge invariant renormalization. Using the background field method, we discuss the gauge invariance of the background effective action and analyze the Ward identities which reflect the symmetries of the EC theory. As an application, we compute, in a general background gauge, the self-energy of the tetrad field at one-loop order.</description>

      <title>Fermion masses and mixings in the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape from Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the complete landscape of three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from intersecting D6-branes on a type IIA $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold has been enumerated consisting of 33 independent models with distinct gauge coupling relations at the string scale. Here, we study the phenomenology of all such models by providing the detailed particle spectra and the analysis of the possible 3-point and the 4-point Yukawa interactions in order to accommodate all standard-model fermion masses and mixings. We find that only 17 models contain viable Yukawa textures to explain quarks masses, charged-leptons' masses, neutrino-masses, quarks' mixings and leptons' mixings. These viable models split into four classes, viz. a single model with 3 Higgs fields from the bulk and sixteen models with either 6, 9 or 12 Higgs from the $\mathcal{N}=2$ sector. The models perform successively better with the increasing number of Higgs pairs. Remarkably, the class of models with 12 Higgs naturally predicts the Dirac-type neutrino masses in normal ordering consistent with both the experimental constraints as well as the bounds from the swampland program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several phenomenological and technical aspects related to electroweak (EW) corrections at a high-energy muon collider, focusing on direct production processes (no VBF configurations). We study in detail the accuracy of the Sudakov approximation, in particular the Denner-Pozzorini algorithm, comparing it with exact calculations at NLO EW accuracy. We also assess the relevance of resumming EW Sudakov logarithms (EWSL) at 3 and 10 TeV collisions. Furthermore, we scrutinise the impact of additional Heavy Boson Radiation (HBR), namely the weak emission of $W, Z$, and Higgs bosons in inclusive and semi-inclusive configurations. All results are obtained via the fully automated and publicly available code MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified description of hadron scattering at all energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of general amplitudes satisfying symmetries and $S$-matrix constraints has been the primary tool in studying the spectrum of hadrons for over half a century. In this work, we present a new parameterization, which can fulfill many expectations of $S$-matrix and Regge theory and connects the essential physics of hadron scattering in the resonance region and in asymptotic limits. In this construction, dynamical information is entirely contained in Regge trajectories that generalize resonance poles in the complex energy plane to moving poles in the angular momentum plane. We highlight the salient features of the model, compare with existing literature on dispersive and dual amplitudes, and benchmark the formalism with an initial numerical application to the $\rho$ and $\sigma/f_0(500)$ mesons in $\pi\pi$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Black Hole as a Harmonic Oscillator from the Perspective of the Minimum Uncertainty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for the Schwarzschild black hole interior, which is derived from a Hamiltonian formulated in terms of canonical phase space coordinates, we show that by applying a simple reparametrization, this equation can be expressed as the eigenvalue equation of a quantum linear harmonic oscillator. Within the standard quantization framework, we find that the resulting wave function diverges in the region of the classical singularity, and the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar is undefined for all states within the black hole. However, when we apply the minimal uncertainty approach to the quantization process, we obtain a wave function that is both well-defined and square-integrable. Additionally, the expectation value of the Kretschmann scalar for these states remains finite throughout the black hole's interior, suggesting that the classical singularity is resolved in this approach, replaced it by a minimum radius.</description>

      <title>Universal topological classifications of black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the universal classifications of black hole states by considering them as topological defects within the thermodynamic parameter space. Through the asymptotic behaviors of the constructed vector, our results indicate the existence of four distinct topological classifications, denoted as $W^{1-}$, $W^{0+}$, $W^{0-}$, and $W^{1+}$. Within these classifications, the innermost small black hole states are characterized as unstable, stable, unstable, and stable, respectively, while the outermost large ones exhibit an unstable, unstable, stable, and stable behavior. These classifications also display contrasting thermodynamic properties in both low and high Hawking temperature limits. Furthermore, we establish a systematic ordering of the local thermodynamically stable and unstable black hole states as the horizon radius increases for a specific topological classification. These results reveal the universal topological classifications governing black hole thermodynamics, providing valuable insights into the fundamental nature of quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that dark matter and dark energy arise naturally in a recently proposed model of combinatorial quantum gravity. Dark energy is due to the ground-state curvature at finite coupling, dark matter arises from allotropy in the discrete structure of space-time. The stable structure of the space-time "crystal" represents the curved background, the coexisting metastable allotropes of higher curvature and energy are natural candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Effect of Magnetic Fields on Urca Rates in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isospin-equilibrating weak processes, called ``Urca" processes, are of fundamental importance in astrophysical environments like (proto-)neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and supernovae. In these environments, matter can reach high temperatures of tens of MeVs and be subject to large magnetic fields. We thus investigate Urca rates at different temperatures and field strengths by performing the full temperature and magnetic-field dependent rate integrals for different equations of state. We find that the magnetic fields play an important role at temperatures of a few MeV, especially close to or below the direct Urca threshold, which is softened by the magnetic field. At higher temperatures, the effect of the magnetic fields can be overshadowed by the thermal effects. We observe that the magnetic field more strongly influences the neutron decay rates than the electron capture rates, leading to a shift in chemical equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: We explore wormhole solutions sourced by Casimir energy density involving generalized uncertainty principle corrections within the framework of Rastall-Rainbow gravity. The questions of traversability and stability, as well as the presence of exotic matter, are carefully investigated. In particular, the stability issue is addressed via an approach that has not been previously employed in the context of wormholes. This method, which represents an improved version of the so-called Herrera cracking technique, has the potential to yield novel insights in the field of wormhole geometries.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement learning-based statistical search strategy for an axion model from flavor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning-based search strategy to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model. The reinforcement learning, which is one of machine learning methods, is a powerful approach to find model parameters with phenomenological constraints. As a concrete example, we focus on a minimal axion model with a global $U(1)$ flavor symmetry. Agents of the learning succeed in finding $U(1)$ charge assignments of quarks and leptons solving the flavor and cosmological puzzles in the Standard Model, and find more than 150 realistic solutions for the quark sector taking renormalization effects into account. For the solutions found by the reinforcement learning-based analysis, we discuss the sensitivity of future experiments for the detection of an axion which is a Nambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken $U(1)$. We also examine how fast the reinforcement learning-based searching method finds the best discrete parameters in comparison with conventional optimization methods. In conclusion, the efficient parameter search based on the reinforcement learning-based strategy enables us to perform a statistical analysis of the vast parameter space associated with the axion model from flavor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scattering calculations in curved spacetime are technically complicated and, in the case of a general spacetime metric, quite impossible. Even in the cases where perturbative scattering calculations can be done one has to be careful about what kind of particles are sensible to measure. Curved spacetime quantum field theories are then less conceptually clear than those in flat spacetime. In this article, we investigate an aspect of this conceptual confusion - the use of wave packets in defining the S-matrix. Wave packets are used in most standard textbook treatments to construct particle states and remove certain singularities in the definition of the S-matrix. We show that this method does not completely work in curved spacetimes first in a general way and then by way of a specific model. We also discuss related effects and suggest a method for doing curved spacetime scattering calculations. Our conclusion is that the most general method for scattering calculations in curved spacetimes requires the use of wave packets, which are typically absent in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding quantum chaos is of profound theoretical interest and carries significant implications for various applications, from condensed matter physics to quantum error correction. Recently, out-of-time ordered correlators (OTOCs) have emerged as a powerful tool to quantify quantum chaos. For a given quantum system, the OTOCs measure incompatibility between an operator evolved in the Heisenberg picture and an unevolved operator. In the first part of this thesis, we employ OTOCs to study the dynamical sensitivity of a perturbed non-Komogorov-Arnold-Moser (non-KAM) system in the quantum limit as the parameter that characterizes the $\textit{resonance}$ condition is slowly varied. For this purpose, we consider a quantized kicked harmonic oscillator (KHO) model that displays stochastic webs in the phase space. The OTOC analysis is followed by a study of quantum Fisher information (QFI) at the resonances and a comparison with the non-resonance cases. We shall show that scaling of the QFI in time is enhanced at the resonances, making the dynamics of the non-KAM systems good candidates for quantum sensing. In the following chapter, we study the OTOCs in a bipartite system of kicked coupled tops with a special focus on the mixed phase space OTOC dynamics. The last part of the thesis is devoted to the study of the emergence of quantum state designs as a signature of quantum chaos and the role of symmetries in this phenomenon. Recently proposed projected ensemble framework utilizes quantum chaos as a resource to construct approximate higher-order state designs. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetries on the emergence of quantum state designs remain under-explored. We thoroughly investigate this by demonstrating the interplay between symmetries and measurements in constructing approximate state designs. Finally, we outline a few open directions relevant to the current thesis.</description>

      <title>Leading Twist-Two Gauge-Variant Counterterms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous dimensions of twist-two operators govern the scale evolution of parton distribution functions. For off-shell external states, the physical twist-two operators mix with unknown gauge-variant operators under renormalization. In this talk, we apply the method proposed by us in~\cite{Gehrmann:2023ksf} to compute all gauge-variant one-loop counterterm Feynman rules with five legs, which enter the determination of the four-loop splitting functions in QCD.</description>

      <title>Gradient corrections to the quantum effective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.12142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the quantum effective action up to second order in gradients and up to two-loop order for an interacting scalar field theory. This expansion of the effective action is useful to study problems in cosmological settings where spatial or time gradients are important, such as bubble nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Assuming spacetime dependent background fields, we work in Wigner space and perform a midpoint gradient expansion, which is consistent with the equations of motion satisfied by the propagator. In particular, we consider the fact that the propagator is non-trivially constrained by an additional equation of motion, obtained from symmetry requirements. At one-loop order, we show the calculations for the case of a single scalar field and then generalise the result to the multi-field case. While we find a vanishing result in the single field case, the one-loop second-order gradient corrections can be significant when considering multiple fields. As an example, we apply our result to a simple toy model of two scalar fields with canonical kinetic terms and mass mixing at tree-level. Finally, we calculate the two-loop one-particle irreducible (1PI) effective action in the single scalar field case, and obtain a nonrenormalisable result. The theory is rendered renormalisable by adding two-particle irreducible (2PI) counterterms, making the 2PI formalism the right framework for renormalization when resummed 1PI two-point functions are used in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Low temperature dynamics for confined $p=2$ soft spin in the quenched regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to address the low-temperature dynamics issue for the $p=2$ spin dynamics with confining potential, focusing especially on quartic and sextic cases. The dynamics are described by a Langevin equation for a real vector $q_i$ of size $N$, where disorder is materialized by a Wigner matrix and we especially investigate the self consistent evolution equation for effective potential arising from self averaging of the square length $a(t)\equiv \sum_i q_i^2(t)/N$ for large $N$. We first focus on the static case, assuming the system reached some equilibrium point, and we then investigate the way the system reach this point dynamically. This allows to identify a critical temperature, above which the relaxation toward equilibrium follows an exponential law but below which it has infinite time life and corresponds to a power law decay.</description>

      <title>Flat limit of massless scalar scattering in $\mathrm{AdS}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.20037v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the flat limit of massless scalar scattering in $\mathrm{AdS}_2$. We derive the $1 \to 1$ $\mathcal{S}$-matrix from the CFT $2$-point function. We show a key property of the $2 \to 2$ $\mathcal{S}$-matrix in $2d$, where the contact interaction in the flat limit gives momentum conserving delta function. We show the factorization of the $n \to n$ $\mathcal{S}$-matrix for integrable models in the flat limit, focusing on contact interactions. We calculate the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix by linking the CFT operator on the AdS boundary to the scattering state in flat-space. We use bulk operator reconstruction to study massless scalar scattering in the flat limit and solve the Klein-Gordon equation in global $\mathrm{AdS}_2$ for the massless scalar field. The solution is simple, involving a pure phase in global time and a sinusoidal function in the radial coordinate. This simplicity also extends to the smearing function, allowing us to map the scattering state to the CFT operator while taking AdS corrections into account.</description>

      <title>Effective field theory bootstrap, large-N $\chi$PT and holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the effective field theory (EFT) bootstrap by formulating it as an infinite-dimensional semidefinite program (SDP), built from the crossing symmetric sum rules and the S-matrix primal ansatz. We apply the program to study the large-$N$ chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) and observe excellent convergence of EFT bounds between the dual (rule-out) and primal (rule-in) methods. This convergence aligns with the predictions of duality theory in SDP, enabling us to analyze the bound states and resonances in the ultra-violet (UV) spectrum. Furthermore, we incorporate the upper bound of unitarity to uniformly constrain the EFT space from the UV scale $M$ using the primal method, thereby confirming the consistency of the large-$N$ expansion. In the end, we translate the large-$N$ $\chi$PT bounds to constrain the higher derivative corrections of holographic QCD models.</description>

      <title>An entanglement asymmetry study of black hole radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawking's discovery that black holes can evaporate through radiation emission has posed a number of questions that with time became fundamental hallmarks for a quantum theory of gravity. The most famous one is likely the information paradox, which finds an elegant explanation in the Page argument suggesting that a black hole and its radiation can be effectively represented by a random state of qubits. Leveraging the same assumption, we ponder the extent to which a black hole may display emergent symmetries, employing the entanglement asymmetry as a modern, information-based indicator of symmetry breaking. We find that for a random state devoid of any symmetry, a $U(1)$ symmetry emerges and it is exact in the thermodynamic limit before the Page time. At the Page time, the entanglement asymmetry shows a finite jump to a large value. Our findings imply that the emitted radiation is symmetric up to the Page time and then undergoes a sharp transition. Conversely the black hole is symmetric only after the Page time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We uncover new non-supersymmetric boundary conditions in 10- and 11-dimensional supergravity whereby spacetime ends on a smeared distribution of D- and M-branes respectively. For example, we find a solution of type IIB supergravity where the AdS$_5\times\mathbb{S}^5$ vacuum ends on an $SO(6)$-invariant distribution of D3-branes. These distributions give a stringy completion of simple models of tensionful end-of-the-world branes considered previously in the literature. However we find that our solutions are all unstable to the fragmentation of the end-of-the-world brane into its constituents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new Lie-algebraic approach to explicitly construct the motivic coaction and single-valued map of multiple polylogarithms in any number of variables. In both cases, the appearance of multiple zeta values is controlled by conjugating generating series of polylogarithms with Lie-algebra generators associated with odd zeta values. Our reformulation of earlier constructions of coactions and single-valued polylogarithms preserves choices of fibration bases, exposes the correlation between multiple zeta values of different depths and paves the way for generalizations beyond genus zero.</description>

      <title>A hierarchy of WZW models related to super Poisson-Lie T-duality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09636v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by super Poisson-Lie (PL) symmetry of the Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model based on the $(C^3+A)$ Lie supergroup of our previous work [A. Eghbali {\it et al.} JHEP 07 (2013) 134], we first obtain and classify all Drinfeld superdoubles (DSDs) generated by the Lie superbialgebra structures on the $({\cal C}^3+ {\cal A})$ Lie superalgebra as a theorem. Then, introducing a general formulation we find the conditions under which a two-dimensional $\sigma$-model may be equivalent to a WZW model. With the help of this formulation and starting the super PL symmetric $(C^3+A)$ WZW model, we get a hierarchy of WZW models related to super PL T-duality, in such a way that it is different from the super PL T-plurality, because the DSDs are, in this process, non-isomorphic. The most interesting indication of this work is that the $(C^3+A)$ WZW model does remain invariant under the super PL T-duality transformation, that is, the model is super PL self-dual.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06153v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String scattering amplitudes are typically expressed in formal integrals which diverge in physical kinematic regions. Recently the problem of divergence was cured by redefining integration contours. In this paper, we apply the new integration contour to evaluate time-delay of the Veneziano amplitude. Thimble analysis of the new integration contour tells us that infinitely many complex saddles contribute to the new integral. Each complex saddle is interpreted as a string path which enters into the scattering region at different Lorentzian time.</description>

      <title>On exactly solvable Yang-Baxter models and enhanced symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Yang-Baxter deformations of the flat space string that result in exactly solvable models, finding the Nappi-Witten model and its higher dimensional generalizations. We then consider the spectra of these models obtained by canonical quantization in light-cone gauge, and match them with an integrability-based Bethe ansatz approach. By considering a generalized light-cone gauge we can describe the model by a nontrivially Drinfel'd twisted S matrix, explicitly verifying the twisted structure expected for such deformations. Next, the reformulation of the Nappi-Witten model as a Yang-Baxter deformation shows that Yang-Baxter models can have more symmetries than suggested by the $r$ matrix defining the deformation. We discuss these enhanced symmetries in more detail for some trivial and nontrivial examples. Finally, we observe that there are nonunimodular but Weyl-invariant Yang-Baxter models of a type not previously considered.</description>

      <title>Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Pion amplitudes and low energy parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the Gauge Theory Bootstrap method proposed in our previous work [arXiv:2309.12402], we compute pion scattering phase shifts for all partial waves with angular momentum $\ell\le 3$ up to 2 GeV and calculate the low energy $\chi$PT coefficients $\bar{\ell}_{1,2,4,6}$. The method looks for the most general S-matrix that matches at low energy the tree level amplitudes of the non-linear sigma model and at high energy, QCD sum rules and form factors. This is a theoretical/numerical calculation that uses as only data the pion mass $m_\pi$, pion decay constant $f_\pi$ and the QCD parameters $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, $m_q$ and $\alpha_s$. All results are in reasonable agreement with experiment. In particular, we find the $\rho(770)$, $f_2(1270)$ and $\rho(1450)$ resonances and some initial indication of particle production near the resonances. The interplay between the UV gauge theory and low energy pion physics is an example of a general situation where we know the microscopic theory as well as the effective theory of long wavelength fluctuations but we want to solve the strongly coupled dynamics at intermediate energies. The bootstrap builds a bridge between the low and high energy by determining the consistent S-matrix that matches both and provides, in this case, a new direction to understand the strongly coupled physics of gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a generic geometric formalism that incorporates both $T\bar{T}$-like and root-$T\bar{T}$-like deformations in arbitrary dimensions. This framework applies to a wide family of stress-energy tensor perturbations and encompasses various well-known field theories. Building upon the recently proposed correspondence between Ricci-based gravity and $T\bar{T}$-like deformations, we further extend this duality to include root-$T\bar{T}$-like perturbations. This refinement extends the potential applications of our approach and contributes to a deeper exploration of the interplay between stress tensor perturbations and gravitational dynamics. Among the various original outcomes detailed in this article, we have also obtained a deformation of the flat Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scattering of electrically charged fermions on magnetic monopole leads to the Callan-Rubakov problem. We discuss some aspects of this problem for Abelian gauge theories with chiral fermions in a Dirac monopole background. In some cases, it is possible to embed the theory in a non-Abelian gauge theory where the monopole is regularized as a 't Hooft-Polyakov monopole. One theory of this kind is the $SU(N)$ chiral gauge theory with fermions in the symmetric, anti-antisymmetric and anti-fundamental representations also called "$\psi \chi \eta$" model, with an extra adjoint scalar that induces the Abelianization of the gauge group. We examine this model in detail and provide a possible solution for the condensates around the monopole, the symmetry preserving boundary conditions, and discuss the particle scattering problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any causal nonlinear electrodynamics theory that is "self-dual" (electromagnetic $U(1)$-duality invariant), the Legendre-dual pair of Lagrangian and Hamiltonian densities $\{\mathcal{L},\mathcal{H}\}$ are constructed from functions $\{\ell,h\}$ on ${\bf R}^+$ related to a particle-mechanics Lagrangian and Hamiltonian. We show how a `duality' relating $\ell$ to $h$ implies that $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{H}$ are related by a simple map between appropriate pairs of variables. We also discuss Born's "Legendre self-duality" and implications of a new "$\Phi$-parity" duality. Our results are illustrated with many examples.</description>

      <title>Modular Invariant Starobinsky Inflation and the Species Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Potentials in cosmological inflation often involve scalars with trans-Planckian ranges. As a result, towers of states become massless and their presence pushes the fundamental scale not to coincide with $M_{\rm P}$ but rather with the $species\, scale$, $\Lambda$. This scale transforms as an automorphic form of the theory's duality symmetries. We propose that the inflaton potential should be 1) an automorphic invariant form, non-singular over all moduli space, 2) depending only on $\Lambda$ and its field derivatives, and 3) approaching constant values in the large moduli to ensure a long period of inflation. These conditions lead to the proposal $V \sim \lambda(\phi, \phi^*)$, with $\lambda = G^{i\bar{j}} (\partial_i \Lambda)(\partial_{\bar{j}} \Lambda) / \Lambda^2$, determining the 'species scale convex hull'. For a single elliptic complex modulus with $SL(2, Z)$ symmetry, this results in an inflaton potential $V \simeq (\text{Im} \tau)^2 |\tilde{G}_2|^2 / N^2$, with $N \simeq -\log(\text{Im} \tau |\eta(\tau)|^4)$, where $\eta$ is the Dedekind function and $\tilde{G}_2$ the Eisenstein modular form of weight 2. Surprisingly, this potential at large modulus resembles that of the Starobinsky model. We compute inflation parameters yielding results similar to Starobinsky's, but extended to modular invariant expressions. Interestingly, the number of e-folds is proportional to the number of species in the tower, $N_e \simeq N$, and $\epsilon \simeq \Lambda^4$ at large moduli, suggesting that the tower of states plays an important role in the inflation process.</description>

      <title>Entropy and Spectrum of Near-Extremal Black Holes: semiclassical brane solutions to non-perturbative problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The black hole entropy has been observed to generically turn negative at exponentially low temperatures $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ in the extremal Bekenstein-Hawking entropy $S_0$, a seeming pathology often attributed to missing non-perturbative effects. In fact, we show that this negativity must happen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble description. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an annealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality if and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and diverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is the average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood in gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological expansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles that dominate gravitational correlators at $T\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to semiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give the leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality with matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case, they are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of $S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our instanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to multiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match is found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the origin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS states at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the former, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states agrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-JT gravity.</description>

      <title>Higher derivative SVT theories from Kaluza-Klein reductions of Horndeski theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently pointed out that some precise Photon-Galileon couplings in four dimensions (4D) -- inspired by a higher dimensional reduction -- are enough to obtain a Horndeski theory that is less constrained by the stringent experimental bounds on the speed of Gravitational Waves. They imply the constancy of the ratio of speed of gravity to light throughout cosmic evolution. This holds without fine tuning, even if one includes the general $G_4 (\pi,X)$ and $G_5 (\pi)$ scalar potentials. In this paper we go into the details of this 4D Luminal extension of Horndeski theory including its scalar sector. We also present the complete action including the general $G_5(\pi,X),\, G_6(\pi,X)$ scalar potentials. Thus we show all the $U(1)$ gauge invariant vector Galileons in 4D that result from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction from 5D Horndeski. They provide a consistent coupling of a higher derivative vector to scalar modifications of gravity -- namely, without inducing Ostrogradsky ghosts and keeping gauge invariance -- in the aim to explore more universal couplings of dark energy to other matter, such as vectors and in particular the Photon.</description>

      <title>Parity Violating Marginal Deformation of the 3D Gross-Neveu-Thirring Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A hybrid of the critical three dimensional Gross-Neveu and Thirring models deformed by explicit parity breaking operators is studied in the large N expansion and using the renormalization group. The regime of coupling constants where the theory is stable is identified and criteria for the occurrence of fixed points in that regime are found. For a certain range of Chern-Simons level, we find stable charge-gapped phase with spontaneously broken approximate scale invariance and a parametrically light dilaton. The Chern-Simons level can be tuned to the stability edge resulting in exact scale invariance which is spontaneously broken, accompanied by a massless dilaton. For another, narrow range of Chern-Simons levels we find a conformal window where the theory flows to a Wilson-Fisher-like fixed point and is a novel (and rare) example of a non-supersymmetric non-trivial parity and time reversal violating three dimensional conformal field theory with scalar, spinor and vector fields.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Bootstrap and Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from High Temperature Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study finite temperature effects in string cosmology and their potential gravitational wave signature. Expanding on our recent work arXiv:2310.11494 , we consider a general configuration of highly excited open and closed strings at high enough temperature to be in the Hagedorn phase in 3+1 dimensions, in order to explore its cosmological implications. We find conditions, which can be satisfied in compactifications with moduli stabilization, that allow the long strings to remain in equilibrium in a controlled effective field theory, with equilibration driven by the joining and splitting of the dominant open string population. We calculate the emission rate of gravitons by long open strings, which we show is determined by ten dimensional flat space transition amplitudes available in the literature, and then find the total gravitational wave spectrum generated by the gas of long strings. The gravitational wave spectrum has robust characteristics. It peaks at frequencies of order 50-100 GHz, the same as for gravitational waves from the reheating epoch of the Standard Model. But the amplitude of the string signal is significantly larger than predicted by the Standard Model and its field theoretic extensions. The amplitude and other physical observables (such as the contribution to $\Delta N_{\text eff}$) are directly proportional to the string scale $M_s$; indicating that a potential signal may also determine the string scale. Our calculations provide one of the few examples of a signal of stringy origin that dominates over the field theory predictions. We give a physical explanation of our results and discuss further implications.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a coupled system consisting of a complex scalar field, a U(1) gauge field, a complex Higgs scalar field, and Einstein gravity. We present nontopological soliton star solutions in which the interior geometry is described by the de Sitter metric, the exterior by the Schwarzschild metric, and these two regions are attached by a spherical surface layer with a finite thickness. This structure is the same as the so-called gravastars, so we refer to these solutions as \lq solitonic gravastars\rq . We demonstrate that compact solitonic gravastars that possessing photon spheres can appear. Additionally, we study the mass and compactness of solitonic gravastars for various sets of parameters that characterize the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical model to alleviate the Hubble tension based on dynamics of a minimally coupled scalar field interacting with both radiation and dark matter in the radiation-dominated era. The model we take up within the Einstein representation of Brans-Dicke theory provides a strong theoretical basis for such interactions. We consider a Brans-Dicke scalar coupled with the thermal bath along with dark matter, so that the scalar field can mimic the cosmological constant and quintessence behaviors under slow-roll and non-slow-roll conditions, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Haag's theorem cries out for explanation and critical assessment: it sounds the alarm that something is (perhaps) not right in one of the standard way of constructing interacting fields to be used in generating predictions for scattering experiments. Viewpoints as to the precise nature of the problem, the appropriate solution, and subsequently-called-for developments in areas of physics, mathematics, and philosophy differ widely. In this paper, we develop and deploy a conceptual framework for critically assessing these disparate responses to Haag's theorem. Doing so reveals the driving force of more general questions as to the nature and purpose of foundational work in physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Shannon entropy of the total system and its subsystems, as well as the subsystem Shannon mutual information, in quasiparticle excited states of free bosonic and fermionic chains and the ferromagnetic phase of the spin-1/2 XXX chain. For single-particle and double-particle states, we derive various analytical formulas for free bosonic and fermionic chains in the scaling limit. These formulas are also applicable to certain magnon excited states in the XXX chain in the scaling limit. We also calculate numerically the Shannon entropy and mutual information for triple-particle and quadruple-particle states in bosonic, fermionic, and XXX chains. We discover that Shannon entropy, unlike entanglement entropy, typically does not separate for quasiparticles with large momentum differences. Moreover, in the limit of large momentum difference, we obtain universal quantum bosonic and fermionic results that are generally distinct and cannot be explained by a semiclassical picture.</description>

      <title>Emergent generalized symmetries in ordered phases and applications to quantum disordering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05730v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the rich landscape of higher-form and non-invertible symmetries that emerge at low energies in generic ordered phases. Using that their charge is carried by homotopy defects (i.e., domain walls, vortices, hedgehogs, etc.), in the absence of domain walls we find that their symmetry defects in ${D}$-dimensional spacetime are described by ${(D-1)}$-representations of a ${(D-1)}$-group that depends only on the spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) pattern of the ordered phase. These emergent symmetries are not spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. We show that spontaneously breaking them induces a phase transition into a nontrivial disordered phase that can have symmetry-enriched (non-)abelian topological orders, photons, and even more emergent symmetries. This SSB transition is between two distinct SSB phases$\unicode{x2013}$an ordinary and a generalized one$\unicode{x2013}$making it a possible generalized deconfined quantum critical point. We also investigate the 't Hooft anomalies of these emergent symmetries and conjecture that there is always a mixed anomaly between them and the microscopic symmetry spontaneously broken in the ordered phase. One way this anomaly can manifest is through the fractionalization of the microscopic symmetry's quantum numbers. Our results demonstrate that even the most exotic generalized symmetries emerge in ordinary phases and provide a valuable framework for characterizing them and their transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We comment on the so-called negative-result experiments (also known as null measurements, interaction-free measurements, and so on) in quantum mechanics (QM), in the light of the new general understanding of the quantum-measurement processes, proposed recently. All experiments of this kind (null-measurements) can be understood as improper measurements with an intentionally biased detector set up, which introduces exclusion or selection of certain events. The prediction on the state of a microscopic system under study based on a null measurement, is sometimes dramatically described as ``wave-function collapse without any microsystem-detector interactions". Though certainly correct, such a prediction is just a consequence of the standard QM laws, not different from the situation in the so-called state-preparation procedure. Another closely related concept is the (first-class or) repeatable measurements. The verification of the prediction made by a null-measurement requires eventually a standard unbiased measurement involving the microsystem-macroscopic detector interactions, which are nonadiabatic, irreversible processes of signal amplification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10903v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin and acceleration mechanisms of energetic particles in the universe remain enigmatic in contemporary astrophysics. Recent efforts have focused on identifying Galactic sources capable of accelerating particles to 1 PeV, known as PeVatrons, and also identifying sources contributing to the spectrum at lower energies. The different morphology of galactic supernova remnants is directly related to the type of stellar explosion and the existence of a possible Compact Central Object (CCO), which possess intense radiative-gravitational fields on their surfaces. These CCOs, due to their strong fields and interactions with surrounding magnetic clouds, are potential candidates for gamma ray production. Through observations of the compact X-ray source 1E 1207.4-5209, located near the remnant G296.5+10.0, and using the enhanced GALPROP code, we analyze the emission of gamma-ray and cosmic-ray production through propagation. Additionally, we calculate the contribution of the G296.5+10.0 source to the overall observed Galactic cosmic-ray flux, taking into account cosmic-ray propagation within the Galaxy, which includes energy losses and particle interactions. Our findings suggest that this setup offers a fertile environment for producing a wide range of cosmic-ray energies at low energy within the Galaxy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional ${\cal N} = (2, 2)$ Yang--Mills theory with gauge group SU($N$) in Euclidean signature compactified on a torus with thermal fermion boundary conditions imposed on one cycle. We perform non-perturbative lattice analyses of this theory for large $12 \leq N \leq 20$. Although no holographic dual of this theory is yet known, we conduct numerical investigations to check for features similar to the two-dimensional ${\cal N} = (8, 8)$ Yang--Mills theory, which has a well-defined gravity dual. We perform lattice field theory calculations to determine the phase diagram, observing a spatial deconfinement transition similar to the maximally supersymmetric case. However, the transition does not continue to low temperature, implying the absence of a topology-changing transition between black hole geometries in any holographic dual for this four-supercharge theory.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of the dispersion law in three-dimensional quantum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a quantum structure underlying space has been proposed for quite some time, yet it has largely eluded direct observation. There is a prevailing notion that the minuscule effects stemming from quantum space could, under certain astronomical conditions, accumulate to an observable magnitude. Typically, these effects are perturbative, limited to the first one or two orders. This study presents a full dispersion law derived from a three-dimensional quantum space model. Our primary focus is investigating the in-vacuo dispersion phenomenon and the threshold anomaly. Furthermore, we briefly explore the implications of additional spatial dimensions within this framework and suggest a way of distinguishing between various theories that agree in the leading order approximation.</description>

      <title>Causal Fermion Systems and Octonions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare the structures and methods in the theory of causal fermion systems with approaches to fundamental physics based on division algebras, in particular the octonions. We find that octonions and, more generally, tensor products of division algebras come up naturally to describe the symmetries of the vacuum configuration of a causal fermion system. This is achieved by associating the real and imaginary octonion basis elements with the neutrino and charged sectors of the vacuum fermionic projector, respectively. Conversely, causal fermion systems provide octonionic theories with spacetime structures and dynamical equations via the causal action principle. In this way, octonionic theories and causal fermion systems complement each other..</description>

      <title>Re-assessing special aspects of Dirac fermions in presence of Lorentz-symmetry violation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on additional inspections concerning the fermionic sector of the Standard Model Extension (SME). In this context, our main effort in this contribution is to investigate effects of Lorentz-symmetry violation (LSV) on the Klein Paradox, the Zitterbewegung and its phenomenology in connection to Condensed Matter Physics, Atomic Physics, and Astrophysics. Finally, we discuss a particular realization of LSV in the Dirac equation, considering an asymmetry between space and time due to a scale factor present in the linear momentum of the fermion, but which does not touch its time derivative. We go further and extend the implications of this asymmetry in the situation the scale factor becomes space-time dependent to compute its influence on the kinematics of the Compton effect with the extended dispersion relation for the fermion that scatters the photon.</description>

      <title>Modulating Hamiltonian Approach to Quantum Many-Body Systems and Crystalline Topological Phases Protected by Generalized Magnetic Translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the topology of the parameter space of invertible phases with an onsite symmetry $G$, i.e., quantum many-body ground states that have neither fractionalization nor spontaneous breaking of the symmetry. The classification of invertible phases is known to be obtained by counting the connected components in the parameter space of the invertible phases. We consider its generalization -- the deformation classes of the mappings from $n$-dimensional spheres $S^n$ to this parameter space for arbitrary integer $n$. We argue a direct one-to-one correspondence in the framework of lattice models between the non-contractibility of $S^n$ and (i) the classification of invertible phases in $d$ dimensions when $d\geq n$; or (ii) zero-dimensional invertible Hamiltonians parametrized by $S^{n-d}$ when $d&lt;n$, using an isotropic modulating Hamiltonian approach. Explicitly, we construct the noncontractible spheres of two-dimensional invertible phases, i.e., $n=2$ and $d=2$. We also propose a large class of crystalline topological phases protected by a generalized magnetic translations.</description>

      <title>A power spectrum approach to the search for Axion-like Particles from resolved galaxy clusters using CMB as a backlight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axions or ALPs are hypothetical particles predicted by BSM theories, which make one of the dark matter candidates. These particles can convert into photons and vice-versa in the presence of magnetic field, with a probability decided by its coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$. One of the ways to detect these particles is using the CMB as a backlight. As the CMB photons pass through a galaxy cluster, they can get converted into ALPs in the mass range $10^{-15}$ eV to $10^{-11}$ eV through resonant conversion in the presence of cluster magnetic fields. This leads to a polarized spectral distortion ($\alpha$-distortion) in the CMB as the photon polarization parallel to the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster is involved in the conversion. The fluctuations in the magnetic field and electron density in a galaxy cluster lead to spatially varying $\alpha$-distortion around the cluster, with a power spectrum that is different from the lensed CMB polarization power spectrum for the standard model of cosmology. By measuring the difference in the polarization power spectrum around a galaxy cluster from the all-sky signal, one can find new $\alpha$-distortion in the sky. For galaxy clusters resolvable in multiple EM bands, one can measure the coupling strength $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ from the ALP power spectrum. Using multi-frequency techniques like ILC to clean the foregrounds, we show that the new power spectrum-based approach of the resolved galaxy clusters from upcoming CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 can detect (or put constraints) on the ALP-photon coupling strength of $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 5.2 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ and $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma} &lt; 3.6 \times 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ at 95\% C.I. respectively for ALPs of masses $10^{-13}$ eV or for smaller $\mathrm{g_{a\gamma}}$ for lighter ALP masses (Abridged).</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09277v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Spectrum-preserving deformations of integrable spin chains with open boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The remaining parts of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for the ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on gravitational perturbations of black holes in the self-accelerating branch of the Minimal Theory of Massive Gravity (MTMG). This theory is a healthy extension of GR which displays the feature of massive tensor modes, without additional polarizations, strong-coupling issues nor requiring screening mechanisms. We proceed by implementing a newly developed technique that, instead of considering a second-order Schr\"odinger-like reformulation of perturbation equations, relies on a first-order formulation and solves it asymptotically, before numerically deriving the quasi-normal modes. We find that the black holes of MTMG are stable, and that their quasi-normal modes smoothly differ from the GR ones, for non-vanishing values of the graviton mass. This work hence confirms the fact that GR is a smooth limit of MTMG, and opens the exciting possibility of a clean test, performed for instance by the LISA detector.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Quantum Harmonic Oscillator in External Magnetic Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the circuit complexity of a quantum harmonic oscillator subjected to an external magnetic field. Utilizing the Nielsen approach within the thermofield dynamics (TFD) framework, we determine the complexity of thermofield double states as functions of time, temperature, and the external magnetic field. Our subsequent analysis reveals various features of this complexity. For instance, as temperature increases, the amplitude of complexity oscillations also rises, while at low temperatures, complexity stabilizes at a constant positive value. Furthermore, the magnetic field creates two distinct sectors: strong magnetic fields exhibit periodic complexity oscillations, whereas weak magnetic fields induce a beating effect. Finally, we confirm that the rate of complexity obeys the Lloyd bound.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physical constants set the observability and operation of phase and other transitions and increase entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03773v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approaching the problem of understanding fundamental physical constants (FPCs) started with discussing the role these constants play in high-energy nuclear physics and astrophysics. Condensed matter physics was relatively unexplored in this regard. More recently, it was realised that FPCs set lower or upper bounds on key condensed matter properties. In this Perspective, we discuss a wider role played by FPCs in condensed matter physics: at given environmental conditions, FPCs set the observability and operation of entire physical effects and phenomena. We discuss second-order phase transitions including structural and superconducting transitions and first-order transitions including melting and boiling. We also discuss metastable states, transitions between them, chemical reactions and their products. An interesting byproduct of this discussion is that the order of magnitude of the transition temperature can be calculated from FPCs. We show that the new states emerging as a result of various transitions increase the phase space and entropy. Were FPCs to take different values, these transitions would become inoperative at our environmental conditions and the new states due to these transitions would not emerge. This suggests that the current values of FPCs, by enabling various transitions and reactions which give rise to new states, promote entropy increase. We propose that this is a general effect that applies to different levels of structure in the Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hierarchy problem is associated with the renormalization and decoupling. We can account for the smallness of the scalar mass against loop corrections and its insensitivity to ultraviolet physics by the decoupling of heavy fields. It is essential to correctly identify the observable parameters as the renormalized ones as opposed to the bare ones. The renormalized loop corrections are finite, independent of regularization and perturbatively expandable. They are suppressed as powers of the external momentum to the mass (of the field in the loop) ratio, according to the Appelquist-Carazzone decoupling theorem which we complete for the case of the scalar mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational perturbations of the Schwarzschild metric in the context of noncommutative gravity. $r-\varphi$ and $r-t$ noncommutativity are introduced through a Moyal twist of the Hopf algebra of diffeomorphisms. Differential geometric structures such as curvature tensors are also twisted. Noncommutative equations of motion are derived from the recently proposed NC vacuum Einstein equation. Here, in addition to previously calculated axial NC potential, we present the polar solution which generalizes the work done by Zerilli. Quasinormal mode frequencies of the two potentials are calculated using three methods: WKB, P\"oschl-Teller and Rosen-Morse. Notably, we apply the WKB method up to the 13th order and determine the optimal order for each noncommutative parameter value individually. Additionally, we provide comprehensive error estimations for the higher-order WKB calculations, offering insights into the accuracy of our results. By comparing the spectra, we conclude that the classical isospectrality of axial and polar modes is broken upon spacetime quantization. Isospectrality is restored in the eikonal limit.</description>

      <title>Primordial regular black holes as all the dark matter (I): tr-symmetric metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are usually assumed to be described by the Schwarzschild or Kerr metrics, which however feature unwelcome singularities. We study the possibility that PBHs are non-singular objects, considering four phenomenological, regular tr-symmetric space-times, featuring either de Sitter or Minkowski cores. We characterize the evaporation of these PBHs and constrain their abundance from $\gamma$-ray observations. For three of the metrics, including the well-known Bardeen and Hayward ones, we show that constraints on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of dark matter (DM) in the form of PBHs, weaken with respect to the Schwarzschild limits, because of modifications to the PBH temperature and greybody factors. This moves the lower edge of the asteroid mass window down by up to an order of magnitude, leading to a much larger region of parameter space where PBHs can make up all the DM. A companion paper is instead devoted to non-tr-symmetric metrics, including loop quantum gravity-inspired ones. Our work provides a proof-of-principle for the interface between the DM and singularity problems being a promising arena with a rich phenomenology.</description>

Abstract: It is a common belief that a theory of quantum gravity should ultimately cure curvature singularities which are inevitable within General Relativity, and plague for instance the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, usually considered as prototypes for primordial black holes (PBHs) as dark matter (DM) candidates. We continue our study, initiated in a companion paper, of non-singular objects as PBHs, considering three regular non-tr-symmetric metrics, all of which are one-parameter extensions of the Schwarzschild space-time: the Simpson-Visser, Peltola-Kunstatter, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times, with the latter two motivated by loop quantum gravity. We study evaporation constraints on PBHs described by these regular metrics, deriving upper limits on $f_{\text{pbh}}$, the fraction of DM in the form of PBHs. Compared to their Schwarzschild counterparts, these limits are weaker, and result in a larger asteroid mass window where all the DM can be in the form of PBHs. Our work demonstrates as a proof-of-principle that quantum gravity-inspired space-times can simultaneously play an important role in the resolution of singularities and in the DM problem.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights defined by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, our loop equations are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). On a simple quiver this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out. The respective partition function boils down to an integral known as Gross-Witten-Wadia model; their solution confirms the solution bootstrapped by our loop equations.</description>

      <title>Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the most complete analysis so far of quasinormal modes of rotating black holes in a general higher-derivative extension of Einstein's theory. By finding the corrections to the Teukolsky equation and expressing them in a simple form, we are able to apply a generalized continued fraction method that allows us to find the quasinormal mode frequencies including overtones. We obtain the leading-order corrections to the Kerr quasinormal mode frequencies of all the $(l,m,n)$ modes with $l=2,3,4$, $-l\le m\le l$ and $n=0,1,2$, and express them as a function of the black hole spin $\chi$ using polynomial fits. We estimate that our results remain accurate up to spins between $\chi\sim 0.7$ and $\chi\sim 0.95$, depending on the mode. We report that overtones are overall more sensitive to corrections, which is expected from recent literature on this topic. We also discuss the limit of validity of the linear corrections to the quasinormal mode frequencies by estimating the size of nonlinear effects in the higher-derivative couplings. All our results are publicly available in an online repository.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Gravity Effects with Eccentric Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the impact of loop quantum gravity (LQG) on extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), and the results indicate that LQG effects cause the orbital decay to occur faster compared to the Schwarzschild case. Furthermore, we use the augmented analytic kludge approach to generate EMRI waveforms and study the LISA's capability to detect the LQG effect with faithfulness. Additionally, employing the Fisher information matrix method for parameter estimation, we estimate that after one year of observation, the uncertainty in $r_0$ reduces to approximately $6.59\times 10^{-4}$ with a signal-to-noise ratio of $49$.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Complex Curves, and Graph Theory: Revising a Conjecture by Kasner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ratios $\sqrt{8/9}=2\sqrt{2}/3\approx 0.9428$ and $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.866$ appear in various contexts of black hole physics, as values of the charge-to-mass ratio $Q/M$ or the rotation parameter $a/M$ for Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, respectively. In this work, in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the horizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are related to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain sequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation. These numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation is not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for understanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole physics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to Ramanujan graph. Intriguingly, some other pure mathematical problems in complex analysis, notably complex interpolation in the unit disk, appear to share some mathematical expressions with the black hole problem and thus also involve the Kasner ratio.</description>
