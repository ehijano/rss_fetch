      <title>Homological Invariants of Higher-Order Equational Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many first-order equational theories, such as the theory of groups or boolean algebras, can be presented by a smaller set of axioms than the original one. Recent studies showed that a homological approach to equational theories gives us inequalities to obtain lower bounds on the number of axioms. In this paper, we extend this result to higher-order equational theories. More precisely, we consider simply typed lambda calculus with product and unit types and study sets of equations between lambda terms. Then, we define homology groups of the given equational theory and show that a lower bound on the number of equations can be computed from the homology groups.</description>

      <title>Strong uniqueness of enhancements for the dual numbers: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the bounded and bounded below derived categories of (all) modules over the dual numbers have strongly unique (dg) enhancements. To this end we relate those categories to the category of sequences of vector spaces, which allows a complete classification of indecomposable objects. Along the way we also prove that all the derived categories of any hereditary category have strongly unique enhancements.</description>

      <title>Interpolating Feigin-Frenkel Duality at the Critical Level to Matrices of Complex Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Feigin-Frenkel duality at the critical level to the setting of complex rank. This is accomplished by considering the center of a vertex algebra in Deligne's interpolating categories, along with Feigin's Lie algebras of complex rank, $\mathfrak{gl}_{\lambda}$ and $\mathfrak{po}_{\lambda}$. More precisely, we define the universal affine vertex algebras associated with Lie algebras in $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{GL}_{\alpha},\mathbb{F})$, $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{O}_{\alpha},\mathbb{F})$ and $\underline{\mathrm{Re}}\mathrm{p}(\mathrm{Sp}_{\alpha},\mathbb{F})$, and describe their centers at the critical level explicitly by interpolating Molev's construction of Segal-Sugawara vectors. Using the formalism of Poisson vertex algebras, we identify a natural set of generators for the Drinfeld-Sokolov reduction of $\mathfrak{gl}_{\lambda}$ and $\mathfrak{po}_{\lambda}$, denoted by $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{gl}_{\lambda})$ and $\mathcal{W}(\mathfrak{po}_{\lambda})$, respectively. Finally, we show that the interpolated Feigin-Frenkel isomorphism maps the interpolated Segal-Sugawara vectors to these generators.</description>

      <title>$Sh(B)$-valued models of $(\kappa ,\kappa )$-coherent categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05345v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A basic technique in model theory is to name the elements of a model by introducing new constant symbols. We describe the analogous construction in the language of syntactic categories/ sites.
  As an application we identify $\mathbf{Set}$-valued regular functors on the syntactic category with a certain class of topos-valued models (we will refer to them as "$Sh(B)$-valued models"). For the coherent fragment $L_{\omega \omega }^g \subseteq L_{\omega \omega }$ this was proved by Jacob Lurie, our discussion gives a new proof, together with a generalization to $L_{\kappa \kappa }^g$ when $\kappa $ is weakly compact.
  We present some further applications: first, a $Sh(B)$-valued completeness theorem for $L_{\kappa \kappa }^g$ ($\kappa $ is weakly compact), second, that $\mathcal{C}\to \mathbf{Set} $ regular functors (on coherent categories with disjoint coproducts) admit an elementary map to a product of coherent functors.</description>

      <title>Relative fixed points of functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the relatively initial or relatively terminal fixed points for a well-behaved functor $F$ form a pair of adjoint functors between $F$-coalgebras and $F$-algebras. We use the language of locally presentable categories to find sufficient conditions for existence of this adjunction. We show that relative fixed points may be characterized as (co)equalizers of the free (co)monad on $F$. In particular, when $F$ is a polynomial functor on $\mathsf{Set}$ the relative fixed points are a quotient or subset of the free term algebra or the cofree term coalgebra. We give examples of the relative fixed points for polynomial functors and an example which is the Sierpinski carpet. Lastly, we prove a general preservation result for relative fixed points.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C}: Oper \to Cat$, which we call the \emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>

      <title>A classification of overlapping clustering schemes for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community detection in graphs is a problem that is likely to be relevant whenever network data appears, and consequently the problem has received much attention with many different methods and algorithms applied. However, many of these methods are hard to study theoretically, and they optimise for somewhat different goals. A general and rigorous account of the problem and possible methods remains elusive.
  We study the problem of finding overlapping clusterings of hypergraphs, continuing the line of research started by Carlsson and M\'emoli (2013) of classifying clustering schemes as functors. We extend their notion of representability to the overlapping case, showing that any representable overlapping clustering scheme is excisive and functorial, and any excisive and functorial clustering scheme is isomorphic to a representable clustering scheme.
  We also note that, for simple graphs, any representable clustering scheme is computable in polynomial time on graphs of bounded expansion, with an exponent determined by the maximum independence number of a graph in the representing set. This result also applies to non-overlapping representable clustering schemes, and so may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Categorical generalization of BF theory coupled to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a thorough introduction to the tools of category theory required for formulating gauge theories based on 2-connections. We provide a detailed construction of the categorical generalization of BF theory, dubbed BFCG, also known as 2BF. Similar to BF gravity, it is known that BFCG can be deformed to give general relativity. Here, we obtain an alternative relation between BFCG and gravity, which consists of coupling general relativity and BFCG by means of the volume form constructed out of the BFCG connections. The resulting theory, closely related to unimodular gravity, is a generalization of BF sequestered gravity not only in the sense that it adds new fields but also in that it allows for new choices for the volume form that is coupled to gravity. Furthermore, we show that BF sequestered gravity in the abelian case is recovered for a specific choice of the 2-group.</description>
