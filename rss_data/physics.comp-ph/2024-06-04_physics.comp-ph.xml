      <title>Spectral scheme for atomic structure calculations in density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spectral scheme for atomic structure calculations in pseudopotential Kohn-Sham density functional theory. In particular, after applying an exponential transformation of the radial coordinates, we employ global polynomial interpolation on a Chebyshev grid, with derivative operators approximated using the Chebyshev differentiation matrix, and integrations using Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the scheme through spin-polarized and unpolarized calculations for representative atoms, while considering local, semilocal, and hybrid exchange-correlation functionals. In particular, we find that $\mathcal{O}$(200) grid points are sufficient to achieve an accuracy of 1 microhartree in the eigenvalues for optimized norm conserving Vanderbilt pseudopotentials spanning the periodic table from atomic number $Z = 1$ to $83$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Computation Using Spatial-Photonic Ising Machines: Utilizing Low-Rank and Circulant Matrix Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of spatial-photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) to address computationally intensive Ising problems that employ low-rank and circulant coupling matrices. Our results indicate that the performance of SPIMs is critically affected by the rank and precision of the coupling matrices. By developing and assessing advanced decomposition techniques, we expand the range of problems SPIMs can solve, overcoming the limitations of traditional Mattis-type matrices. Our approach accommodates a diverse array of coupling matrices, including those with inherently low ranks, applicable to complex NP-complete problems. We explore the practical benefits of low-rank approximation in optimization tasks, particularly in financial optimization, to demonstrate the real-world applications of SPIMs. Finally, we evaluate the computational limitations imposed by SPIM hardware precision and suggest strategies to optimize the performance of these systems within these constraints.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Framework for an Efficient Normalizing Flow-Based Solution to the Schrodinger Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in quantum mechanics involves solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation for a molecule or material. The Variational Monte Carlo approach to this problem approximates a particular variational objective via sampling, and then optimizes this approximated objective over a chosen parameterized family of wavefunctions, known as the ansatz. Recently neural networks have been used as the ansatz, with accompanying success. However, sampling from such wavefunctions has required the use of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, which is inherently inefficient. In this work, we propose a solution to this problem via an ansatz which is cheap to sample from, yet satisfies the requisite quantum mechanical properties. We prove that a normalizing flow using the following two essential ingredients satisfies our requirements: (a) a base distribution which is constructed from Determinantal Point Processes; (b) flow layers which are equivariant to a particular subgroup of the permutation group. We then show how to construct both continuous and discrete normalizing flows which satisfy the requisite equivariance. We further demonstrate the manner in which the non-smooth nature ("cusps") of the wavefunction may be captured, and how the framework may be generalized to provide induction across multiple molecules. The resulting theoretical framework entails an efficient approach to solving the Electronic Schrodinger Equation.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-supported basis optimizer for the configuration interaction problem in quantum many-body clusters: Feasibility study and numerical proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep-learning approach to optimize the selection of Slater determinants in configuration interaction calculations for condensed-matter quantum many-body systems is developed. We exemplify our algorithm on the discrete version of the single-impurity Anderson model with up to 299 bath sites. Employing a neural network classifier and active learning, our algorithm enhances computational efficiency by iteratively identifying the most relevant Slater determinants for the ground-state wavefunction. We benchmark our results against established methods and investigate the efficiency of our approach as compared to other basis truncation schemes. Our algorithm demonstrates a substantial improvement in the efficiency of determinant selection, yielding a more compact and computationally manageable basis without compromising accuracy. Given the straightforward application of our neural network-supported selection scheme to other model Hamiltonians of quantum many-body clusters, our algorithm can significantly advance selective configuration interaction calculations in the context of correlated condensed matter.</description>

      <title>Predicting solvation free energies with an implicit solvent machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) potentials are a powerful tool in molecular modeling, enabling ab initio accuracy for comparably small computational costs. Nevertheless, all-atom simulations employing best-performing graph neural network architectures are still too expensive for applications requiring extensive sampling, such as free energy computations. Implicit solvent models could provide the necessary speed-up due to reduced degrees of freedom and faster dynamics. Here, we introduce a Solvation Free Energy Path Reweighting (ReSolv) framework to parametrize an implicit solvent ML potential for small organic molecules that accurately predicts the hydration free energy, an essential parameter in drug design and pollutant modeling. With a combination of top-down (experimental hydration free energy data) and bottom-up (ab initio data of molecules in a vacuum) learning, ReSolv bypasses the need for intractable ab initio data of molecules in explicit bulk solvent and does not have to resort to less accurate data-generating models. On the FreeSolv dataset, ReSolv achieves a mean absolute error close to average experimental uncertainty, significantly outperforming standard explicit solvent force fields. The presented framework paves the way toward deep molecular models that are more accurate yet computationally cheaper than classical atomistic models.</description>

      <title>Incompressible Navier-Stokes solve on noisy quantum hardware via a hybrid quantum-classical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partial differential equation solvers are required to solve the Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow. Recently, algorithms have been proposed to simulate fluid dynamics on quantum computers. Fault-tolerant quantum devices might enable exponential speedups over algorithms on classical computers. However, current and upcoming quantum hardware presents noise in the computations, requiring algorithms that make modest use of quantum resources: shallower circuit depths and fewer qubits. Variational algorithms are more appropriate and robust under resource restrictions. This work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Classical devices perform nonlinear computations, and quantum ones use variational algorithms to solve the pressure Poisson equation. A lid-driven cavity problem benchmarks the method. We verify the algorithm via noise-free simulation and test it on noisy IBM superconducting quantum hardware. Results show that high-fidelity results can be achieved via this approach, even on current quantum devices. A multigrid preconditioning approach helps avoid local minima. HTree, a tomography technique with linear complexity in qubit count, reduces the quantum state readout time. We compare the quantum resources required for near-term and fault-tolerant solvers to determine quantum hardware requirements for fluid simulations with complexity improvements.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum-Classical Hybrid Algorithm for Determining Eigenstate Energies in Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient quantum computing algorithms is crucial for addressing computationally challenging problems across various fields. In this paper, we introduce a novel quantum XZ24 algorithm, designed for efficiently computing the eigen-energy spectra of any quantum systems. The algorithm employs an auxiliary qubit as a control qubit to execute a pair of time-reversing real-time evolutions of Hamiltonian $\hat{H}$ on the target qubits. The reference state wavefunction $|\phi_0 \rangle$ is stored in target qubits. When the control qubit (i.e., the auxiliary qubit) is in the 0 (1) state, the $e^{-i\hat{H}t/2} (e^{i\hat{H}t/2})$ evolution operator is applied. By combining Hadamard gates and phase gates on the auxiliary qubit, information about $\langle \psi_0 | \cos(\hat{H}t) | \psi_0 \rangle$ can be obtained from the output auxiliary qubit state. Theoretically, applying the Fourier transformation to the $\langle \psi_0 | \cos(\hat{H}t) | \psi_0 \rangle$ signal can resolve the eigen-energies of the Hamiltonian in the spectrum. We provide theoretical analysis and numerical simulations of the algorithm, demonstrating its advantages in computational efficiency and accuracy. Compared to existing quantum methods, the new algorithm stands out for its remarkably low measurement cost. For quantum systems of any complexity, only a single auxiliary qubit needs to be measured, resulting in a measurement complexity of $O(1)$. Moreover, this method can simultaneously obtain multiple eigen-energies, dependent on the reference state. We anticipate that the new algorithm will drive significant progress in quantum system simulation and offer promising applications in quantum computing and quantum information processing.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an efficient neural network (NN) architecture for classifying wave functions in terms of their localization. Our approach integrates a versatile quantum phase space parametrization leading to a custom 'quantum' NN, with the pattern recognition capabilities of a modified convolutional model. This design accepts wave functions of any dimension as inputs and makes accurate predictions at an affordable computational cost. This scalability becomes crucial to explore the localization rate at the semiclassical limit, a long standing question in the quantum scattering field. Moreover, the physical meaning built in the model allows for the interpretation of the learning process</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach toward characterizing local structural features of two-dimensional particle systems. The approach can accurately identify and characterize defects in high-temperature crystals, distinguish a wide range of nominally disordered systems, and robustly describe complex structures such as grain boundaries. This paper also introduces two-dimensional functionality into the open-source software program VoroTop which automates this analysis.

      <title>A level set-based solver for two-phase incompressible flows: Extension to magnetic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of a two-phase incompressible solver for magnetic flows in the magnetostatic case is presented. The proposed numerical toolkit couples the Navier-Stokes equations of hydrodynamics with Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism to model the behaviour of magnetic flows in the presence of a magnetic field. To this end, a rigorous implementation of a second-order two-phase solver for incompressible nonmagnetic flows is introduced first. This solver is implemented in the finite-difference framework, where a fifth-order conservative level set method is employed to capture the evolution of the interface, along with an incompressible solver based on the projection scheme to model the fluids. The solver demonstrates excellent performance even with high density ratios across the interface (Atwood number $\approx 1$), while effectively preserving the mass conservation property. Subsequently, the numerical discretization of Maxwell's equations under the magnetostatic assumption is described in detail, utilizing the vector potential formulation. The primary second-order solver for two-phase flows is extended to the case of magnetic flows, by incorporating the Lorentz force into the momentum equation, accounting for high magnetic permeability ratios across the interface. The implemented solver is then utilized for examining the deformation of ferrofluid droplets in both quiescent and shear flow regimes across various susceptibility values of the droplets. The results suggest that increasing the susceptibility value of the ferrofluid droplet can affect its deformation and rotation in low capillary regimes. In higher capillary flows, increasing the magnetic permeability jump across the interface can further lead to droplet breakup as well. The effect of this property is also investigated for the Rayleigh-Taylor instability growth in magnetic fluids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A detailed analysis of ptychography for 3D phase reconstructions of thick specimens is performed. We introduce multi-focus ptychography, which incorporates a 4D-STEM defocus series to enhance the quality of 3D reconstructions along the beam direction through a higher overdetermination ratio. This method is compared with established multi-slice ptychography techniques, such as conventional ptychography, regularized ptychography, and multi-mode ptychography. Additionally, we contrast multi-focus ptychography with an alternative method that uses virtual optical sectioning through a reconstructed scattering matrix ($\mathcal{S}$-matrix), which offers more precise 3D structure information compared to conventional ptychography. Our findings from multiple 3D reconstructions based on simulated and experimental data demonstrate that multi-focus ptychography surpasses other techniques, particularly in accurately reconstructing the surfaces and interface regions of thick specimens.</description>

Abstract: The integration of deep neural networks with the Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method has marked a significant advancement in solving the Schr\"odinger equation. In this work, we enforce spin symmetry in the neural network-based VMC calculation with modified optimization target. Our method is designed to solve for the ground state and multiple excited states with target spin symmetry at a low computational cost. It predicts accurate energies while maintaining the correct symmetry in strongly correlated systems, even in cases where different spin states are nearly degenerate. Our approach also excels at spin-gap calculations, including the singlet-triplet gap in biradical systems, which is of high interest in photochemistry. Overall, this work establishes a robust framework for efficiently calculating various quantum states with specific spin symmetry in correlated systems, paving the way for novel discoveries in quantum science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimized effective potential (OEP) approach has so far mainly been used in benchmark studies and for the evaluation of band gaps. In this work, we extend the application of the OEP by determining the analytical ionic forces within the plane-wave and pseudopotential framework. It is first shown that, due to the constrained optimization inherent to the OEP approach, an extra term needs to be added to the standard Hellmann-Feynman expression for the forces, whenever nonlocal pseudopotentials are employed. Computing this term for functionals based on Hartree-Fock and the hybrid PBE0 functional yields forces with excellent numerical accuracy. Furthermore, results for equilibrium geometries and vibrational frequencies on a set of molecules and solids confirm that the local exchange OEP is able to reproduce results obtained with the nonlocal exchange potential. Our work opens up the possibility to study lattice dynamics using advanced orbital functionals for describing exchange and correlation effects.</description>

      <title>Towards latent space evolution of spatiotemporal dynamics of six-dimensional phase space of charged particle beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Addressing the charged particle beam diagnostics in accelerators poses a formidable challenge, demanding high-fidelity simulations in limited computational time. Machine learning (ML) based surrogate models have emerged as a promising tool for non-invasive charged particle beam diagnostics. Trained ML models can make predictions much faster than computationally expensive physics simulations. In this work, we have proposed a temporally structured variational autoencoder model to autoregressively forecast the spatiotemporal dynamics of the 15 unique 2D projections of 6D phase space of charged particle beam as it travels through the LANSCE linear accelerator. In the model, VAE embeds the phase space projections into a lower dimensional latent space. A long-short-term memory network then learns the temporal correlations in the latent space. The trained network can evolve the phase space projections across further modules provided the first few modules as inputs. The model predicts all the projections across different modules with low mean squared error and high structural similarity index.</description>

      <title>Statistics of drops generated from ensembles of randomly corrugated ligaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.16192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.16192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The size of drops generated by the capillary-driven disintegration of liquid ligaments plays a fundamental role in several important natural phenomena, ranging from heat and mass transfer at the ocean-atmosphere interface to pathogen transmission. The inherent non-linearity of the equations governing the ligament destabilization leads to significant differences in the resulting drop sizes, owing to small fluctuations in the myriad initial conditions. Previous experiments and simulations reveal a variety of drop size distributions, corresponding to competing underlying physical interpretations. Here, we perform numerical simulations of individual ligaments, the deterministic breakup of which is triggered by random initial surface corrugations. The simulations are grouped in a large ensemble, each corresponding to a random initial configuration. The resulting probability distributions reveal three stable drop sizes, generated via a sequence of two distinct stages of breakup. Four different distributions are tested, volume-based Poisson, Gaussian, Gamma and Log-Normal. Depending on the time, range of droplet sizes and criteria for success, each distribution has successes and failures. However the Log-Normal distribution roughly describes the data when fitting both the primary peak and the tail of the distribution while the number of droplets generated is the highest, while the Gamma and Log-Normal distributions perform equally well when fitting the tail. The study demonstrates a precisely controllable and reproducible framework, which can be employed to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the polydispersity of drop sizes found in complex fluid fragmentation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalable molecular simulation of electrolyte solutions with quantum chemical accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12535</link>

Abstract: Unleashing the predictive power of molecular dynamics (MD), Neural Network Potentials (NNPs) trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are revolutionizing our ability to simulate chemical systems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency. Electrolyte solutions are a natural initial system to apply this tool to because they are critically important for a wide range of applications and their properties cannot currently be predicted. Unfortunately, however most DFT approximations are not sufficiently accurate to predict many practically relevant properties of electrolytes. Additionally, tracking the position of every atom in a system during molecular simulations is inherently limited, even with NNP-MD. Here, we use a state-of-the-art DFT approximation to demonstrate highly accurate all-atom NNPs with minimal training data. We demonstrate that NNPs can reliably be recursively trained on a subset of their own output to enable coarse-grained continuum solvent molecular simulations that can access much longer timescales. We apply our technique to simulate lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and lithium bromide in water. We reproduce key structural, thermodynamic, and kinetic properties of these solutions in agreement with experimental data. The formation of a previously unknown Li cation dimer is observed, along with identical anion-anion interactions of chloride and bromide. Finally, the coarse-grained model is capable of reproducing crystal phase behavior and infinite dilution pairing free energies despite being trained solely on moderate concentration solutions, disproving the notion that NNPs are only useful for interpolation. This approach should be scalable to determine the properties of electrolyte solutions over a much wider range of conditions and compositions than is possible experimentally.</description>

      <title>High Resolution Optimized High-Order Schemes for Discretization of Non-Linear Straight and Mixed Second Derivative Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new set of midpoint-based high-order discretization schemes for computing straight and mixed nonlinear second derivative terms that appear in the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Firstly, we detail a set of conventional fourth and sixth-order baseline schemes that utilize central midpoint derivatives for the calculation of second derivatives terms. To enhance the spectral properties of the baseline schemes, an optimization procedure is proposed that adjusts the order and truncation error of the midpoint derivative approximation while still constraining the same overall stencil width and scheme order. A new filter penalty term is introduced into the midpoint derivative calculation to help achieve high wavenumber accuracy and high-frequency damping in the mixed derivative discretization. Fourier analysis performed on the both straight and mixed second derivative terms show high spectral efficiency and minimal numerical viscosity with no odd-even decoupling effect. Numerical validation of the resulting optimized schemes is performed through various benchmark test cases assessing their theoretical order of accuracy and solution resolution. The results highlight that the present optimized schemes efficiently utilize the inherent viscosity of the governing equations to achieve improved simulation stability - a feature attributed to their superior spectral resolution in the high wavenumber range. The method is also tested and applied to non-uniform structured meshes in curvilinear coordinates, employing a supersonic impinging jet test case.</description>

      <title>Numerical linked-cluster expansions for two-dimensional spin models with continuous disorder distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that numerical linked cluster expansions (NLCEs) based on sufficiently large building blocks allow one to obtain accurate low-temperature results for the thermodynamic properties of spin lattice models with continuous disorder distributions. Specifically, we show that such results can be obtained computing the disorder averages in the NLCE clusters before calculating their weights. We provide a proof of concept using three different NLCEs based on L, square, and rectangle building blocks. We consider both classical (Ising) and quantum (Heisenberg) spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models and show that convergence can be achieved down to temperatures that are up to two orders of magnitude lower than the relevant energy scale in the model. Additionally, we provide evidence that in one dimension one can obtain accurate results for observables such as the energy down to their ground-state values.</description>

      <title>Deep learning methods for Hamiltonian parameter estimation and magnetic domain image generation in twisted van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of twist engineering in van der Waals magnets has opened new frontiers in the field of two-dimensional magnetism, yielding distinctive magnetic domain structures. Despite the introduction of numerous theoretical methods, limitations persist in terms of accuracy or efficiency due to the complex nature of the magnetic Hamiltonians pertinent to these systems. In this study, we introduce a deep-learning approach to tackle these challenges. Utilizing customized, fully connected networks, we develop two deep-neural-network kernels that facilitate efficient and reliable analysis of twisted van der Waals magnets. Our regression model is adept at estimating the magnetic Hamiltonian parameters of twisted bilayer CrI3 from its magnetic domain images generated through atomistic spin simulations. The generative model excels in producing precise magnetic domain images from the provided magnetic parameters. The trained networks for these models undergo thorough validation, including statistical error analysis and assessment of robustness against noisy injections. These advancements not only extend the applicability of deep-learning methods to twisted van der Waals magnets but also streamline future investigations into these captivating yet poorly understood systems.</description>

      <title>Shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symplectic integrators are widely implemented numerical integrators for Hamiltonian mechanics, which preserve the Hamiltonian structure (symplecticity) of the system. Although the symplectic integrator does not conserve the energy of the system, it is well known that there exists a conserving modified Hamiltonian, called the shadow Hamiltonian. For the Nambu mechanics, which is a kind of generalized Hamiltonian mechanics, we can also construct structure-preserving integrators by the same procedure used to construct the symplectic integrators. In the structure-preserving integrator, however, the existence of shadow Hamiltonians is nontrivial. This is because the Nambu mechanics is driven by multiple Hamiltonians and it is nontrivial whether the time evolution by the integrator can be cast into the Nambu mechanical time evolution driven by multiple shadow Hamiltonians. In this paper we present a general procedure to calculate the shadow Hamiltonians of structure-preserving integrators for Nambu mechanics, and give an example where the shadow Hamiltonians exist. This is the first attempt to determine the concrete forms of the shadow Hamiltonians for a Nambu mechanical system. We show that the fundamental identity, which corresponds to the Jacobi identity in Hamiltonian mechanics, plays an important role in calculating the shadow Hamiltonians using the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula. It turns out that the resulting shadow Hamiltonians have indefinite forms depending on how the fundamental identities are used. This is not a technical artifact, because the exact shadow Hamiltonians obtained independently have the same indefiniteness.</description>

      <title>Generating Reservoir State Descriptions with Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to reservoir computer measurements using random matrices. We do so to motivate how atomic-scale devices might be used for real-world computing applications. Our approach uses random matrices to construct reservoir measurements, introducing a simple, scalable means for producing state descriptions. In our studies, two reservoirs, a five-atom Heisenberg spin chain, and a five-qubit quantum circuit, perform time series prediction and data interpolation. The performance of the measurement technique and current limitations are discussed in detail alongside an exploration of the diversity of measurements yielded by the random matrices. Additionally, we explore the role of the parameters of the reservoirs, adjusting coupling strength and the measurement dimension, yielding insights into how these learning machines might be automatically tuned for different problems. This research highlights using random matrices to measure simple quantum reservoirs for natural learning devices and outlines a path forward for improving their performance and experimental realization.</description>
