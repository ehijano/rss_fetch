      <title>Magnetic structure of EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ single-crystal thin-film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic topological materials are a class of compounds which can host massless electrons controlled by the magnetic order. One such compound is EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$, which has recently garnered interest due to its strong interplay between the Eu magnetism and charge carriers. However the topology of the electronic band structure, which depends on the ground state magnetic configuration of the europium sublattice, has not been determined. Based on our \textit{ab-initio} calculations, we find that an in-plane and out-of-plane \textit{A}-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) order generates a topological crystalline insulator and Dirac semimetal respectively, whereas a ferromagnetic (FM) order stabilizes a Weyl semimetal. Our resonant x-ray elastic scattering measurements of single-crystal thin film EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ reveal both a sharp magnetic peak at $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,\frac{1}{2})$ and broad $\textit{\textbf{Q}}$=$(0,0,1)$ below $T_{\mathrm{N}}=12.9$\,K, which is associated with an \textit{A}-type AFM and FM order, respectively. Our measurements indicate that the FM and AFM layers are spatially separated along the crystal $c$ axis, with the former limited to the top three atomic layers. We propose that EuZn$_2$Sb$_2$ behaves as a Weyl semimetal in the surface FM layers, and as a topological crystalline insulator in the lower AFM layers.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Many Body Quantum Embedding and Local Correlation in Crystalline Materials using Interpolative Separable Density Fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient implementation of ab initio many-body quantum embedding and local correlation methods for infinite periodic systems through translational symmetry adapted interpolative separable density fitting, an approach which reduces the scaling of the calculations to only linear with the number of k-points. Employing this methodology, we compute correlated ground-state coupled cluster energies within density matrix embedding and local natural orbital correlation frameworks for both weakly and strongly correlated solids, using up to 1000 k-points. By extrapolating the local correlation domains and k-point sampling we further obtain estimates of the full coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples ground-state energies in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Kondo-assisted N\'eel order in a Kondo necklace model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between Kondo screening and magnetic order has long been a central issue in the physics of strongly correlated systems. While the Kondo effect has traditionally been understood to suppress magnetism through the formation of local singlets, recent studies suggest that Kondo interactions may enhance magnetic order under certain conditions. However, these scenarios often rely on complex electronic structures, including orbital and charge degrees of freedom, making the essential mechanisms difficult to isolate. Here we report the realization of a spin-(1/2,1) Kondo necklace model in a Ni-based complex-a minimal spin-only analog of the Kondo lattice that isolates quantum spin correlations by eliminating charge degrees of freedom. Thermodynamic measurements identify a magnetic phase transition and a field-induced quantum phase transition. Perturbative analysis reveals that the Kondo coupling mediates effective antiferromagnetic interactions between the spin-1 sites, stabilizing the N\'eel order across the entire chain. Our results establish a universal boundary in Kondo physics, where coupling to spin-1/2 moments yields singlets, but to spin-1 and higher stabilizes magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Realization of a triangular spin necklace in a verdazyl-based Ni complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We successfully synthesized a verdazyl-based complex, ($m$-Py-V)$_3$[Ni(NO$_3$)$_2$], in which Ni$^{2+}$ ions and verdazyl radicals form a one-dimensional, triangular spin necklace consisting of spin-1/2 and spin-1 units. Molecular orbital calculations reveal strong antiferromagnetic (AF) interactions between inversion-related radical pairs that form spin-1/2 singlet dimers. The remaining verdazyl and Ni$^{2+}$ spins form frustrated triangular units, creating a distinctive spin network. Magnetic susceptibility and specific heat measurements identify a phase transition to an AF order. The application of magnetic fields suppresses the phase transition signal, suggesting field-induced decoupling of the spin-1 moments. Electron spin resonance measurements are used to evaluate the easy-axis anisotropy of spin-1, which may promote the AF order. This work provides a rare example of a geometrically frustrated quantum spin chain realized via molecular design, thereby offering a platform for exploring frustration-driven quantum phases in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerating dynamical mean-field theory convergence by preconditioning with computationally cheaper quantum embedding methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) is a cornerstone technique for studying strongly correlated electronic systems. However, each DMFT step is computationally demanding, and many iterations can be required to achieve convergence. Here, we accelerate the convergence of DMFT by initializing its self-consistent cycle with solutions from computationally cheaper and more approximate methods. We compare the initialization with the non-interacting solution to a range of quantum embedding compatible approaches: Hartree-Fock, the Hubbard-I approximation, rotationally invariant slave bosons (RISB), and its ghost extension (g-RISB). We find that these initializations can reduce the number of DMFT iterations by up to an order of magnitude, with g-RISB providing the most effective and reliable benefits. In most regimes, initializing with g-RISB and performing a single DMFT iteration suffices to recover the full dynamical structure. The improvement in convergence is controlled by the initial solution's accuracy in the low-energy part of the self-energy, on the scale of the non-interacting bandwidth. This strategy is especially effective at the Mott insulator-metal transition, where an initialization from the non-interacting limit can lead to a breakdown of DMFT due to the sign problem. Our results establish the usage of accurate yet cheaper quantum embedding methods as a powerful means to substantially reduce the computational cost of DMFT, particularly in regimes where convergence is slow or prone to failure.</description>

      <title>Effect of Electron Correlation on the Integer Quantum Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the effect of electron correlation on the integer quantum Hall effect in a square lattice. Increasing the correlation strength via the effective onsite repulsion parameter $U$ degrades the quantization of $\nu = 1$ transverse conductance due to the interplay of correlation and the external magnetic field, which together induce periodic modulations in renormalized hopping parameters and site energies. Overall, this work demonstrates that the strength of electron correlation can significantly impact conductivity in the integer quantum Hall regime.</description>

      <title>Bosonization Solution to Spin-Valley Kondo Problem: Finite-Size Spectrum and Renormalization Group Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-valley Anderson impurities (SVAIM) with (anti-)Hund's splitting provide a natural explanation to the origin of pairing potential and pseudogap in the magic-angle graphene. In this work, we derive and analytically solve the low-energy Kondo theories for SVAIM at half-filling, with especial focus on the two anti-Hund's regimes: the impurity is either dominated by a valley doublet, or a trivial singlet. In the doublet regime, we reveal that a novel pair Kondo scattering $\lambda_x$ is required to flip the valley doublet, which involves a quartic operator of bath electrons. Our renormalization group (RG) calculation based on the Coulomb gas analog shows $\lambda_x$ drives a phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. One side of the transition is an anisotropic doublet phase, characterized by non-universal phase shifts of bath electrons and non-analytic impurity susceptibilities, while the other is a Fermi liquid formed by pair-Kondo resonance. The finite-size many-body spectrum, thermodynamic quantities, and correlation functions for both phases are analytically solved. Remarkably, the solution in the pair-Kondo Fermi liquid is achieved via the constructive approach of bosonization-refermionization along a solvable fixed line, where the many-body interaction $\lambda_x$ is mapped into a pseudo-fermion bilinear in a rigorous manner. Finally, we also apply the RG analysis to the singlet regime, and identify a second-order phase transition between the Kondo Fermi liquid and a local singlet phase.</description>

      <title>$d$-wave FFLO state and charge-2e supersolidity in the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model under Zeeman fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity under strong Zeeman fields--particularly beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit--remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. The exotic Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, in particular, remains in need of definitive study within fundamental electronic models. Here we employ state-of-the-art finite-temperature and ground-state tensor network approaches to systematically explore the superconducting (SC) phase diagram of the $t$-$t'$-$J$ model subjected to Zeeman fields. We find that zero-momentum $d$-wave superconductivity persists until the spin gap closes, coexisting with charge density waves. A novel $d$-wave FFLO phase emerges under a higher Zeeman field even above the Pauli limit, concomitant with a field-enhanced spin density waves. We identify these phases, characterized by the simultaneous presence of pairing condensate and density wave orders, as charge-2e supersolids. Analysis of Matsubara Green's function reveals that the FFLO pairing momentum is locked to the underlying Fermi surface. Our results provide microscopic insights into field-induced unconventional pairing mechanisms and reveal the long-sought FFLO state in a fundamental correlated electron model, offering a promising route for its realization in ultracold atom optical lattice.</description>

      <title>Zoology of Altermagnetic-type Non-collinear Magnets on the Maple Leaf Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define unconventional non-collinear magnetic ground states on the maple leaf lattice (MLL) distinguished by the selective breaking or preservation of time reversal ($\mathcal{T}$) and parity ($\mathcal{P}$). Depending on the nature of $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-breaking, linear spin-wave theory reveals momentum-dependent non-relativistic magnon spin splitting at different high symmetry points in the Brillouin zone. From a mean-field analysis of the Hubbard model at weak coupling, we reveal itinerant $\mathcal{P}$-preserving $q=0$ altermagnetic (A$l$M)-type order, while we expect $\mathcal{P}$-broken canted-$120^\circ$ A$l$M-type order at strong coupling. Our findings establish the MLL as a prime platform for exploring phase transitions and frustration phenomena emanating from competing non-collinear A$l$M-type orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states host fractionally charged anyons with exotic exchange statistics. Of particular interest are FQH phases supporting non-Abelian anyons, which can encode topologically protected quantum information. In this work, we construct quasihole bases for a broad family of non-Abelian FQH states using parton wave functions, which reproduces the fusion-space dimensionality expected from their underlying conformal field theory, consistent with level-rank duality across the parton family. As an application, we numerically compute braiding matrices for representative parton states for large systems, providing a general framework for diagnosing non-Abelian characteristics in candidate FQH states.</description>

      <title>Intermediate Field Spin(on) Dynamics in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present comprehensive inelastic neutron spectroscopic maps of the magnetic field-induced disordered phase of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. For fields along both in-plane high-symmetry directions we observe that the spin excitation spectrum at and above a magnetic field of 8~T is gapped. Excitation modes then sharpen for increasing field but are consistently broader than experimental resolution even at 13.5~T. The out-of-plane dispersion diminishes in the 7-10~T regime, signifying enhanced two-dimensional behavior as the in-plane liquid correlations are established. In this regime, excitations are very broad and largely flat for all accessible energy-momenta, which is kinematically at odds with a magnon-decay picture. By contrast, a continuum of fractionalized excitations naturally yields a broad continuum response, which crucially may be accompanied by sharper modes of bound states of fractionalized excitations. Their damping by the continuum accounts for the observed spectral broadening and field dependence. Our results provide strong evidence for the existence of fractionalized excitations in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in a magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results for the phase diagram of the parent compound LaCrAsO under electron doping using the matrix random-phase approximation. At low doping levels, the system stabilizes an antiferromagnetic state in which different Cr sublattices carry opposite spins, consistent with experimental observations. As the doping concentration increases, a stripe-type antiferromagnetic phase becomes favored. At even higher doping, the system repeats the two former magnetic states, but with incommensurate magnetic ordering vectors. The commensurate magnetic phases are associated with more localized electrons in the Cr $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, whereas the incommensurate phases are linked to the $d_{xy}$ orbital, whose stronger overlap favors itinerant-electron magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundary critical phenomena of the one-dimensional quantum Ashkin-Teller model using boundary conformal field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. Based on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold of the $c=1$ compactified boson boundary conformal field theory, we construct microscopic lattice boundary terms that renormalize to the stable conformal boundary conditions,, utilizing simple current extensions and the underlying $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry to explicitly characterize the four-state Potts point. We validate these theoretical identifications via finite-size spectroscopy of the lattice energy spectra, confirming their consistency with $D_4$ symmetry and Kramers-Wannier duality. Finally, we discuss the boundary renormalization group flows among these identified fixed points to propose a global phase diagram for the boundary criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a natural generalization of bipartite entanglement, but is relatively poorly understood. In this paper, we develop tools to calculate a class of multipartite entanglement measures - known as multi-invariants - for stabilizer states. We give an efficient numerical algorithm that computes multi-invariants for stabilizer states. For tripartite stabilizer states, we also obtain an explicit formula for any multi-invariant using the GHZ-extraction theorem. We then present a counting argument that calculates any Coxeter multi-invariant of a q-partite stabilizer state. We conjecture a closed form expression for the same. We uncover hints of an interesting connection between multi-invariants, stabilizer states and topology. We show how our formulas are further simplified for a restricted class of stabilizer states that appear as ground states of interesting models like the toric code and the X-cube model.</description>

Abstract: Gapped two-dimensional gauge theories with massless fermions generically have rich vacuum structures consisting of many degenerate vacua related by the action of topological line operators. The algebra of such operators has been used to calculate ratios of vacuum expectation values of local operators and to predict nontrivial particle-soliton degeneracies. In this paper, we use recently-developed tensor network methods to study several examples of such theories via their Hamiltonian lattice descriptions. Our lattice results agree with all previously-made predictions. Furthermore, we identify the lattice strong-coupling states that can be adiabatically continued to the degenerate vacua in the continuum limit. We conjecture a procedure, referred to as a lattice decay rule, for how this identification works in general. This rule allows us to compute the continuum vacuum degeneracy by studying the lattice Hamiltonian in the strong-coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Gluing Randomness via Entanglement: Tight Bound from Second R\'enyi Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient generation of random quantum states is a long-standing challenge, motivated by their diverse applications in quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we identify entanglement as the key resource that enables local random unitaries to generate global random states by effectively gluing randomness across the system. Specifically, we demonstrate that approximate random states can be produced from an entangled state $|\psi\rangle$ through the application of local random unitaries. We show that the resulting ensemble forms an approximate state design with an error saturating as $\Theta(e^{-\mathcal{N}_2(\psi)})$, where $\mathcal{N}_2(\psi)$ is the second R\'enyi entanglement entropy of $|\psi\rangle$. Furthermore, we prove that this tight bound also applies to the second R\'enyi entropy of coherence when the ensemble is constructed using coherence-free operations. These results imply that, when restricted to resource-free gates, the quality of the generated random states is determined entirely by the resource content of the initial state. Notably, we find that among all $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropeis, the second R\'enyi entropy yields the tightest bounds. Consequently, these second R\'enyi entropies can be interpreted as the maximal capacities for generating randomness using resource-free operations. Finally, moving beyond approximate state designs, we utilize this entanglement-assisted gluing mechanism to present a novel method for generating pseudorandom states in multipartite systems from a locally entangled state via pseudorandom unitaries in each of parties.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Piezomagnetism in Mn$_3$Sn: A Dual Real- and $k$-Space Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study on the origin of the piezomagnetic effect in the non-collinear antiferromagnet Mn$_3$Sn, a material known for exhibiting a large anomalous Hall effect. We investigate strain-induced variations of electronic and magnetic states and elucidate the mechanism of the piezomagnetic effect from both real-space and momentum-space perspectives. In real space, the emergence of piezomagnetism is understood to arise from rotations of the magnetic moments at specific Mn sites, which directly couple to the strain. Through detailed electronic structure analysis, we identify the Fermi surfaces that play a crucial role in the emergence of piezomagnetism. Our results reveal that specific Fermi surface features undergo pseudo-degeneracy lifting under applied strain, which significantly contributes to the induced net magnetization. By combining these complementary real-space and momentum-space pictures, our dual-space analysis provides deep insight into the microscopic origins of strain-driven magnetization in Mn$_3$Sn.</description>

      <title>Observation of an isolated flat band in the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dispersionless electronic bands lead to an extremely high density of states and suppressed kinetic energy, thereby increasing electronic correlations and instabilities that can shape emergent ordered states, such as excitonic, ferromagnetic, and superconducting phases. A flat band that extends over the entire momentum space and is well isolated from other dispersive bands is, therefore, particularly interesting. Here, the band structure of the van der Waals crystal NbOCl$_2$ is revealed by utilizing photoelectron momentum microscopy. We directly map out an electronic band that is flat throughout the entire Brillouin zone and features a width of only $\sim$100 meV. This band is well isolated from both the conduction and remote valence bands. Moreover, the quasiparticle band gap shows a high tunability upon the deposition of caesium atoms on the surface. By combining the single-particle band structure with the optical transmission spectrum, the optical gap is identified. The fully isolated flat band in a van der Waals crystal provides a qualitatively new testbed for exploring flat-band physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introducing superconductivity (SC) or magnetism into topological insulators (TIs) can give rise to novel quantum states and exotic physical phenomena. Here, we report a high-pressure transport study on the TI Ge2Bi2Te5 and its Mn-doped counterparts. The application of pressure induces a SC in Ge2Bi2Te5, which shows a dome-shape phase diagram with the maximum Tc of 7.6 K at 23 GPa. Doping Mn into Ge2Bi2Te5 introduces an antiferromagnetic order at ambient pressure and strongly weakens the pressure-induced SC, demonstrating that magnetism and SC compete in this material system. Present study provides a new platform for investigating the interplay among band topology, magnetism, and SC.</description>

Abstract: We provide the superconducting density of states of the iron based superconductor LaRu2P2 (Tc= 4.1 K), measured using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy. From the tunneling conductance, we extract a density of states which shows the opening of a s-wave single superconducting gap. The temperature dependence of the gap also follows BCS theory. Under magnetic fields, vortices present Caroli de Gennes Matricon states, although these are strongly broadened by defect scattering. From the vortex core size we obtain a superconducting coherence length of {\xi} = 50 nm, compatible with the value extracted from macroscopic Hc2 measurements. We discuss the comparison between s-wave LaRu2P2 and pnictide unconventional multiple gap and strongly correlated Fe based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Atomically Resolved Acoustic Dynamics Coupled with Magnetic Order in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelastic coupling in van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials enables a unique interplay between the spin and lattice degrees of freedom. Characterizing the elastic responses with atomic and femtosecond resolution across the magnetic transition is essential for guiding the design of magnetically tunable actuators and strain-mediated spintronic devices. Here, ultrafast x-ray diffraction employed at a free-electron laser reveals that the atomic displacements, wave vectors, and dispersion relations of acoustic phonon modes in a vdW antiferromagnet FePS$_3$ are coupled with the magnetic order, by tracking both in-plane and out-of-plane Bragg peaks upon optical excitation across the N\'eel temperature (T$_N$). One transverse mode shows that a quasi-out-of-plane atomic displacement undergoes a significant directional change across T$_N$. Its quasi-in-plane wave vector is derived by the comparison between the measured sound velocity and the first-principles calculations. The other transverse mode is an interlayer shear acoustic mode whose amplitude is strongly enhanced in the antiferromagnetic phase, exhibiting eight times stronger amplitude than the longitudinal acoustic mode below T$_N$. The atomically resolved characterization of acoustic phonon dynamics that couple with magnetic ordering opens opportunities for harnessing unique magnetoelastic coupling in vdW magnets on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Random singlet physics in the $S = \frac{1}{2}$ pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a random singlet ground state in the $S=\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$. Cationic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ disorder on the pyrochlore $A$ site generates a broad distribution of Cu$^{2+}$--F$^-$--Cu$^{2+}$ exchange couplings, introducing intrinsic magnetic bond disorder. Despite strong antiferromagnetic interactions ($\theta_{\mathrm{CW}}=-72$~K), no magnetic order or global spin freezing is observed in DC and AC susceptibility, specific heat or $^{23}$Na nuclear magnetic resonance to 120 mK, with muon spin relaxation experiments confirming persistent spin dynamics to 58 mK. $T$-linear specific heat, a Curie-like susceptibility tail, and power-law scaling with data collapse in $\chi(T)$, $M(H)$, $C_{\mathrm{mag}}/T$, $^{23}$Na $(1/T_1T)$ and the muon spin polarization $P(t)$ reveal a disorder-driven network of random singlets and orphan spins. Scaling across multiple bulk and local probes is consistent with a broad distribution of exchange energies, $P[\mathcal{J}] \sim \mathcal{J}^{-\alpha}$. This behavior contrasts with previously-studied Na$A''B_2$F$_7$ pyrochlore fluorides, where magnetic bond disorder precipitates spin-glass freezing, underscoring the crucial role of strong $S=\frac{1}{2}$ quantum fluctuations in NaCdCu$_2$F$_7$.</description>

      <title>To infinity and back -- $1/N$ graph expansions of light-matter systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for performing a full graph expansion for light-matter systems, utilizing the linked-cluster theorem. This method enables us to explore $1/N$ corrections to the thermodynamic limit $N\to \infty$ in the number of particles, giving us access to the mesoscopic regime. While this regime is yet largely unexplored due to the challenges of studying it with established approaches, it incorporates intriguing features, such as entanglement between light and matter that vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. As a representative application, we calculate physical quantities of the low-energy regime for the paradigmatic Dicke-Ising chain in the paramagnetic normal phase by accompanying the graph expansion with both exact diagonalization (NLCE) and perturbation theory (pcst++), benchmarking our approach against other techniques. We investigate the ground-state energy density and photon density, showing a smooth transition from the microscopic to the macroscopic regime up to the thermodynamic limit. Around the quantum critical point, we extract the $1/N$ corrections to the ground-state energy density to obtain the critical point and critical exponent using extrapolation techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of higher-order fermionic deformations in multiflavor Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory. Focusing specifically on the 6- and 8-fermion interactions, we show that these terms can have significant consequences on the dynamics of the system. In certain regions of parameter space, the theory continues to exhibit second-order phase transitions with mean-field critical exponents and the same critical temperature; however, the temperature dependence of the superconducting gap can deviate markedly from conventional BCS behavior. In other regions, the theory exhibits first-order phase transitions or second-order phase transitions with non-mean field exponents. We conclude by discussing potential phenomenological applications of these theories.</description>

      <title>The sphere free energy of the vector models to order $1/N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the large-$N$ expansion of the sphere free energy $F=-\log Z_{S^d}$ of the O(N) $\phi^4$ and the Gross-Neveu $(\bar{\psi} \psi)^2$ CFTs to order $1/N$. Analytic regularization of these theories requires consistently shifting the UV scaling dimension of the auxiliary field: this can only be done by modifying its kinetic term. This modification combines with the counterterms to give the result that matches the $\epsilon$-expansion, resolving a puzzle raised by Tarnopolsky in arXiv:1609.09113. These $F$s can be written compactly in terms of the anomalous dimensions, for both the short-range and the long-range versions of these CFTs. We also provide various technical results including a computation of the counterterms on the sphere and a neat derivation of the sphere free energy of a free conformal field. Finally, we observe that the long-range CFT becomes the short-range CFT at exactly the point where its $\tilde{F} =-\sin \tfrac{\pi d}{2} F$ is maximized as a function of the vector's scaling dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use resonant X-ray scattering at the nickel L$_{2,3}$ edges to investigate the interplay between orbital degrees of freedom and charge density waves (CDW) in the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$. Both the incommensurate and commensurate CDWs in this system exhibit strong resonant enhancement with distinct energy and polarization dependencies, indicative of orbital ordering. Azimuthal-angle-dependent measurements reveal a lowering of the local Ni site symmetry, consistent with monoclinic or lower point group symmetry. The scattering signatures of both CDWs are dominated by contributions from Ni $d_{xz,yz}$ orbitals, with similar orbital character despite their distinct wave vectors. These findings point to a shared orbital-driven formation mechanism and provide new insight into the symmetry breaking and orbital/nematic fluctuations in the high-temperature regime of the superconductor BaNi$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$.</description>

      <title>First-principles calculation of electronic and topological properties of low-dimensional tellurium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, vibrational, and topological properties of tellurium across its dimensional hierarchy, including bulk trigonal Te-I, two-dimensional tellurene polymorphs, and one-dimensional helical nanowires. Using density functional theory with full inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, we confirm that bulk Te-I is a narrow-gap semiconductor hosting Weyl nodes arising from broken inversion symmetry and degenerate phonon modes suggestive of chiral phonon behavior. In contrast, two-dimensional alpha and beta-tellurene are found to be topologically trivial, with no spin-orbit-driven band inversion in the occupied manifold. Beyond these established phases, we find that buckled kagome and buckled square tellurene lattices exhibit a nontrivial two-dimensional topology of the occupied electronic bands, indicating incipient quantum spin Hall character in metallic systems. In contrast, one-side hydrogen-passivated hexagonal tellurene realizes a fully gapped quantum spin Hall phase with a robust Z2 = 1 invariant, preserved under applied strain and chemical functionalization. In the one-dimensional limit, helical tellurium nanowires preserve chirality and host edge-localized states accompanied by pronounced anisotropy in carrier effective masses. These results establish tellurium as a highly tunable platform for engineering topological phenomena across dimensionality, bridging three-dimensional Weyl physics, two-dimensional quantum spin Hall and incipient Z2 phases, and one-dimensional helical systems.</description>

      <title>Mind the Gap -- Imaging Buried Interfaces in Twisted Oxide Moir\'es</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune electronic structure in twisted stacks of two-dimensional (2D) materials has motivated the exploration of similar moir\'e physics with twisted oxide membranes. Due to the intrinsic three-dimensional nature of bonding in many oxides, achieving atomic-level coupling is significantly more challenging than with van der Waals materials. Although clean interfaces with atomic-level proximity have been demonstrated in ceramic bicrystals using high-temperature and high-pressure processing to facilitate atomic diffusion that flattens rough interfaces, such conditions are not readily accessible when bonding oxide membranes. This study shows how topographic mismatch due to surface roughness of the membranes can restrict atomic-scale proximity at the interface to isolated patches even after contaminants and amorphous interlayers are eliminated. In interfaces between 2D materials and oxide membranes the reduced ability of the 2D material to conform to the membrane's step-terrace topography also limits atomic-scale contact. When imaging stacked membranes in projection, we find conventional through-focal imaging to be relatively insensitive to the buried interface, whereas electron ptychography detects structural variations on the order of a nanometer. These findings highlight interface roughness as a key challenge for the field of oxide twistronics and emphasize the need for reliable characterization methods, both in cross-section and projection.</description>

      <title>Geometric Categories for Continuous Gauging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified categorical framework for gauging both continuous and finite symmetries in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Our construction applies to geometric categories i.e. categories internal to stacks. This generalizes the familiar setting of fusion categories, which describe finite group symmetries, to the case of Lie group symmetries. Within this framework, we obtain a functorial Symmetry Topological Field Theory together with its natural boundaries, allowing us to compute associated endomorphism categories and Drinfeld centers in a uniform way. For a given symmetry group $G$, our framework recovers the electric and magnetic higher-form symmetries expected in $G$-gauge theory. Moreover, it naturally encodes electric breaking symmetry in the presence of charged matter, reproducing known physical phenomena in a categorical setting.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Infrared Landscape of the SYK Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a class of SYK models whose Hamiltonian is the sum of two SYK Hamiltonians with different numbers of fermions $q, \tilde q$ in each interaction. We consider both Euclidean and Lorentzian probes of the quantum system in the large $N$ limit. In the strong coupling phase, the entropy provides a diagnostic of the thermal renormalisation group flow. Under certain conditions, two parametrically separated regimes of near-conformal behaviour emerge. The first reproduces the standard linear-in-temperature scaling characteristic of the single SYK model. The system then flows to another near-fixed point whose entropy scaling depends on the ratio $n = q/\tilde q$. For $n&lt;3/2$, the entropy exhibits anomalous, stronger-than-linear scaling in temperature. At $n=3/2$, there is an additional logarithmic enhancement. Using conformal perturbation theory, we argue that in the infrared regime of the SYK model, there may exist disordered conformal operators with dimensions $1 &lt; \Delta \leq 3/2$. In Lorentzian signature, we study the out-of-time-ordered correlator and show that these deformed theories exhibit near-maximal chaos in both regimes (when they exist). We comment on the relation between the anomalous scalings found here and those observed in certain near-extremal black holes in two and higher dimensions.</description>
