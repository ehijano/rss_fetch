      <title>Generalization and the Rise of System-level Creativity in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation ecosystems require careful policy stewardship to drive sustained advance in human health, welfare, security and prosperity. We develop new measures that reliably decompose the influence of innovations in terms of the degree to which each represents a field-level foundation, an extension of foundational work, or a generalization that synthesizes and modularizes contributions from distant fields to catalyze combinatorial innovation. Using 23 million scientific works, we demonstrate that while foundational and extensional work within fields has declined in recent years-a trend garnering much recent attention-generalizations across fields have increased and accelerated with the rise of the web, social media, and artificial intelligence, shifting the locus of innovation from within fields to across the system as a whole. We explore implications for science policy.</description>

      <title>Fair Minimum Labeling: Efficient Temporal Network Activations for Reachability and Equity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing resource efficiency and fairness is critical in networked systems that support modern learning applications. We introduce the Fair Minimum Labeling (FML) problem: the task of designing a minimum-cost temporal edge activation plan that ensures each group of nodes in a network has sufficient access to a designated target set, according to specified coverage requirements. FML captures key trade-offs in systems where edge activations incur resource costs and equitable access is essential, such as distributed data collection, update dissemination in edge-cloud systems, and fair service restoration in critical infrastructure. We show that FML is NP-hard and $\Omega(\log |V|)$-hard to approximate, and we present probabilistic approximation algorithms that match this bound, achieving the best possible guarantee for the activation cost. We demonstrate the practical utility of FML in a fair multi-source data aggregation task for training a shared model. Empirical results show that FML enforces group-level fairness with substantially lower activation cost than baseline heuristics, underscoring its potential for building resource-efficient, equitable temporal reachability in learning-integrated networks.</description>

      <title>Deep learning framework for predicting stochastic take-off and die-out of early spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale outbreaks of epidemics, misinformation, or other harmful contagions pose significant threats to human society, yet the fundamental question of whether an emerging outbreak will escalate into a major epidemic or naturally die out remains largely unaddressed. This problem is challenging, partially due to inadequate data during the early stages of outbreaks and also because established models focus on average behaviors of large epidemics rather than the stochastic nature of small transmission chains. Here, we introduce the first systematic framework for forecasting whether initial transmission events will amplify into major outbreaks or fade into extinction during early stages, when intervention strategies can still be effectively implemented. Using extensive data from stochastic spreading models, we developed a deep learning framework that predicts early-stage spreading outcomes in real-time. Validation across Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and Barab\'asi-Albert networks with varying infectivity levels shows our method accurately forecasts stochastic spreading events well before potential outbreaks, demonstrating robust performance across different network structures and infectivity scenarios.To address the challenge of sparse data during early outbreak stages, we further propose a pretrain-finetune framework that leverages diverse simulation data for pretraining and adapts to specific scenarios through targeted fine-tuning. The pretrain-finetune framework consistently outperforms baseline models, achieving superior performance even when trained on limited scenario-specific data. To our knowledge, this work presents the first framework for predicting stochastic take-off versus die-out. This framework provides valuable insights for epidemic preparedness and public health decision-making, enabling more informed early intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Network Structure Inference: A Topological Approach to Network Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thresholding--the pruning of nodes or edges based on their properties or weights--is an essential preprocessing tool for extracting interpretable structure from complex network data, yet existing methods face several key limitations. Threshold selection often relies on heuristic methods or trial and error due to large parameter spaces and unclear optimization criteria, leading to sensitivity where small parameter variations produce significant changes in network structure. Moreover, most approaches focus on pairwise relationships between nodes, overlooking critical higher-order interactions involving three or more nodes. We introduce a systematic thresholding algorithm that leverages topological data analysis to identify optimal network parameters by accounting for higher-order structural relationships. Our method uses persistent homology to compute the stability of homological features across the parameter space, identifying parameter choices that are robust to small variations while preserving meaningful topological structure. Hyperparameters allow users to specify minimum requirements for topological features, effectively constraining the parameter search to avoid spurious solutions. We demonstrate the approach with an application in the Science of Science, where networks of scientific concepts are extracted from research paper abstracts, and concepts are connected when they co-appear in the same abstract. The flexibility of our approach allows researchers to incorporate domain-specific constraints and extends beyond network thresholding to general parameterization problems in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Why Does the Engineering Manager Still Exist in Agile Software Development?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Agile methodologies emphasize decentralized decision-making and team autonomy, engineering managers continue to be employed in Agile software organizations. This apparent paradox suggests that traditional managerial functions persist despite the theoretical displacement of managerial hierarchy in Agile. This paper explores the persistence of engineering managers through a multidimensional framework encompassing historical context, theoretical tensions, organizational realities, empirical evidence, evolving managerial roles, and practical implications. A systematic literature review underpins our multifaceted analysis, supplemented by illustrative case studies. We conclude by proposing a conceptual model that reconciles Agile principles with managerial necessity, offering guidance for practitioners, researchers, and tool designers. Implications for leadership development, tool integration, and future research are discussed.</description>

      <title>Internal World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is the computational objective of imagination? While classical interpretations suggest imagination is useful for maximizing rewards, recent findings challenge this view. In this study, we propose that imagination serves to access an internal world model (IWM) and use psychological network analysis to explore IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we assessed imagination vividness ratings using two questionnaires and constructed imagination networks from these reports. Imagination networks from human groups showed correlations between different centrality measures, including expected influence, strength, and closeness. However, imagination networks from LLMs showed a lack of clustering and lower correlations between centrality measures under different prompts and conversational memory conditions. Together, these results indicate a lack of similarity between IWMs in human and LLM agents. Overall, our study offers a novel method for comparing internally-generated representations in humans and AI, providing insights for developing human-like imagination in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Good Intentions Beyond ACL: Who Does NLP for Social Good, and Where?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The social impact of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is increasingly important, with a rising community focus on initiatives related to NLP for Social Good (NLP4SG). Indeed, in recent years, almost 20% of all papers in the ACL Anthology address topics related to social good as defined by the UN Sustainable Development Goals (Adauto et al., 2023). In this study, we take an author- and venue-level perspective to map the landscape of NLP4SG, quantifying the proportion of work addressing social good concerns both within and beyond the ACL community, by both core ACL contributors and non-ACL authors. With this approach we discover two surprising facts about the landscape of NLP4SG. First, ACL authors are dramatically more likely to do work addressing social good concerns when publishing in venues outside of ACL. Second, the vast majority of publications using NLP techniques to address concerns of social good are done by non-ACL authors in venues outside of ACL. We discuss the implications of these findings on agenda-setting considerations for the ACL community related to NLP4SG.</description>

      <title>Discrete scalar curvature as a weighted sum of Ollivier-Ricci curvatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between discrete analogues of Ricci and scalar curvature that are defined for point clouds and graphs. In the discrete setting, Ricci curvature is replaced by Ollivier-Ricci curvature. Scalar curvature can be computed as the trace of Ricci curvature for a Riemannian manifold; this motivates a new definition of a scalar version of Ollivier-Ricci curvature. We show that our definition converges to scalar curvature for nearest neighbor graphs obtained by sampling from a manifold. We also prove some new results about the convergence of Ollivier-Ricci curvature to Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>SGRDN-Data learned sparsification of graph reaction-diffusion networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11943v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph sparsification is an area of interest in computer science and applied mathematics. Sparsification of a graph, in general, aims to reduce the number of edges in the network while preserving specific properties of the graph, like cuts and subgraph counts. Computing the sparsest cuts of a graph is known to be NP-hard, and sparsification routines exist for generating linear-sized sparsifiers in almost quadratic running time $O(n^{2 + \epsilon})$. Consequently, obtaining a sparsifier can be a computationally demanding task, and the complexity varies based on the level of sparsity required. We propose SGRDN to extend sparsification to complex reaction-diffusion systems. This approach seeks to sparsify the graph such that the inherent reaction-diffusion dynamics are strictly preserved on the resulting structure. By selectively considering a subset of trajectories, we frame the network sparsification issue as a data assimilation problem within a Reduced Order Model (ROM) space, imposing constraints to conserve the eigenmodes of the Laplacian matrix ($L = D - A$), the difference between the degree matrix ($D$) and the adjacency matrix ($A$) despite perturbations. We derive computationally efficient eigenvalue and eigenvector approximations for perturbed Laplacian matrices and integrate these as spectral preservation constraints in the optimization problem. To further validate the method's broad applicability, we conducted an additional experiment on Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (neural ODEs), where SGRDN successfully achieved parameter sparsity.</description>

      <title>New Recipe for Semi-supervised Community Detection: Clique Annealing under Crystallization Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised community detection methods are widely used for identifying specific communities due to the label scarcity. Existing semi-supervised community detection methods typically involve two learning stages learning in both initial identification and subsequent adjustment, which often starts from an unreasonable community core candidate. Moreover, these methods encounter scalability issues because they depend on reinforcement learning and generative adversarial networks, leading to higher computational costs and restricting the selection of candidates. To address these limitations, we draw a parallel between crystallization kinetics and community detection to integrate the spontaneity of the annealing process into community detection. Specifically, we liken community detection to identifying a crystal subgrain (core) that expands into a complete grain (community) through a process similar to annealing. Based on this finding, we propose CLique ANNealing (CLANN), which applies kinetics concepts to community detection by integrating these principles into the optimization process to strengthen the consistency of the community core. Subsequently, a learning-free Transitive Annealer was employed to refine the first-stage candidates by merging neighboring cliques and repositioning the community core, enabling a spontaneous growth process that enhances scalability. Extensive experiments on \textbf{43} different network settings demonstrate that CLANN outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple real-world datasets, showcasing its exceptional efficacy and efficiency in community detection.</description>

      <title>Maximum Degree-Based Quasi-Clique Search via an Iterative Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cohesive subgraph mining is a fundamental problem in graph theory with numerous real-world applications, such as social network analysis and protein-protein interaction modeling. Among various cohesive subgraphs, the $\gamma$-quasi-clique is widely studied for its flexibility in requiring each vertex to connect to at least a $\gamma$ proportion of other vertices in the subgraph. However, solving the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem is NP-hard and further complicated by the lack of the hereditary property, which makes designing efficient pruning strategies challenging. Existing algorithms, such as DDA and FastQC, either struggle with scalability or exhibit significant performance declines for small values of $\gamma$. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm, IterQC, which reformulates the maximum $\gamma$-quasi-clique problem as a series of $k$-plex problems that possess the hereditary property. IterQC introduces a non-trivial iterative framework and incorporates two key optimization techniques: (1) the pseudo lower bound (pseudo LB) technique, which leverages information across iterations to improve the efficiency of branch-and-bound searches, and (2) the preprocessing technique that reduces problem size and unnecessary iterations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IterQC achieves up to four orders of magnitude speedup and solves significantly more graph instances compared to state-of-the-art algorithms DDA and FastQC.</description>

      <title>Fostering cultural change in research through innovative knowledge sharing, evaluation, and community engagement strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific research needs a new system that appropriately values science and scientists. Key innovations, within institutions and funding agencies, are driving better assessment of research, with open knowledge and FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) principles as central pillars. Furthermore, coalitions, agreements, and robust infrastructures have emerged to promote more accurate assessment metrics and efficient knowledge sharing. However, despite these efforts, the system still relies on outdated methods where standardized metrics such as h-index and journal impact factor dominate evaluations. These metrics have had the unintended consequence of pushing researchers to produce more outputs at the expense of integrity and reproducibility. In this community paper, we bring together a global community of researchers, funding institutions, industrial partners, and publishers from 14 different countries across the 5 continents. We aim at collectively envision an evolved knowledge sharing and research evaluation along with the potential positive impact on every stakeholder involved. We imagine these ideas to set the groundwork for a cultural change to redefine a more fair and equitable scientific landscape.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order graph neural networks (HOGNNs) and the related architectures from Topological Deep Learning are an important class of GNN models that harness polyadic relations between vertices beyond plain edges. They have been used to eliminate issues such as over-smoothing or over-squashing, to significantly enhance the accuracy of GNN predictions, to improve the expressiveness of GNN architectures, and for numerous other goals. A plethora of HOGNN models have been introduced, and they come with diverse neural architectures, and even with different notions of what the "higher-order" means. This richness makes it very challenging to appropriately analyze and compare HOGNN models, and to decide in what scenario to use specific ones. To alleviate this, we first design an in-depth taxonomy and a blueprint for HOGNNs. This facilitates designing models that maximize performance. Then, we use our taxonomy to analyze and compare the available HOGNN models. The outcomes of our analysis are synthesized in a set of insights that help to select the most beneficial GNN model in a given scenario, and a comprehensive list of challenges and opportunities for further research into more powerful HOGNNs.</description>

      <title>HP-BERT: A framework for longitudinal study of Hinduphobia on social media via language models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, community tensions intensified, contributing to discriminatory sentiments against various religious groups, including Hindu communities. Recent advances in language models have shown promise for social media analysis with potential for longitudinal studies of social media platforms, such as X (Twitter). We present a computational framework for analyzing anti-Hindu sentiment (Hinduphobia) during the COVID-19 period, introducing an abuse detection and sentiment analysis approach for longitudinal analysis on X. We curate and release a "Hinduphobic COVID-19 XDataset" containing 8,000 annotated and manually verified tweets. We then develop the Hinduphobic BERT (HP-BERT) model using this dataset and achieve 94.72\% accuracy, outperforming baseline Transformer-based language models. The model incorporates multi-label sentiment analysis capabilities through additional fine-tuning. Our analysis encompasses approximately 27.4 million tweets from six countries, including Australia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, Japan, and the United Kingdom. Statistical analysis reveals moderate correlations (r = 0.312-0.428) between COVID-19 case increases and Hinduphobic content volume, highlighting how pandemic-related stress may contribute to discriminatory discourse. This study provides evidence of social media-based religious discrimination during a COVID-19 crisis.</description>

      <title>Efficient Sparsification of Simplicial Complexes via Local Densities of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simplicial complexes (SCs) have become a popular abstraction for analyzing complex data using tools from topological data analysis or topological signal processing. However, the analysis of many real-world datasets often leads to dense SCs, with many higher-order simplicies, which results in prohibitive computational requirements in terms of time and memory consumption. The sparsification of such complexes is thus of broad interest, i.e., the approximation of an original SC with a sparser surrogate SC (with typically only a log-linear number of simplices) that maintains the spectrum of the original SC as closely as possible. In this work, we develop a novel method for a probabilistic sparsification of SCs that uses so-called local densities of states. Using this local densities of states, we can efficiently approximate so-called generalized effective resistance of each simplex, which is proportional to the required sampling probability for the sparsification of the SC. To avoid degenerate structures in the spectrum of the corresponding Hodge Laplacian operators, we suggest a ``kernel-ignoring'' decomposition to approximate the sampling probability. Additionally, we utilize certain error estimates to characterize the asymptotic algorithmic complexity of the developed method. We demonstrate the performance of our framework on a family of Vietoris--Rips filtered simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>AI Feedback Enhances Community-Based Content Moderation through Engagement with Counterarguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08110v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today, social media platforms are significant sources of news and political communication, but their role in spreading misinformation has raised significant concerns. In response, these platforms have implemented various content moderation strategies. One such method, Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) on X (formerly Twitter), relies on crowdsourced fact-checking and has gained traction. However, it faces challenges such as partisan bias and delays in verification. This study explores an AI-assisted hybrid moderation framework in which participants receive AI-generated feedback, supportive, neutral, or argumentative, on their notes and are asked to revise them accordingly. The results show that incorporating feedback improves the quality of notes, with the most substantial gains resulting from argumentative feedback. This underscores the value of diverse perspectives and direct engagement in human-AI collective intelligence. The research contributes to ongoing discussions about AI's role in political content moderation, highlighting the potential of generative AI and the importance of informed design.</description>
