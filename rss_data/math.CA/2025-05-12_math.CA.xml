      <title>The spectral constant for the quantum cross and asymptotically sharp bounds for annuli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum annulus of type $r$ is the class of invertible operators with singular values in $(1/r,r).$ Given an analytic function on the classical annulus of type $r,$ we may evaluate it on operators in the quantum annulus by The spectral constant gives the maximum ratio betweeen the supremum over the norm of evalutions at operators in the quantum annulus to the supremum over classical evaluations. We show that the limit of the spectral constant as $r$ goes to infinity is $2.$ Via the correspondence between annuli and hyperbolae, our study degenerates the problem to one on the quantum cross, pairs of contractions with product zero, where the spectral constant is exactly $2.$
  The essential technique is to rationally dilate $Z$ to $\hat{Z}$ which has $U =(\hat{Z}+(\hat{Z}^{-1})^*)/(r+1/r)$ unitary and estimate $Uf(\hat{Z})U^*$ directly.</description>

      <title>Some variants of the periodic tiling conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The periodic tiling conjecture (PTC) asserts, for a finitely generated Abelian group $G$ and a finite subset $F$ of $G$, that if there is a set $A$ that solves the tiling equation $\mathbb{1}_F * \mathbb{1}_A = 1$, there is also a periodic solution $\mathbb{1}_{A_{\mathrm{p}}}$. This conjecture is known to hold for some groups $G$ and fail for others. In this paper we establish three variants of the PTC. The first (due to Tim Austin) replaces the constant function $1$ on the right-hand side of the tiling equation by $0$, and the indicator functions $\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\mathbb{1}_A$ by bounded integer-valued functions. The second, which applies in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$, replaces the right-hand side of the tiling equation by an integer-valued periodic function, and the functions $\mathbb{1}_F$ and $\mathbb{1}_A$ on the left-hand side by bounded integer-valued functions. The third (which is the most difficult to establish) is similar to the second, but retains the property of both $\mathbb{1}_A$ and $\mathbb{1}_{A_{\mathrm{p}}}$ being indicator functions; in particular, we establish the PTC for multi-tilings in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$. As a result, we obtain the decidability of constant-level integer tilings in any finitely generated Abelian group $G$ and multi-tilings in $G=\mathbb{Z}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain several degenerations of the $q$-Heun equation by considering the linear $q$-difference equations associated to several $q$-Painlev\'e equations. We establish definitions of the confluent $q$-Heun equation, the biconfluent $q$-Heun equation and the doubly confluent $q$-Heun equation, and investigate limit procedures to the corresponding differential equations.</description>

      <title>The Restricted Three-Body Problem as a Perturbed Duffing Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the restricted circular planar three-body problem. We prove that for every negative Jacobi constant of sufficiently large magnitude, the surface of unperturbed parabolic solutions breaks to induce homoclinic tangle for all but at most finitely many mass ratios of primaries. This result is not covered by \cite{G} as the required large magnitude of the Jacobi constant is uniform across the mass ratios.
  Our approach consists of three main ingredients. First, by introducing new coordinate transformations, we reformulate the restricted three-body problem as a perturbed Duffing equation. Second, we adopt the method recently introduced in \cite{CW} to derive integral equations for the primary stable and unstable solutions. This enables us to effectively capture the order of the singularities involved and to further establish the existence and analytic dependence of the invariant manifolds on the mass ratio of the primaries and the Jacobi constant. Third, in evaluating the Poincar\'e-Melnikov integral, we take advantage of the explicit homoclinic solution of the unperturbed Duffing equation.
  Compared to existing works, our proof is significantly simpler and more direct. Moreover, the paper is self-contained: we do not rely on McGehee's analysis in \cite{Mc} to justify the applicability of the Poincar\'e-Melnikov method.</description>

      <title>Generalized upper and lower Legendre conjugates for weight functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study new transformations between two functions satisfying some basic growth properties and generalize the known lower and upper Legendre conjugate (or envelope). We also investigate how these transformations modify recently defined growth indices for weight functions. A special but important and useful situation, to which the knowledge is then applied, is when considering associated weight functions which are expressed in terms of an underlying weight sequence. In this case these transformations precisely correspond to the point-wise product resp. point-wise division of the given sequences. Therefore, the new approach studied in this work illustrates the genuineness and importance and suggests applications for weighted spaces in different directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new necessary condition for local smoothing estimates for the averaging operator defined by convolution with a measure supported on a smooth non-degenerate curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for $n \geq 3$. This demonstrates a limitation in the strength of local smoothing estimates towards establishing bounds for the corresponding maximal functions when $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Conformal geodesics are not variational in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variationality of the equation of conformal geodesics is an important problem in geometry with applications to general relativity. Recently it was proven that, in three dimensions, this system of equations for un-parametrized curves is the Euler-Lagrange equations of a certain conformally invariant functional, while the parametrized system in three dimensions is not variational. We demonstrate that variationality fails in higher dimensions for both parametrized and un-parametrized conformal geodesics, indicating that variational principle may be the selection principle for the physical dimension.</description>

      <title>The $L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for higher order Schr\"odinger operator with zero singularities in low odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $L^p$-bounds of wave operators for higher-order Schr\"odinger operators $H = (-\Delta)^m + V$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $m \ge 2$ and real-valued decaying potentials $V$. Our main objective is to establish the sharp $L^p$-boundedness of the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ in the presence of all types of zero-resonance singularities, for all odd dimensions $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$.
  Specifically, for odd $n$ with $1 \le n \le 4m - 1$, there exist $m_n$ types of zero resonances for $H$, along with a critical type $k_c$ (both depending on $n$ and $m$). If zero is a regular point of $H$ or a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $1 \le \mathbf{k} \le k_c$, the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. If zero is a $\mathbf{k}$-th kind resonance with $k_c &lt; \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, we show that the range of $p$-boundedness for $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ narrows to $1 &lt; p &lt; p_{\mathbf{k}}$, where $$p_{\mathbf{k}} = \frac{n}{n - 2m + \mathbf{k} + k_c - 1}.$$ Additionally, if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ (i.e., $\mathbf{k} = m_n + 1$), then $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \frac{2n}{n - 1}$.
  Furthermore, it is shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H; (-\Delta)^m)$ are unbounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for all $p_{\mathbf{k}} &lt; p \le \infty$ if $k_c &lt; \mathbf{k} \le m_n$, and for all $\frac{2n}{n - 1} &lt; p \le \infty$ if zero is an eigenvalue of $H$ with a non-zero solution $\phi$ to $H\phi = 0$ in $\bigcap_{s &lt; -\frac{1}{2}} L^{2}_{s}(\mathbb{R}^n) \setminus L^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$(referred to as a $p$-wave resonance). The key idea of the proof is to reduce the $L^p$-unboundedness to establishing the optimality of time-decay estimates for $e^{itH}P_{ac}(H)$ in weighted $L^2$ spaces.</description>

      <title>On inverse dynamical and spectral problems for the wave and Schr\"odinger equations on finite trees. The leaf peeling method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in inverse dynamical, spectral and scattering problems for differential equations on graphs is motivated by possible applications to nano-electronics and quantum waveguides and by a variety of other classical and quantum applications. Recently a new effective leaf peeling method has been proposed by S. Avdonin and P. Kurasov \cite{AK} for solving inverse problems on trees (graphs without cycles). It allows recalculating efficiently the inverse data from the original tree to the smaller trees, `removing' leaves step by step up to the rooted edge. In this paper we describe the main step of the spectral and dynamical versions of the peeling algorithm -- recalculating the inverse data for the `peeled tree'.</description>

Abstract: We establish relationships between the classical moments problems which are problems of a construction of a measure supported on a real line, on a half-line or on an interval from prescribed set of moments with the Boundary control approach to a dynamic inverse problem for a dynamical system with discrete time associated with Jacobi matrices. We show that the solution of corresponding truncated moment problems is equivalent to solving some generalized spectral problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07078v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theorems crucial in elementary real function theory have proofs in which compactness arguments are used. Despite the introduction in relatively recent literature of each new highly elegant compactness argument, or of an equivalent, this work is based on the idea that, with the aid of simple notions such as local properties of continuous or of differentiable functions, suprema, nested intervals, convergent subsequences or the simplest form of the Heine-Borel Theorem, the use of one of four simple types of compactness arguments, suffices, and the resulting development of real function theory need not involve notions more sophisticated than what immediately follows from the usual ordering of the real numbers. Thus, four independent approaches are presented, one for each type of compactness argument: supremum arguments, nested interval arguments, Heine-Borel arguments and sequential compactness arguments.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for Legendre functions via differential equations having coalescing turning points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19405v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear second-order ordinary differential equations of the form $d^{2}w/dz^{2}=\{u^{2}f(a,z) \allowbreak +g(z)\}w$ are considered for large values of the real parameter $u$, $z$ being a complex variable ranging over a bounded or unbounded complex domain $Z$, and $a_{0} \leq a \leq a_{1} &lt; \infty$. It is assumed that $f(a,z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic in the interior of $Z$. Furthermore, $f(a,z)$ has exactly two real simple zeros in $Z$ for $a&gt;a_{0}$ that depend continuously on $a$, and coalesce into a double zero as $a \to a_{0}$. Uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for solutions of the equation which involve parabolic cylinder functions and their derivatives, along with certain slowly-varying coefficient functions. The new results involve readily computable coefficients and explicit error bounds, and are then applied to provide new asymptotic expansions for the associated Legendre functions when both the degree $\nu$ and order $\mu$ are large.</description>

      <title>Unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials and of uniformly bounded functions in $L^p$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there is no unconditional basis of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$, for any set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of finite measure. This is a consequence of a more general result due to Gaposhkin, who proved that the space $L^p(\Omega)$ does not admit a seminormalized unconditional basis consisting of uniformly bounded functions. We show that the latter result fails if the word "basis" is replaced with "Schauder frame". On the other hand we prove that if $\Omega$ has nonempty interior then there are no unconditional Schauder frames of exponentials in the space $L^p(\Omega)$, $p \ne 2$.</description>

      <title>Functional differential equations driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of unique solutions is established for rough differential equations (RDEs) with path-dependent coefficients and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Moreover, it is shown that the associated solution map, also known as It\^o-Lyons map, is locally Lipschitz continuous. These results are then applied to various classes of rough differential equations, such as controlled RDEs and RDEs with delay, as well as stochastic differential equations with delay. To that end, a joint rough path is constructed for a c\`adl\`ag martingale and its delayed version, that corresponds to stochastic It\^o integration.</description>

      <title>On some inequalities for the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function in the complex plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11852v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the two-parameter Mittag-Leffler function $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ with $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $\beta \ge 0,$ we consider the question whether $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|$ and $E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z)$ are comparable on the whole complex plane. We show that the inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\le E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z)$ holds globally if and only if $E_{\alpha,\beta}(-x)$ is completely monotone on $(0,\infty)$. For $\alpha\in [1,2)$ we prove that the complete monotonicity of $1/E_{\alpha,\beta}(x)$ on $(0,\infty)$ is necessary for the global inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\ge E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z),$ and also sufficient for $\alpha =1.$ For $\alpha \ge 2$ we show that the absence of non-real zeros for $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ is sufficient for the global inequality $|E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)|\ge E_{\alpha,\beta}(\Re z),$ and also necessary for $\alpha =2.$ All these results have an explicit description in terms of the values of the parameters $\alpha,\beta.$ Along the way, several inequalities for $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ on the half-plane $\{\Re z \ge 0\}$ are established, and a characterization of its log-convexity and log-concavity on the positive half-line is obtained.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic evaluations of generalized Bessel function of order zero related to the p-circle lattice point problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ and $r$ be positive real numbers. Then, we consider the lattice point problem of the closed curve $p$-circle $\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{2}|\ |x_{1}|^{p}+|x_{2}|^{p}=r^{p}\}$ which is a generalization of the circle ($p=2$). Following the harmonic analytic approach of S. Kuratsubo and E. Nakai for the case of a circle, we need to investigate properties of appropriately generalized Bessel functions for $p$ in order to tackle the problem. Thus, in this paper, we derive asymptotic evaluations of the generalized Bessel function of order zero, such as uniformly asymptotic estimates on compact sets on quadrants of $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for the cases $0&lt;p\leq1$ or $p=2$, and, as stronger results, uniformly asymptotic estimates on $\mathbb{R}^{2}$ for the cases $p$ such that $\frac{2}{p}$ are the natural numbers.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of the Dirichlet and Fucik spectra of the one-dimensional anisotropic p-Laplace operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10599v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the Dirichlet spectrum $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of the anisotropic $p$-Laplace operator $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on an interval $(0,L)$ where
  \[ \Delta^{a,b}_p u:= \left(a^{p}[(u')^{+}]^{p-1}-b^{p}[(u')^{-}]^{p-1}\right)', \ \ a, b &gt; 0. \] The set $\Lambda^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ and the respective eigenfunctions are completely characterized for $a \neq b$ in terms of the corresponding ones within the isotropic context. As a relevant application, we derive a new optimal Poincar\'e inequality that is stronger than the classical version. The leading ideas are based on glue arguments of conveniently modified eigenfunctions and maximum type principles. More generally, our approach allows to characterize the Fuc\'ik spectrum $\Sigma^{a,b}_p(0,L)$ of $- \Delta^{a,b}_{p}$ on $(0,L)$ and mainly the corresponding solutions. All results are novelty even for $p = 2$ which correspond to nonlinear anisotropic operators.</description>

      <title>Special solutions of a discrete Painlev\'e equation for quantum minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider solutions of a discrete Painlev\'e equation arising from a construction of quantum minimal surfaces by Arnlind, Hoppe and Kontsevich, and in earlier work of Cornalba and Taylor on static membranes. While the discrete equation admits a continuum limit to the continuous Painlev\'e I equation, we find that it has the same space of initial values as the Painlev\'e V equation with certain specific parameter values. We further explicitly show how each iteration of this discrete Painlev\'e I equation corresponds to a certain composition of B\"acklund transformations for Painlev\'e V, as was first remarked in work by Tokihiro, Grammaticos and Ramani. In addition, we show that some explicit special function solutions of Painlev\'e V, written in terms of modified Bessel functions, yield the unique positive solution of the initial value problem required for quantum minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Matrix-Weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin Spaces of Optimal Scale: Boundedness of Pseudo-Differential, Trace, and Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is a continuation of our work on generalized matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces with matrix $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ weights. In this article, we establish the boundedness of pseudo-differential, trace, and Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators on these spaces. The main tools involved in this article are the molecular and the wavelet characterizations of these spaces. Since generalized matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces include many classical function spaces such as matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin spaces, all the results in this article are of wide generality.</description>
