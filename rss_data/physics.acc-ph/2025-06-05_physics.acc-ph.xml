      <title>Characterization of NbTi wires for the electron-ion collider project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a proposed machine to explore the behaviour of the fundamental particles and forces that bind atomic nuclei together. The design and construction of the EIC are underway at Brookhaven National Laboratory in collaboration with Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility. EIC will use several different types of superconducting strands for magnets near the interaction region (IR). At beam injection, the magnetic field is usually very low compared with its maximum operating field. This usually creates considerable field errors mainly generated from magnetization current in superconducting strands even using very fine filament. The accurate magnetization measurement results from those superconducting strands will be critical for the calculation and future correction of magnetic field for EIC. In this work, we characterized three billets of superconductor NbTi strands. The magnetization was measured at 4.2 K and 1.9 K in magnetic fields below 1.5 T. The critical current at 4.2 K and in magnetic field down to 5 T were also measured. Other properties that are important for the safety margin of superconducting magnet fabrication, operation, and quench protection such as residual-resistance-ratio (RRR), filament diameter, Cu to non-Cu ratio, twist pitch, and mechanical properties at 77 K will also be presented.</description>

      <title>Information-Optimal Sensing and Control in High-Intensity Laser Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-intensity laser systems present unique measurement and optimization challenges due to their high complexity, low repetition rates, and shot-to-shot variations. We discuss recent developments towards a unified framework based on information theory and Bayesian inference that addresses these challenges. Starting from fundamental constraints on the physical field structure, we recently demonstrated how to capture complete spatio-temporal information about individual petawatt laser pulses. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate how Bayesian frameworks can leverage temporal correlations between consecutive pulses to improve measurement precision. We then extend these concepts to active sensing strategies that adaptively select measurements to maximize information gain, exemplified through Bayesian autocorrelation spectroscopy. Finally, we show how these information-optimal measurement principles naturally extend to Bayesian optimization. This progression represents a paradigm shift where measurement devices transition from passive data collectors to active participants in complex experiments.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the production and detection of Breit-Wheeler tunneling positrons in Experiment 320 at the FACET-II accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The SLAC Experiment 320 collides 10 TW-class laser pulses with the high-quality, 10 GeV electron beam from the FACET-II RF LINAC. This setup is expected to produce a sizable number of $e^+e^-$ pairs via nonlinear Breit-Wheeler mechanism in the strong-field tunneling regime, with an estimated yield of ~0.01-0.1 pairs per collision. This small signal rate typically comes along with large backgrounds originating, e.g., from dumping the high-charge primary beam, secondaries induced by the beam halo, as well as photons and low-energy electrons produced in the electron-laser collision itself. These backgrounds may reach densities of O(100) charged particles per cm^2 (and even more neutral particles) at the surface of the sensing elements, making it a tremendous challenge for an unambiguous detection of single particles. In this work, we demonstrate how detectors and methods adapted from high-energy physics experiments, can enable this measurement. The solution presented is based on a highly granular, multi-layer, radiation-hard pixel detector paired with powerful particle-tracking algorithms. Using a detailed simulation of the existing experimental setup, we show how the false-positive rate due to background processes can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude relative to the expected signal after full reconstruction. Furthermore, we show that the high spatial tracking resolution achievable (&lt;10 microns) allows for positron momentum measurements with a resolution of &lt;2%, enabling spectral characterization of the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process. Based on our extensive simulation, with a conservatively large background assumption, we show that it is possible to measure single Breit-Wheeler positrons in the coming data taking campaign of E320. That would be the first statistically significant observation and characterization of this elusive process in the (deep) tunneling regime.</description>

      <title>Design of an Active Thomson Parabola for the detection of ions accelerated by laser: Numerical simulations and characterization of different solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes the development of an active Thomson Parabola ion spectrometer designed to measure the energy spectra of different multi-MeV ion species generated in laser-plasmas interactions. To do so, GEANT4 optical simulations were carried out in order to design and build a spectrometer based on scintillator detectors capable of operating at rates comparable with the highest achievable at any existing or upcoming high intensity laser facilities. Details on the different configurations simulated and their characterization are discussed.</description>
