      <title>Lyapunov Characterization for ISS of Impulsive Switched Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the ISS of impulsive switched systems that have modes with both stable and unstable flows. We assume that the switching signal satisfies mode-dependent average dwell and leave time conditions. To establish ISS conditions, we propose two types of time-varying ISS-Lyapunov functions: one that is non-decreasing and another one that is decreasing. Our research proves that the existence of either of these ISS-Lyapunov functions is a necessary and sufficient condition for ISS. We also present a technique for constructing a decreasing ISS-Lyapunov function from a non-decreasing one, which is useful for its own sake. Our findings also have added value to previous research that only studied sufficient conditions for ISS, as our results apply to a broader class of systems. This is because we impose less restrictive dwell and leave time constraints on the switching signal and our ISS-Lyapunov functions are time-varying with general nonlinear conditions imposed on them. Moreover, we provide a method to guarantee the ISS of a particular class of impulsive switched systems when the switching signal is unknown.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Wireless Power Transfer Mechanism of the Both-Sides Retrodirective System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve efficient long-range wireless power transfer (WPT), large antenna systems are necessary spanning lengths of tens to thousands of meters in one dimension. This creates an array in the order of at least hundreds of thousands to billions of elements. This makes the implementation of beamforming control a challenge. Various works focus on iterative optimization or channel estimation to maintain high efficiency in a time-varying environment requiring complex processing capabilities. A simpler alternative is the both-sides retrodirective antenna array (BS-RDAA) system where iterative optimization or channel estimation is not required. In a previous study, it was observed that this system achieves maximum WPT efficiency if the system is marginally stable. Thus, there is a need to regulate the system to maintain marginal stability regardless of the transmission channel conditions. In this paper, we present a plant model for the system and design a control system to drive it to marginal stability. The result is a WPT implementation that is not dependent on complex processing capabilities present in other established high efficiency methods. We also confirmed the ability of the proposed design to maintain maximum efficiency in a dynamic environment through the results of an electromagnetic simulator and a time domain simulator.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using projection between Euclidian spaces of different dimensions, the signal compression and decompression become straightforward. This encoding/decoding technique requires no preassigned measuring matrix as in compressed sensing. Moreover, in application there is no dimension or size restrictions. General formulas for encoding/decoding of any finite dimensional signals are provided. Their main properties are revealed. Particularly, it is shown that under the equivalence assumption the technique provides the best approximation with least square error.</description>

      <title>An invariance principle based concentration result for large-scale stochastic pairwise interaction network systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic pairwise interaction network systems whereby a finite population of agents, identified with the nodes of a graph, update their states in response to both individual mutations and pairwise interactions with their neighbors. The considered class of systems include the main epidemic models -such as the SIS, SIR, and SIRS models-, certain social dynamics models -such as the voter and anti-voter models-, as well as evolutionary dynamics on graphs. Since these stochastic systems fall into the class of finite-state Markov chains, they always admit stationary distributions. We analyze the asymptotic behavior of these stationary distributions in the limit as the population size grows large while the interaction network maintains certain mixing properties. Our approach relies on the use of Lyapunov-type functions to obtain concentration results on these stationary distributions. Notably, our results are not limited to fully mixed population models, as they do apply to a much broader spectrum of interaction network structures, including, e.g., Erd\"oos-R\'enyi random graphs.</description>

      <title>Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Hybrid Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems pose significant challenges for effective planning and control, especially when additional constraints such as obstacle avoidance, state boundaries, and actuation limits are present. In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</description>

      <title>Cyber-physical WebAssembly: Secure Hardware Interfaces and Pluggable Drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Internet of Things (IoT), edge, and embedded devices in the past decade has introduced numerous challenges in terms of security and configuration management. Simultaneously, advances in cloud-native development practices have greatly enhanced the development experience and facilitated quicker updates, thereby enhancing application security. However, applying these advances to IoT, edge, and embedded devices remains a complex task, primarily due to the heterogeneous environments and the need to support devices with extended lifespans. WebAssembly and the WebAssembly System Interface (WASI) has emerged as a promising technology to bridge this gap. As WebAssembly becomes more popular on IoT, edge, and embedded devices, there is a growing demand for hardware interface support in WebAssembly programs. This work presents WASI proposals and proof-of-concept implementations to enable hardware interaction with I2C and USB, which are two commonly used protocols in IoT, directly from WebAssembly applications. This is achieved by running the device drivers within WebAssembly as well. A thorough evaluation of the proof of concepts shows that WASI-USB introduces a minimal overhead of at most 8% compared to native operating system USB APIs. However, the results show that runtime initialization overhead can be significant in low-latency applications.</description>

      <title>DiffLight: A Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion Model for Traffic Signal Control with Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning in traffic signal control (TSC) has been extensively researched and yielded notable achievements. However, most existing works for TSC assume that traffic data from all surrounding intersections is fully and continuously available through sensors. In real-world applications, this assumption often fails due to sensor malfunctions or data loss, making TSC with missing data a critical challenge. To meet the needs of practical applications, we introduce DiffLight, a novel conditional diffusion model for TSC under data-missing scenarios in the offline setting. Specifically, we integrate two essential sub-tasks, i.e., traffic data imputation and decision-making, by leveraging a Partial Rewards Conditioned Diffusion (PRCD) model to prevent missing rewards from interfering with the learning process. Meanwhile, to effectively capture the spatial-temporal dependencies among intersections, we design a Spatial-Temporal transFormer (STFormer) architecture. In addition, we propose a Diffusion Communication Mechanism (DCM) to promote better communication and control performance under data-missing scenarios. Extensive experiments on five datasets with various data-missing scenarios demonstrate that DiffLight is an effective controller to address TSC with missing data. The code of DiffLight is released at https://github.com/lokol5579/DiffLight-release.</description>

      <title>KALAM: toolKit for Automating high-Level synthesis of Analog computing systeMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse computing paradigms have emerged to meet the growing needs for intelligent energy-efficient systems. The Margin Propagation (MP) framework, being one such initiative in the analog computing domain, stands out due to its scalability across biasing conditions, temperatures, and diminishing process technology nodes. However, the lack of digital-like automation tools for designing analog systems (including that of MP analog) hinders their adoption for designing large systems. The inherent scalability and modularity of MP systems present a unique opportunity in this regard. This paper introduces KALAM (toolKit for Automating high-Level synthesis of Analog computing systeMs), which leverages factor graphs as the foundational paradigm for synthesizing MP-based analog computing systems. Factor graphs are the basis of various signal processing tasks and, when coupled with MP, can be used to design scalable and energy-efficient analog signal processors. Using Python scripting language, the KALAM automation flow translates an input factor graph to its equivalent SPICE-compatible circuit netlist that can be used to validate the intended functionality. KALAM also allows the integration of design optimization strategies such as precision tuning, variable elimination, and mathematical simplification. We demonstrate KALAM's versatility for tasks such as Bayesian inference, Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) decoding, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). Simulation results of the netlists align closely with software implementations, affirming the efficacy of our proposed automation tool.</description>

      <title>V2X-Assisted Distributed Computing and Control Framework for Connected and Automated Vehicles under Ramp Merging Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates distributed computing and cooperative control of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) in ramp merging scenario under transportation cyber-physical system. Firstly, a centralized cooperative trajectory planning problem is formulated subject to the safely constraints and traffic performance in ramp merging scenario, where the trajectories of all vehicles are jointly optimized. To get rid of the reliance on a central controller and reduce computation time, a distributed solution to this problem implemented among CAVs through Vehicles-to-Everything (V2X) communication is proposed. Unlike existing method, our method can distribute the computational task among CAVs and carry out parallel solving through V2X communication. Then, a multi-vehicles model predictive control (MPC) problem aimed at maximizing system stability and minimizing control input is formulated based on the solution of the first problem subject to strict safety constants and input limits. Due to these complex constraints, this problem becomes high-dimensional, centralized, and non-convex. To solve it in a short time, a decomposition and convex reformulation method, namely distributed cooperative iterative model predictive control (DCIMPC), is proposed. This method leverages the communication capability of CAVs to decompose the problem, making full use of the computational resources on vehicles to achieve fast solutions and distributed control. The two above problems with their corresponding solving methods form the systemic framework of the V2X assisted distributed computing and control. Simulations have been conducted to evaluate the framework's convergence, safety, and solving speed. Additionally, extra experiments are conducted to validate the performance of DCIMPC. The results show that our method can greatly improve computation speed without sacrificing system performance.</description>

      <title>Accurate Solutions to Optimal Control Problems via a Flexible Mesh and Integrated Residual Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose joining a flexible mesh design with an integrated residual transcription in order to improve the accuracy of numerical solutions to optimal control problems. This approach is particularly useful when state or input trajectories are non-smooth, but it may also be beneficial when dynamics constraints are stiff. Additionally, we implement an initial phase that will ensure a feasible solution is found and can be implemented immediately in real-time controllers. Subsequent iterations with warm-starting will improve the solution until optimality is achieved. Optimizing over the mesh node locations allows for discontinuities to be captured exactly, while integrated residuals account for the approximation error in-between the nodal points. First, we numerically show the improved convergence order for the flexible mesh. We then present the feasibility-driven approach to solve control problems and show how flexible meshing and integrated residual methods can be used in practice. The presented numerical examples demonstrate for the first time the numerical implementation of a flexible mesh for an integrated residual transcription. The results show that our proposed method can be more than two times more accurate than conventional fixed mesh collocation for the same computational time and more than three times more accurate for the same problem size.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Autonomous Driving Safety Analysis with Generative AI: A Comparative Study on Automated Hazard and Risk Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of autonomous driving technology has accentuated the need for comprehensive hazard analysis and risk assessment (HARA) to ensure the safety and reliability of vehicular systems. Traditional HARA processes, while meticulous, are inherently time-consuming and subject to human error, necessitating a transformative approach to fortify safety engineering. This paper presents an integrative application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a means to enhance HARA in autonomous driving safety analysis. Generative AI, renowned for its predictive modeling and data generation capabilities, is leveraged to automate the labor-intensive elements of HARA, thus expediting the process and augmenting the thoroughness of the safety analyses. Through empirical research, the study contrasts conventional HARA practices conducted by safety experts with those supplemented by generative AI tools. The benchmark comparisons focus on critical metrics such as analysis time, error rates, and scope of risk identification. By employing generative AI, the research demonstrates a significant upturn in efficiency, evidenced by reduced timeframes and expanded analytical coverage. The AI-augmented processes also deliver enhanced brainstorming support, stimulating creative problem-solving and identifying previously unrecognized risk factors.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-bound algorithm for efficient reliability analysis of general coherent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branch and bound algorithms have been developed for reliability analysis of coherent systems. They exhibit a set of advantages; in particular, they can find a computationally efficient representation of a system failure or survival event, which can be re-used when the input probability distributions change over time or when new data is available. However, existing branch-and-bound algorithms can handle only a limited set of system performance functions, mostly network connectivity and maximum flow. Furthermore, they run redundant analyses on component vector states whose system state can be inferred from previous analysis results. This study addresses these limitations by proposing branch and bound for reliability analysis of general coherent systems} (BRC) algorithm: an algorithm that automatically finds minimal representations of failure/survival events of general coherent systems. Computational efficiency is attained by dynamically inferring importance of component events from hitherto obtained results. We demonstrate advantages of the BRC method as a real-time risk management tool by application to the Eastern Massachusetts highway benchmark network.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Mobility System with Integrated Motion Planning and Control Utilizing Infrastructure Sensor Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for an indoor autonomous mobility system that can perform patient transfers and materials handling. Unlike traditional systems that rely on onboard perception sensors, the proposed approach leverages a global perception and localization (PL) through Infrastructure Sensor Nodes (ISNs) and cloud computing technology. Using the global PL, an integrated Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based local planning and tracking controller augmented with Artificial Potential Field (APF) is developed, enabling reliable and efficient motion planning and obstacle avoidance ability while tracking predefined reference motions. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC controller in smoothly navigating around both static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed system has the potential to extend to intelligent connected autonomous vehicles, such as electric or cargo transport vehicles with four-wheel independent drive/steering (4WID-4WIS) configurations.</description>

Abstract: End-to-end vision-based autonomous driving has achieved impressive success, but safety remains a major concern. The safe control problem has been addressed in low-dimensional settings using safety filters, e.g., those based on control barrier functions. Designing safety filters for vision-based controllers in the high-dimensional settings of autonomous driving can similarly alleviate the safety problem, but is significantly more challenging. In this paper, we address this challenge by using frozen pre-trained vision representation models as perception backbones to design vision-based safety filters, inspired by these models' success as backbones of robotic control policies. We empirically evaluate the offline performance of four common pre-trained vision models in this context. We try three existing methods for training safety filters for black-box dynamics, as the dynamics over representation spaces are not known. We use the DeepAccident dataset that consists of action-annotated videos from multiple cameras on vehicles in CARLA simulating real accident scenarios. Our results show that the filters resulting from our approach are competitive with the ones that are given the ground truth state of the ego vehicle and its environment.</description>

      <title>IM-GIV: an effective integrity monitoring scheme for tightly-coupled GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on factor graph optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System/Inertial Navigation System (GNSS/INS)/Vision integration based on factor graph optimization (FGO) has recently attracted extensive attention in navigation and robotics community. Integrity monitoring (IM) capability is required when FGO-based integrated navigation system is used for safety-critical applications. However, traditional researches on IM of integrated navigation system are mostly based on Kalman filter. It is urgent to develop effective IM scheme for FGO-based GNSS/INS/Vision integration. In this contribution, the position error bounding formula to ensure the integrity of the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO is designed and validated for the first time. It can be calculated by the linearized equations from the residuals of GNSS pseudo-range, IMU pre-integration and visual measurements. The specific position error bounding is given in the case of GNSS, INS and visual measurement faults. Field experiments were conducted to evaluate and validate the performance of the proposed position error bounding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed position error bounding for the GNSS/INS/Vision integration based on FGO can correctly fit the position error against different fault modes, and the availability of integrity in six fault modes is 100% after correct and timely fault exclusion.</description>

      <title>Inexact Augmented Lagrangian Methods for Conic Programs: Quadratic Growth and Linear Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Augmented Lagrangian Methods (ALMs) are widely employed in solving constrained optimizations, and some efficient solvers are developed based on this framework. Under the quadratic growth assumption, it is known that the dual iterates and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) residuals of ALMs applied to semidefinite programs (SDPs) converge linearly. In contrast, the convergence rate of the primal iterates has remained elusive. In this paper, we resolve this challenge by establishing new $\textit{quadratic growth}$ and $\textit{error bound}$ properties for primal and dual SDPs under the strict complementarity condition. Our main results reveal that both primal and dual iterates of the ALMs converge linearly contingent solely upon the assumption of strict complementarity and a bounded solution set. This finding provides a positive answer to an open question regarding the asymptotically linear convergence of the primal iterates of ALMs applied to semidefinite optimization.</description>

      <title>PDSR: Efficient UAV Deployment for Swift and Accurate Post-Disaster Search and Rescue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive framework for Post-Disaster Search and Rescue (PDSR), aiming to optimize search and rescue operations leveraging Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The primary goal is to improve the precision and availability of sensing capabilities, particularly in various catastrophic scenarios. Central to this concept is the rapid deployment of UAV swarms equipped with diverse sensing, communication, and intelligence capabilities, functioning as an integrated system that incorporates multiple technologies and approaches for efficient detection of individuals buried beneath rubble or debris following a disaster. Within this framework, we propose architectural solution and address associated challenges to ensure optimal performance in real-world disaster scenarios. The proposed framework aims to achieve complete coverage of damaged areas significantly faster than traditional methods using a multi-tier swarm architecture. Furthermore, integrating multi-modal sensing data with machine learning for data fusion could enhance detection accuracy, ensuring precise identification of survivors.</description>

      <title>Planning and Learning in Risk-Aware Restless Multi-Arm Bandit Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In restless multi-arm bandits, a central agent is tasked with optimally distributing limited resources across several bandits (arms), with each arm being a Markov decision process. In this work, we generalize the traditional restless multi-arm bandit problem with a risk-neutral objective by incorporating risk-awareness. We establish indexability conditions for the case of a risk-aware objective and provide a solution based on Whittle index. In addition, we address the learning problem when the true transition probabilities are unknown by proposing a Thompson sampling approach and show that it achieves bounded regret that scales sublinearly with the number of episodes and quadratically with the number of arms. The efficacy of our method in reducing risk exposure in restless multi-arm bandits is illustrated through a set of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Offline Reinforcement Learning and Sequence Modeling for Downlink Link Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary radio access networks employ link adaption (LA) algorithms to optimize the modulation and coding schemes to adapt to the prevailing propagation conditions and are near-optimal in terms of the achieved spectral efficiency. LA is a challenging task in the presence of mobility, fast fading, and imperfect channel quality information and limited knowledge of the receiver characteristics at the transmitter, which render model-based LA algorithms complex and suboptimal. Model-based LA is especially difficult as connected user equipment devices become increasingly heterogeneous in terms of receiver capabilities, antenna configurations and hardware characteristics. Recognizing these difficulties, previous works have proposed reinforcement learning (RL) for LA, which faces deployment difficulties due to their potential negative impacts on live performance. To address this challenge, this paper considers offline RL to learn LA policies from data acquired in live networks with minimal or no intrusive effects on the network operation. We propose three LA designs based on batch-constrained deep Q-learning, conservative Q-learning, and decision transformers, showing that offline RL algorithms can achieve performance of state-of-the-art online RL methods when data is collected with a proper behavioral policy.</description>

      <title>From Hype to Reality: The Road Ahead of Deploying DRL in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The industrial landscape is rapidly evolving with the advent of 6G applications, which demand massive connectivity, high computational capacity, and ultra-low latency. These requirements present new challenges, which can no longer be efficiently addressed by conventional strategies. In response, this article underscores the transformative potential of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for 6G, highlighting its advantages over classic machine learning solutions in meeting the demands of 6G. The necessity of DRL is further validated through three DRL applications in an end-to-end communication procedure, including wireless access control, baseband function placement, and network slicing coordination. However, DRL-based network management initiatives are far from mature. We extend the discussion to identify the challenges of applying DRL in practical networks and explore potential solutions along with their respective limitations. In the end, these insights are validated through a practical DRL deployment in managing network slices on the testbed.</description>

      <title>DisCo: Distributed Contact-Rich Trajectory Optimization for Forceful Multi-Robot Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DisCo, a distributed algorithm for contact-rich, multi-robot tasks. DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

      <description>arXiv:2303.11890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control strategy consisting of a robust controller and an Echo State Network (ESN) based control law for stabilizing a class of uncertain nonlinear discrete-time systems subject to persistent disturbances. Firstly, the robust controller is designed to ensure that the closed-loop system is Input-to-State Stable (ISS) with a guaranteed stability region regardless of the ESN control action and exogenous disturbances. Then, the ESN based controller is trained in order to mitigate the effects of disturbances on the system output. A numerical example demonstrates the potentials of the proposed control design method.</description>

      <title>Robust Control Barrier Functions using Uncertainty Estimation with Application to Mobile Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a safety-critical control design approach for nonlinear control affine systems in the presence of matched and unmatched uncertainties. Our constructive framework couples control barrier function (CBF) theory with a new uncertainty estimator to ensure robust safety. The estimated uncertainty with a derived upper bound on the estimation error is used for synthesizing CBFs and safety-critical controllers via a quadratic program-based feedback control law that rigorously ensures robust safety while improving disturbance rejection performance. The method is extended to higher-order CBFs (HOCBFs) to achieve safety under unmatched uncertainty, which may cause relative degree differences with respect to control input and disturbances. We assume the relative degree difference is at most one, resulting in a second-order cone constraint. The proposed robust HOCBF method is demonstrated via a simulation of an uncertain elastic actuator control problem. Finally, we experimentally demonstrated the efficacy of our robust CBF framework on a tracked robot with slope-induced matched and unmatched perturbations.</description>

      <title>Electricity Market-Clearing With Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme events jeopardize power network operations, causing beyond-design failures and massive supply interruptions. Existing market designs fail to internalize and systematically assess the risk of extreme and rare events. Efficiently maintaining the reliability of renewable-dominant power systems during extreme weather events requires co-optimizing system resources, while differentiating between large/rare and small/frequent deviations from forecast conditions. To address this gap in both research and practice, we propose managing the uncertainties associated with extreme weather events through an additional reserve service, termed extreme reserve. The procurement of extreme reserve is co-optimized with energy and regular reserve using a large deviation theory chance-constrained (LDT-CC) model, where LDT offers a mathematical framework to quantify the increased uncertainty during extreme events. To mitigate the high additional costs associated with reserve scheduling under the LDT-CC model, we also propose an LDT model based on weighted chance constraints (LDT-WCC). This model prepares the power system for extreme events at a lower cost, making it a less conservative alternative to the LDT-CC model. The proposed market design leads to a competitive equilibrium while ensuring cost recovery. Numerical experiments on an illustrative system and a modified 8-zone ISO New England system highlight the advantages of the proposed market design.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Input Mapping Inversion for Algebraic Loop-Free Control in Hydraulic Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The application of nonlinear control schemes to electro-hydraulic actuators often requires several alterations in the design of the controllers during their implementation. This is to overcome the challenges that frequently arise from the inherent complexity of such control algorithms owning to model nonlinearities. Moreover, advanced control solutions for this type of systems often introduce input algebraic loops and chatter, which considerably degrade the tracking performance. This study presents a nonlinear control architecture for hydraulic actuators that comprises low-complexity modules, based on well-established designs that facilitate robust high performance in tracking without introducing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, the proposed solution consists of two variants of a position controller for the hydraulic cylinder and a dynamic input-mapping inversion module to avoid algebraic loops in the control input. The stability of the closed-loop system is analysed using arguments from Lyapunov theory for cascaded non-autonomous nonlinear systems. The effectiveness of the proposed solution is evaluated on a high-fidelity simulator of a wind turbine pitch system. Appropriate quantitative metrics are finally defined to evaluate the closed-loop system performance in comparison to state-of-the-art nonlinear design.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Aware Computing for Data Centers with Probabilistic Performance Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21510v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data centers are significant contributors to carbon emissions and can strain power systems due to their high electricity consumption. To mitigate this impact and to participate in demand response programs, cloud computing companies strive to balance and optimize operations across their global fleets by making strategic decisions about when and where to place compute jobs for execution. In this paper, we introduce a load shaping scheme which reacts to time-varying grid signals by leveraging both temporal and spatial flexibility of compute jobs to provide risk-aware management guidelines and job placement with provable performance guarantees based on distributionally robust optimization. Our approach divides the problem into two key components: (i) day-ahead planning, which generates an optimal scheduling strategy based on historical load data, and (ii) real-time job placement and (time) scheduling, which dynamically tracks the optimal strategy generated in (i). We validate our method in simulation using normalized load profiles from randomly selected Google clusters, incorporating time-varying grid signals. We can demonstrate significant reductions in carbon cost and peak power with our approach compared to myopic greedy policies, while maintaining computational efficiency and abiding to system constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PC-Gym is an open-source tool designed to facilitate the development and evaluation of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for chemical process control problems. It provides a suite of environments that model a range of chemical processes, incorporating nonlinear dynamics, process disturbances, and constraints. Key features include flexible constraint handling mechanisms, customizable disturbance generation, and modular reward function design. The framework enables benchmarking state-of-the-art RL algorithms against a nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) oracle across various process control scenarios. Case studies demonstrate PC-Gym's effectiveness in evaluating RL approaches for the control of various chemical engineering systems such as a continuously stirred tank reactor, multistage extraction process, and crystallization reactor. The framework's ability to incorporate realistic disturbances and constraints allows for robust testing of control strategies. Results highlight the performance gaps between RL algorithms and NMPC oracles, demonstrating the utility of PC-Gym for algorithm benchmarking and suggesting areas for improvement in RL-based process control. By offering a standardized platform for developing and assessing RL-based control strategies, PC-Gym aims to accelerate research at the intersection of machine learning and process systems engineering. It bridges the gap between theoretical advancements in RL and practical applications in industrial process control, providing researchers and practitioners with a valuable tool for exploring data-driven control solutions for complex chemical processes.</description>

      <title>MPPI-IPDDP: Hybrid Method of Collision-Free Smooth Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid trajectory optimization method designed to generate collision-free, smooth trajectories for autonomous mobile robots. By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

      <title>Online Control with Adversarial Disturbance for Continuous-time Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01952v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study online control for continuous-time linear systems with finite sampling rates, where the objective is to design an online procedure that learns under non-stochastic noise and performs comparably to a fixed optimal linear controller. We present a novel two-level online algorithm, by integrating a higher-level learning strategy and a lower-level feedback control strategy. This method offers a practical and robust solution for online control, which achieves sublinear regret. Our work provides the first nonasymptotic results for controlling continuous-time linear systems with finite number of interactions with the system. Moreover, we examine how to train an agent in domain randomization environments from a non-stochastic control perspective. By applying our method to the SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) algorithm, we achieved improved results in multiple reinforcement learning tasks within domain randomization environments. Our work provides new insights into non-asymptotic analyses of controlling continuous-time systems. Furthermore, our work brings practical intuition into controller learning under non-stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>Successive Bayesian Reconstructor for Channel Estimation in Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06551v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluid antenna systems (FASs) can reconfigure their antenna locations freely within a spatially continuous space. To keep favorable antenna positions, the channel state information (CSI) acquisition for FASs is essential. While some techniques have been proposed, most existing FAS channel estimators require several channel assumptions, such as slow variation and angular-domain sparsity. When these assumptions are not reasonable, the model mismatch may lead to unpredictable performance losses. In this paper, we propose the successive Bayesian reconstructor (S-BAR) as a general solution to estimate FAS channels. Unlike model-based estimators, the proposed S-BAR is prior-aided, which builds the experiential kernel for CSI acquisition. Inspired by Bayesian regression, the key idea of S-BAR is to model the FAS channels as a stochastic process, whose uncertainty can be successively eliminated by kernel-based sampling and regression. In this way, the predictive mean of the regressed stochastic process can be viewed as a Bayesian channel estimator. Simulation results verify that, in both model-mismatched and model-matched cases, the proposed S-BAR can achieve higher estimation accuracy than the existing schemes.</description>

      <title>A Concentration Bound for TD(0) with Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a concentration bound of the type `for all $n \geq n_0$ for some $n_0$' for TD(0) with linear function approximation. We work with online TD learning with samples from a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain. This makes our analysis significantly different from offline TD learning or TD learning with access to independent samples from the stationary distribution of the Markov chain. We treat TD(0) as a contractive stochastic approximation algorithm, with both martingale and Markov noises. Markov noise is handled using the Poisson equation and the lack of almost sure guarantees on boundedness of iterates is handled using the concept of relaxed concentration inequalities.</description>

      <title>Attention-Enhanced Prioritized Proximal Policy Optimization for Adaptive Edge Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles the growing issue of excessive data transmission in networks. With increasing traffic, backhaul links and core networks are under significant traffic, leading to the investigation of caching solutions at edge routers. Many existing studies utilize Markov Decision Processes (MDP) to tackle caching problems, often assuming decision points at fixed intervals; however, real-world environments are characterized by random request arrivals. Additionally, critical file attributes such as lifetime, size, and priority significantly impact the effectiveness of caching policies, yet existing research fails to integrate all these attributes in policy design. In this work, we model the caching problem using a Semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP) to better capture the continuous-time nature of real-world applications, enabling caching decisions to be triggered by random file requests. We then introduce a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)--based caching strategy that fully considers file attributes like lifetime, size, and priority. Simulations show that our method outperforms a recent Deep Reinforcement Learning-based technique. To further advance our research, we improved the convergence rate of PPO by prioritizing transitions within the replay buffer through an attention mechanism. This mechanism evaluates the similarity between the current state and all stored transitions, assigning higher priorities to transitions that exhibit greater similarity.</description>

      <title>A novel seamless magnetic-based actuating mechanism for end-effector-based robotic rehabilitation platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rehabilitation robotics continues to confront substantial challenges, particularly in achieving smooth, safe, and intuitive human-robot interactions for upper limb motor training. Many current systems depend on complex mechanical designs, direct physical contact, and multiple sensors, which not only elevate costs but also reduce accessibility. Additionally, delivering seamless weight compensation and precise motion tracking remains a highly complex undertaking. To overcome these obstacles, we have developed a novel magnetic-based actuation mechanism for end-effector robotic rehabilitation. This innovative approach enables smooth, non-contact force transmission, significantly enhancing patient safety and comfort during upper limb training. To ensure consistent performance, we integrated an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) alongside a controller for real-time position tracking, allowing the system to maintain high accuracy or recover even in the event of sensor malfunction or failure. In a user study with 12 participants, 75% rated the system highly for its smoothness, while 66.7% commended its safety and effective weight compensation. The EKF demonstrated precise tracking performance, with root mean square error (RMSE) values remaining within acceptable limits (under 2 cm). By combining magnetic actuation with advanced closed-loop control algorithms, this system marks a significant advancement in the field of upper limb rehabilitation robotics.</description>

      <title>Gaussian process-based online health monitoring and fault analysis of lithium-ion battery systems from field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Health monitoring, fault analysis, and detection are critical for the safe and sustainable operation of battery systems. We apply Gaussian process resistance models on lithium iron phosphate battery field data to effectively separate the time-dependent and operating point-dependent resistance. The data set contains 29 battery systems returned to the manufacturer for warranty, each with eight cells in series, totaling 232 cells and 131 million data rows. We develop probabilistic fault detection rules using recursive spatiotemporal Gaussian processes. These processes allow the quick processing of over a million data points, enabling advanced online monitoring and furthering the understanding of battery pack failure in the field. The analysis underlines that often, only a single cell shows abnormal behavior or a knee point, consistent with weakest-link failure for cells connected in series, amplified by local resistive heating. The results further the understanding of how batteries degrade and fail in the field and demonstrate the potential of efficient online monitoring based on data. We open-source the code and publish the large data set upon completion of the review of this article.</description>

      <title>Certifiably Robust Policies for Uncertain Parametric Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03093v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a data-driven approach for producing policies that are provably robust across unknown stochastic environments. Existing approaches can learn models of a single environment as an interval Markov decision processes (IMDP) and produce a robust policy with a probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantee on its performance. However these are unable to reason about the impact of environmental parameters underlying the uncertainty. We propose a framework based on parametric Markov decision processes (MDPs) with unknown distributions over parameters. We learn and analyse IMDPs for a set of unknown sample environments induced by parameters. The key challenge is then to produce meaningful performance guarantees that combine the two layers of uncertainty: (1) multiple environments induced by parameters with an unknown distribution; (2) unknown induced environments which are approximated by IMDPs. We present a novel approach based on scenario optimisation that yields a single PAC guarantee quantifying the risk level for which a specified performance level can be assured in unseen environments, plus a means to trade-off risk and performance. We implement and evaluate our framework using multiple robust policy generation methods on a range of benchmarks. We show that our approach produces tight bounds on a policy's performance with high confidence.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Control and Readout Integrated Circuits for Solid-State Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of quantum computing, solid-state quantum systems, particularly superconducting ones, have made remarkable advancements over the past two decades. However, achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing for next-generation applications necessitates the integration of several million qubits, which presents significant challenges in terms of interconnection complexity and latency that are currently unsolvable with state-of-the-art room-temperature control and readout electronics. Recently, cryogenic integrated circuits (ICs), including CMOS radio-frequency ICs and rapid-single-flux-quantum-logic ICs, have emerged as potential alternatives to room-temperature electronics. Unlike their room-temperature counterparts, these ICs are deployed within cryostats to enhance scalability by reducing the number and length of transmission lines. Additionally, operating at cryogenic temperatures can suppress electronic noise and improve qubit control fidelity. However, for CMOS ICs specifically, circuit design uncertainties arise due to a lack of reliable models for cryogenic field effect transistors as well as issues related to severe fickle noises and power dissipation at cryogenic temperatures. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on both types of cryogenic control and readout ICs but primarily focuses on the more mature CMOS technology. The discussion encompasses principles underlying control and readout techniques employed in cryogenic CMOS ICs along with their architectural designs; characterization and modeling approaches for field effect transistors under cryogenic conditions; as well as fundamental concepts pertaining to rapid single flux quantum circuits.</description>
