      <title>How forest insect outbreaks depend on forest size and tree distribution: an individual-based model results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an individual-based model of forest insect outbreaks is presented. The results obtained show that the outbreak is an emerging feature of the system. It is a common product of the characteristics of insects, the environment in which the insects live, and the way insects behave in it. The outbreak dynamics is an effect of scale. In a sufficiently large forest regardless of the density of trees and their spatial distribution, provided that the range of insect dispersion is large enough, it develops in the form of an outbreak. In very small forests, the dynamics becomes more chaotic. It loses the outbreak character and, especially in the forest with random tree distribution, there is a possibility that the insect population goes extinct. The local dynamics of the number of insects on one tree in a forest, where the dynamics of all insects has the character of outbreak, is characterized by a rapid increase in number and then a rapid decrease until the extinction of the local population. It is the result of the influx of immigrants from neighboring trees. The type of tree distribution in the forest becomes visible when the density of trees becomes low and/or the range of insect dispersion is small. When trees are uniformly distributed and the range of insect dispersion is small, the system persists as a set of more or less isolated local populations. In the forest with randomly distributed trees, the insect population becomes more susceptible to extinction when the tree density and/or range of insect dispersion are small.</description>

      <title>Competition in the nutrient-driven self-cycling fermentation process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-cycling fermentation is an automated process used for culturing microorganisms. We consider a model of $n$ distinct species competing for a single non-reproducing nutrient in a self-cycling fermentor in which the nutrient level is used as the decanting condition. The model is formulated in terms of impulsive ordinary differential equations. We prove that two species are able to coexist in the fermentor under certain conditions. We also provide numerical simulations that suggest coexistence of three species is possible and that competitor-mediated coexistence can occur in this case. These results are in contrast to the chemostat, the continuous analogue, where multiple species cannot coexist on a single nonreproducing nutrient.</description>

      <title>No evidence of systematic proximity ascertainment bias in early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan Reply to Weissman (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a short text published as Letter to the Editor of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A, Weissman (2024) argues that the finding that early COVID-19 cases without an ascertained link to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale market resided on average closer to the market than cases epidemiologically linked to it, reveals "major proximity ascertainment bias". Here we show that Weissman's conclusion is based on a flawed premise, and that there is no such "internal evidence" of major bias. The pattern can indeed be explained by places of infection not being limited to residential neighbourhoods, and by stochasticity -- i.e., without requiring any ascertainment bias.</description>

      <title>Genetic contribution of an advantaged mutant in the biparental Moran model -- finite selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a population of N individuals, whose dynamics through time is represented by a biparental Moran model with two types: an advantaged type and a disadvantaged type. The advantage is due to a mutation, transmitted in a Mendelian way from parent to child that reduces the death probability of individuals carrying it. We assume that initially this mutation is carried by a proportion a of individuals in the population. Once the mutation is fixed, a gene is sampled uniformly in the population, at a locus independent of the locus under selection. We then give the probability that this gene initially comes from an advantaged individual, i.e. the genetic contribution of these individuals, as a function of a and when the population size is large.</description>

      <title>The Requirement for Cognition, in an Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model of the evolution of cognition is used to derive a Requirement Equation (RE), which defines what computations the fittest possible brain must make, or must choose actions as if it had made those computations. The terms in the RE depend on factors outside an animals brain, which can be modelled without making assumptions about how the brain works, from knowledge of the animals habitat and biology. In simple domains where the choices of actions have small information content, it may not be necessary to build internal models of reality; short cut computations may be just as good at choosing actions. In complex domains such as 3D spatial cognition, which underpins many complex choices of action, the RE implies that brains build Bayesian internal models of the animals surroundings; and that the models are constrained to be true to external reality.</description>
