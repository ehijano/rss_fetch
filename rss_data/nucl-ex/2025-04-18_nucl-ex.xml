      <title>Mass measurements of proton-rich nuclei in the vicinity of ${}^{84}$Mo and their impact on rp-process in type I X-ray burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the mass measurement of the rapid proton-capture process key nuclide ${}^{84}$Mo and its vicinity, such as ${}^{78}$Y${}^{\rm m}$, ${}^{79}$Y, ${}^{83}$Nb, and ${}^{88}$Ru, using the multi-reflection time-of-flight spectrograph at RIKEN RIBF. For ${}^{78}$Y${}^{\rm m}$, ${}^{84}$Mo, and ${}^{88}$Ru, their masses are experimentally determined for the first time with uncertainties of $\delta m \approx 20~{\rm keV}$. The mass precision of ${}^{79}$Y and ${}^{83}$Nb is improved to 13 keV and 9.6 keV, respectively. The new $\alpha$-separation energy of ${}^{84}$Mo, 1.434(83) MeV, unambiguously rules out the possibility of forming the ZrNb cycle. The X-ray burst simulation with the new masses shows that our measurements effectively remove the large final abundance uncertainties in the $A=80-90$ mass region. The new mass values improve the prediction power for the composition of the nuclear ashes in X-ray bursts, including the production of light $p$-nuclei.</description>

      <title>High-Density Ultracold Neutron Source for Low-Energy Particle Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SuperSUN, a new superthermal source of ultracold neutrons (UCN) at the Institut Laue-Langevin, exploits inelastic scattering of neutrons in isotopically pure superfluid $^4$He at temperatures below $0.6\,$K. For the first time, continuous operation with an intense broad-spectrum cold neutron beam is demonstrated over 60 days. We observe continuous UCN extraction rates of $21000\,$s$^{-1}$, and storage in the source with saturated $\textit{in-situ}$ density $273\,$cm$^{-3}$. The high stored density, low-energy UCN spectrum, and long storage times open new possibilities in fundamental and applied physics.</description>

      <title>Contrasting Features of Parton Energy Loss in Heavy-ion Collisions at RHIC and the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00024v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energetic quarks and gluons lose energy as they traverse the hot and dense medium created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions at the BNL Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The nuclear modification factor ($R_{AA}$) of leading particles quantifies parton energy loss in such collisions, with the particle spectrum in $p+p$ collisions as a reference. Previous $R_{AA}$ measurements at RHIC energies have revealed an approximately constant trend at high transverse momenta ($p_{T}$), implying a scenario where parton energy loss, $\Delta p_{T}$, scales proportionally with $p_{T}$, a feature naively expected from energy loss dynamics in elastic collisions. In this study, we investigate the LHC $R_{AA}$ measurements which exhibit a pronounced $p_{T}$ dependence of $R_{AA}$ for various particle species, and our analysis attributes this behavior to $\Delta p_T$ being approximately proportional to $\sqrt{p_{T}}$. These distinct features are consistent with model calculations of dominant radiative energy loss dynamics at the LHC, in contrast to the dominance of collisional energy loss at RHIC. Additionally, the linear increase of fractional energy loss with medium density at different $p_{T}$ magnitudes affirms the previous empirical observation that the magnitude of the energy loss depends mostly on the initial entropy density, with no significant path-length dependence. Implications on the dynamical scenarios of parton energy loss and future experimental investigations will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Weak interaction axial form factors of the octet baryons in nuclear medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the axial-vector and the induced pseudoscalar form factors associated with the weak transitions between the octet baryon members in nuclear medium, using a covariant constituent quark model. We extend previous calculations of the axial transition form factors from the vacuum (free space) to the nuclear medium (symmetric nuclear matter). The extension of the model to the nuclear medium takes into account the modifications of the properties of hadrons in the medium (masses and coupling constants), as determined by the quark-meson coupling model. The axial-vector ($G_A$) and the induced pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factors are evaluated for different values of the nuclear density $\rho$ in terms of the square transfer momentum $q^2= -Q^2$. We conclude that, in general, the $G_A$ and $G_P$ form factors are reduced in the nuclear medium. The reduction is stronger for light baryons and high densities. The medium modifications are milder for the heavier octet baryons, particularly at large $Q^2$. The calculations presented here can be used to estimate the cross sections of neutrino and antineutrino scattering with nucleus, and neutrino and antineutrino scattering with hyperons bound to a nucleus, as well as those in the cores of compact stars.</description>

      <title>Extended Skyrme effective interactions with higher-order momentum-dependence for transport models and neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently developed extended Skyrme effective interaction based on the so-called N3LO Skyrme pseudopotential is generalized to the general N$n$LO case by incorporating the derivative terms up to 2$n$th-order into the central term of the pseudopotential. The corresponding expressions of Hamiltonian density and single-nucleon potential are derived within the Hartree-Fock approximation under general nonequilibrium conditions. The inclusion of the higher-order derivative terms provides additional higher-order momentum dependence for the single-nucleon potential, and in particular, we find that the N5LO single-nucleon potential with momentum dependent terms up to $p^{10}$ can give a nice description for the empirical nucleon optical potential up to energy of $2$ GeV. At the same time, the density-dependent terms in the extended Skyrme effective interaction are extended correspondingly in the spirit of the Fermi momentum expansion, which allows highly flexible variation of density behavior for both the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and the symmetry energy. Based on the Skyrme pseudopotential up to N3LO, N4LO and N5LO, we construct a series of interactions with the nucleon optical potential having different high-momentum behaviors and with the symmetry potentials featuring different linear isospin-splitting coefficients for nucleon effective mass, by which we study the properties of nuclear matter and neutron stars. Furthermore, within the lattice BUU transport model, some benchmark simulations with selected interactions are performed for the Au+Au collisions at a beam energy of $1.23$ GeV/nucleon, and the predicted collective flows for protons are found to nicely agree with the data measured by HADES collaboration.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Transport of Radioactive Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beams of radioactive heavy ions allow researchers to study rare and unstable atomic nuclei, shedding light into the internal structure of exotic nuclei and on how chemical elements are formed in stars. However, the extraction and transport of radioactive beams rely on time-consuming expert-driven tuning methods, where hundreds of parameters are manually optimized. Here, we introduce a system that employs Artificial Intelligence (AI), specifically utilizing Bayesian Optimization, to assist in the transport process of radioactive beams. We apply our methodology to real-life scenarios showing advantages when compared with standard tuning methods. This AI-assisted approach can be extended to other radioactive beam facilities around the world to improve operational efficiency and enhance scientific output.</description>
