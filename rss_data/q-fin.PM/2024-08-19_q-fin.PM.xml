      <title>Enhancement of price trend trading strategies via image-induced importance weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We open up the "black-box" to identify the predictive general price patterns in price chart images via the deep learning image analysis techniques. Our identified price patterns lead to the construction of image-induced importance (triple-I) weights, which are applied to weighted moving average the existing price trend trading signals according to their level of importance in predicting price movements. From an extensive empirical analysis on the Chinese stock market, we show that the triple-I weighting scheme can significantly enhance the price trend trading signals for proposing portfolios, with a thoughtful robustness study in terms of network specifications, image structures, and stock sizes. Moreover, we demonstrate that the triple-I weighting scheme is able to propose long-term portfolios from a time-scale transfer learning, enhance the news-based trading strategies through a non-technical transfer learning, and increase the overall strength of numerous trading rules for portfolio selection.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Asset Allocation with Asset-Specific Regime Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel hybrid regime identification-forecasting framework designed to enhance multi-asset portfolio construction by integrating asset-specific regime forecasts. Unlike traditional approaches that focus on broad economic regimes affecting the entire asset universe, our framework leverages both unsupervised and supervised learning to generate tailored regime forecasts for individual assets. Initially, we use the statistical jump model, a robust unsupervised regime identification model, to derive regime labels for historical periods, classifying them into bullish or bearish states based on features extracted from an asset return series. Following this, a supervised gradient-boosted decision tree classifier is trained to predict these regimes using a combination of asset-specific return features and cross-asset macro-features. We apply this framework individually to each asset in our universe. Subsequently, return and risk forecasts which incorporate these regime predictions are input into Markowitz mean-variance optimization to determine optimal asset allocation weights. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through an empirical study on a multi-asset portfolio comprising twelve risky assets, including global equity, bond, real estate, and commodity indexes spanning from 1991 to 2023. The results consistently show outperformance across various portfolio models, including minimum-variance, mean-variance, and naive-diversified portfolios, highlighting the advantages of integrating asset-specific regime forecasts into dynamic asset allocation.</description>
