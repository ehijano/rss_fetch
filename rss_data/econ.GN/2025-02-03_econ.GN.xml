      <title>ReviewCoin: Paying for Real Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The peer-review process is broken and the problem is getting worse, especially in AI: large conferences like NeurIPS increasingly struggle to adequately review huge numbers of paper submissions. I propose a scalable solution that, foremost, recognizes reviewing as important, necessary, \emph{work} and rewards it with crypto-coins owned and managed by the conferences themselves. The idea is at its core quite simple: paper submissions require work (reviews, meta-reviews, etc.) to be done, and therefore the submitter must pay for that work. Each reviewer submits their review to be approved by some designated conference officer (e.g. PC chair, Area Chair, etc.), and upon approval is paid a single coin for a single review. If three reviews are required, the cost of submission should be three coins + a tax that covers payments to all the volunteers who organize the conference. After some one-time startup costs to fairly distribute coins, the process should be relatively stable with new coins minted only when a conference grows.</description>

      <title>Examining the Impact of Income Inequality and Gender on School Completion in Malaysia: A Machine Learning Approach Utilizing Malaysia's Public Sector Open Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between income inequality, gender, and school completion rates in Malaysia using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilized is from the Malaysia's Public Sector Open Data Portal, covering the period 2016-2022. The analysis employs various machine learning techniques, including K-means clustering, ARIMA modeling, Random Forest regression, and Prophet for time series forecasting. These models are used to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies in the data, and to predict future school completion rates. Key findings reveal significant disparities in school completion rates across states, genders, and income levels. The analysis also identifies clusters of states with similar completion rates, suggesting potential regional factors influencing educational outcomes. Furthermore, time series forecasting models accurately predict future completion rates, highlighting the importance of ongoing monitoring and intervention strategies. The study concludes with recommendations for policymakers and educators to address the observed disparities and improve school completion rates in Malaysia. These recommendations include targeted interventions for specific states and demographic groups, investment in early childhood education, and addressing the impact of income inequality on educational opportunities. The findings of this study contribute to the understanding of the factors influencing school completion in Malaysia and provide valuable insights for policymakers and educators to develop effective strategies to improve educational outcomes.</description>

      <title>Implications of zero-growth economics analysed with an agent-based model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-approaching limits of the Earth's biosphere and the potentially catastrophic consequences caused by climate change have begun to call into question the endless growth of the economy. There is increasing interest in the prospects of zero economic growth from the degrowth and post-growth literature. In particular, the question arises as to whether a zero-growth trajectory in a capitalist system with interest-bearing debt can be economically stable. There have been several answers to this question using macroeconomic models; some find a zero-growth trajectory is stable, while other models show an economic breakdown. However, the capitalist system in a period of growth is not guaranteed to be stable. Hence, a more appropriate methodology is to compare the relative stability between a growth and zero-growth scenario on the same model. Such a question has not yet been answered at any disaggregated level. It's important to investigate the consequences of zero-growth on market share instability and concentration, bankruptcy rates, income distribution, and credit network risk. To answer such questions, we develop a macroeconomic agent-based model incorporating Minskyan financial dynamics. The growth and zero-growth scenarios are accomplished by changing an average productivity growth parameter for the firms in the model. The model results showed that real GDP growth rates were more stable in the zero-growth scenario, there were fewer economic crises, lower unemployment rates, a higher wage share of output for workers, and capital firm and bank market shares were relatively more stable. Some of the consequences of zero-growth were a higher rate of inflation than in the growth scenario, increased market concentration for both firms and banks, and a higher level of financial risk in the credit network.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Plant-Product Productivity via First-Order Conditions: Robust Replication of Orr (2022)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the reproducibility and replicability of Scott Orr's (Journal of Political Economy 2022, 130(11): 2771-2828) innovative approach for identifying within-plant productivity differences across product lines. Orr's methodology allows the estimation of plant-product level productivity, contingent upon a well-behaved pre-estimated demand system, which requires carefully chosen instrumental variables (IVs) for output prices. Using Orr's STATA replication package, we successfully replicate all primary estimates with the ASI Indian plant-level panel data from 2000 to 2007. Additionally, applying Orr's replication codes to a sample from 2011 to 2020 reveals that the suggested IVs do not perform as expected.</description>

      <title>AI Biases Towards Rich and Powerful Surnames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surnames often convey implicit markers of social status, wealth, and lineage, shaping perceptions in ways that can perpetuate systemic biases. This study investigates whether and how surnames influence AI-driven decision-making, focusing on their effects across key areas such as hiring recommendations, leadership appointments, and loan approvals. Drawing on 600 surnames from the United States and Thailand, countries with differing sociohistorical dynamics and surname conventions, we categorize names into Rich, Legacy, Normal, and phonetically similar Variant groups. Our findings reveal that elite surnames consistently predict AI-generated perceptions of power, intelligence, and wealth, leading to significant consequences for decisions in high-stakes situations. Mediation analysis highlights perceived intelligence as a crucial pathway through which surname biases operate. Providing objective qualifications alongside the surnames reduces, but does not eliminate, these biases, especially in contexts with uniformly low credentials. These results call for fairness-aware algorithms and robust policy interventions to mitigate the reinforcement of inherited inequalities by AI systems. Our work also urges a reexamination of algorithmic accountability and its societal impact, particularly in systems designed for meritocratic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Errors or Surprises?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional finance and macroeconomic models usually assume people can form rational expectations or reach them via a learning path by minimizing prediction errors. The recent Reference Model Based Learning (RMBL) model provides a new perspective: It hypothesizes that people minimize surprises instead of errors. Following the spirit of Simon's "satisficing" criteria, RMBL predicts that they will minimize errors only when the prediction error exceeds a threshold. We conduct meta-analyses based on 18 Learning-to-Forecast Experiments (LtFEs; N=41,490). Our results from the horse race test consistently show that student participants minimize surprises instead of errors in the LtFEs. In contrast, the results based on the data from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) show no evidence that they minimize surprises. Together, our results suggest that minimizing surprises by implementing RMBL may be the simple procedure people employ when navigating complexity in forecasting.</description>
