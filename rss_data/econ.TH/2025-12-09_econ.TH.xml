      <title>Comparative risk attitude and the aggregation of single-crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In choice under risk, there is a standard notion of 'less risk-averse than', due to Yaari (1969). In the theory of comparative statics, the single-crossing property is satisfied by all weighted averages of a family of single-crossing functions if and only if the family satisfies a property called signed-ratio monotonicity (Quah &amp; Strulovici, 2012). We establish a close link between 'less risk-averse than' and signed-ratio monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Innovation, Spillovers and Economic Geography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a Schumpeterian quality-ladder spatial model in which innovation arrivals depend on regional knowledge spillovers. A parsimonious reduced-form diffusion mechanism induces the convergence of regions' average distance to the global frontier quality. As a result, regional differences in knowledge levels stem residually from asymmetries in the spatial distribution of researchers and firms. We analytically characterize the processes of innovation and knowledge diffusion. We then explore how the weight of intra-relative to inter-regional knowledge spillovers interacts with freer trade to shape the spatial distribution of economic activities. If intra-regional spillovers are relatively stronger, a higher economic integration leads to progressive agglomeration. If inter-regional spillovers dominate, researchers and firms may re-disperse after an initial phase of agglomeration as integration increases. This happens because firms and researchers have incentives to relocate to the smaller region, where they can leverage the concentrated knowledge base of the larger region while avoiding congestion in innovation. The smoothness of the dispersion process depends on the particular weight of intra-regional spillovers. If inter-regional spillovers become stronger as trade becomes freer, then the latter induces a monotone dispersion process. When integration is high enough, stable long-run equilibria always maximize the growth rate of the global frontier quality and the average distance to the frontier, irrespective of whether spillovers are mainly local or global.</description>

      <title>Regulating a Monopolist without Subsidy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study monopoly regulation under asymmetric information about costs when subsidies are infeasible. A monopolist with privately known marginal cost serves a single product market and sets a price. The regulator maximizes a weighted welfare function using unit taxes as sole policy instrument. We identify a sufficient and necessary condition for when laissez-faire is optimal. When intervention is desired, we provide simple sufficient conditions under which the optimal policy is a progressive price cap: prices below a benchmark face no tax, while higher prices are taxed at increasing and potentially prohibitive rates. This policy combines delegation at low prices with taxation at high prices, balancing access, affordability, and profitability. Our results clarify when taxes act as complements to subsidies and when they serve only as imperfect substitutes, illuminating how feasible policy instruments shape optimal regulatory design.</description>

      <title>Wage Dispersion, On-the-Job Search, and Stochastic Match Productivity: A Mean Field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wage dispersion and job-to-job mobility are central features of modern labour markets, yet canonical equilibrium search models with exogenous job-offer ladders struggle to jointly account for these facts and the magnitude of frictional wage inequality. We develop a continuous-time equilibrium search model in which match surplus follows a diffusion process, workers choose on-the-job search and separation, firms post state-contingent wages, and the cross-sectional distribution of match states endogenously determines both outside options and the job ladder. On the theoretical side, we formulate the problem as a stationary mean field game with a one-dimensional surplus state, characterize stationary mean field equilibria, and show that equilibrium separation is governed by a free-boundary rule: matches continue if and only if surplus stays above an endogenous threshold. Under standard regularity and Lasry-Lions monotonicity conditions we prove existence and uniqueness of stationary equilibrium and obtain comparative statics for the separation boundary, wage schedules, and wage dispersion. On the quantitative side, we solve the coupled HJB and Kolmogorov system using monotone finite-difference methods and interpret the discretization as a finite-state mean field game. The model is calibrated to micro evidence on stochastic match productivity, job durations, tenure-dependent separation hazards, wage growth, and job-to-job mobility. The stationary equilibrium delivers a structural decomposition of wage dispersion into stochastic selection along job spells, equilibrium on-the-job search and the induced job ladder, and equilibrium wage policies with feedback through outside options. We use this framework to quantify how firing costs, search subsidies, and changes in match-productivity volatility jointly shape mobility, the job ladder, and the cross-sectional distribution of wages.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Exploitation Equilibria for Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Sustainable Exploitation Equilibrium (SEE), a refinement of Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) for dynamic games with an exploiter-exploitee structure. SEE imposes two additional discipline conditions: (i) viability, requiring state trajectories to remain inside a sustainability set; and (ii) renegotiation-proofness with exploiter-optimal selection, to retain only those viable equilibria that are immune to Pareto-improving renegotiations, with ties resolved in favor of the exploiter. In our base formulation the exploitee cannot exit the relationship (no outside option), but retains a strategic effort margin that affects dynamics and payoffs. We establish existence under appropriate conditions and illustrate SEE in a hegemon-client model of foreign politics, where tribute demands trade off against the client's governance effort.</description>

      <title>Optimal Auction Design under Costly Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal auction design in an independent private values environment where bidders can endogenously -- but at a cost -- improve information about their own valuations. The optimal mechanism is two-stage: at stage-1 bidders register an information acquisition plan and pay a transfer; at stage-2 they bid, and allocation and payments are determined. We show that the revenue-optimal stage-2 rule is the Vickrey--Clarke--Groves (VCG) mechanism, while stage-1 transfers implement the optimal screening of types and absorb information rents consistent with incentive compatibility and participation. By committing to VCG ex post, the pre-auction information game becomes a potential game, so equilibrium information choices maximize expected welfare; the stage-1 fee schedule then transfers an optimal amount of payoff without conditioning on unverifiable cost scales. The design is robust to asymmetric primitives and accommodates a wide range of information technologies, providing a simple implementation that unifies efficiency and optimal revenue in environments with endogenous information acquisition.</description>

      <title>Learning Paths to Multi-Sector Equilibrium: Belief Dynamics Under Uncertain Returns to Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of learning in a multi-sector general equilibrium model where firms operate under incomplete information about their production returns to scale. Firms iteratively update their beliefs using maximum a-posteriori estimation, derived from observed production outcomes, to refine their knowledge of their returns to scale. The implications of these learning dynamics for market equilibrium and the conditions under which firms can effectively learn their true returns to scale are the key objects of this study. Our results shed light on how idiosyncratic shocks influence the learning process and demonstrate that input decisions encode all pertinent information for belief updates. Additionally, we show that a long-memory (path-dependent) learning which keeps track of all past estimations ends up having a worse performance than a short-memory (path-independent) approach.</description>

      <title>Generative AI and Copyright: A Dynamic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI is poised to disrupt the creative industry. Amidst the immense excitement for this new technology, its future development and applications in the creative industry hinge crucially upon two copyright issues: 1) the compensation to creators whose content has been used to train generative AI models (the fair use standard); and 2) the eligibility of AI-generated content for copyright protection (AI-copyrightability). While both issues have ignited heated debates among academics and practitioners, most analysis has focused on their challenges posed to existing copyright doctrines. In this paper, we aim to better understand the economic implications of these two regulatory issues and their interactions. By constructing a dynamic model with endogenous content creation and AI model development, we unravel the impacts of the fair use standard and AI-copyrightability on AI development, AI company profit, creators income, and consumer welfare, and how these impacts are influenced by various economic and operational factors. For example, while generous fair use (use data for AI training without compensating the creator) benefits all parties when abundant training data exists, it can hurt creators and consumers when such data is scarce. Similarly, stronger AI-copyrightability (AI content enjoys more copyright protection) could hinder AI development and reduce social welfare. Our analysis also highlights the complex interplay between these two copyright issues. For instance, when existing training data is scarce, generous fair use may be preferred only when AI-copyrightability is weak. Our findings underscore the need for policymakers to embrace a dynamic, context-specific approach in making regulatory decisions and provide insights for business leaders navigating the complexities of the global regulatory environment.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Priority-Neutral Matching Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02142v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the structure of the set of priority-neutral matchings. These matchings, introduced by Reny (AER, 2022), generalize stable matchings by allowing for priority violations in a principled way that enables Pareto-improvements to stable matchings. Known results show that the set of priority-neutral matchings is a lattice, suggesting that these matchings may enjoy the same tractable theoretical structure as stable matchings.
  In this paper, we characterize priority-neutral matching lattices, and show that their structure is considerably more intricate than that of stable matching lattices. To begin, we show priority-neutral lattices are not distributive, an important property that characterizes stable lattices and is satisfied by many other lattice structures considered in matching theory and algorithm design. Then, in our main result, we show that priority-neutral lattices are in fact characterized by a more-involved property which we term being a "movement lattice," which allows for significant departures from the order theoretic properties of distributive (and hence stable) lattices. While our results show that priority-neutrality is more intricate than stability, they also establish tractable properties. Indeed, as a corollary of our main result, we obtain the first known polynomial-time algorithm for checking whether a given matching is priority-neutral.</description>

      <title>Efficiency in Games with Incomplete Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study games with incomplete information and characterize when a feasible outcome is Pareto efficient. Outcomes with excessive randomization are inefficient: generically, the total number of action profiles across states must be strictly less than the sum of the number of players and the number of states. We consider three applications. A cheap talk outcome is efficient only if pure; with state-independent sender payoffs, it is efficient if and only if the sender's most preferred action is induced with certainty. In natural settings, Bayesian persuasion outcomes are inefficient across many priors. Finally, ranking-based allocation mechanisms are inefficient under mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Mediation and Moral Hazard: From Private To Public Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02436v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I characterize optimal mediation dynamics with fixed discounting in a moral hazard model where a long-lived worker interacts with short-lived clients. I show that optimal mediation yields a nonstationary correlated information structure that transitions from private to public communication over time. In early periods, it occasionally creates information asymmetry about future play between the worker and the clients by randomizing over two continuations, with the realization privately revealed to the worker. In one, the worker shirks with impunity. In the other, the worker exerts effort subject to minimal punishment for underperformance. Eventually, optimal mediation prescribes only public communication that induces carrot-and-stick incentives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.03179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study contests where the designer's objective is an extension of the widely studied objective of maximizing the total output: The designer gets zero marginal utility from a player's output if the output of the player is very low or very high. We consider two variants of this setting, which correspond to two objective functions: binary threshold, where the designer's utility is a non-decreasing function of the number of players with output above a certain threshold; and linear threshold, where a player's contribution to the designer's utility is linear in her output if the output is between a lower and an upper threshold, and becomes constant below the lower and above the upper threshold. For both of these objectives, we study rank-order allocation contests and general contests. We characterize the contests that maximize the designer's objective and indicate techniques to efficiently compute them.</description>

      <title>Matching Markets Meet LLMs: Algorithmic Reasoning with Ranked Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven progress in reasoning tasks -- from program synthesis to scientific hypothesis generation -- yet their ability to handle ranked preferences and structured algorithms in combinatorial domains remains underexplored. We study matching markets, a core framework behind applications like resource allocation and ride-sharing, which require reconciling individual ranked preferences to ensure stable outcomes. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models on a hierarchy of preference-based reasoning tasks -- ranging from stable-matching generation to instability detection, instability resolution, and fine-grained preference queries -- to systematically expose their logical and algorithmic limitations in handling ranked inputs. Surprisingly, even top-performing models with advanced reasoning struggle to resolve instability in large markets, often failing to identify blocking pairs or execute algorithms iteratively. We further show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA) significantly improves performance in small markets, but fails to bring about a similar improvement on large instances, suggesting the need for more sophisticated strategies to improve LLMs' reasoning with larger-context inputs.</description>
