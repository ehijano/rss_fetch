      <title>Defect Engineering the Interacting Many-body SSH Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to engineer topologically distinct materials opens the possibility of enabling novel phenomena in low-dimensional nano-systems, as well as manufacturing novel quantum devices. One of the simplest examples, the SSH model with both even and odd number of sites, demonstrates the connection between localized edge states and the topology of the system. We show that the SSH model hosts localized spin centers due to the interplay between the localized edge states and the on-site Hubbard interaction. We further show how one can engineer any number of localized spin centers within the chain by careful addition of defects. These spin centers are paired in spin-singlet or spin-triplet channels within each block separated by the defects, and together they construct a chain of spin qubits. As this system is realizable experimentally, our findings provide a novel way for manipulating and engineering spin qubits in physical systems.</description>

      <title>X-ray Emission Spectropolarimetry of Strongly Anisotropic Single Crystal Systems using a Rowland Circle Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization dependence has historically seen extensive use in x-ray spectroscopy to determine magnetic and local geometric properties, but more broadly as a way to gain extra sensitivity to electronic structure at the level of individual magnetic orbitals. This is often done in the context of x-ray absorption through techniques like x-ray magnetic circular dichroism or x-ray linear dichroism, but it has seen little application to x-ray emission. Here we explore the information contained in the polarized emission of two 3d transition metal systems across both core-to-core (CtC) and valence-to-core emission (VtC) lines. We demonstrate how the Rowland circle geometry can be used as a spectropolarimeter, and apply it to the x-ray emission spectroscopy of spin-1/2 Cu(II) and spin-0 Ni(II) ions in LiVCuO4 and DyNiC2, respectively. From this we explore how the polarized XES interrogates of the occupied density of states at the valence level, either as a second order effect through Coulomb exchange (CtC x-ray emission) or by direct transitions (VtC x-ray emission). We find that the polarized x-ray emission can provide insights into the valence electron orbital occupation, in much the same way that is achievable with polarized absorption or angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy techniques. Finally, we highlight how the individually polarized dipole emission spectra can be extracted from a linearly independent suite of directed emission spectra, allowing for polarized measurements at high Bragg angle with lower experimental broadening.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Induced Nonlinear Transport in LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent experimental measurements of the nonlinear longitudinal resistance of the spin-orbit coupled electron gas in the (111) LaTiO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interfaces under external in-plane magnetic field [G. Tuvia \emph{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 146301 (2024)], we formulate a theory of nonlinear electronic transport based on the analysis of the quantum kinetic equation for the Wigner distribution function. Specifically, we evaluate the magnetic field dependence of the second harmonic of the current density at arbitrary values of the magnetic field. The magnitude of the second harmonic increases linearly with the magnetic field at small fields. Upon further increase of the magnetic field, the second harmonic response reaches its maximum value. We find that the position of the peak and its width strongly depend on the relaxation rate due to disorder. Importantly, we discover that the direction of the nonlinear contribution to the current can be completely reversed when the magnetic field reaches a certain critical value.</description>

      <title>Spinon Singlet: Microscopic Mechanism of $d$-Wave Pairing in a Partially-Filled Stripe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant research advances have led to a consensus that the Fermi-Hubbard model and its extended variants are archetypal frameworks for elucidating the intertwined relationship between stripe orders and superconductivity in hole-doped high-$T_c$ materials. Notably, the Hubbard quantum simulator has recently achieved several remarkable breakthroughs, e.g., being successfully cooled down to the cryogenic regime and enabling the observation of stable fluctuating stripes. However, the microscopic mechanism behind $d$-wave pairing of electrons in the presence of stripes at low temperatures remains poorly understood due to the intricate interplay among the strongly correlated effects and non-negligible thermal fluctuations. Here, we conduct a close investigation of a partially-filled stripe in the representative $t$-$J$ and Fermi-Hubbard models with both numerical and analytical methods. Analogous to quantum gas microscopy, the perfect sampling technique allows us to obtain the high-confidence statistics of the Fock basis states appearing in the ground-state wavefunction. In a refreshing physical paradigm, these data demonstrate that two spinons with opposite chiralities tend to spontaneously pair into a singlet state, which naturally gives rise to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Then, using the effective theory of quantum colored string, we reconstruct the wavefunction and determine the nature of spinon pairing and its connection to the $d$-wave pairing pattern. Furthermore, spinon singlet pairs enable the establishment of a long-range pair-pair correlation between double stripes. Our work offers new insights into the role of stripe orders in mediating $d$-wave superconductivity and paves the way for further exploration of multi-stripe-mediated pairing mechanisms in the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Antibonding and Electronic Instabilities in GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn): A New Pathway Toward Developing Centrosymmetric Skyrmion Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical bonding is key to unlocking the potential of magnetic materials for future information technology. Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected nano-sized spin textures that can enable high-density low-power spin-based electronics. Despite increasing interest in the discovery of new skyrmion hosts and their characterization, the electronic origins of the skyrmion formation remain unknown. Here, we study GdRu2X2 (X = Si, Ge, Sn) as a model system to study the connection among chemical bonding, electronic instability, and the critical temperature and magnetic field at which skyrmions evolve. The nature of the electronic structure of GdRu2X2 is characterized by chemical bonding, Fermi surface analysis, and density of energy function. As X-p orbitals become more extended from Si-3p to Ge-4p and Sn-5p, improved interactions between the Gd spins and the [Ru2X2] conduction layer and increased destabilizing energy contributions are obtained. GdRu2Si2 possesses a Fermi surface nesting (FSN) vector [Q = (q, 0, 0)], whereas GdRu2Ge2 displays two inequivalent FSN vectors [Q = (q, 0, 0); QA = (q, q, 0)] and GdRu2Sn2 features multiple Q vectors. In addition, competing ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange interactions in the Gd plane become more pronounced as a function of X. These results reveal some correlation among the electronic instability, the competing interaction strength, and the temperature and magnetic field conditions at which the skyrmions emerge. This work demonstrates how chemical bonding and electronic structure enable a new framework for understanding and developing skyrmions under desired conditions that would otherwise be impossible.</description>

      <title>A Riemann-Hilbert Approach to Slavnov Overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19025v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a method to compute Slavnov overlaps in the Lieb-Liniger model using the steepest descent method of the Riemann-Hilbert problem. To do so, we employ the Matsuo-Kostov Representation of the Slavnov overlaps to write an integral equation for the respective resolvent, and then represent this equation as a Riemann-Hilbert problem. We demonstrate the validity and applicability of the method by computing the Anderson orthogonality catastrophe in the $c\to\infty$ limit, corresponding to free fermions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement across scales: Quantics tensor trains as a natural framework for renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding entanglement remains one of the most intriguing problems in physics. While particle and site entanglement have been studied extensively, the investigation of length or energy scale entanglement, quantifying the information exchange between different length scales, has received far less attention. Here, we identify the quantics tensor train (QTT) technique, a matrix product state-inspired approach for overcoming computational bottlenecks in resource-intensive numerical calculations, as a renormalization group method by analytically expressing an exact cyclic reduction-based real-space renormalization scheme in QTT language, which serves as a natural formalism for the method. In doing so, we precisely match the QTT bond dimension, a measure of length scale entanglement, to the number of rescaled couplings generated in each coarse-graining renormalization step. While QTTs have so far been applied almost exclusively to numerical problems in physics, our analytical calculations demonstrate that they are also powerful tools for mitigating computational costs in semi-analytical treatments. We present our results for the one-dimensional tight-binding model with n-th-nearest-neighbor hopping, where the 2n rescaled couplings generated in the renormalization procedure precisely match the QTT bond dimension of the one-particle Green's function.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the collinear plateau phase by thermal fluctuations in the disordered triangular lattice antiferromagnet Rb$_{(1-x)}$K$_{x}$Fe(MoO$_4$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The triangular lattice antiferromagnet RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ orders antiferromagnetically in a planar 120$^\circ$-structure below $T_\textrm{N}\approx 4$ K. A striking feature of RbFe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ magnetic phase diagram is the presence of collinear ``1/3-plateau'' magnetic phase, which is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations at magnetization $M\approx \frac{1}{3} M_\textrm{sat}$. Static disorder caused by impurities is predicted to act against the effect of fluctuations and to suppress collinear plateau phase (Maryasin and Zhitomirsky, PRL 111, 247201 (2013)). Balance between ``dynamic'' thermal and quantum fluctuations and ``static'' impurity-induced disorder is temperature-sensitive, which allows thermal fluctuations to take over the effect of static disorder and leads to the revival of the fluctuation-stabilized ``1/3-plateau'' phase on heating. Here we present experimental results directly confirming this prediction and demonstrating re-establishment of the plateau-like phase in the diluted Rb$_{(1-x)}$K$_{x}$Fe(MoO$_4$)$_2$ sample at moderate dilution level $x=15$\% on heating as the effect of thermal fluctuations increases.</description>

      <title>Incommensurate magnetic order arising from frustrated interchain interactions in the spin-1/2 chain compound AgCuVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin chains with competing interactions offer a platform where low dimensionality and frustration--both acting to suppress magnetic order--intersect. We studied magnetic ordering in the spin-1/2 chain compound AgCuVO$_4$ using muon spin spectroscopy and neutron diffraction. Long-range magnetic order emerges at $T_N = 2.0(1)$ K, which is $\sim$1/200 of the dominant intrachain coupling $J$ and $\sim$1/15 of the interchain interactions. The collinear incommensurate amplitude-modulated magnetic structure features a reduced ordered moment of 0.13(2) $\mu_\mathrm{B}$, confined to the $ab$ plane and modulated along the $c$ axis--perpendicular to the spin chains--indicating frustrated interchain couplings. The low $T_N$, small moment, and incommensurate order highlight strong frustration, positioning AgCuVO$_4$ as a model system for exploring frustration in quantum spin chains.</description>

      <title>From weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the frustrated quantum spin-Peierls chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractionalized quasiparticles and their confinement into emergent bound states lie at the heart of modern quantum magnetism. While the evolution into magnonic bound states has been well characterized, experimental insight into the analogous transition to triplons remains limited. Here, using high-resolution neutron spectroscopy and state-of-the-art spin dynamics simulations, we uncover the transformation from weakly interacting spinons to tightly bound triplons in the spin-Peierls compound CuGeO3. Quantitative comparisons between the measured spectra and tensor network simulations reveal substantial next-nearest-neighbor frustration and weak external dimerization, placing the system deep within the spontaneously dimerized regime and near the exactly solvable Majumdar-Ghosh point. We further show an energy- and temperature-dependent evolution between two contrasting quasiparticle regimes: deconfined spinons with markedly suppressed interactions by frustration, and coherent triplonic bound states with no observable spinon degrees of freedom. Remarkably, triplon character persists into the two-particle regime, forming a structured two-triplon continuum with a spectral feature associated with a van Hove singularity at its lower boundary. These findings challenge the conventional view that robust triplons require strong external dimerization and demonstrate how the interplay between frustration and dimerization can reshape fractionalization and confinement.</description>

      <title>Interplay of non-Hermitian skin effect and electronic correlations in the non-Hermitian Hubbard model via Real-space dynamical mean field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, characterized by their ability to model open systems with gain and loss, have unveiled striking phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), where eigenstates localize at boundaries under open boundary conditions. While extensively studied in non-interacting systems, the interplay between NHSE and strong electron correlations remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the non-Hermitian Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping, employing real-space dynamical mean-field theory (R-DMFT), a novel extension to such non-Hermitian correlated models-to capture both local correlations and spatial inhomogeneities. By analyzing the end-to-end Green's function as probes of directional amplification, we demonstrate that strong correlations can suppress the skin effect, leading to a crossover from boundary-dominated to correlation-driven dynamics. Our systematic study reveals that correlations dominate at small to intermediate strength of asymmetric hopping, inducing exponential decay in the end-to-end Green's function, but higher strength of asymmetric hopping can restore amplification even at strong interaction. These results illuminate the tunable interplay between correlations and non-Hermitian physics, suggesting avenues for engineering non-reciprocal transport in correlated open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Fingerprint of Chiral Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors have long been theorized to break time-reversal symmetry and support exotic topological features such as Majorana modes and spontaneous edge currents, promising ingredients for quantum technologies. Although several unconventional superconductors may exhibit time-reversal symmetry breaking, clear microscopic evidence of chiral pairing has remained out of reach. In this work, we demonstrate direct real-space signatures of chiral superconductivity in a single atomic layer of tin on Si(111). Using quasiparticle interference imaging, we detected symmetry-locked nodal and antinodal points in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle wavefunction, tightly bound to atomic point defects in the tin lattice. These nodal features, along with their surrounding texture, form a distinct real-space pattern exhibiting a clear and exclusive hallmark of chiral superconductivity. Our findings, reinforced by analytical theory and numerical simulations, offer unambiguous evidence of chiral pairing in a two-dimensional material.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Neural Quantum States: A Recurrent Neural Network Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) are powerful neural-network ans\"atzes that have emerged as promising tools for studying quantum many-body physics through the lens of the variational principle. These architectures are known to be systematically improvable by increasing the number of parameters. Here we demonstrate an Adaptive scheme to optimize NQSs, through the example of recurrent neural networks (RNN), using a fraction of the computation cost while reducing training fluctuations and improving the quality of variational calculations targeting ground states of prototypical models in one- and two-spatial dimensions. This Adaptive technique reduces the computational cost through training small RNNs and reusing them to initialize larger RNNs. This work opens up the possibility for optimizing graphical processing unit (GPU) resources deployed in large-scale NQS simulations.</description>

Abstract: Using a 1D bilayer system comprised of pairing and metallic layers, the present work proves the striking power of reservoir-mediated boosting of superconductivity. Employing many-body numerics on large systems at zero and finite temperature, we unravel the complex processes by which the tuning of the metal parameters can impact the effective pairing strength as well as the long-range pair-pair-coupling mediated by the metal. It is these two processes that in turn can strongly enhance superconducting susceptibility and thermal superconducting correlation length over those of the isolated system. We show that in this way, even a 1D system can come very close to achieving superconducting long-range order.</description>

      <title>Propagating Neutral Modes in an Intervalley Coherent State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of neutral collective modes is a hallmark of correlated quantum phases but is often challenging to probe experimentally. In two-dimensional flatband systems, charge responses have been intensively investigated, yet neutral excitations remain largely unexplored. In particular, intervalley coherent state (IVC) features a neutral Goldstone mode due to spontaneously broken valley U(1) symmetry. While IVC state has been proposed as a unifying theme across graphene- and semiconductor-based systems, its defining feature - the neutral Goldstone mode - remains elusive in experiment. Here we investigate space-and-time-resolved transport of neutral modes in twisted WSe2 moir\'e superlattices through a novel ultrafast imaging technique. We uncover two new propagating collective modes with very different velocities, which emerge near the van Hove singularity (VHS) in both intermediate- (3.5~4 degree) and large-angle (~5 degree) twisted WSe2. The fast-propagating mode has a surprisingly large speed of ~3 km/s and is consistent with a Goldstone mode for an IVC state, while the slow-moving mode is likely a gapped amplitude mode. They can be understood as the spin-valley analogues of collective modes of a superfluid, whose propagation are imaged for the first time in a condensed matter system. Our study sets a new paradigm for probing charge-neutral modes in quantum materials and offers key insights into the interplay between charge and spin-valley physics in moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric coupling and its impact on the multicaloric effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multicaloric effect, which represents the reversible entropy change that occurs when both external magnetic and electric fields are applied, is an interesting phenomenon characteristic to multiferroics. Targeting the multicaloric effect in the typical multiferroic (Fe$_{0.95}$Zn$_{0.05}$)$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$, we experimentally evaluate the isothermal entropy change due to a magnetoelectric cross-correlation. A pronounced cross-correlation-derived isothermal entropy change is found at the magnetic ordering temperature. By exploring the literature, we suggest that a magnetic phase transition may tend to involve a considerably larger cross-correlation-derived entropy change than that derived from the linear magnetoelectric effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a powerful and flexible framework for addressing quantum many-body problems. While successful for model Hamiltonians, their application to molecular systems remains challenging for several reasons. In this work, we introduce three innovations to overcome some of the key limitations. (1) We propose two novel ans\"atzet hat hybridize tensor network and neural network states for addressing initialization challenges and enhancing the expressivity of tensor networks. First, we develop a bounded-degree graph recurrent neural network (BDG-RNN) ansatz that leverages graph-based updates, enabling applications to molecular electronic structure problems. Second, we introduce restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) inspired correlators to further enhance expressivity and improve accuracy, without dramatically modifying the underlying variational Monte Carlo (VMC) optimization framework. (2) We introduce a semi-stochastic algorithm for local energy evaluation, which significantly reduces computational cost while maintaining high accuracy. Combining these advances, we demonstrate that our approaches can achieve chemical accuracy in challenging systems, including the one-dimensional hydrogen chain H50, the iron-sulfur cluster [Fe2S2(SCH3)4]^{2-}, and a three-dimensional $3 \times 3 \times 2$ hydrogen cluster H18. These methods are implemented in an open-source package - PyNQS (https://github.com/Quantum-Chemistry-Group-BNU/PyNQS) to advance NQS methodologies for quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Giant plateau-like topological Hall effect controlled by tailoring the magnetic exchange stiffness in a kagome magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6 has attracted vast attention, because its pristine Mn kagome lattice with strong spin-orbit coupling and out-of-plane Tb-Mn exchange supports quantum-limit Chern topological magnetism which can be described by the simple spinless Haldane model. We unveil herein that engineering the kagome lattice through partial substitution of Mn with nonmagnetic Cr induces a striking structural reorganization-Cr preferentially concentrates within a single Mn layer per unit cell, reducing the crystal symmetry from the D6h point group to the C2. This tailored structure configuration gives rise to a plateau-like topological Hall effect (THE), achieving a record-breaking resistivity of 19.1 ohm cm among bulk systems. Complementary magnetic force microscopy measurements unveil a magnetic domain transition near 1 T at 180 K, aligning with the field-dependent phase diagram of the THE. Our direct visualization of the magnetic domain structure underscores the critical role of broken kagome lattice symmetry in generating distinct exchange stiffness between the two Mn layers. These findings establish a new paradigm for exploring exotic states in kagome topological magnets and provide a proof-of-principle strategy for unraveling the interplay between magnetism and emergent topological properties in kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Field-induced magnon decays in dipolar quantum magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous disintegration of magnons in two-dimensional ferromagnets and antiferromagnets dominated by long-range dipolar interactions. Analyzing kinematic constraints, we show that the unusual dispersion of dipolar ferromagnets in a uniform magnetic field precludes magnon-decay at all fields, in sharp contrast to short-range exchange-driven magnets. However, in a staggered magnetic field, magnons can decay in both dipolar ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. Remarkably, such decays do not require a minimum threshold field, and happen over a nearly fixed fraction of the Brillouin Zone in the XY limit, highlighting the significant role played by dipolar interactions. In addition, topological transitions in the decay surfaces lead to singularities in the magnon spectrum. Regularizing such singular behavior via a self-consistent approach, we make predictions for dynamical spin correlations accessible to near-term quantum simulators and sensors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Ni-N-Ni Centers in N-substituted NiO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19250v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explore how anion substitution modifies the existing magnetism in strongly correlated oxides, we investigate local electronic states and magnetic ordering in nickel oxide (NiO) induced by substituting oxygen (O) with nitrogen (N). Each N introduces an additional N 2p hole and modifies the magnetic moment of a neighboring nickel (Ni) cation site, as the exchange interaction between this hole and the Ni eg electrons exceeds the Ni-O-Ni superexchange interaction. This leads to the formation of Ni-N-Ni centers consisting of five spins, without perturbing the antiferromagnetic NiO lattice. These centers are studied using density functional theory and confirmed through high-resolution spectroscopy on N-substituted NiO thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. This type of magnetic design may enable future advances in quantum technologies based on strongly correlated materials, such as quantum sensors and spin-based qubits.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origin of Reduced Magnetic Order in a Frustrated Metal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08523v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although magnetic frustration in metals provides a promising avenue for novel quantum phenomena, their microscopic interpretation is often challenging. Here we use the face-centered cubic intermetallic HoInCu$_4$ as model material to show that Hamiltonians neglecting the charge degree of freedom are appropriate for frustrated metals possessing low density of states at the Fermi surface. Through neutron scattering techniques we determine matching magnetic exchange interactions in the paramagnetic and field-polarized states using an effective spin-1 Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we identify antiferromagnetic nearest and next-nearest neighbour interactions $J_1$ and $J_2$ that are close to the critical ratio $J_2$/$J_1$ = 1/2. The study further provides evidence that spin-wave theory fails to predict the low-energy spin dynamics in the antiferromagnetic zero-field state, which is dominated by overdamped magnetic excitations. We conclude that the low-energy fluctuations arise from quantum fluctuations, accounting for the missing moment of the strongly renormalized magnetic long-range order.</description>

Abstract: Frustrated magnetism in face-centred cubic (fcc) magnetic sublattices remains underexplored but holds considerable potential for exotic magnetic behaviour. Here we report on the crystal structure, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the $A$-site-vacant double hydroxide perovskite MnSn(OH)$_6$. Despite dominant antiferromagnetic interactions among Mn$^{2+}$ moments, evidenced by a negative Curie-Weiss temperature, the lack of a sharp thermodynamic transition down to 350$\,$mK implies the absence of long-range magnetic order. However, a broad hump in the specific heat at 1.6$\,$K suggests short-range correlations. Neutron diffraction at low temperatures confirms the presence of three-dimensional antiferromagnetic correlations, manifested as diffuse magnetic scattering with a correlation length $\xi = 24.66\,${\AA} and magnetic propagation vectors $\mathbf{k}=(\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2})$ and $(0\,0.625\,0)$ at 20$\,$mK.</description>

      <title>Most two-dimensional bosonic topological orders forbid sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo: Nonpositive Gauss sum as an indicator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo is a powerful tool for studying quantum many-body physics, yet its efficacy is often curtailed by the notorious sign problem. In this Letter, we introduce a novel criterion for the "intrinsic" sign problem in two-dimensional bosonic topological orders, which cannot be resolved by local basis transformations or adiabatic deformations of the Hamiltonian. Specifically, we find that the positivity of higher Gauss sums is a necessary condition for a two-dimensional bosonic topological order to be realized by a stoquastic Hamiltonian, and hence sign-problem-free. Equivalently, a nonpositive higher Gauss sum for a given topological order indicates the presence of an intrinsic sign problem. This condition not only aligns with prior findings but significantly broadens their scope. Using this new criterion, we examine the Gauss sums of all 405 bosonic topological orders classified up to rank 12, and strikingly find that 398 of them exhibit intrinsic sign problems. We also uncover intriguing links between the intrinsic sign problem, gappability of boundary theories, and time-reversal symmetry, suggesting that sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo may fundamentally rely on both time-reversal symmetry and gapped boundaries. These results highlight the deep connection between the intrinsic sign problem and fundamental properties of topological phases, offering valuable insights into their classical simulability.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and the anti-flatness of the entanglement spectrum after a quantum quench in a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.</description>

      <title>The moments of the spectral form factor in SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems the spectral form factor exhibits a universal linear ramp and plateau structure with superimposed erratic oscillations. The mean signal and the statistics of the noise can be probed by the moments of the spectral form factor, also known as higher-point spectral form factors. We identify saddle points in the SYK model that describe the moments during the ramp region. Perturbative corrections around the saddle point indicate that SYK mimics random matrix statistics for the low order moments, while large deviations for the high order moments arise from fluctuations near the edge of the spectrum. The leading correction scales inversely with the number of random parameters in the SYK Hamiltonian and is amplified in a sparsified version of the SYK model, which we study numerically, even in regimes where a linear ramp persists. Finally, we study the $q=2$ SYK model, whose spectral form factor exhibits an exponential ramp with increased noise. These findings reveal how deviations from random matrix universality arise in disordered systems and motivate their interpretation from a bulk gravitational perspective.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14315v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability and non-integrability of isotropic spin chains with nearest-neighbor interaction with general spin $S$ in terms of the presence or absence of local conserved quantities. We prove a dichotomy theorem that whether a single quantity is zero or not sharply separates two scenarios: (i) this system has $k$-local conserved quantities for all $k$ (completely integrable), or (ii) this system has no nontrivial local conserved quantity (non-integrable). This result excludes the possibility of an intermediate system with some but not all local conserved quantities, which solves in the affirmative the Grabowski-Mathieu conjecture. This theorem also serves as a complete classification of integrability and non-integrability for $S\leq 13.5$, suggesting that all the integrable models are in the scope of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11964v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing cooling protocols is believed to require knowledge of the system spectrum. In contrast, cooling in nature occurs whenever the system is coupled to a cold bath. How does nature know how to cool? A natural cold bath can be mimicked with a reservoir of "meter" qubits that are initialized in their ground state. We show that a quantum system can be cooled without knowledge of system details when system-meter interactions and meter splittings are chosen randomly. For sufficiently small interaction strengths and long interaction times, the protocol ensures that resonant energy-exchange processes, leading to cooling, dominate over heating. Effectively, the dynamics is then captured by the rotating-wave approximation, which we identify as the basic mechanism for robust and scalable cooling of complex quantum systems through generic, structure-independent protocols. This offers a versatile universal framework for controlling quantum matter far from equilibrium, in particular, for quantum computing and simulation.</description>
