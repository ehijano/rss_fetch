      <title>A theory of state-to-state transitions based on the framework of classical reaction dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to describe the population dynamics of distinct configurational states based on a continuous-time description of state-to-state transitions. According to classical reaction dynamics theory, the probability density associated with a given state obeys the Liouville equation, the probability density associate d with a given state obeys the Li ouville equation, including influx from and efflux to neighboring states. By introducing a Markov approximation for the crossing of boundaries separating the states, tractable integral equations governing the state populations are derived. Once the time-dependent quantities appearing in these equations are evaluated, the population dynamics on long timescales can be obtained. Because these quantities depend only on a few states in the local neighborhood of a given state, they can be computed using a set of short-timescale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We apply the present method to the binding and unbinding kinetics of CH$_4$/CH$_4$, Na$^+$/Cl$^-$, and 18-crown-6-ether (crown ether)/K$^+$ in water. For both kinetics, the time constants estimated from the present method are almost comparable to those obtained from brute-force MD simulations. The required timescale of each MD trajectory in the present method is approximately two orders of magnitude shorter than that in the brute-force MD approach in the crown ether/K$^+$ system. This reduction in the trajectory timescale enables applications to
  complex binding and unbinding sy stems whose characteristic timescales a re far beyond those directly acce ssible by brute-force MD simulati ons.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect with dielectric matter in salted water and implications at the cell scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casimir interaction in salted water contains a universal contribution of electromagnetic fluctuations that makes it of a longer range than previously thought. The universal contribution dominates non universal ones at the distances relevant for actin fibers inside the cell. We discuss universal and non-universal contributions with a model mimicking biological matter. We also show that the universal Casimir effect should have important implications at the cell scale.</description>

      <title>Molecular-based coordination polymer as reversible and precise acetonitrile electro-optical readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient detection of harmful organic volatile compounds is a major health and environmental need in industrialized societies. Tailor-made metal-organic frameworks and other coordination polymers are emerging as promising sensing molecular materials thanks to their responsivity to a wide variety of external stimuli, and could be used to complement conventional sensors. Here, a non-porous crystalline 1D Fe(II) coordination polymer acting as a porous acetonitrile host is presented. The desorption of interstitial acetonitrile is accompanied by magneto-structural transitions easily detectable in the optical and electronic properties of the material. The structural switch and therefore its (opto)electronic readout are reversible under exposition of the crystal to acetonitrile vapor. Coordination polymers can be versatile sensors for volatile acetonitrile and potentially other organic compounds.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Dye-Sensitized Solar Cells: An economical Strategy for Prototypical Organic Dyes with Tailored Frontier Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strategic incorporation of heteroatoms (N, O, and B) into organic dyes is a versatile and effective approach to enhance molecular properties. This approach is highly attractive for tailoring organic solar cells, as it allows for precise control over the HOMO and LUMO energy levels, enabling the design and customization of organic molecules with desired optical and electronic properties. In this work, we aim to contribute to this pursuit by exploring novel charge transfer materials with Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT), specifically using the Tamm-Dancoff Approximation (TDA). This study evaluates two distinct parameter-tuning strategies for the range-separated hybrid (RSH) functional. The first uses a simplified scheme $\omega_{eff}$, while the second implements a more intricate protocol $\omega_{IP}$ designed to reproduce the exact ionization potential. The accuracy of the effective-tuning ($\omega_{eff}$) method was tested against experimental values of ionization potentials for BN-doped organic molecules. A comparative analysis of our data reveals that the accuracy of the ($\omega_{eff}$) approach is superior to that of the more complicated ($\omega_{IP}$) method and comparable to wave function theory (WFT).</description>

      <title>Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency-generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions of higher-order multipole contributions. Magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by bulk properties but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework to predict the full set of multipole spectral contributions. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise spatial localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Higher-order multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole contributions have similar intensities, while the electric quadrupole contribution is significantly larger. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be in large part responsible for the characteristic shoulder at 3600/cm. Crucially, subtracting the quadrupole and magnetic contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial molecular orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.</description>

      <title>Consistent Sampling and Simulation: Molecular Dynamics with Energy-Based Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models trained on equilibrium molecular distributions have proven effective for sampling biomolecules. Beyond direct sampling, the score of such a model can also be used to derive the forces that act on molecular systems. However, while classical diffusion sampling usually recovers the training distribution, the corresponding energy-based interpretation of the learned score is often inconsistent with this distribution, even for low-dimensional toy systems. We trace this inconsistency to inaccuracies of the learned score at very small diffusion timesteps, where the model must capture the correct evolution of the data distribution. In this regime, diffusion models fail to satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation, which governs the evolution of the score. We interpret this deviation as one source of the observed inconsistencies and propose an energy-based diffusion model with a Fokker-Planck-derived regularization term to enforce consistency. We demonstrate our approach by sampling and simulating multiple biomolecular systems, including fast-folding proteins, and by introducing a state-of-the-art transferable Boltzmann emulator for dipeptides that supports simulation and achieves improved consistency and efficient sampling. Our code, model weights, and self-contained JAX and PyTorch notebooks are available at https://github.com/noegroup/ScoreMD.</description>

      <title>Investigating Anharmonicities in Polarization-Orientation Raman Spectra of Acene Crystals with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles machine-learning computational framework to investigate anharmonic effects in polarization-orientation (PO) Raman spectra of molecular crystals, focusing on anthracene and naphthalene. By combining machine learning models for interatomic potentials and polarizability tensors, we enable efficient, large-scale simulations that capture temperature-dependent vibrational dynamics beyond the harmonic approximation. Our approach reproduces key qualitative features observed experimentally. We show, systematically, what are the fingerprints of anharmonic lattice dynamics, thermal expansion, and Raman tensor symmetries on PO-Raman intensities. However, we find that the simulated polarization dependence of Raman intensities shows only subtle deviations from quasi-harmonic predictions, failing to capture the pronounced temperature-dependent changes that have been reported experimentally in anthracene. We propose that part of these inconsistencies stem from the impossibility to deconvolute certain vibrational peaks when only experimental data is available. This work therefore provides a foundation to improve the interpretation of PO-Raman experiments in complex molecular crystals with the aid of theoretical simulations.</description>
