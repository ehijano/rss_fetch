      <title>Branes and Antibranes in AdS$_3$: The Impossible States in the CFT Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new family of type IIB supergravity solutions corresponding to states of the D1-D5-P-KKm system that carry the same charges and energy as the non-extremal four-charge black hole and are asymptotic to AdS$_3 \times ($S$^3/\mathbb{Z}_{N_k}) \times$ T$^4$. The solutions consist of static binaries of two extremal D1-D5-P black holes with S$^3$ horizons and charges of opposite signs, held in equilibrium by a topological bubble supporting $N_k$ units of KKm charge. Although dynamically unstable, the spacetimes remain smooth on and outside the horizons. The equilibrium condition discretizes the black hole separation, producing a quantized spectrum labeled by the number of antibranes and antimomenta at the anti-BPS center. Strikingly, the lowest-energy states lie within an energy window smaller than the dual CFT mass gap. We also show that these solutions admit regular finite-temperature deformations, which slightly lift the two black holes above extremality while remaining within the gap. These results challenge the expectation that no states exist within the CFT gap, realizing Impossible States. We discuss two possible resolutions. First, higher-genus corrections to the two-dimensional effective super-JT theory may allow a sparse spectrum of exponentially suppressed states within the gap. Alternatively, quantum corrections could lift these solutions above the gap.</description>

      <title>The String Theory Photoverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String theory compactifications come with numerous $U(1)$ factors, implying the presence of many hidden photons in the low-energy EFT. One may call this the ``string photoverse''. We argue that, generically, these hidden photons are massless and do not couple to any light dark current such that, naively, kinetic mixing with the Standard Model is unobservable. The leading interactions of these ``superhidden'' photons are then dimension-6 dipole operators which couple them to quarks or leptons and the Higgs field. This induces magnetic and electric dipole moments with respect to both the superhidden photons as well as, through kinetic mixing, to the Standard Model photon. We derive these couplings by dimensionally reducing the fermionic action of 7-branes realizing the Standard Model: In the first step to 6d theories on intersection curves and then, in the presence of fluxes, to our 4d chiral EFT. We analyze how experiments and observations can employ this effect to place lower bounds on the string scale, which is relevant for compactifications with very large volumes. Finally, we briefly discuss how supersymmetry implies the presence of relatively light photinos and hence an accompanying ``photinoverse'', which may be observed via renormalizable mixing effects.</description>

      <title>Axion-Scalar Systems and Dynamical Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmology of axion-scalar pairs, coupled by a hyperbolic field-space metric and with a string-motivated rational scalar potential. Borrowing tools from the theory of dynamical systems, we are able to classify all late-time trajectories and extract physical properties of the asymptotic solutions. These results suggest a Dynamical Distance Conjecture: along the physical (possibly non-geodesic) trajectories, towers of states become exponentially light as a function of the traversed field-space distance. We further rule out possible counterexamples with wildly oscillating solutions. The considered axion-scalar systems are realized in F-theory compactifications, where the axion-scalar pair is a complex-structure modulus and four-form fluxes induce the asymptotic potentials. We also provide a complete Hodge-theoretic classification of all one-modulus asymptotic potentials of this type.</description>

      <title>Chiral Quartic Massive Gravity in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study minimal massive gravity with cubic and quartic terms in Compere, Song, and Strominger (CSS) boundary conditions. By employing a semi-product of a Virasoro and a $U(1)$ Kac-Moody current algebra as the asymptotic symmetry algebra, we calculate the entropy of BTZ black holes via the degeneracy of states belonging to a Warped-CFT. Then, we compute the linearized energy excitations using the representations of the algebra $U(1)\times SL(2, R)_{R}$ and demonstrate that the energies of excitations are non-negative at two chiral points in the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Corrections to Thermodynamics of Accelerating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As pointed out in recent research, the near extremal black hole entropy with one-loop effect exhibits universal $\log T$ behaviour at sufficiently low temperature. In this paper, we discuss the low temperature quantum corrections to the thermodynamics of four dimensional accelerating black holes with rotation and charges by using the method of Euclidean path integral. The one-loop path integral for the black hole thermal partition function near extremality is dominated by zero modes defined with respect to the extremal background. For the accelerating black holes without rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a direct product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ with warping factors, and the gravitational zero modes contain both tensor and vector types, with the respective contributions to the near extremal black hole entropy being $(3/2)\log T$ and $(1/2)\log T$. While in the presence of rotation, the near horizon extremal geometry is a twist product of AdS$_2$ and S$^2$ and the gravitational vector modes are absent. For the accelerating black holes with charges, we also consider the one-loop path integral of the gauge field, where the photon zero modes are found to contribute an additional $(1/2)\log T$ term to the near extremal black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Four-charge static non-extremal black holes in the five-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$, $STU-W^2U$ supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct, for the first time, new static non-extremal five-dimensional black hole solutions (without or with squashed horizons) endowing with four different electric charge parameters in the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to \emph{three} vector multiplets with a specific pre-potential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$. When the fourth charge parameter disappears, the solution simplify reduces to the three-charge static black hole solution previously presented in ref. [1], which belongs to the solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to \emph{two} vector multiplets (also notably known as the $STU$ model). We parameterize the model in such a simple fashion that not only can one easily recover the static three-charge solution but also it is very convenient to study their thermodynamical properties of the obtained black hole solutions in the case without a squashing horizon. We then show that the thermodynamical quantities perfectly obey both the differential first law and integral Smarr formula of thermodynamics. Finally, we also extend to present its generalizations with squashed horizons or including a nonzero cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Holographic Schwinger effect with Translational Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of disorder on the Schwinger effect at finite chemical potential has been studied from holography. The gravitational background with translational symmetry breaking, characterized by two parameters: the disorder strength \(\alpha\) and the chemical potential \(\mu\). By employing the potential analysis method, we derive the total potential that governs the pair creation process and examine its dependence on \(\alpha\), \(\mu\), and the the external electric field to its critical value ratio. We analyze the system both in the absence and in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our results show that increasing the chemical potential \(\mu\) lowers the potential barrier, thereby enhancing vacuum instability and facilitating pair production, while the disorder parameter \(\alpha\) acts oppositely, suppressing the Schwinger effect by strengthening the barrier. Furthermore, we find that an external magnetic field plays a role similar to the chemical potential by reducing the barrier height and promoting pair creation, even in the subcritical regime. The combined analysis highlights the competing influences of \(\mu\) and \(\alpha\), and the amplifying effect of the magnetic field, on the non-perturbative pair production mechanism in holographic setups with broken translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>On the Imaginary Part of the Effective Action in de Sitter Spacetime with Different Regularization Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13712v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The imaginary part of the effective action encodes vacuum instability and particle production in the background field. Two standard approaches are commonly used to derive it: the Bogoliubov method and the Green's function method, which are usually expected to agree. However, in de Sitter spacetime they yield different results. We revisit this problem by introducing explicit time and momentum cutoffs in the Green's function representation of the effective action. The apparent discrepancy is found to be due to the different limiting procedures in regularization, which reproduces the Bogoliubov result and the Green's function result respectively. Therefore, the two approaches are understood to be different regularization limits of the same expression, which clarifies the origin of their disagreement.</description>

      <title>Hadronic vacuum polarization to three loops in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic vacuum polarization at low virtualities limits the precision of experimental tests of the standard model via important physical observables. Here we compute that effect in two-flavor chiral perturbation theory to three loops. Among the master integrals that describe the amplitude, six are elliptic functions of the momentum. Of these five are new to this work, although all can be related to the three-loop sunset integral. The renormalizability of the amplitude hinges on relations between the master integrals that were not previously known and that are not consequences of the integration-by-parts reduction. Our result is intended to serve as a starting point for phenomenological calculations, as well as the computation of finite-volume corrections in lattice QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13007v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moduli spaces of instantons on ALE spaces for classical groups are examples of fixed point sets of involutions on quiver varieties, i.e., $\sigma$-quiver varieties. In 2018 Yiqiang Li considered their equivariant cohomology, and by stable envelope of Maulik-Okounkov, constructed representations of coideal subalgebras of Maulik-Okounkov Yangian, called twisted Yangian. We calculate $K$-matrices as matrices in examples, identified the twisted Yangians with ones studied in other literature, and clarify conditions which we should impose to make them well-defined.</description>

      <title>A short review on QCD sum rule studies of P-wave single heavy baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few decades, the study of singly heavy baryons has entered a golden era, with numerous excited states observed by experimental collaborations. Various theoretical approaches have been developed to investigate their properties, with the QCD sum rule method being one of the most widely applied. This paper provides a review of these QCD sum rule studies. Over the last ten years, we have systematically studied $P$-wave singly heavy baryons using QCD sum rules and light-cone sum rules within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. These $P$-wave singly heavy baryons can explain many excited heavy baryons, including the $\Lambda_c(2595)^+$, $\Lambda_c(2625)^+$, $\Xi_c(2790)^{0/+}$, $\Xi_c(2815)^{0/+}$, $\Sigma_c(2800)^0$, $\Xi_c(2882)^0$, $\Xi_c(2923)^0$, $\Xi_c(2939)^0$, $\Xi_c(2965)^0$, $\Omega_c(3000)^0$, $\Omega_c(3066)^0$, $\Omega_c(3090)^0$, $\Omega_c(3050)^0$, $\Omega_c(3119)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5912)^0$, $\Lambda_b(5920)^0$, $\Xi_b(6087)^0$, $\Xi_b(6095)^0/\Xi_b(6100)^-$, $\Sigma_b(6097)^\pm$, $\Xi_b(6227)^-$, $\Omega_b(6316)^-$, $\Omega_b(6330)^-$, $\Omega_b(6340)^-$, and $\Omega_b(6350)^-$, etc. Furthermore, we predict additional $P$-wave singly heavy baryons, including two $\Lambda_b$ states, two $\Xi_b$ states, three $\Sigma_b$ states, three $\Xi_b^\prime$ states, two $\Omega_b$ states, two $\Lambda_c$ states, two $\Xi_c$ states, three $\Sigma_c$ states, and one $\Omega_c$ state, all with relatively narrow decay widths, making them viable candidates for experimental observation. The study of singly heavy baryons is closely related to two meaningful questions:"What is the shortest possible lifetime of an observable particle?" and "How can one generally describe approximate (flavor) symmetries?".</description>

      <title>Bumblebee Gravity - Lessons from Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These proceedings summarize some recent efforts in understanding a class of vector-tensor theories known as {\it bumblebee} models, which spontaneously break local Lorentz and diffeomorphism invariance. Using cosmological perturbation theory on an exact dS background, we find that for non-minimal coupling to gravity, the theory contains a ghost mode unless a degeneracy condition is imposed, after which the model becomes a subset of generalized Proca theory. We go further to show that scalar perturbations become strongly coupled in the minimal-coupling limit, which shows the necessity of the non-minimal coupling. Moreover, we find a constraint on the bumblebee field from the speed of tensor modes on the order of $10^{-15}$.</description>

      <title>Singularity avoidance in black hole interiors by quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum nature of the Schwarzschild black hole interior is investigated through the Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) equation. The interior of a static, spherically symmetric black hole is described by the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) metric, which represents a homogeneous but anisotropic cosmology. We derive the Hamiltonian for the gravitational system corresponding to the black hole interior and obtain the associated WDW equation. By varying the gravitational constant as a parameter controlling quantum effects, we examine how the solutions of the WDW equation change with respect to this parameter. In the parameter regime where quantum effects are negligible, we find that the wave packet solutions closely follow the classical trajectory of the black hole interior. On the other hand, as quantum effects are enhanced, the wave packet deviates from the classical trajectory and exhibits behavior suggestive of singularity avoidance. To quantify this behavior, we introduce an appropriate "clock" inside the black hole and compute the time to singularity formation with respect to this clock. The results show that stronger quantum effects lead to a longer formation time, suggesting a tendency toward the avoidance of singularity formation due to quantum gravity effects.</description>

      <title>Probing thermodynamic phase transitions by dynamics of timelike particle around a magnetic AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phase structure of a nonminimal coupled magnetic AdS black hole by connecting its thermodynamic properties with the dynamical behavior of orbiting particles, within the framework of Lyapunov exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation. The analysis of the free energy as a function of the Hawking temperature reveals a Van der Waals-like phase transition, characterized by the coexistence of small, intermediate, and large black hole phases. By examining timelike geodesics corresponding to unstable circular orbits, we evaluate the Lyapunov exponent of the test particles crossing the phase transition and explore its role as dynamical indicator of stability. Furthermore, by perturbing the unstable circular orbit and employing the relativistic precession model, we explore the associated upper and lower quasi-periodic oscillation frequencies. Our findings show that the occurrence of thermodynamic phase transitions induces marked changes in both Lyapunov exponent and quasi-periodic oscillation spectra, indicating that these dynamical quantities can serve as sensitive probes of the underlying thermodynamic phase structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Dirac Quasinormal Modes in Noncommutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noncommutative (NC) geometry provides a novel approach to probe quantum gravity effects in black hole spacetimes. This work explores Dirac quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a deformed Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole, where noncommutativity induces an effective metric with an additional ($ r-\varphi$) component. Employing a semiclassical model equivalent to a NC gauge theory, we investigate the dynamics of massless Dirac fields and calculate their QNM frequencies using the continued fraction method, enhanced by Gauss elimination to address the six-term recurrence relations. Our results demonstrate notable shifts in oscillation frequencies and damping rates relative to the commutative Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, exhibiting a distinctive Zeeman-like splitting in the QNM spectrum driven by the NC parameter.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetogenesis in loop quantum cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) are magnetic fields generated during the early universe. These fields are thought to be the seeds of extragalactic magnetic fields. The origin of PMFs is not well known. Further, if they are indeed sources of extragalactic fields, then there is a possibility that observations of extragalactic magnetic fields could provide insights into the primordial physics. With this motivation, we study the generation of the primordial magnetic field in the context of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). In LQC, inflation is preceded by a quantum bounce. In this work, we consider an electromagnetic field coupled to the background as a test field and study its evolution through the bounce and through the subsequent inflationary phase. We investigate the power spectra generated in LQC and show that it is scale-dependent. We study the power spectra with different initial conditions, discuss equivalent forms of coupling functions, investigate backreaction, and compute the amount of primordial magnetic field which can be measured today. We conclude the article with a summary and discussion of the results.</description>

Abstract: The {\it finiteness} of the entanglement entropies between disjoint subsystems enables us to show that, the dynamical equation of the entanglement entropy in CFT$_2$ is precisely three dimensional Einstein's equation. We establish a profound relation between the cosmological constant and CFT$_2$ entanglement entropy. Thus entanglement entropies induce internal gravitational geometries in CFT$_2$. Extracting the dual metric from an entanglement entropy becomes a straightforward procedure. Remarkably, we discover that the renormalization group equation is a geometric identity.</description>

      <title>Notes on conformal integrals: Coulomb branch amplitudes, magic identities and bootstrap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multi-loop conformal integrals for four-point correlators of planar ${\cal N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory, and in particular those contributing to Coulomb branch amplitudes in the ten-dimensional lightlike limit, where linear combinations of such integrals are determined by the large R-charge octagons exactly known from integrability. Exploiting known results for integrands, we review those combinations of dual conformal invariant (DCI) integrals that must evaluate to determinants of ladders, generalizing the simplest cases of Basso-Dixon fishnet integrals; in this way, we summarize all-loop predictions for the integrands (which are extracted from $f$-graphs) contributing to components of Coulomb branch amplitudes, such as next-to-fishnet integrals. Moreover, this exercise produces new ``magic identities", {\it i.e.} certain combinations of DCI integrals equal zero, and we enumerate and simplify such identities up to six loops explicitly.
  On the other hand, most of these individual integrals have not been computed beyond three loops, and as a first step we consider a bootstrap program for DCI integrals based on their leading singularities and the space of pure functions. We bootstrap the $3$ non-trivial DCI integrals for four-loop Coulomb branch amplitudes (providing an independent verification of the four-loop magic identity), which all take remarkably simple form as weight-$8$ single-valued harmonic polylogarithms. We also compute all leading singularities and a large portion of the pure functions for the $34$ DCI integrals contributing to five-loop amplitudes, where not only some integrals evaluate to functions beyond harmonic polylogarithms but they also contain lower-weight pieces individually.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes have historically contributed to much development in understanding fundamental structures in physics. However, the fate of the leading soft singularities of amplitudes in non-trivial background fields has remained largely unknown. In this paper, we derive the leading soft theorems for photons, gluons and gravitons on generic plane wave backgrounds in gauge theory and gravity. The results differ from the flat space results through dependence on the initial conditions of the soft mediator. We also consider the special case of self-dual plane wave backgrounds, and match onto the flat space results when the background is treated perturbatively.</description>

Abstract: We prove a novel action of the (three-dimensional) Heisenberg algebra on the equivariant K-theory of the Hilbert scheme of points on C2. These operators are defined via pushforwards and pullbacks via the Nakajima correspondences while tensoring the square roots of the canonical line bundles of the correspondences. We show, using supersymmetric localisation in 6d (1, 1) Super Yang-Mills compactified on a circle, that these operators correspond to instanton line operators wrapping the extra circle.</description>

      <title>A microscopic Normal Matrix Model for $(A)dS_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the duality between the gravitating $c=1$ (compact) Sine-Gordon model and a normal matrix model. From a two-dimensional quantum gravity perspective and due to the periodic nature of the potential, this model admits both anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter saddles, similarly to simpler models of Sine-Dilaton gravity, as well as more complicated interpolating "wineglass wormhole" geometries. From a string theory perspective the Euclidean de-Sitter (genus zero) saddles are related to the presence of a classical entropic contribution associated to the target space geometry. The gravitating Sine-Gordon model corresponds to a well defined CFT by construction and the eigenvalues of the dual normal matrix model are supported in a compact region of the complex plane. The duality with the normal matrix model is operationally defined even for a finite, but sufficiently large matrix size $N$, depending on the precise observable to be determined. We define and study a "microscopic" version of the large-N limit that allows us to recover non-perturbative results for all physical observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge fields in extra compact dimensions can drive inflation in the four-dimensional (4D) non-compact spacetime, a scenario known as extra-natural inflation. A time-dependent gauge field configuration generates the electric field along the compact dimension, enabling the production of Kaluza-Klein (KK) particles charged under the field via the Schwinger effect. We construct the extra-natural inflation model within a five-dimensional (5D) quantum electrodynamics (QED) framework coupled to gravity including matter fields that generate the inflationary one-loop effective potential. In general, multiple charged fields can exist, and we show that KK particle production occurs under these conditions. Since KK momentum is conserved, the produced KK particles may become superheavy dark matter or dominate the universe, depending on the model parameters. Furthermore, we show that even when the gauge field acts not as the inflaton but as a spectator field, its post-inflationary oscillations, initiated when the Hubble friction becomes negligible, can also generate superheavy KK modes. This suggests that KK particle production is a generic outcome when gauge potentials along compact dimensions are light.</description>

      <title>Limits of Symmetry in Schwarzschild: CKVs and BRST Triviality in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In the first paper in this series, we showed that the infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical spectrum is restricted to global isometries.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation and topological defects for the Chern-Simons matter vector field</title>

      <description>arXiv:hep-th/0610096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of topological defects occurring in vector and tensor fields is an intriguing subject and little explored in the literature. In this article, we analyze the topological defects arising from the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry for a vector matter field with Chern-Simons term in a Minkowski spacetime in $(1+2)D$. As a consequence, the resulting nonlinear equations include a topological mass via the Chern-Simons term, which leads to a vector version of a soliton state. We show that the topological defects arising from the vector field can be categorized as either vortices, with topology $S^{1}\times\mathbb{R}$, or domain-walls, with topology $S^{0} \times\mathbb{R}^2$. The vortex solutions were analyzed using a procedure similar to the Nielsen-Olesen one, though extended to the vector case to account for a spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry. We also analyze the influence of the topological mass and verify the stability of the model as well as the magnetic vortex in $(1+2)D$. We show that domain-wall solutions also emerge as an effect of the violation of the Lorentz symmetry expressed by the vacuum of the vector field. We obtain general equations for this new class of domain walls involving the Lorentz violation parameter and the topological mass. By means of the energy-momentum tensor, we verify the instability of the formation of these domain walls in $(1+2)D$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The black hole information paradox remains a profound challenge in theoretical physics. Among the proposed resolutions, the soft-hair approach stands out for its independence from any specific quantum gravity model. In this paper, we investigate how the inclusion of soft degrees of freedom in the unitary evolution of quantum electrodynamics, within a spacetime collapsing into a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole, leads to information scrambling. By evaluating the tripartite mutual information of this unitary evolution, we estimate the degree of information scrambling in the corresponding quantum channel. Our results show that the presence of soft degrees of freedom induces scrambling of information initially encoded in hard degrees of freedom, driven by quantum electrodynamics interactions and the nontrivial transformations arising from the non-uniqueness of the vacuum in the collapsing spacetime. This lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the black hole information paradox, particularly the mechanisms behind information scrambling.</description>

Abstract: We construct $Spin(7)$-instantons on one of Joyce's compact $Spin(7)$-manifolds. The underlying compact $Spin(7)$-manifold given by Joyce is the same as in Lewis' construction of $Spin(7)$-instantons. However, our construction method and the resulting instantons are new. The compact $Spin(7)$-manifold is constructed by gluing a $Spin(7)$-orbifold and certain local model spaces around the orbifold singularities. We construct our instantons by gluing non-flat connections on the local model spaces to a flat connection on the $Spin(7)$-orbifold. We deliver more than $20,000$ new four-parameter families of examples of $Spin(7)$-instantons within the structure groups $SO(3), SO(4), SO(5), SO(7)$, and $SO(8)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a recent construction using bumpified Haar wavelets to demonstrate explicit violations of the Bell-Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality within the vacuum state in quantum field theory. The construction was tested for massless spinor fields in $(1+1)$-dimensional Minkowski spacetime and is claimed to achieve violations arbitrarily close to an upper bound known as Tsirelson's bound. We show that this claim can be reduced to a mathematical conjecture involving the maximal eigenvalue of a sequence of symmetric matrices composed of integrals of Haar wavelet products. More precisely, the asymptotic eigenvalue of this sequence should approach $\pi$. We present a formal argument using a subclass of wavelets, allowing us to reach $3.11052$. Although a complete proof remains elusive, we present further compelling numerical evidence to support it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>Duality, asymptotic charges and algebraic topology in mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently the duality map between electric-like asymptotic charges of $p$-form gauge theories is studied. The outcome is an existence and uniqueness theorem and the topological nature of the duality map. The goal of this work is to extend that theorem in the case of mixed symmetry tensor gauge theories in order to have a deeper understanding of exotic gauge theories, of the non-trivial charges associated to them and of the duality of their observables. Unlike the simpler case of $p$-form gauge theories, here we need to develop some mathematical tools. The crucial points are to view a mixed symmetry tensor as a Young projected object of the $N$-multi-form space and to develop an analogue of de Rham complex for mixed symmetry tensors. As a result, if the underlying manifold satisfy appropriate conditions, the duality map can be proven to exist and to be unique ensuring the charge of a description has information on the dual ones. Moreover, we provide some physical applications ranging form fractons and higher symmetries to string theory and holography.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD vacuum, the nucleon form factors receive contributions from the underlying ensemble of topological pseudoparticles, which are sensitive to a finite vacuum angle $\theta$. We use this observation to derive a novel relationship between the Pauli and electric dipole form factors, for light quark flavors. This relationship allows for an explicit derivation of the proton and neutron electric dipole moments induced by a small CP violating $\theta$ angle, in terms of the vacuum topological susceptibity times pertinent magnetic moments. The results compare well with some recent lattice estimates.</description>

      <title>Bridging Entanglement and Magic Resources within Operator Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18679v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local-operator entanglement (LOE) dictates the complexity of simulating Heisenberg evolution using tensor network methods, {and bears witness to many-body chaos for local dynamics}. We show that LOE is also sensitive to how non-Clifford a unitary is: its magic resources. In particular, we prove that LOE is always upper-bound by three distinct magic monotones: $T$-count, unitary nullity, and operator stabilizer R\'enyi entropy. Moreover, in the average case for large, random circuits, LOE and magic monotones approximately coincide. Our results imply that an operator evolution that is expensive to simulate using tensor network methods must also be inefficient using both stabilizer and Pauli truncation methods. {In terms of a previous conjecture on the characteristic scaling of LOE, our results also mean that non-integrable spin chains cannot be simulated classically}. Entanglement in operator space therefore measures a unified picture of non-classical resources, in stark contrast to the Schr\"odinger picture.</description>

      <title>Color-magnetic correlations in SU(N) lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19874v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by color-magnetic instabilities in QCD, we investigate field-strength correlations in both SU(2) and SU(3) lattice QCD. In the Euclidean Landau gauge, we numerically calculate the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation, $C_{\perp}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \perp)) \rangle$ with $\perp \equiv x, y$, and the parallel-type one, $C_{\parallel}(r) \equiv g^2 \langle H_z^a(s)H_z^a(s + r\hat \parallel) \rangle$ with $\parallel~\equiv z, t$. In the Landau gauge, all two-point field-strength correlations $g^2 \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^b_{\alpha\beta}(s')\rangle$ are described by these two quantities, due to the Lorentz and global SU($N_c$) color symmetries. Curiously, the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ is found to be always negative for arbitrary $r$, except for the same point of $r=0$. The parallel-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\parallel}(r)$ is always positive. In the infrared region, $C_{\perp}(r)$ and $C_{\parallel}(r)$ strongly cancel each other, which leads to an approximate cancellation for the sum of the field-strength correlations as $\sum_{\mu, \nu} \langle G^a_{\mu\nu}(s)G^a_{\mu\nu}(s')\rangle \propto C_{\perp}(|s-s'|)+ C_{\parallel}(|s-s'|) \simeq 0$. Next, we decompose the perpendicular-type color-magnetic correlation $C_{\perp}(r)$ into quadratic, cubic and quartic terms of the gluon field $A_\mu$. The quadratic term is always negative, which is explained by the Yukawa-type gluon propagator $\langle A^a_\mu(s)A^a_\mu(s')\rangle \propto e^{-mr}/r$ with $r\equiv |s-s'|$ in the Landau gauge. The quartic term gives a relatively small contribution. In the infrared region, the cubic term is positive and tends to cancel with the quadratic term, resulting in a small value of $C_{\perp}(r)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical solution for the evolution of parton distributions incorporating mixed-order QCD $\otimes$ QED corrections, addressing both polarized and unpolarized cases. Using the Altarelli-Parisi kernels extended to mixed order, we solve the DGLAP equations exactly in Mellin $N$-space and derive the associated Wilson coefficients for the polarized structure function $g_1$. Our analytical approach not only improves computational efficiency but also enhances the precision of theoretical predictions relevant for current and future phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Effective Field Theory of Perturbations on Arbitrary Black Hole Backgrounds with Spacelike Scalar Profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the effective field theory (EFT) of perturbations in the context of scalar-tensor theories with a spacelike scalar profile on arbitrary black hole backgrounds. Our construction of the EFT is based on the fact that in the unitary gauge, where the scalar field is chosen as one of the spatial coordinates, the background scalar field spontaneously breaks the diffeomorphism invariance along the direction of its gradient. The residual symmetry on a timelike hypersurface of constant scalar field is referred to as the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphism invariance. We then derive a set of consistency relations, imposed on the EFT parameters, by requiring that the EFT action in the unitary gauge be invariant under the $(2+1)$d diffeomorphisms. For concreteness, we apply the EFT to study the background dynamics of a class of non-static and spherically symmetric solutions, focusing in particular on a black hole solution with a time-varying mass. We emphasize that our EFT framework is broadly applicable to any black hole background as long as the scalar field remains spacelike throughout the spacetime region of interest. This formulation provides a model-independent approach for testing scalar-tensor theories as gravity beyond general relativity in the strong-gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and particle production from cosmological perturbations: a quantum optical simulation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04249v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a computational framework based on the Gaussian formalism and symplectic circuit representation to explore cosmological perturbations during inflation. These tools offer an efficient means to study entanglement generation and particle production, particularly when analytical methods become insufficient and numerical simulations are essential. By evolving an initial Bunch-Davies vacuum through a two-mode squeezer, we simulate the behavior of the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity across a wide range of cosmological backgrounds, each characterized by a distinct equation of state. The von Neumann entropy obtained via QuGIT simulations is compared with analytic R\'enyi entropy bounds, thereby validating the accuracy of our circuit implementation of the cosmological squeezing Hamiltonian in both accelerating and decelerating scenarios. We further investigate the role of thermal noise and demonstrate how the von Neumann entropy and logarithmic negativity are affected by its presence.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Evolving Dark Energy from LRG1-2 and Low-$z$ SNe Ia Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10514v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidences indicating that dark energy may be evolving with time, thereby challenging the core assumptions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Our investigation extends beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by exploring a range of dynamical dark energy models. Our analysis reveals that the predicted value of the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ by the DESI DR2 LRG1 and LRG3+ELG1 datapoints deviates from the standard $\Lambda$CDM prediction and from different supernova compilations. We find that analyzing the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers strongly affects the model predictions especially $\omega_0$, which shifts from $-1$ to slightly higher values. This suggests that the evidence of evolving dark energy in the DESI DR2 data is driven by the LRG1 and LRG2 tracers. When we exclude low-redshift supernovae data, particularly from the DES-SN5YR compilation, the model predictions are restored to the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. This effect is particularly evident in the GEDE model, where removing low-redshift supernovae data leads to $\Delta = 0$, effectively recovering $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Our analysis confirms that the evidence for dynamical dark energy is substantial, particularly at low redshift ($z \lesssim 0.3$). The reconstruction of $\omega(z)$ and $f_{DE}(z)$, using a combination of DESI DR2 BAO measurements, CMB distance priors, and supernovae datasets, further supports the evolving nature dark energy. These results favor a dynamical dark-energy scenario characterized by $\omega_0&gt;-1$, $\omega_a&lt;0$, and $\omega_0+\omega_a&lt;-1$ (Quintom-B). Bayesian analysis of model evidence reveals that the inclusion of low-redshift supernovae data significantly strengthens the support for evolving dark energy models such as JBP and Mirage, while models revert to inconclusive or weak support when low-redshift data are excluded.</description>

      <title>The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation.</description>

      <title>Is the $\Lambda$CDM Model in Crisis?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present strong evidence for dynamical dark energy challenging the $\Lambda$CDM model. Several dark energy models are explored, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, and BA, along with non-flat cosmologies accounting for potential spatial curvature. Our analysis supports a flat Universe ($\Omega_k \approx 0$). Using the Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm, we analyze data from BAO of DESI DR2, Type Ia Supernovae, and CMB to constrain model parameters. We find strong evidence that $\omega \neq -1$, with deviations from $\Lambda$CDM favoring dynamical dark energy consistent with the Quintom-B scenario ($\omega_0 &gt; -1$, $\omega_a &lt; 0$, and $\omega_0 + \omega_a &lt; -1$). We also derive upper bounds on $\sum m_\nu$ from CMB + DESI DR2. For $\Lambda$CDM we find $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.066~\text{eV}$, while for $\omega$CDM it is $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.075~\text{eV}$. In o$\Lambda$CDM and o$\omega$CDM the limits are $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.263~\text{eV}$ and $\sum m_\nu &lt; 0.520~\text{eV}$, respectively. For other models, including $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM, Logarithmic, Exponential, JBP, BA, and GEDE, the upper limits range from $&lt; 0.043~\text{eV}$ to $&lt; 0.127~\text{eV}$. Constraints on the effective number of relativistic species, $N_{\text{eff}}$, remain consistent with the standard value $N_{\text{eff}} = 3.044$ for all models. Bayesian evidence shows that combining DES-SN5Y and Union3 SNe Ia with CMB + DESI DR2 reveals deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, while no model reaches the $5\sigma$ threshold, some show $&gt; 3\sigma$ tensions with DES-SN5YR or Union3, hinting at cracks in the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>
