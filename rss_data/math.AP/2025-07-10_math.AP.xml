      <title>A dynamical system approach to the Chandrasekhar-Hamilton-Jacobi equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local properties of positive solutions of the equation -Delta u= exp(u) in a punctured domain Omega of RN in the range of parameters q &gt; 1 and M &gt; 0. We prove a series of a priori estimates near a singular point. In the case of radial solutions we use various techniques inherited from the dynamical systems theory to obtain the precise behaviour of singular solutions. We prove also the existence of singular solutions with these precise behaviours.</description>

      <title>$C^{\infty}$-structures approach to travelling wave solutions to the gKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric method for finding travelling wave solutions to the generalized Korteweg--de Vries (gKdV) equation $$ u_t + u_{xxx} + a(u)u_x = 0, $$ where $a(u)$ is a smooth function characterizing the nonlinearity. Using the travelling wave ansatz, the gKdV equation reduces to an ordinary differential equation (ODE), which we analyze via the $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure-based method, a geometric framework involving sequences of involutive distributions and Pfaffian equations. Starting with the symmetry $\partial_z$, we construct a $\mathcal{C}^\infty$-structure for the ODE and apply the stepwise integration algorithm to obtain an implicit general solution. We illustrate the method by deriving explicit solutions for specific forms of $a(u)$, including the modified KdV and Schamel--KdV equations, as well as power-law nonlinearities.</description>

      <title>Global invertibility of Sobolev mappings with prescribed homeomorphic boundary values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X, Y \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ be Lipschitz domains, and suppose there is a homeomorphism $\varphi \colon \overline{X} \to \overline{Y}$. We consider the class of Sobolev mappings $f \in W^{1,n} (X, \mathbb{R}^n)$ with a strictly positive Jacobian determinant almost everywhere, whose Sobolev trace coincides with $\varphi$ on $\partial X$. We prove that every mapping in this class extends continuously to $\overline{X}$ and is a monotone (continuous) surjection from $\overline{X}$ onto $\overline{Y}$ in the sense of C.B. Morrey. As monotone mappings, they may squeeze but not fold the reference configuration $X$. This behavior reflects weak interpenetration of matter, as opposed to folding, which corresponds to strong interpenetration. Despite allowing weak interpenetration of matter, these maps are globally invertible, generalizing the pioneering work of J.M. Ball.</description>

      <title>Global Bifurcation In Four-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates In Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a system of coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in the domain of a unitary ball in $\mathbb{R}^3$. The coupling is due to atom-to-atom interactions that occur between different gas components. The multi-component Bose-Einstein condensate is described by a system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations, which has an explicit trivial branch of constant solutions bifurcating from the zero-solution. Our main theorem establishes that this trivial branch undergoes multiple global bifurcations at any critical values with kernels of dimensions at least $3(2k+1)$, for $k \in \mathbb{N}^+$. Handling these high dimension kernels poses a challenge from the perspective of bifurcation theory. Our methodology, which relies on the $G$-equivariant gradient degree, effectively manages these complexities and establishes the existence of at least two global branch in the particular case of $k = 0$ and at least six branches in the case of $k = 1$.</description>

      <title>Indirect stabilization of nonlinear coupled wave equations in the presence of time delay or indefinite damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the exponential stability of two nonlinear wave equations coupled through their velocities. The analysis is divided into two main cases. First, we consider a system where one equation is damped, while the other experiences a discrete time delay. By reformulating the problem in an abstract framework, we use semigroup theory and energy methods to establish well-posedness and derive conditions that guarantee exponential energy decay. In the second case, we examine a scenario where a frictional damping term appears in the first equation, while the second equation contains an indefinite damping term, namely with a sign-changing coefficient. Although this setup can be viewed as a special case of the first, we analyze it separately and show that exponential stability still holds under a weaker condition.</description>

      <title>Optimal $C^{\frac{1}{2}}$ regularity of the Boltzmann equation in non-convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularity of the Boltzmann equation, particularly in the presence of physical boundary conditions, heavily relies on the geometry of the boundaries. In the case of non-convex domains with specular reflection boundary conditions, the problem remained outstanding until recently due to the severe singularity of billiard trajectories near the grazing set, where the trajectory map is not differentiable. This challenge was addressed in [32], where $C^{\frac{1}{2}-}_{x,v}$ H\"{o}lder regularity was proven. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamical singular regime integration methodology to establish the optimal $C^{\frac{1}{2}}_{x,v}$ regularity for the Boltzmann equation past a convex obstacle.</description>

      <title>Forward and Inverse Problems for a Langevin-Type Fractional Equation Involving Non-Local Time Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the formulation and analysis of direct and inverse problems for a Langevin-type fractional differential equation under a non-local condition imposed on the time variable. An additional condition for solving the inverse problem has the form $u(t_0)=\omega$. The existence and uniqueness of a solution to the problems are established, and stability inequalities are derived. Criteria ensuring the uniqueness of the solution are identified.</description>

      <title>On the weak flocking of the kinetic Cucker-Smale model in a fully non-compact support setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergent behaviors of the weak solutions to the kinetic Cucker-Smale (in short, KCS) model in a non-compact spatial-velocity support setting. Unlike the compact support situation, non-compact support of a weak solution can cause a communication weight to have zero lower bounds, and position difference does not have a uniformly linear growth bound. These cause the previous approach based on the nonlinear functional approach for spatial and velocity diameters to break down. To overcome these difficulties, we derive refined estimates on the upper bounds for the second-order spatial-velocity moments and show the uniqueness of the weak solution using the estimate on the deviation of particle trajectories. For the estimate of emergent dynamics, we consider two classes of distribution functions with decaying properties (an exponential decay or polynomial decay) in phase space, and then verify that the second moment for the velocity deviation from an average velocity tends to zero asymptotically, while the second moment for spatial deviation from the center of mass remains bounded uniformly in time. This illustrates the robustness of the mono-cluster flocking dynamics of the KCS model even for fully non-compact support settings in phase space and generalizes earlier results on flocking dynamics in a compact support setting.</description>

      <title>Emergent dynamics of spatially extended relativistic kinetic Cucker-Smale model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of the relativistic kinetic Cucker-Smale (RKCS) model without assuming compactness in spatial and velocity support. In this setting, the lower bound of the kernel function in the nonlocal velocity alignment force can be zero so that the previous approach based on the energy method does not provide a quantitative flocking estimate. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a suitable decay ansatz for the one-particle distribution function and an {\it effective domain} by identifying a time-varying region in which the total mass outside of it decays to zero asymptotically. Using these two ingredients, we show that weak flocking dynamics emerges asymptotically in the sense that the second moment for the velocity fluctuation around the velocity average tends to zero asymptotically, whereas the second moment for spatial fluctuations around the center of mass remains bounded uniformly in time. Our results demonstrate the robustness of the emergent dynamics in the RKCS model across various non-compact physically important distributions, including Gaussian, sub-Gaussian, and $D$-th moment integrable distributions.</description>

      <title>The primitive equations for the ocean and atmosphere in anisotropic spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the well-posedness of the primitive equations for the ocean and the atmosphere on two specific domains: a bounded domain $\Omega_1\mathrel{\mathop:}=(-1,1)^3$ with periodic boundary conditions, and the strip $\Omega_2\mathrel{\mathop:}=\mathbb{R}^2\times(-1,1)$ with periodic boundary conditions in the vertical direction. In a first time, we establish a global existence and uniqueness theorem for small initial data in a suitable anisotropic Besov space. Then, we also justify, in a similar functional framework, the singular limit from the anisotropic Navier-Stokes equations to this system.</description>

      <title>Global attractor of chemotaxis system with weak degradation and density-dependent motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the following chemotaxis system featuring weak degradation and nonlinear motility functions
  \begin{equation}\label{Model1}
  \begin{cases}
  u_{t} = (\gamma(v)u)_{xx} + r - \mu u, &amp; x \in [0,L],\ t &gt; 0,
  v_{t} = v_{xx} - v + u, &amp; x \in [0,L],\ t &gt; 0,
  \end{cases}
  \end{equation} defined on the bounded interval $[0,L]$ with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. The motility function $\gamma(v)$ satisfies the regularity conditions $\gamma \in C^{2}[0,\infty)$ with $\gamma(v) &gt; 0$ for all $v \geq 0$, and has bounded logarithmic derivative in the sense that $\sup_{v\geq 0} \frac{|\gamma'(v)|^{2}}{\gamma(v)} &lt; \infty$. Our main results establish three fundamental properties of the system. Firstly, using energy estimate methods, we prove the existence of globally bounded solutions for all positive parameters $r, \mu &gt; 0$ and non-negative, non-trivial initial data $u_{0} \in W^{1,\infty}([0,L])$. Secondly, through the construction of an appropriate Lyapunov function, we demonstrate that all solutions $(u,v)$ converge exponentially to the unique constant equilibrium $(r/\mu, r/\mu)$ in the parameter regime $\mu &gt; \frac{H_{0}}{16}$, where $H_{0} := \sup_{v \geq 0} \frac{|\gamma'(v)|^{2}}{\gamma(v)}$ quantifies the maximal relative variation of the motility function. Finally, we present numerical results that not only validate the theoretical findings but also investigate the long-term behavior of solutions under diverse parameter configurations and initial conditions in two- and three-dimensional domains, providing valuable benchmarks for future research.</description>

      <title>A New proof of Liouville type theorems for a class of semilinear elliptic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain typical semilinear elliptic equations in Euclidean space $\bR^{n}$ or on a closed manifold $M$ with nonnegative Ricci curvature. Our proof is based on a crucial integral identity constructed by the invariant tensor method. Together with suitable integral estimates, some classical Liouville theorems will be reestablished.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we fully characterize, in any space dimension, the minimizer of a class of nonlocal and anisotropic Riesz energies defined over probability measures supported on ellipsoids. In the super-Coulombic and Coulombic regime, we prove that the minimizer is independent of the anisotropy. In contrast, in the sub-Coulombic regime we show that this property fails: we exhibit an example of anisotropy for which the isotropic minimizer is not optimal. In order to prove our main result, we provide a formula for the potential inside an ellipsoid, valid in any space dimension and involving the hypergeometric function.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Robin problem for a uniformly elliptic divergence operator with measure data on the right-hand side of the equation and an absorption term on the boundary involving blowing up terms. We prove the existence of a positive renormalized solution and provide it stochastic representation, which can be viwed as a generalized nonlinear Feynman-Kac formula. From this representation we derive some additional regularity results for the solution and some uniqueness results.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Framework of Subwavelength Resonance in Elastic Metascreen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a mathematical framework based on asymptotic analysis of layer potential operators for determining the existence of subwavelength resonance in elastic metascreen and resonance frequency calculation. We consider the case of high shear modulus contrast between metascreen inclusions and background medium. When the shear modulus of inclusions tends to infinity, we prove the occurrence of subwavelength resonance and demonstrate the dramatic change of scattered field due to subwavelength resonance by calculating approximated field inside inclusions and far-away from metascreen. When the shear modulus of background goes to infinity, we prove the absence of subwavelength resonance.</description>

      <title>Strong time-periodic solutions to a multilayered fluid-structure interaction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies a nonlinearly coupled, time-periodic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem involving the Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid coupled with a multilayered elastic structure consisting of a thin damped shell and a thick viscoelastic component. The main objective is to establish the existence of a strong time-periodic solution. To address the full nonlinear problem, we employ a fixed point argument, which relies on a detailed analysis of the linearized system together with appropriate nonlinear estimates. The linearized problem is analyzed by employing the Arendt-Bu theorem on maximal periodic $\mathrm{L}^p$-regularity, which requires several new analytical ingredients including a careful treatment of the thick structural layer, a refined lifting procedure, a decoupling strategy to establish $\mathcal{R}$-sectoriality of the associated FSI operator and a careful spectral analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result proving the existence of strong time-periodic solutions for a multilayered fluid-structure interaction problem.</description>

      <title>On the local null controllability of a viscous Burgers' system in finite time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the local null controllability of the Burgers control system $y_t - y_{xx} + y y_x = u(t)$ on a bounded interval imposed by the zero Dirichlet boundary condition. It is known from the work of Marbach that this control system is not locally null controllable in small time. In this paper, we prove that the system is not locally null controllable in finite time as well. Our approach is inspired by the works of Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen, and Nguyen on the controllability of the KdV system and is different from the one of Marbach.</description>

      <title>Multi-species McKean-Vlasov dynamics in non-convex landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study multi-species stochastic interacting particle systems and their mean-field McKean-Vlasov partial differential equations (PDEs) in non-convex landscapes. We discuss the well-posedness of the multi-species SDE system, propagation of chaos and the derivation of the coupled McKean-Vlasov PDE system in the mean field limit. Our focus is on the long-time and asymptotic behaviour of the mean-field PDEs. Under suitable growth assumptions on the potentials and an appropriate structural assumption, we show the existence and (non-) uniqueness of stationary solutions and study their linear stability. Under a symmetry assumption we construct a free-energy functional that plays the role of a Lyapunov function for the mean-field PDE system. Furthermore, we prove the existence of a phase transition at low noise strengths and establish the convergence of solutions to the mean-field PDEs (and of their free energy) to a stationary state (and the corresponding free energy).</description>

      <title>Quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in capillarity problems and cones in strong and barycentric forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for two different perimeter-type functionals. We first consider classical capillarity functionals, which measure the perimeter of sets in a Euclidean half-space, assigning a constant weight $\lambda \in (-1, 1)$ to the portion of the boundary that lies on the boundary of the half-space. We then consider the relative perimeter of sets contained in some suitable convex cone in the Euclidean space. In both settings, we establish sharp quantitative isoperimetric inequalities in the so-called strong form. More precisely, we show that the isoperimetric deficit of a competitor not only controls the Fraenkel asymmetry, but it also controls an oscillation asymmetry that measures how much the unit normals to the boundary of a competitor deviate from those of an isoperimetric set. Our technique is also able to explicitly identify a center that can be employed to compute the asymmetries. In particular, we also derive barycentric versions of these quantitative isoperimetric inequalities (both in the classical and in the strong form). The proofs are based on the derivation of Fuglede-type estimates for graphs defined on general spherically convex domains, in combination with a new application of the selection principle that directly provides the inequalities in barycentric form.</description>

      <title>Turing complete Navier-Stokes steady states via cosymplectic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct stationary solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations on certain Riemannian $3$-manifolds that exhibit Turing completeness, in the sense that they are capable of performing universal computation. This universality arises on manifolds admitting nonvanishing harmonic 1-forms, thus showing that computational universality is not obstructed by viscosity, provided the underlying geometry satisfies a mild cohomological condition. The proof makes use of a correspondence between nonvanishing harmonic $1$-forms and cosymplectic geometry, which extends the classical correspondence between Beltrami fields and Reeb flows on contact manifolds.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned boundary value method for advection-diffusion equations with half Laplacian via spectrum doubling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an advection-diffusion equation that involves a half-Laplacian operator derived from the Riesz fractional Laplacian, combined with a differential operator \(\mathcal{L}\). By applying the half-Laplacian operator $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$ on both sides of the equation and using the relationship between the Hilbert transform and $(-\Delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}$, we reformulate the problem as a second-order damped Cauchy problem and then convert it into an equivalent first-order system. This \textit{spectrum doubling} (SD) reformulation applies the half-Laplacian only once to the initial condition, thereby eliminating the need to evaluate singular integrals during the time evolution and reducing truncation-related numerical errors. For the resulting SD system, we show that standard time-stepping schemes can lose stability because of the backward-diffusion term. To address this, we adopt Boundary Value Methods (BVMs), which yield unconditional stability and second-order accuracy. We present eigenvalue-based stability criteria, error estimates, and an efficient block formulation to solve the resulting large linear systems. To further enhance computational efficiency, we propose a parallel preconditioned iterative solver. Numerical experiments confirm the second-order convergences in both time and space, even under strong advection or for complex fractional Schr\"odinger-type problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Neumann problem for linear elliptic equations involving integro-differential operators of Levy-type. We show that suitably defined viscosity solutions have probabilistic representations given in terms of the reflected stochastic Skorokhod equation associated with an Ito process and an independent pure-jump Levy process. As an application of the representation we show that viscosity solutions arise a limits of some penalized equations and give some stability results for the viscosity solutions. Our proofs are based on new limit theorems for solutions of penalized stochastic equations with jumps and new estimates on the bounded variation parts of the solutions.</description>

      <title>The Calderon Problem Revisited: Reconstruction With Resonant Perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original Calder\'on problem consists in recovering the potential (or the conductivity) from the knowledge of the related Neumann to Dirichlet map (or Dirichlet to Neumann map). Here, we first perturb the medium by injecting small-scaled and highly heterogeneous particles. Such particles can be bubbles or droplets in acoustics or nanoparticles in electromagnetism. They are distributed, periodically for instance, in the whole domain where we want to do reconstruction. Under critical scales between the size and contrast, these particles resonate at specific frequencies that can be well computed. Using incident frequencies that are close to such resonances, we show that
  1) the corresponding Neumann to Dirichlet map of the composite converges to the one of the homogenized medium. In addition, the equivalent coefficient, which consist in the sum of the original potential and the effective coefficient, is negative valued with a controlable amplitude.
  2) as the equivalent coefficient is negative valued, then we can linearize the corresponding Neumann to Dirichlet map using the effective coefficient's amplitude.
  3) from the linearized Neumann to Dirichlet map, we reconstruct the original potential using explicit complex geometrical optics solutions (CGOs).</description>

Abstract: Given a half-harmonic map $u\in \dot H^{\frac{1}{2},2}(\mathbb{R},\mathbb{S}^1)$ minimizing the fractional Dirichlet energy under Dirichlet boundary conditions in $\mathbb{R}\setminus I$, we show the existence of a second half-harmonic map, minimizing the fractional Dirichlet energy in a different homotopy class. This is based on the study of the degree of fractional Sobolev maps and a sharp estimate \`a la Brezis-Coron. We give examples showing that it is in general not possible to minimize in every homotopy class and show a contrast with the 2-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and ill-posedness for a system of periodic quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem of a system of quadratic derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations which was introduced by M. Colin and T. Colin (2004) as a model of laser-plasma interaction. For the nonperiodic setting, the authors proved some well-posedness results, which contain the scaling critical case for $d\geq 2$. In the present paper, we prove the well-posedness of this system for the periodic setting. In particular, well-posedness is proved at the scaling critical regularity for $d\geq 3$ under some conditions for the coefficients of the Laplacian. We also prove some ill-posedness results. As long as we use an iteration argument, our well-posedness results are optimal except for some critical cases.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the well-posedness of a class of infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation. This class includes in particular the Euler-Bernoulli beam equations and more generally 1D linear infinite-dimensional port-Hamiltonian systems with boundary control and observation as well as coupled systems. It is known, that for the Timoshenko beam models internal well-posedness implies well-posedness of the overall system. By means of an example we show that this is not true for the Euler-Bernoulli beam models. An easy verifiable equivalent condition for well-posedness of the overall system will be presented. We will conclude the paper by applying the obtained results to several Euler-Bernoulli beam models.</description>

      <title>An essential one sided boundary singularity for a $3$-dimensional area minimizing current in $\mathbb{R}^5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a $3$-dimensional area minimizing current $T$ in $\mathbb{R}^5$ whose boundary contains a real analytic surface of multiplicity $2$ at which $T$ has a density $1$ essential boundary singularity with a flat tangent cone. This example shows that the boundary regularity theory we developed with Reinaldo Resende in another paper, which extends Allard's classical boundary regularity result to higher boundary multiplicity, is dimensionally sharp.
  The construction of $T$ relies on the prescription of boundary data with non-trivial topology, which makes it a flexible technique and gives rise to a wide family of singular examples.
  In order to understand the examples, we develop a boundary regularity theory for a class of area minimizing $m$-dimensional currents whose boundary consists of smooth $(m-1)$-dimensional surfaces with multiplicities meeting along an $(m-2)$-dimensional smooth submanifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Ricci flow out of spaces with edge type conical singularities along a closed, embedded curve. Under the additional assumption that for each point of the curve, our space is locally modelled on the product of a fixed positively curved cone and a line, we show existence of a solution to Ricci flow $(M,g(t))$ for $t\in (0,T],$ which converges back to the singular space as $t\searrow 0$ in the pointed Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We also prove curvature estimates for the solution and, for edge points, we show that the tangent flow at these points is a positively curved expanding Ricci soliton solution crossed with a line.</description>

      <title>Error Estimates for Systems of Nonlocal Balance Laws Modeling Dense Multilane Vehicular Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16928v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a class of coupled systems of nonlocal nonlinear balance laws modeling multilane traffic, with the nonlocality present in both convective and source terms. The uniqueness and existence of the entropy solution are proven via doubling of the variables arguments and convergent finite volume approximations, respectively. The primary goal is to establish that the finite volume numerical approximations of the system converge to the unique entropy solution at a rate of $\sqrt{\Delta t}$, even when using relatively less regular one-sided kernels, compared to the globally smooth kernels analyzed in [Num. Math., 156(1):237-271, 2024] and [IMA J. Numer. Anal., 44(6):3354-3392, 2024]. The applicability of the proven theory to a general class of systems of nonlocal balance laws coupled strongly through the convective part and weakly through the source part, is indicated. As the support of the kernel tends to zero, the convergence of the entropy solutions of the proposed model to its local counterparts [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 51: 3694--3713, 2019] is also discussed. Numerical simulations illustrating the behavior of the entropy solutions of the coupled nonlocal systems are also shown.</description>
