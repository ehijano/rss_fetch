      <title>Cognitive-Radio Functionality: A Novel Configuration for STAR-RIS assisted RSMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cognitive radio rate-splitting multiple access (CR-RSMA) has emerged as a promising multiple access framework that can efficiently manage interference and adapt dynamically to heterogeneous quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. To effectively support such demanding access schemes, programmable wireless environments have attracted considerable attention, especially through simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (STAR-RISs), which can enable full-space control of signal propagation in asymmetric user deployments. In this paper, we propose the cognitive radio (CR) functionality for STAR-RIS-assisted CR-RSMA systems, leveraging the unique capability of the STAR-RIS to combine element and power splitting for adaptive control of transmission and reflection in CR scenarios. Specifically, the proposed CR functionality partitions the STAR-RIS into two regions independently controlling the transmission and reflection of signals, simultaneously ensuring the required QoS for the primary user and enhancing the performance of the secondary user. To accurately characterize the system performance, we derive analytical expressions for the ergodic rate of the secondary user and the outage rate of the primary user under Nakagami-m fading. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively manages interference, guarantees the QoS of the primary user, and significantly improves the throughput of the secondary user, highlighting STAR-RIS as an efficient solution for CR-RSMA-based services.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Authentication for Data Spaces: An Authentication Flow Based On Grant Negotiation And Authorization Protocol For Verifiable Presentations (GNAP4VP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity verification in Data Spaces is a fundamental aspect of ensuring security and privacy in digital environments. This paper presents an identity verification protocol tailored for shared data environments within Data Spaces. This protocol extends the Grant Negotiation and Authorization Protocol (GNAP) and integrates OpenID Connect for Verifiable Presentations (OIDC4VP) along with support for Linked Verifiable Presentations (LVP), providing a robust foundation for secure and privacy-preserving interactions. The proposed solution adheres to the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) to facilitate decentralized, user-centric identity management while maintaining flexibility through protocol negotiation. Two alternative interaction flows are introduced: a "Wallet-Driven Interaction" utilizing OIDC4VP, and a "LVP Authorization" model for fully automated machine-to-machine communication. These flows address critical challenges encountered in Data Spaces, including privacy, interoperability, and regulatory compliance while simultaneously ensuring scalability and minimizing trust assumptions. The paper provides a detailed technical design, outlining the implementation considerations, and demonstrating how the proposed flows guarantee verifiable, secure, and efficient interactions between participants. This work contributes towards the establishment of a more trustworthy and sovereign digital infrastructure, in alignment with emerging European data governance initiatives.</description>

      <title>Running Conventional Automatic Speech Recognition on Memristor Hardware: A Simulated Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristor-based hardware offers new possibilities for energy-efficient machine learning (ML) by providing analog in-memory matrix multiplication. Current hardware prototypes cannot fit large neural networks, and related literature covers only small ML models for tasks like MNIST or single word recognition. Simulation can be used to explore how hardware properties affect larger models, but existing software assumes simplified hardware. We propose a PyTorch-based library based on "Synaptogen" to simulate neural network execution with accurately captured memristor hardware properties. For the first time, we show how an ML system with millions of parameters would behave on memristor hardware, using a Conformer trained on the speech recognition task TED-LIUMv2 as example. With adjusted quantization-aware training, we limit the relative degradation in word error rate to 25% when using a 3-bit weight precision to execute linear operations via simulated analog computation.</description>

      <title>Authentication and authorization in Data Spaces: A relationship-based access control approach for policy specification based on ODRL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data has become a crucial resource in the digital economy, fostering initiatives for secure and sovereign data sharing frameworks such as Data Spaces. However, these distributed environments require fine-grained access control mechanisms that balance openness with sovereignty and security. This paper proposes an extension of the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) standard, the ODRL Data Spaces (ODS) profile, aimed at supporting authorization and complementing existing authentication mechanisms throughout the data lifecycle. Additionally, a policy execution engine is introduced to translate ODRL policies into executable formats, enabling effective enforcement. The approach is validated through a use case involving OpenFGA, demonstrating its applicability to relationship-based access control scenarios.</description>

      <title>Disturbance-based Discretization, Differentiable IDS Channel, and an IDS-Correcting Code for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) error-correcting codes have garnered increased attention with recent advancements in DNA storage technology. However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in the realistic DNA storage channel.</description>

      <title>On the Vulnerability of Applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation within Knowledge-Intensive Application Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been empirically shown to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal contexts. Given a query, RAG retrieves relevant documents from a corpus and integrates them into the LLMs' generation process. In this study, we investigate the adversarial robustness of RAG, focusing specifically on examining the retrieval system. First, across 225 different setup combinations of corpus, retriever, query, and targeted information, we show that retrieval systems are vulnerable to universal poisoning attacks in medical Q\&amp;A. In such attacks, adversaries generate poisoned documents containing a broad spectrum of targeted information, such as personally identifiable information. When these poisoned documents are inserted into a corpus, they can be accurately retrieved by any users, as long as attacker-specified queries are used. To understand this vulnerability, we discovered that the deviation from the query's embedding to that of the poisoned document tends to follow a pattern in which the high similarity between the poisoned document and the query is retained, thereby enabling precise retrieval. Based on these findings, we develop a new detection-based defense to ensure the safe use of RAG. Through extensive experiments spanning various Q\&amp;A domains, we observed that our proposed method consistently achieves excellent detection rates in nearly all cases.</description>

      <title>Equivalence checking of quantum circuits via intermediary matrix product operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum computing advances, the complexity of quantum circuits is rapidly increasing, driving the need for robust methods to aid in their design. Equivalence checking plays a vital role in identifying errors that may arise during compilation and optimization of these circuits and is a critical step in quantum circuit verification. In this work, we introduce a novel method based on Matrix Product Operators (MPOs) for determining the equivalence of quantum circuits. Our approach contracts tensorized quantum gates from two circuits into an intermediary MPO, exploiting their reversibility to determine their equivalence or non-equivalence. Our results show that this method offers significant scalability improvements over existing methods, with polynomial scaling in circuit width and depth for the practical use cases we explore. We expect that this work sets the new standard for scalable equivalence checking of quantum circuits and will become a crucial tool for the validation of increasingly complex quantum systems.</description>

      <title>WaferLLM: Large Language Model Inference at Wafer Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging AI accelerators increasingly adopt wafer-scale manufacturing technologies, integrating hundreds of thousands of AI cores in a mesh architecture with large distributed on-chip memory (tens of GB in total) and ultra-high on-chip memory bandwidth (tens of PB/s). However, current LLM inference systems, optimized for shared memory architectures like GPUs, fail to exploit these accelerators fully.
  We introduce WaferLLM, the first wafer-scale LLM inference system. WaferLLM is guided by a novel PLMR model (pronounced as "Plummer") that captures the unique hardware characteristics of wafer-scale architectures. Leveraging this model, WaferLLM pioneers wafer-scale LLM parallelism, optimizing the utilization of hundreds of thousands of on-chip cores. It also introduces MeshGEMM and MeshGEMV, the first GEMM and GEMV implementations designed to scale effectively on wafer-scale accelerators.
  Evaluations show that WaferLLM achieves up to 200$\times$ higher accelerator utilization than state-of-the-art methods. Leveraging a wafer-scale accelerator (Cerebras WSE2), WaferLLM delivers GEMV operations 606$\times$ faster and 16$\times$ more energy-efficient than on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. For full LLM inference, WaferLLM achieves 10-20$\times$ speedups over A100 GPU clusters running SGLang and vLLM. These advantages are expected to grow as wafer-scale AI models, software, and hardware continue to mature. WaferLLM is open-sourced at https://github.com/MeshInfra/WaferLLM.</description>
