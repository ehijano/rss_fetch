      <title>Gravitational collapse and singularity avoidance of a homogeneous dust fluid on a brane with timelike extra dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational collapse of a homogeneous dust cloud in the Shtanov Sahni braneworld model, which incorporates an extra timelike dimension. The interior of the collapsing configuration is modeled by a Friedmann Lemaitre spacetime, while the exterior is described by a Vaidya radiation envelope that eventually settles into a static Reissner Nordstrom (RN) geometry with a positive tidal charge. Although a smooth matching between the interior and the static exterior is precluded by the breakdown of Birkhoff's theorem in the braneworld scenario, we show that as long as braneworld effects remain significant, the brane tension stays finite. Consequently, the scalar curvature remains bounded, thereby preventing the formation of a singularity.</description>

      <title>Ab uno disce omnes: Single-harmonic search for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals' complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</description>

      <title>Compact binary system dynamics at the second post-Newtonian order: analytical formula of the coordinate time for eccentric and circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is based on the letter Phys. Lett. B, 865, 139484 (2025), where we developed the analytical expression of the coordinate time in terms of the eccentric anomaly at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The aim of this paper is to provide more details about the performed calculations and to produce other new results. More specifically, we will focus on deriving the analytical expression of the coordinate time at the second Post-Newtonian order for circular orbits and then discuss two astrophysical applications involving binary neutron star and black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Signatures and Geometrothermodynamics of Critical Phenomena in Regularized Maxwell Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic topology and microscopic interaction properties of charged black holes in RegMax gravity, focusing on the role of the coupling parameter $\alpha$. Using the Duan topological current method together with Ruppeiner geometry, we show that $\alpha$ controls a sharp change in phase structure. Above a certain critical threshold, we find that the Duan defect curve develops an intermediate branch and vertical tangency points, producing continuous (second-order) critical behaviour. Furthermore, the Ruppeiner curvature becomes negative at very small horizon radii before turning positive and progressively vanishing at larger radii. By contrast, below the critical value of the coupling, the intermediate black hole phase disappears, and the system shows a simpler small/large first-order/coexistence behaviour driven by free-energy competition. In this regime, the Ruppeiner curvature remains predominantly positive. Overall, increasing $\alpha$ enriches the thermodynamic topology (allowing for second-order criticality) while simultaneously reducing the domain in which classical energy conditions (ECs) are satisfied, thus linking exotic thermodynamic behaviour to more severe violations of standard energy conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory-inspired cure for black hole singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a growing interest in the study of regular black holes, driven by the search for singularity-free geometries. This research has revealed intriguing similarities between the regularization mechanisms used in black hole models and those employed in quantum field theory, such as the introduction of exponential suppression or energy cutoffs. We propose a systematic exponential cutoff regularization scheme for static, spherically symmetric black hole solutions in general relativity. The method explored in this paper serves as an alternative to the black-bounce singularity suppression mechanism proposed by Simpson and Visser, which involves a coordinate remapping $r \rightarrow\sqrt{r^2+a^2}$, as well as to the mechanism proposed by Bronnikov, which employs a Bardeen-type remapping in the metric. The method presented here introduces exponential factors in the mass function, smoothing curvature divergences and ensuring geodesic completeness under specific conditions. This approach allows the regularization of known singular spacetimes without altering their asymptotic structure. We analyze curvature invariants, horizon formation, and thermodynamic properties, showing that the regularized geometries avoid singularities while maintaining physical consistency. As examples of application, we regularize the Schwarzschild black hole and present a novel regularized Kiselev solution. The method provides a unified framework to systematically generate singularity-free black holes within classical general relativity</description>

      <title>Shadow and Polarization Images of Rotating Black Holes in Kalb-Ramond Gravity Illuminated by Several Thick Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using ray-tracing techniques, this paper investigates the optical and polarization images of rotating black holes in Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity illuminated by thick accretion disks. We consider two accretion disk models: the phenomenological model and the HOU disk model, where the phenomenological model includes both isotropic and anisotropic radiation. In all models, the external bright rings corresponding to the high-order image and the internal dark region associated with the event horizon are observed. At high observational inclinations, the inner shadows are obscured by the radiation from the equatorial plane, which is significantly different from the thin accretion disk model. The primary distinction between isotropic and anisotropic radiation is that the latter causes distortion of the high-order image in the vertical direction, resulting in an elliptical structure. For the HOU disk model, due to certain regions are geometrically thinner under the conical approximation, the high-order images are narrower compared to the phenomenological model. Furthermore, we find that an increase in the rotational parameter $a$ leads to an asymmetry in the intensity distribution of the high-order image, while an increase in the spontaneous Lorentz violating parameters, $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$, results in a decrease in the size of the high-order image. In the polarization image, the linear polarization is found to be significantly influenced by the intensity, while it is relatively less affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$. The electric vector position angle is mainly affected by the parameters $\varsigma$ and $\varpi$.</description>

      <title>Exact Regions of Superradiant Instability of Kerr-Newman Black Holes and Massive Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the superradiant instability of Kerr-Newman black holes in the presence of a massive, charged scalar field using the Vieira-Bezerra-Kokkotas (VBK) method. We study the solutions of the exact polynomial condition for quasibound state frequencies and determine the domain of superradiant instability in parameter space without relying on the hydrogenic approximation or numerics. We derive the minimum scalar mass needed for quasibound states to exist, and identify the precise overlap region between the quasibound and superradiant conditions where instability can occur. Through a perturbative analysis of the resonance equation, we obtain analytic expressions for the instability boundaries and growth rates, and clarify their relation to previous numerical results. Our analysis reveals how the instability region shifts from nearly neutral Kerr black holes for light fields to highly charged near-extremal Kerr-Newman black holes for heavier fields, while remaining absent in the Reissner-Nordstrom limit.</description>

      <title>Optimizing searches for gravitational wave bursts 2 using coherent WaveBurst 2G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most general searches for gravitational wave transients (GWTs) rely on data analysis methods that do not assume prior knowledge of the signal waveform, direction, or arrival time on Earth. These searches provide data-driven signal reconstructions that are crucial both for testing available emission models and for discovering yet-to-be-uncovered sources. Here, we discuss progress in the detection performance of the coherent WaveBurst second-generation pipeline (cWB-2G), which is highly adaptable to both minimally modeled and model-informed searches for GWTs. Several search configurations for GWTs are examined using approximately 14.8 days of observation time from the third observing run by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK). Recent enhancements include a ranking statistic fully based on multivariate classification with eXtreme Gradient Boosting, a thorough validation of the statistical significance accuracy of GWT candidates, and a measurement of the correlations of false alarms and simulated detections between different concurrent searches. For the first time, we provide a comprehensive comparison of cWB-2G performance on data from networks made of two and three detectors, and we demonstrate the advantage of combining concurrent searches for GWTs of generic morphology in a global observatory. This work offers essential insights for assessing our data analysis strategies in ongoing and future LVK searches for generic GWTs.</description>

      <title>A cosmological model with logarithmic f(T) gravity and H(z) quadratic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological expansion of a modified teleparallel gravity model of type logarithmic type. This modified gravitational lagrangian yields a cosmological constant term and also power-law corrections to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) for small $\lambda$. By using the cosmological chronometers and the type Ia supernove data from the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, we fit the parameters of the modified gravitational dynamics assuming $H(z)$ parametrized by a quadratic expansion. The results exhibit an accelerated expansion with parameter $q = - 0.435 \pm 0.028$. In addition, we analyzed the effective energy density, pressure and state parameter $\omega$. It turns out that, this modified gravitational theory produces solutions similar to the quintessence and phantom models.</description>

      <title>Dark Coriolis Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We argue that the standard post-Newtonian expansion scheme used in General Relativity leaves room for time-space components $g_{ti}$ of the metric to be of the same order of the usual gravitational potential. We explore this possibility and find that such leading order contributions to $g_{ti}$ are related to the Coriolis field of Newton-Cartan gravity. We investigate the possibility that Coriolis fields mimic dark matter effects in disk galaxies. We find solutions from their field equations that sustain the velocity rotation curves in the bulge region and beyond it, notably describing flattish velocity profiles. We dub such solutions Dark Coriolis Fields.</description>

      <title>Influence of plasma on the observational appearance of rotating black holes in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the influence of plasma on the light rays trajectories in the vicinity of black holes is significat since that astrophysical black holes are generally surrounded by a plasma medium. In this work, we analyze the null geodesics in the space-time of rotating hairy Horndeski black holes immersed in a plasma medium using the Hamilton-Jacobi method. By considering both uniform and non-uniform plasma distributions, we perform a comparative study of their effects on the black hole shadow. The impact of the hair parameter and the inclination angle on the black hole shadow is also investigated. Finally, the shadow results are compared with observational data of the Event Horizon Telescope for M87* to constrain the plasma parameter.</description>

      <title>Exploring potential astrophysical applications of black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spacetimes arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) are a good laboratory for studying both the nature of regular black holes (RBH) solutions and the imprints of nonlinear electromagnetic fields within this context. Over the past few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$ framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) BH. In its turn, for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.</description>

      <title>The Yilmaz-Rosen and Janis-Newman-Winicour metric solutions in the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet $4d$ gravitational model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (sEGB) $4d$ gravitational model with a scalar field $\varphi\left(u\right)$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The model action contains a potential term $U\left(\varphi\right)$, a Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f\left(\varphi\right)$ and a parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to the ordinary scalar field, and $\varepsilon = -1$ to the phantom field. In this paper we applied the sEGB reconstruction procedure from our previous work \cite{Er_Ivash} to the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric, a solution potentially describing a quasi-black hole without an event horizon. Within this framework, we also derived analytical solutions based on scalar-tensor theory with minimal coupling.
  Our results indicate that for this configuration, the potential $U$ vanishes and the scalar field is phantom-like. Furthermore, an analysis of the Einstein equations in the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric reveals that all energy conditions are violated. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor suggests the presence of exotic matter with negative pressure, as indicated by the negative value of $T_u^u$. This could originate from a scalar field (such as the Higgs field or another nonlinear field), or from phenomena like dark energy or quintessence.
  In addition, we considered the application of our reconstruction method in the sEGB model in the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) metric. As noted in this paper, the Y{\i}lmaz-Rosen metric is a limiting case of the Janus metric (as $s \to +\infty$). Furthermore, we obtained some exact solutions of scalar-tensor theory with minimal coupling in the JNW metric.</description>

      <title>Conformal characterization of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic structure of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric. We prove that every straight ambient metric admits a conformal completion with a well-defined null infinity, and that the asymptotic expansion of the metric at infinity can be related to that at the homothetic horizon. Furthermore, in even dimensions, we show that the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor naturally arises in the geometry at infinity. By identifying the fundamental properties that this particular conformal extension exhibits, and analyzing their sufficiency, we arrive at the main result of the paper, namely the identification of a set of conformally covariant conditions that completely characterize the ambient metric from a conformal perspective. In particular, our result relaxes the requirement of the homothety one-form being exact.</description>

      <title>Swampland Conjectures through ACT Observations: Observational Signatures of Radiative-Corrected Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the consistency of radiatively corrected inflationary models with both the latest observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) combined with Planck 2018 and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the theoretical constraints imposed by the swampland program. We systematically test two distinct models against three key swampland conjectures: the further refined de Sitter swampland conjecture (FRDSSC), the scalar weak gravity conjecture (SWGC), and the strong scalar weak gravity conjecture (SSWGC). Model I, based on radiatively corrected Higgs inflation, satisfies the FRDSSC and remains consistent with current observational constraints ($n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$, $r &lt; 0.038$), but fails to meet the SWGC and SSWGC requirements, indicating limited theoretical compatibility with quantum gravity principles. In contrast, Model II, incorporating radiative corrections with scalar sectors, demonstrates full consistency by satisfying all three swampland conjectures simultaneously while maintaining observational viability. The compatibility of Model II is highly sensitive to the non-minimal coupling $\xi$ and renormalization scales $\mu_b$, with larger values extending the range of swampland-consistent solutions. Our results highlight the critical role of radiative corrections in achieving simultaneous theoretical and observational consistency, and identify Model II as a promising candidate for a fully viable inflationary scenario within the swampland framework. This work provides a methodology for classifying inflationary models based on their swampland compatibility, demonstrating that satisfaction of the FRDSSC alone is insufficient for full theoretical consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The covariant description of massless particles of arbitrary spin typically employs symmetric tensors of rank $s$ and rests on a local symmetry carried by symmetric tensor parameters of rank $s-1$, suitably generalizing the $U(1)$ transformations of Maxwell's theory and the diffeomorphisms underlying general relativity. Here we show that Fronsdal's action is actually uniquely identified by the weaker requirement of invariance under higher-derivative gauge transformations driven by a vector parameter. This observation may hint to a tighter, if unexpected, connection between higher-spin symmetry and diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Searching for emergent spacetime in spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on algebraic formulations of holographic dualities in terms of large $N$ algebras has revealed a deep connection between the properties of the associated spectral functions and the emergence of a semiclassical spacetime and causal horizons therein. One of the main lessons is that, for a radial direction to emerge, the spectral function has to exhibit non-compact support. Furthermore, there exist conjectures upon a possible duality between complex gravitational configurations and glassy systems. The goal of this paper is to combine these ideas by studying many-body quantum-mechanical systems and assess in which parameter regimes they could potentially be holographic. Thus, we compute the spectral functions of three many-body systems with quenched disorder, the SYK model, the $p$-spin model and the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg chain in the large $N$ limit and present results in different parameter regimes. Our main finding is that in the quantum spin glass phase of the SU$(M)$ Heisenberg model, the spectral function develops an exponential tail, similar to the large $q$ limit of SYK. Furthermore, we demonstrate the presence of an infinite family of quasiparticle excitations deep in the spin liquid phase of the $p$-spin model, which could point towards an emergent type I von Neumann algebra. In addition, we demonstrate the presence of an exponential tail in the spectral function for all cases without compact support and conformal symmetry. Motivated by this observation, we prove that no low-energy operator can detect a nontrivial bulk causal structure, if the spectral function has exponentially decaying tails.</description>

      <title>Background solutions to the Hubble tension in $f(Q)$ gravity and consistency with BAO measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test whether $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel theories of gravity are capable of solving the Hubble tension while producing consistency with DESI DR2 BAO. We consider three different forms for the $f(Q)$ function: logarithmic, exponential, and hyperbolic tangent. We also consider extensions of these models by adding the Cosmological constant, and compare to phenomenological models with a flexible double exponential addition to the standard $\Lambda$CDM $H(z)$. We test these models against DESI DR2 BAO, Planck 2018, Local $H_0$, and Cosmic Chronometers data. The logarithmic and hyperbolic tangent models do not provide an adequate solution, while the exponential model gives a reasonable solution, though it faces mild tension with the BAO data. The models assisted by the cosmological constant perform slightly better than the exponential, at the cost of reduced theoretical motivation. This highlights the difficulties of finding a theoretically motivated solution to the Hubble tension while producing BAO consistency. The phenomenological models are able to achieve a good fit to all data, giving guidelines for what a background solution to the Hubble tension would look like in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bose et al. and Marletto and Vedral proposed an experiment to test whether gravity can induce entanglement between massive systems, arguing that the capacity to do so would imply the quantum nature of gravity. In this work, a class of semi-classical models is examined that treat gravity classically, through some potential in the Schr\"odinger equation, and it is shown that these models do not generate entanglement. This class includes the Newton-Schr\"odinger model, where gravity is sourced by the wave function, the Bohmian analogue, where gravity is sourced by actual point-particles, and an interpolating model proposed by D\"oner and Grossardt. These models are analyzed in the context of the proposed experiment and contrasted with the standard Newtonian potential, which does generate entanglement.</description>

      <title>Matching conditions at null infinity in the presence of logarithms: the role of advanced and retarded radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new perspective on the general matching conditions between the future of past null infinity and the past of future null infinity, emphasizing the impact of dominant logarithmic terms in the asymptotic expansion of the fields near null infinity. We explicitly consider the cases of a massless scalar field and of electromagnetism. Key in our derivation is the identification of the physical origin of these logarithms, which are associated with advanced and retarded radiation saturating the finite energy flux condition at null infinity (in a space of functions which is made precise). The matching conditions arise then from the requirement of Coulombic (i.e., $1/r$) behaviour at spatial infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been a long entertained idea that self-bound gravitons, so-called geons, could be a dark matter candidate or form (primordial) black holes. The development of viable candidates for quantum gravity allows now to investigate these ideas. Analytic methods show that the description of geons needs to be based on composite operators made out of the graviton field. We present results from a numerical investigation into this idea using causal dynamical triangulations, an ab-initio non-perturbative definition of quantum gravity based on general relativity, and accessible in lattice-gauge-theory-like simulations. Our results suggest an interesting dependence on cosmological time and other unexpected features. Finally, we extend the analytic part of the setting to a supergravity scenario. This provides hints which, if confirmed, could explain why supersymmetry may in a realistic universe in principle not be observable at low (collider) energy scales.</description>

Abstract: We recently described a cosmological quantum spacetime of vanishing spatial curvature, which can be considered as background for the IKKT matrix model, assuming that the resulting gauge theory couples weakly. Building on this example, we construct a large class of spatially flat cosmological quantum spacetimes. We also elaborate on various details of their algebraic and semi-classical structure as well as the higher spin modes present in these models. In particular, we introduce the notion of approximate diffeomorphisms on the cosmological quantum spacetimes that stem from gauge transformations of the underlying matrix model, and investigate how different gauges are related in the semi-classical regime by approximate diffeomorphisms. Finally, we briefly outline how the described quantum spacetimes could be incorporated into the full IKKT model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from the sound shell model: direct and inverse phase transitions in the early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological phase transitions are a frequent phenomenon in particle physics models beyond the Standard Model, and the corresponding gravitational wave signal offers a key probe of new physics in the early Universe. Depending on the underlying microphysics, the transition can exhibit either direct or inverse hydrodynamics, leading to a different phenomenology. Most studies to date have focused on direct transitions, where the cosmic fluid is pushed or dragged by the expanding vacuum bubbles. In contrast, inverse phase transitions are characterized by fluid profiles where the plasma is sucked in by the expanding bubbles. Using the sound shell model, we derive and compare the gravitational wave spectra from sound waves for direct and inverse phase transitions, providing new insights into the potential observable features and the possibility of discriminating among the various fluid solutions in gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) in the vicinity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident detection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Synergy between CSST and third-generation gravitational-wave detectors: Inferring cosmological parameters using cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) events are generally believed to originate in galaxies and can thus serve, like galaxies, as tracers of the universe's large-scale structure. In GW observations, waveform analysis provides direct measurements of luminosity distances; however, the redshifts of GW sources cannot be determined due to the mass-redshift degeneracy. By cross-correlating GW events with galaxies, one can establish a correspondence between luminosity distance and redshift shells, enabling cosmological inference. In this work, we explore the scientific potential of cross-correlating GW sources detected by third-generation (3G) ground-based GW detectors with the photometric redshift survey of the China Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). We find that the constraint precisions of the Hubble constant and the matter density parameter can reach $1.04\%$ and $2.04\%$, respectively. The GW clustering bias parameters $A_{\rm GW}$ and $\gamma$ can be constrained to $1.52\%$ and $4.67\%$, respectively. These results highlight the significant potential of the synergy between CSST and 3G ground-based GW detectors in constraining cosmological models and probing GW source formation channels using cross-correlation of dark sirens and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Sco X-1 as a continuous gravitational waves source: modelling the secular evolution using MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform- and progenitor- parameters. We study the evolution of different Sco X-1 progenitors, identifying those that give rise to detectable signals. We model the spin evolution of the neutron star (NS) by the accretion torque and the GW torque. We consider two mechanisms for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the GW torque: i) magnetic mountains and ii) deformation after crustal breakage. Both torques are intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA, starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G (Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs, with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on $\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust does not break. When $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with $M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70% all crusts break. In some systems the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase. If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies. We estimate current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability increases substantially -- to around 41% -- with third-generation detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the computation of the shear viscosity to entropy ratio $\eta/s$ at finite chemical potential in a holographic model that takes into account the quantum fluctuations in the IR region of near-extremal black branes. Such quantum corrections can be computed from JT gravity and generate non-trivial temperature dependence for $\eta/s$, which deviates from the universal $1/4\pi$ result. In the semi-classical regime, $\eta/s$ attains a minimum which is below the KSS bound, generated by the presence of the quantum effects. In the quantum regime at lower temperatures, $\eta/s$ increases and is well above the KSS bound. We also compare the shear viscosity to the quantum-corrected absorption cross-section of near-extremal black holes, and find agreement.</description>

      <title>DESI constraints on two-field quintessence with exponential potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a quintessence model involving two scalar fields with double-exponential potentials. This configuration allows the system as a whole to emulate the dynamics of a single field with a shallower potential, enabling scalar fields that individually cannot drive cosmic acceleration to collectively achieve and sustain it. We assess the viability of this model by performing a fully Bayesian analysis and confronting its predictions with observational data, including the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) shift parameters, the newly released Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and the Dark Energy Survey Year 5 (DESY5) Type Ia supernova (SnIa) sample. Our analysis shows that the two-field quintessence model yields a log Bayes factor relative to the flat $\Lambda$CDM model of $\Delta \ln B \sim 4$, indicating moderate evidence against the latter. We also find that the central values of the two slopes of the exponential potentials are both close to 1, whereas the slope of an effective single-field system is constrained to be less than order unity. This property is theoretically desirable from the perspective of higher-dimensional theories. Thus, the two-field quintessence model with exponential potentials provides a physically motivated and compelling mechanism that is consistent with both observational and theoretical requirements.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Carrollian Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrollian physics provides the natural framework for describing null hypersurfaces. This review explores the geometry of Carrollian manifolds -- spaces endowed with a degenerate metric. We begin with an algebraic overview of the Carroll group, its conformal extension, and its relation to the BMS group. Then, in the core of the review, we follow the standard pseudo-Riemannian narrative: metric $\to$ connection $\to$ curvature. We first introduce the modern, general definition of a Carrollian structure, the analogue of the metric on such manifolds, reviewing the historical developments, symmetries, and link with the algebraic groups. The second part concerns connections. We show the breakdown of the Levi-Civita theorem in the Carrollian setting and construct the most general intrinsic Carrollian connection. A preferred connection is then identified intrinsically and later shown to coincide with the one induced by embedding a null hypersurface in an ambient spacetime. The third part develops the associated curvature tensors. We include novel results presented here for the first time.
  Two advanced topics highlight the broader scope of this framework. The first treats null hypersurfaces via the rigging technique, deriving the induced geometry from the ambient space. This provides a unified language for spacelike, timelike, and null hypersurfaces, and shows that the induced rigged connection exactly reproduces the intrinsic Carrollian one. From this, the Gauss and Codazzi-Mainardi equations follow, and the Einstein equations emerge as conservation laws for the null Brown-York stress tensor. The second topic extends the Carrollian setup to generic, non-null hypersurfaces, enabling a smooth null limit and completing the unified geometric description of hypersurfaces of all causal characters.</description>

      <title>Imprint of the black hole singularity on thermal two-point functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-point functions of light fields at finite temperature and large real frequencies in holographic theories. The thermal system is dual to a single-sided AdS black hole. We show that the high-frequency expansion obtained from the Operator Product Expansion receives nonperturbative corrections, which are controlled by null geodesics bouncing off the black hole singularity in the two-sided eternal black hole geometry. We develop a bulk WKB description of these bouncing geodesics and explain how to calculate reflection coefficients at the singularity.</description>

      <title>Kosmic Field Theories: Towards Holographic Duals for Unitary String Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on cosmological amplitudes has established reality conditions (derived from unitarity) for general particle-creation processes in flat FLRW cosmologies, in the Bunch-Davies wavefunction. In light of these results, we propose a new class of large-$N$ holographic gauge theories with $d$ spatial dimensions, which we call Kosmic Field Theories (KFTs), of which only a subset are conformal (KCFTs). By imposing an appropriate -- $d$ dependent -- complex phase for the number of colours $N$ and the t' Hooft coupling $\lambda$, we show that the complex phases of $n$-point functions in a KFT match the reality conditions required by $d + 1$ bulk unitarity, to all orders in bulk and boundary perturbation theory, including loop diagrams. Since $N^2/\lambda$ is imaginary in all dimensions, the class of (parity-even) KFTs has no overlap with the class of Wick rotations of unitary QFTs. We also make a preliminary investigation of positivity conditions, which might constrain the overall $\pm$ sign of $N^2$ and $\lambda$.
  Although SU($N$) models with adjoint matter can be defined in generic real dimensions $d$, several features of the class of KFTs are nicer when $d$ is odd, allowing $N^2$ to be real. This includes the possibility of non-oriented and/or open string duals, reality of the effective number of degrees of freedom, and closure under RG flow beyond the leading order in a $1/N$ expansion. This could explain why we live in a cosmology with an even number of spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth, mergers, and tidal disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole, possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption events and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.</description>

      <title>Application of Non-Linear Noise Regression in the Virgo Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06220v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents the first demonstration of non-linear noise regression in the Virgo detector using deep learning techniques. We use DeepClean, a convolutional autoencoder previously shown to be effective in denoising LIGO data, as our tool for modeling and subtracting environmental and technical noise in Virgo. The method uses auxiliary witness channels to learn correlated noise features and remove them from the strain data. For this study, we apply DeepClean to Virgo O3b data, using 225 witness channels selected across 13 targeted frequency bands. Our analysis confirms the presence of non-linear couplings in the subtracted noise, highlighting the importance of DeepClean-like tools in capturing such effects. We observe up to a 1.3 Mpc improvement in the binary neutron star inspiral range (~2.5% gain), and an average increase of 1.7% in the recovered signal-to-noise ratio for injected binary black hole signals. Parameter estimation studies further confirm that DeepClean does not introduce bias in the recovery of source parameters. These results demonstrate the robustness of DeepClean on Virgo data and support its adoption in real-time noise subtraction frameworks for future observing runs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole solution in the scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet $4d$ gravitational model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the sEGB $4d$ gravitational model with a scalar field $\varphi\left(u\right)$, Einstein and Gauss-Bonnet terms. The model action contains a potential term $U\left(\varphi\right)$, a Gauss-Bonnet coupling function $f\left(\varphi\right)$ and a parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$, where $\varepsilon = 1$ corresponds to the usual scalar field, and $\varepsilon = -1$ to the phantom field. In this paper, the sEGB reconstruction procedure considered in our previous paper is applied to the metric of the Ellis-Bronnikov solution, which describes a massive wormhole in the model with a phantom field (and zero potential). For this metric, written in the Buchdal parameterization with a radial variable $u$, we find a solution of the master equation for $ f\left(\varphi\left(u\right)\right)$ with the integration (reconstruction) parameter $C_0$. We also find expressions for $U\left(\varphi\left(u\right)\right)$ and $\varepsilon \dot{\varphi}^2 = h\left(u\right)$ for $\varepsilon = \pm 1$. We prove that for all non-trivial values of the parameter $C_0 \neq 0$ the function $h\left(u\right)$ is not of constant sign for all admissible $u \in \left(-\infty , +\infty\right)$. This means that for a fixed value of the parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$ there is no non-trivial sEGB reconstruction in which the scalar field is a purely ordinary field ($\varepsilon = 1$) or a purely phantom field ($\varepsilon = - 1$).</description>

When an infinite tower of corrections is considered, these theories allow for cosmological models in which the Big Bang singularity is replaced by an inflationary phase in the early-universe, and they also admit a specific class of regular black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Prospects for High-Frequency Gravitational-Wave Detection with GEO600</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current ground-based interferometers are optimized for sensitivity from a few tens of Hz to about 1 kHz. While they are not currently utilized for GW detection, interferometric detectors also feature narrow bands of strong sensitivity at higher frequencies where the sideband fields created by a GW are resonantly amplified in the optical system. For certain interferometer configurations, small changes to system parameters allow the narrow band of high sensitivity to be scanned over a much larger range of frequencies, potentially enabling broadband detection at high frequencies. In this paper, we investigate whether simply modifying the detuning angle of the signal-recycling mirror of the GEO600 interferometer can make this experiment sensitive to GWs in the kilohertz frequency range. We compute the strain sensitivity for GEO600 across a frequency range from several kHz to tens of kHz for various detuning angles. We also show that LIGO cannot attain the same effect assuming that the optical components are not changed due to the narrow band response of the Fabry-Perot cavities. We then calculate the sensitivity of GEO600 to various proposed high-frequency GW sources and compare it to the sensitivity of other ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Phantom Crossing and Oscillating Dark Energy with $F(R)$ Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we shall consider how a dynamical oscillating and phantom crossing dark energy era can be realized in the context of $F(R)$ gravity. We approach the topic from a theoretical standpoint considering all the conditions that may lead to a consistent phantom crossing behavior and separately how the $F(R)$ gravity context may realize oscillating dark energy era. Apart from our qualitative considerations, we study in a quantitative way two $F(R)$ gravity dark energy models which are viable cosmologically and also exhibit simultaneously phantom crossing behavior and also oscillating dark energy. We consider these models by solving numerically the field equations using appropriate statefinder parameters engineered for dark energy studies. As we show, $F(R)$ provides a natural extension of Einstein's general relativity which can naturally realize a transition from a phantom era to a quintessential era, a feature supported by recent observational data, without resorting to phantom scalar fields to realize the phantom evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11800v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Addressing the late-time accelerated expansion of the universe, known as the "dark energy problem", remains a central challenge in cosmology. While the cosmological constant is the standard explanation, alternative models such as quintessence, phantom fluids, and Chaplygin gas have been proposed. This work investigates the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model, which is characterized by a polytropic equation of state. We explore this model within the framework of an anisotropic fluid, by means of a metric that reduces to the standard form of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spacetime at cosmological scales. To assess the model's viability, we derive analytical expressions for the scale factor, the Hubble parameter, and the deceleration parameter. Finally, the model is tested against observational data to constrain its parameters and evaluate its consistency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16647v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain rotating black hole solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations with the cosmological constant. There are eight parameters in the solutions. They are the physical mass $M$, the electric charge $Q$, the specific angular momentum $a$, the acceleration $\alpha$, the cosmological constant $\lambda$ and other three parameters, $S_1\;, S_2$ and $S_3$. We show that $S_3$ and $S_1$ are actually the well-known NUT charge and the rescaled parameter $C$, respectively, for the Kerr-NUT spacetime. As for $S_2$, it is a new parameter although it has the same physical meaning of $C$ in the weak field limit. In the case of static limit, $S_2$ describes a conical defect along the axis of revolution, which corresponds to a cosmic string of tension. Therefore, the solutions extend the accelerating Kerr-Newman-NUT-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Pulsar timing array analysis in a Legendre polynomial basis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use Legendre polynomials, previously employed in this context by Lee et al. [1], van Haasteren and Levin [2], and Pitrou and Cusin [3], to model signals in pulsar timing arrays (PTA). These replace the (Fourier mode) basis of trigonometric functions normally used for data analysis. The Legendre basis makes it simpler to incorporate pulsar modeling effects, which remove constant-, linear-, and quadratic-in-time terms from pulsar timing residuals. In the Legendre basis, this zeroes the amplitudes of the the first three Legendre polynomials. We use this basis to construct an optimal quadratic cross-correlation estimator $\widehat{\mu}$ of the Hellings and Downs (HD) correlation and compute its variance $\sigma^2_{\widehat{\mu}}$ in the way described by Allen and Romano [4]. Remarkably, if the gravitational-wave background (GWB) and pulsar noise power spectra are (sums of) power laws in frequency, then in this basis one obtains analytic closed forms for many quantities of interest.</description>

Abstract: The locally defined Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Translations and Carroll boosts associated with two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe the motions. The Displacement Memory Effect arises for particular choices of the parameters which yield trajectories with zero momentum. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Stability of Rotating Hairy Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating hairy black holes (RHBHs) are axisymmetric equilibrium solutions of the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, consisting of a spinning black hole surrounded by a toroidal distribution of complex scalar field. Despite their potential astrophysical relevance, the stability of these configurations -- naturally expected to form through superradiant growth of light bosonic fields -- remains uncertain. In this work, we investigate the stability of RHBHs by performing fully non-linear numerical evolutions of several configurations that differ in the relative mass contribution of the scalar-field torus. We find that configurations in which the scalar field mass is subdominant compared to the black hole mass remain stable throughout the evolution. In contrast, when the scalar-field mass dominates, the system develops an instability akin to the non-axisymmetric instability observed in rotating boson stars. Given the expected limits on the scalar-field mass growth achievable through superradiance, our results suggest that rotating hairy black holes formed predominantly by this process are expected to be stable.</description>

We suggest that the formation of the E8 lattice in 8-dimensions, from which three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals derive by projection, occurs without dimensionally restricting the degrees of freedom of the quaternion orientational order parameter to the quaternion plane. This is different from the development of regular crystalline solids in three-dimensions, which occurs in "restricted dimensions" and requires topological-ordering, as previously discussed by the authors. In other words, herein, the formation of lattices in eight-dimensions is considered as a higher-dimensional analogy to the formation of "bulk" superfluidity. It follows that, the solidification of lattices in 8-dimensions (and derivative icosahedral quasicrystalline solids) should occur without the necessity of topological defects.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for Poincar\'e-Einstein Fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-linear Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the Poincar\'e-Einstein filling problem. For even dimensional manifolds the range of this non-local map is described in terms of a rank two "Dirichlet-to Neumann tensor" along the boundary determined by the Poincar\'e-Einstein metric. This tensor is proportional to the variation of renormalized volume along a path of Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics. We construct natural "Dirichlet-to-Neumann hypersurface invariants" that are conformally invariant and recover all Dirichlet-to-Neumann tensors. We give an explicit formula for these hypersurface invariants and use a new vanishing result for odd order $T$-curvatures to show that they are the unique, natural conformal hypersurface invariant of transverse order equaling the boundary dimension. We also construct such conformally invariant Dirichlet-to-Neumann hypersurface invariants for Poincar\'e-Einstein fillings for odd dimensional manifolds with conformally flat boundary.</description>

      <title>Localization of $q$-form field on squared curvature gravity domain wall brane coupling with gravity and background scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike the duality in four-dimensional spacetime, where the $q-$form fields corresponds to the scalar fields or the vector fields, in higher dimensional spacetime, they denote new types of particles. In this paper, we investigate the localization of the KK modes of the $q$-form fields in a five dimensional brane world. We introduce the coupling between the $q-$form fields and both the gravity and the background scalar field. This consideration enables the localization of the $q$-form fields on the five-dimensional RS-2 thick brane, leading to the derivation of zero modes, Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations, and a four-dimensional effective action. We suggest a new function $F(R,\varphi)$ to stand for the coupling of the $q$-form field with gravity and background scalar fields. Our analysis highlights the significance of the parameters $\text C_2$ and $\displaystyle t$ in the localization processes.</description>

      <title>A Renormalization Group Analysis of the Ising Model Coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix model characterizing the Ising model coupled to Causal Dynamical Triangulations (CDT) from the point of view of the Functional Renormalization Group Equation (FRGE). This model is a dually weighted matrix model, whose Feynman diagrams are in correspondence with discrete triangulations of two-dimensional geometries with a preferred time foliation. In particular, we find the fixed points of the beta-function equations, showing that the number of relevant directions in each case is compatible with the physical interpretation of the CFT at the fixed point. In addition to recovering the fixed points for topological gravity and pure gravity with a cosmological constant, we find a new fixed point featuring three relevant directions which matches the number of primary fields in the Ising CFT.</description>

      <title>Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}/D_{\text{A}}(z)(1+z)^{-2} = 1$, making it a powerful probe to check a potential variation of fundamental constants. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2.6$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</description>

      <title>Bispectrum Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the amplitude bootstrap program, the spirit of this work is to constrain the space of consistent inflationary correlation functions - specifically, the bispectrum of curvature perturbations - using fundamental principles such as unitarity, locality, analyticity, and symmetries. To this end, we assume a setup for inflation in which de Sitter isometries are only mildly broken by the slow roll of the inflaton field, and study the bispectrum imprinted by a generic hidden sector during inflation. Assuming that the hidden sector's contributions to primordial non-Gaussianity are dominated by the exchange of a scalar operator (which does not preclude high-spin UV completions), we derive nontrivial positivity constraints on the resulting bispectrum $B(k_1,k_2,k_3)$. In particular, we show that $B$ must be negative in a certain region around the equilateral configuration. For instance, for isosceles triangles (with $k_2=k_3$) this region is given by $0.027\lesssim k_3/k_1\leq 2$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that unitarity imposes upper and lower bounds on the bispectrum shape, thereby carving out a Bispectrum Island where consistent shapes in our setup can reside. We complement our analysis by contemplating alternative setups where the coupling to the hidden sector is allowed to strongly break de Sitter boosts. We also identify situations that would push the bispectrum off the island and the profound physical features they would reveal.</description>

      <title>Generalized Unitarity Method for Worldline Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized unitarity method for theories of point-particle worldlines coupled to gravity, analogous to that of scattering amplitudes in quantum field theory. This method allows the computation of perturbative observables from basic principles such as locality and unitarity, thus avoiding gauge redundancies and the use of Feynman diagrams. We illustrate the method with a variety of examples, including the gravitational waveform for the scattering of two point masses at next-to-leading order (or ${\cal O}(G^{5/2})$), reproducing known results. Our method further streamlines the calculation of the scattering dynamics of compact binary systems and opens the door to further applications and systematical exploration of structure in this class of observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections in the Low-Temperature Fluid/Gravity Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attempts to construct a low-temperature version of the fluid/gravity correspondence have faced obstacles manifested in the form of logarithmic terms in the frequency, $\log(\omega)$, leading to non-local in time constitutive relations for the stress tensor and the charge current. These difficulties can be broadly presented as a breakdown of the hydrodynamic description due to additional infrared modes. We employ new quantum insights into the physics of near-extremal black holes, brought about in the context of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, as an effective description of quantum fluctuations in the throat, to revisit the fluid/gravity correspondence at very low temperatures. The quantum corrections naturally include a new length scale, $C$, and an effective action that parametrizes the breaking of near-horizon symmetries. We show that with an appropriate choice of order of limits in the derivative expansion within the low-temperature regime, the $\log(\omega)$ infrared divergence can be resolved. By quantum averaging the infrared Schwarzian modes as an effective extra contribution to the long-wavelength fluid modes, the resulting low-temperature effective fluid description is consistent. We present the dispersion relations for all the relevant hydrodynamic modes. We also revisit the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio and find that at very low temperatures the universal $\frac{1}{4\pi}$ bound is violated due to quantum correction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the new version of FeynGrav, a package that provides a set of tools to work with Feynman rules for gravity models. The new version addresses two principal issues and includes changes that improve user experience. Firstly, we present a more sophisticated implementation of the BRST formalism for general relativity and quadratic gravity, which results in a finite set of interaction rules between ghosts and gravitons. We also implement a realisation of a higher derivative gauge fixing term for quadratic gravity. Secondly, we implement Feynman rules for Cheung-Remmen variables. These variables present the general relativity action in a polynomial form and produce a finite set of Feynman rules. Lastly, we introduce some minor quality-of-life changes to the package to improve the user experience.</description>

      <title>Perturbations and Greybody Factors of AdS Black Holes with a Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Quintessence-like Field in NLED Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of gravitational waves and advances in black hole imaging have opened new opportunities to probe exotic physics in strong-field regimes. Building upon a recent black hole solution in Einstein gravity coupled with nonlinear electrodynamics and exotic matter sources-specifically a cloud of strings and a quintessence field--we study the perturbative dynamics, thermodynamic behavior, and quantum transmission characteristics in anti-de Sitter spacetime. The black hole, defined by its mass, nonlinear magnetic charge, string cloud, and quintessence parameters, exhibits modified spacetime geometry, horizon structure, Hawking temperature, and effective potentials governing field propagation. We derive Schr\"{o}dinger-like equations for massless scalar, electromagnetic, and fermionic perturbations, exploring how these sources jointly shape the potential barriers. The Hawking temperature shows strong dependence on the horizon radius and nonlinear charge, differing markedly from asymptotically flat cases due to the cosmological constant. Greybody factors, describing Hawking radiation transmission probabilities, are computed for all field spins via turning point analysis. A notable result arises in the fermionic sector: positive and negative helicity modes attain maximal transmission at distinct quintessence normalization values, revealing helicity-dependent coupling absent in bosonic channels. This asymmetry suggests a potential observational signature of spin-exotic matter interactions, offering new insights into detecting quintessence through black hole radiation spectra. Our results extend previous perturbative analyses by incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics, cosmic strings, and quintessence effects--linking quantum radiation studies to gravitational wave astronomy and early-universe cosmology.</description>
