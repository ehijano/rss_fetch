      <title>Application of first- and second-order adjoint methods to glacial isostatic adjustment incorporating rotational feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits and extends the adjoint theory for glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) of Crawford et al. (2018). Rotational feedbacks are now incorporated, and the application of the second-order adjoint method is described for the first time. The first-order adjoint method provides an efficient means for computing sensitivity kernels for a chosen objective functional, while the second-order adjoint method provides second-derivative information in the form of Hessian kernels. These latter kernels are required by efficient Newton-type optimisation schemes and within methods for quantifying uncertainty for non-linear inverse problems. Most importantly, the entire theory has been reformulated so as to simplify its implementation by others within the GIA community. In particular, the rate-formulation for the GIA forward problem introduced by Crawford et al. (2018) has been replaced with the conventional equations for modelling GIA in laterally heterogeneous earth models. The implementation of the first- and second-order adjoint problems should be relatively easy within both existing and new GIA codes, with only the inclusions of more general force terms being required.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Graded Denoising of Seismic Data Based on Noise Estimation and Local Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismic data denoising is an important part of seismic data processing, which directly relate to the follow-up processing of seismic data. In terms of this issue, many authors proposed many methods based on rank reduction, sparse transformation, domain transformation, and deep learning. However, when the seismic data is noisy, complex and uneven, these methods often lead to over-denoising or under-denoising. To solve this problems, we proposed a novel method called noise level estimation and similarity segmentation for graded denoising. Specifically, we first assessed the average noise level of the entire seismic data and denoised it using block matching and three-dimensional filtering (BM3D) methods. Then, the denoised data is contrasted with the residual using local similarity, pinpointing regions where noise levels deviate significantly from the average. The remaining data is retained intact. These areas are then re-evaluated and denoised. Finally, we integrated the data retained after the first denoising with the re-denoising data to get a complete and cleaner data. This method is verified on theoretical model and actual seismic data. The experimental results show that this method has a good effect on seismic data with uneven noise.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Vehicle-Induced Distributed Acoustic Sensing Signals for Accurate Urban Near-Surface Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous seismic monitoring of the near-surface structure is crucial for urban infrastructure safety, aiding in the detection of sinkholes, subsidence, and other seismic hazards. Utilizing existing telecommunication optical fibers as Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) systems offers a cost-effective method for creating dense seismic arrays in urban areas. DAS leverages roadside fiber-optic cables to record vehicle-induced surface waves for near-surface imaging. However, the influence of roadway vehicle characteristics on their induced surface waves and the resulting imaging of near-surface structures is poorly understood. We investigate surface waves generated by vehicles of varying weights and speeds to provide insights into accurate and efficient near-surface characterization. We first classify vehicles into light, mid-weight, and heavy based on the maximum amplitudes of quasi-static DAS records. Vehicles are also classified by their traveling speed using their arrival times at DAS channels. To investigate how vehicle characteristics influence the induced surface waves, we extract phase velocity dispersion and invert the subsurface structure for each vehicle class by retrieving virtual shot gathers (VSGs). Our results reveal that heavy vehicles produce higher signal-to-noise ratio surface waves, and a sevenfold increase in vehicle weight can reduce uncertainties in phase velocity measurements from dispersion spectra by up to 3X. Thus, data from heavy vehicles better constrain structures at greater depths. Additionally, with driving speeds ranging from 5 to 30 meters per second in our study, differences in the dispersion curves due to vehicle speed are less pronounced than those due to vehicle weight. Our results suggest judiciously selecting and processing surface wave signals from certain vehicle types can improve the quality of near-surface imaging in urban environments.</description>

      <title>The limitations of a standard phase-field model in reproducing jointing in sedimentary rock layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological applications of phase-field methods for fracture are notably scarce. This work conducts a numerical examination of the applicability of standard phase-field models in reproducing jointing within sedimentary layers. We explore how the volumetric-deviatoric split alongside the AT1 and AT2 phase-field formulations have several advantages in simulating jointing, but also have intrinsic limitations that prevent a reliable quantitative analysis of rock fracture. The formulations qualitatively reproduce the process of joint saturation, along with the negative correlation between joint spacing and the height of the sedimentary layer. However, in quantitative comparison to alternative numerical methods and outcrop observations, the phase-field method overestimates joint spacings by a factor of 2 and induces unrealistic compressive fractures in the AT1 model, alongside premature shearing at layer interfaces for the AT2 model. The causes are identified to be intrinsic to the phase-field lengthscale and the unsuitable strength envelope arising from the Volumetric-Deviatoric split. Finally, our analysis elucidates on the phase-field lengthscale's distortion of the stress field around dilating fractures, causing the sedimentary layer to reach joint saturation prematurely, thereby stopping the nucleation of new fractures and leading to larger joint spacings than in natural examples. Decreasing the lengthscale results in gradual improvement but becomes prohibitively computationally expensive for very small lengthscales such that the limit of ``natural'' behavior was not reached in this study. Overall, our results motivate the development of constitutive phase-field models that are more suitable for geological applications and their benchmarking against geological observations.</description>

      <title>Jamming, Yielding, and Rheology during Submerged Granular Avalanche</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jamming transitions and the rheology of granular avalanches in fluids are investigated using experiments and numerical simulations. Simulations use the lattice-Boltzmann method coupled with the discrete element method, providing detailed stress and deformation data. Both simulations and experiments present a perfect match with each other in carefully conducted deposition experiments, validating the simulation method. We analyze transient rheological laws and jamming transitions using our recently introduced length-scale ratio $G$. $G$ serves as a unified metric for the pressure and shear rate capturing the dynamics of sheared fluid-granular systems. Two key transition points, $G_{Y}$ and $G_{0}$, categorize the material's state into solid-like, creeping, and fluid-like states. Yielding at $G_{Y}$ marks the transition from solid-like to creeping, while $G_{0}$ signifies the shift to the fluid-like state. The $\mu-G$ relationship converges towards the equilibrium $\mu_{eq}(G)$ after $G&gt;G_0$ showing the critical point where the established rheological laws for steady states apply during transient conditions.</description>
