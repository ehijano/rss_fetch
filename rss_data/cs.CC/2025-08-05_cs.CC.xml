      <title>Towards EXPTIME One Way Functions: Bloom Filters, Succinct Graphs, Cliques, &amp; Self Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider graphs of n nodes, and use a Bloom filter of length 2 log3 n bits. An edge between nodes i and j, with i &lt; j, turns on a certain bit of the Bloom filter according to a hash function on i and j. Pick a set of log n nodes and turn on all the bits of the Bloom filter required for these log n nodes to form a clique. As a result, the Bloom filter implies the existence of certain other edges, those edges (x, y), with x &lt; y, such that all the bits selected by applying the hash functions to x and y happen to have been turned on due to hashing the clique edges into the Bloom filter.
  Constructing the graph consisting of the clique-selected edges and those edges mapped to the turned-on bits of the Bloom filter can be performed in polynomial time in n. Choosing a large enough polylogarithmic in n Bloom filter yields that the graph has only one clique of size log n, the planted clique. When the hash function is black-boxed, finding that clique is intractable and, therefore, inverting the function that maps log n nodes to a graph is not (likely to be) possible in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Proof of Hiding Conjecture in Gaussian Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian boson sampling (GBS) is a promising protocol for demonstrating quantum computational advantage. One of the key steps for proving classical hardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one can ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of Haar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove the hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed states, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen et al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states that a $o(\sqrt{M})\times o(\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\times M$ circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex Gaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\to\infty$. This is the first rigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant regime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a maximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the conventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143 (2013)].</description>

      <title>Forrelation is Extremally Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Forrelation problem is a central problem that demonstrates an exponential separation between quantum and classical capabilities. In this problem, given query access to $n$-bit Boolean functions $f$ and $g$, the goal is to estimate the Forrelation function $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)$, which measures the correlation between $g$ and the Fourier transform of $f$.
  In this work we provide a new linear algebraic perspective on the Forrelation problem, as opposed to prior analytic approaches. We establish a connection between the Forrelation problem and bent Boolean functions and through this connection, analyze an extremal version of the Forrelation problem where the goal is to distinguish between extremal instances of Forrelation, namely $(f,g)$ with $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=1$ and $\mathrm{forr}(f,g)=-1$.
  We show that this problem can be solved with one quantum query and success probability one, yet requires $\tilde{\Omega}\left(2^{n/4}\right)$ classical randomized queries, even for algorithms with a one-third failure probability, highlighting the remarkable power of one exact quantum query. We also study a restricted variant of this problem where the inputs $f,g$ are computable by small classical circuits and show classical hardness under cryptographic assumptions.</description>

      <title>On the Counting Complexity of the Skolem Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Skolem Problem asks, given an integer linear recurrence sequence (LRS), to determine whether the sequence contains a zero term or not. Its decidability is a longstanding open problem in theoretical computer science and automata theory. Currently, decidability is only known for LRS of order at most 4. On the other hand, the sole known complexity result is NP-hardness, due to Blondel and Portier.
  A fundamental result in this area is the celebrated Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem, which asserts that the zero set of any LRS is the union of a finite set and finitely many arithmetic progressions. This paper focuses on a computational perspective of the Skolem-Mahler-Lech theorem: we show that the problem of counting the zeros of a given LRS is #P-hard, and in fact #P-complete for the instances generated in our reduction.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithm for Sparse Fourier Transform of Generalized $q$-ary Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computing the Fourier transform of a $q$-ary function $f:\mathbb{Z}_{q}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, which maps $q$-ary sequences to real numbers, is an important problem in mathematics with wide-ranging applications in biology, signal processing, and machine learning. Previous studies have shown that, under the sparsity assumption, the Fourier transform can be computed efficiently using fast and sample-efficient algorithms. However, in most practical settings, the function is defined over a more general space -- the space of generalized $q$-ary sequences $\mathbb{Z}_{q_1} \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_2} \times \cdots \times \mathbb{Z}_{q_n}$ -- where each $\mathbb{Z}_{q_i}$ corresponds to integers modulo $q_i$. Herein, we develop GFast, a coding theoretic algorithm that computes the $S$-sparse Fourier transform of $f$ with a sample complexity of $O(Sn)$, computational complexity of $O(Sn \log N)$, and a failure probability that approaches zero as $N=\prod_{i=1}^n q_i \rightarrow \infty$ with $S = N^\delta$ for some $0 \leq \delta &lt; 1$. We show that a noise-robust version of GFast computes the transform with a sample complexity of $O(Sn^2)$ and computational complexity of $O(Sn^2 \log N)$ under the same high probability guarantees. Additionally, we demonstrate that GFast computes the sparse Fourier transform of generalized $q$-ary functions $8\times$ faster using $16\times$ fewer samples on synthetic experiments, and enables explaining real-world heart disease diagnosis and protein fitness models using up to $13\times$ fewer samples compared to existing Fourier algorithms applied to the most efficient parameterization of the models as $q$-ary functions.</description>

      <title>Certificate-Sensitive Subset Sum: Realizing Instance Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present, to our knowledge, the first deterministic, certificate-sensitive algorithm for a canonical NP-complete problem whose runtime provably adapts to the structure of each input. For a Subset-Sum instance $(S, t)$, let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of distinct subset sums and define $U = |\Sigma(S)|$. This set serves as an information-theoretically minimal witness, the instance-complexity (IC) certificate.
  Our solver, IC-SubsetSum, enumerates every element of $\Sigma(S)$ in deterministic time $O(U \cdot n^2)$ and space $O(U \cdot n)$. A randomized variant achieves expected runtime $O(U \cdot n)$. The algorithm's complexity is thus directly governed by the certificate size, and this structure-sensitive performance is paired with a guaranteed worst-case runtime of $O^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the first such result to strictly outperform classical methods on every instance.
  We revisit fine-grained reductions that rely on the classical $2^{n/2}$ hardness of SubsetSum and show that these arguments hold only for collision-free instances where $U$ is maximal. IC-SubsetSum reframes this barrier structurally and introduces a new paradigm for certificate-sensitive algorithms across NP-complete problems.</description>

      <title>Convergence and efficiency proof of quantum imaginary time evolution for bounded order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many current and near-future applications of quantum computing utilise parametric families of quantum circuits and variational methods to find optimal values for these parameters. Solving a quantum computational problem with such variational methods relies on minimising some cost function, e.g., the energy of a physical system. As such, this is similar to the training process in machine learning and variational quantum simulations can therefore suffer from similar problems encountered in machine learning training. This includes non-convergence to the global minimum due to local minima as well as critical slowing down. In this article, we analyse the imaginary time evolution as a means of compiling parametric quantum circuits and finding optimal parameters, and show that it guarantees convergence to the global minimum without critical slowing down. We also show that the compilation process, including the task of finding optimal parameters, can be performed efficiently up to an arbitrary error threshold if the underlying physical system is of bounded order. This includes many relevant computational problems, e.g., local physical theories and combinatorial optimisation problems such as the flight-to-gate assignment problem. In particular, we show a priori estimates on the success probability for these combinatorial optimisation problems. There seem to be no known classical methods with similar efficiency and convergence guarantees. Meanwhile the imaginary time evolution method can be implemented on current quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Landauer Principle and Thermodynamics of Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Landauer principle, any logically irreversible process accompanies entropy production, which results in heat dissipation in the environment. Erasing of information, one of the primary logically irreversible processes, has a lower bound on heat dissipated into the environment, called the Landauer bound (LB). However, the practical erasure processes dissipate much more heat than the LB. Recently, there have been a few experimental investigations to reach this bound both in the classical and quantum domains. There has also been a spate of activities to enquire about this LB in finite time, with finite-size heat baths, non-Markovian and nonequilibrium environments in the quantum regime, where the effects of fluctuations and correlation of the systems with the bath can no longer be ignored. This article provides a comprehensive review of the recent progress on the Landauer bound, which serves as a fundamental principle in the thermodynamics of computation. We also provide a perspective for future endeavors in these directions.
  Furthermore, we review the recent explorations toward establishing energetic bounds of a computational process. We also discuss the thermodynamic aspects of error correction, which is an indispensable part of information processing and computations. In doing so, we briefly discuss the basics of these fields to provide a complete picture.</description>
