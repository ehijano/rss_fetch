      <title>Fair allocation of riparian water rights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take an axiomatic approach to the allocation of riparian water rights. We formalize ethical or structural properties as axioms of allocation rules. We show that several combinations of these axioms characterize focal rules implementing the principle of Territorial Integration of all Basin States in various forms. One of them connects to the Shapley value, the long-standing centerpiece of cooperative game theory. The others offer natural compromises between the polar principles of Absolute Territorial Sovereignty and Unlimited Territorial Integrity. We complete our study with an empirical application to the allocation of riparian water rights in the Nile River.</description>

      <title>(Non-)Commutative Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Commutativity is a normative criterion of aggregation and updating stating that the aggregation of expert posteriors should be identical to the update of the aggregated priors. I propose a thought experiment that raises questions about the normative appeal of Commutativity. I propose a weakened version of Commutativity and show how that assumption plays central roles in the characterization of linear belief aggregation, multiple-weight aggregation, and an aggregation rule which can be viewed as the outcome of a game played by "dual-selves," Pessimism and Optimism. Under suitable conditions, I establish equivalences between various relaxations of Commutativity and classic axioms for decision-making under uncertainty, including Independence, C-Independence, and Ambiguity Aversion.</description>

      <title>Selection pressure/Noise driven cooperative behaviour in the thermodynamic limit of repeated games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the scenario where an infinite number of players (i.e., the \textit{thermodynamic} limit) find themselves in a Prisoner's dilemma type situation, in a \textit{repeated} setting. Is it reasonable to anticipate that, in these circumstances, cooperation will emerge? This paper addresses this question by examining the emergence of cooperative behaviour, in the presence of \textit{noise} (or, under \textit{selection pressure}), in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games, involving strategies such as \textit{Tit-for-Tat}, \textit{Always Defect}, \textit{GRIM}, \textit{Win-Stay, Lose-Shift}, and others. To analyze these games, we employ a numerical Agent-Based Model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash Equilibrium Mapping (NEM) technique, both based on the \textit{1D}-Ising chain. We use \textit{game magnetization} as an indicator of cooperative behaviour. A significant finding is that for some repeated games, a discontinuity in the game magnetization indicates a \textit{first}-order \textit{selection pressure/noise}-driven phase transition. The phase transition is particular to strategies where players do not severely punish a single defection. We also observe that in these particular cases, the phase transition critically depends on the number of \textit{rounds} the game is played in the thermodynamic limit. For all five games, we find that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with game magnetization, provide crucial inputs on how cooperative behaviour can emerge in an infinite-player repeated Prisoner's dilemma game.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Value of Monitoring Structures in Stochastic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies how improved monitoring affects the limit equilibrium payoff set for stochastic games with imperfect public monitoring. We introduce a simple generalization of Blackwell garbling called weighted garbling in order to compare different monitoring structures for this class of games. Our main result is the monotonicity of the limit perfect public equilibrium (PPE) payoff set with respect to this information order. We show that the limit PPE payoff set expands when the monitoring structure gets more informative with respect to the weighted garbling order. We also show that a similar monotonicity holds for strongly symmetric equilibrium for symmetric stochastic games. Finally, we show that our weighted garbling order is useful to compare the limit PPE payoff set for different state transition laws and monitoring structures when the limit feasible payoff set is the same.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of buyer populations in fresh product markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on empirical evidences and previous studies, we introduce and mathematically study a perception-driven model for the dynamics of buyer populations in markets of perishable goods. Buyer behaviours are driven partly by some loyalty to the sellers that they previously purchased at, and partly by the sensitivity to the intrinsic attractiveness of each seller in the market. On the other hand, the sellers update they attractiveness in time according to the difference between the volume of their clientele and the mean volume of buyers in the market, optimising either their profit when this difference is favourable or their competitiveness otherwise. While this negative feedback mechanism is a source of instability that promotes oscillatory behaviour, our analysis identifies the critical features of the dynamics that are responsible for the asymptotic stability of the stationary states, both in their immediate neighbourhood and globally in phase space. Altogether, this study provides mathematical insights into the consequences of introducing feedback into buyer-seller interactions in such markets, with emphasis on identifying conditions for long term constancy of clientele volumes.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem Through Combinatorial Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To the best of our knowledge, a complete characterization of the domains that escape the famous Arrow's impossibility theorem remains an open question. We believe that different ways of proving Arrovian theorems illuminate this problem. This paper presents a new combinatorial topology proof of Arrow's theorem. In PODC 2022, Rajsbaum and Ravent\'os-Pujol proved this theorem using a combinatorial topology approach. This approach uses simplicial complexes to represent the sets of profiles of preferences and that of single preferences. These complexes grow in dimension with the number of alternatives. This makes it difficult to think about the geometry of Arrow's theorem when there are (any) finite number of voters and alternatives. Rajsbaum and Ravent\'os-Pujol (2022) use their combinatorial topology approach only for the base case of two voters and three alternatives and then proceed by induction to prove the general version. The problem with this strategy is that it is unclear how to study domain restrictions in the general case by focusing on the base case and then using induction. Instead, the present article uses the two-dimensional structure of the high-dimensional simplicial complexes (formally, the $2$$\unicode{x2013}$skeleton), yielding a new combinatorial topology proof of this theorem. Moreover, we do not assume the unrestricted domain, but a domain restriction that we call the class of polarization and diversity over triples, which includes the unrestricted domain. By doing so, we obtain a new generalization of Arrow's theorem. This shows that the combinatorial topology approach can be used to study domain restrictions in high dimensions through the $2$$\unicode{x2013}$skeleton.</description>

      <title>A Mechanism for Optimizing Media Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A mechanism is described that addresses the fundamental trade off between media producers who want to increase reach and consumers who provide attention based on the rate of utility received, and where overreach negatively impacts that rate. An optimal solution can be achieved when the media source considers the impact of overreach in a cost function used in determining the optimal distribution of content to maximize individual consumer utility and participation. The result is a Nash equilibrium between producer and consumer that is also Pareto efficient. Comparison with the literature on Recommender systems highlights the advantages of the mechanism, including identifying an optimal content volume for the consumer and improvements for optimizing with multiple objectives. A practical algorithm for generating the optimal distribution for each consumer is provided.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing Agents through Ratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study the optimal design of performance or product ratings to motivate agents' performance or investment in product quality. The principal designs a rating that maps their quality (performance) to possibly stochastic scores. Agents have private information about their abilities (cost of effort/quality) and choose their quality. The market observes the scores and offers a wage equal to the agent's expected quality [resp. ability].
  I first show that an incentive-compatible interim wage function can be induced by a rating (i.e., feasible) if and only if it is a mean-preserving spread of quality [resp. ability] in the quantile space. Thus, I reduce the principal's rating design problem to the design of a feasible interim wage. When restricted to deterministic ratings, the optimal rating design is equivalent to the optimal delegation with a participation constraint (Amador and Bagwell, 2022). Using optimal control theory, I provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which lower censorship, and particularly a simple pass/fail test, are optimal within deterministic ratings. In particular, when the principal elicits maximal effort (quality), lower censorship [resp. pass/fail] is optimal if the density is unimodal [resp. increasing]. I also solve for the optimal deterministic ratings beyond lower censorship for general distributions and preferences. For general ratings, I provide sufficient conditions under which lower censorship remains optimal. In the effort-maximizing case, a pass/fail test remains optimal if the density is increasing.</description>
