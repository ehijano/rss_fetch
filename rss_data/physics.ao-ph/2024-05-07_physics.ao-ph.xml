      <title>Atmospheric cooling of freshwater near the temperature of maximum density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform three-dimensional direct numerical simulations of surface-driven convection near the temperature of maximum density $\tilde T_{md}$. A dynamic surface boundary condition couples heat flux through the surface to the induced convection, creating a dynamic equilibrium between the surface water temperature and the convection below. In this system, we identified three convective regimes: (1) free convection when the surface water temperature is above $\tilde T_{md}$, (2) penetrative convection when the surface water temperature is below $\tilde T_{md}$ and the convection is actively mixing the fluid layer, and (3) decaying convection when the convection weakens. We then predict the transitions between these regimes. Understanding these transitions is essential for the predicting timing of ice formation in natural systems.</description>

      <title>CloudDiff: Super-resolution ensemble retrieval of cloud properties for all day using the generative diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clouds play a crucial role in the Earth's water and energy cycles, underscoring the importance of high spatiotemporal resolution data on cloud phase and properties for accurate numerical modeling and weather prediction. Currently, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provides cloud products with a spatial resolution of 1 km. However, these products suffer from a lengthy revisit cycle. This study develops a generative diffusion model (donated as CloudDiff) for super-resolution retrieval of high spatiotemporal cloud phase and properties, applicable both day and night. Leveraging 2 km spatial resolution Himawari-8 Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) thermal infrared (TIR) radiances and viewing geometry as condition, alongside daytime MODIS products as targets, the model can generate cloud phase (CLP), cloud top height (CTH), cloud optical thickness (COT), and cloud effective radius (CER) at 1 km spatial resolution and 10-minute temporal resolution. The conditional diffusion model can generate sharper images and capture finer local features than deterministic super-resolution approaches. It draws multiple samples based on the underlying probability distribution, enabling retrieval uncertainty assessment. Evaluations show agreement between cloud phase and properties derived from the CloudDiff and MODIS cloud products. The ensemble mean is found to enhance retrieval accuracy and credibility, outperforming the deterministic model.</description>

      <title>Unicorn: U-Net for Sea Ice Forecasting with Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea ice at the North Pole is vital to global climate dynamics. However, accurately forecasting sea ice poses a significant challenge due to the intricate interaction among multiple variables. Leveraging the capability to integrate multiple inputs and powerful performances seamlessly, many studies have turned to neural networks for sea ice forecasting. This paper introduces a novel deep architecture named Unicorn, designed to forecast weekly sea ice. Our model integrates multiple time series images within its architecture to enhance its forecasting performance. Moreover, we incorporate a bottleneck layer within the U-Net architecture, serving as neural ordinary differential equations with convolution operations, to capture the spatiotemporal dynamics of latent variables. Through real data analysis with datasets spanning from 1998 to 2021, our proposed model demonstrates significant improvements over state-of-the-art models in the sea ice concentration forecasting task. It achieves an average MAE improvement of 12% compared to benchmark models. Additionally, our method outperforms existing approaches in sea ice extent forecasting, achieving a classification performance improvement of approximately 18%. These experimental results show the superiority of our proposed model.</description>

      <title>Super-Earths and Earth-like Exoplanets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the last few years astronomical surveys have expanded the reach of planetary science into the realm of small and dense extrasolar worlds. These share a number of characteristics with the terrestrial and icy planetary objects of the Solar System, but keep stretching previous understanding of the known limits of planetary thermodynamics, material properties, and climate regimes. Improved compositional and thermal constraints on exoplanets below $\sim$2 Earth radii suggest efficient accretion of atmosphere-forming volatile elements in a fraction of planetary systems, pointing to rapid formation, planet-scale melting, and chemical equilibration between the core, mantle, and atmosphere of rocky and volatile-rich exoplanets. Meaningful interpretation of novel observational data from these worlds necessitates cross-disciplinary expansion of known material properties under extreme thermodynamic, non-solar conditions, and accounting for dynamic feedbacks between interior and atmospheric processes. Exploration of the atmosphere and surface composition of individual, short-period super-Earths in the next few years will enable key inferences on magma ocean dynamics, the redox state of rocky planetary mantles, and mixing between volatile and refractory phases in planetary regimes that are absent from the present-day Solar System, and reminiscent of the conditions of the prebiotic Earth. The atmospheric characterization of climate diversity and the statistical search for biosignatures on terrestrial exoplanets on temperate orbits will require space-based direct imaging surveys, capable of resolving emission features of major and trace gases in both shortwave and mid-infrared wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Geometric approaches to Lagrangian averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian averaging theories, most notably the Generalised Lagrangian Mean (GLM) theory of Andrews &amp; McIntyre (1978), have been primarily developed in Euclidean space and Cartesian coordinates. We re-interpret these theories using a geometric, coordinate-free formulation. This gives central roles to the flow map, its decomposition into mean and perturbation maps, and the momentum 1-form dual to the velocity vector. In this interpretation, the Lagrangian mean of any tensorial quantity is obtained by averaging its pull back to the mean configuration. Crucially, the mean velocity is not a Lagrangian mean in this sense. It can be defined in a variety of ways, leading to alternative Lagrangian mean formulations that include GLM and Soward &amp; Roberts' (2010) glm. These formulations share key features which the geometric approach uncovers. We derive governing equations both for the mean flow and for wave activities constraining the dynamics of the pertubations. The presentation focusses on the Boussinesq model for inviscid rotating stratified flows and reviews the necessary tools of differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Agnostic detection of large-scale weather patterns in the northern hemisphere: from blockings to teleconnections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting recurrent weather patterns and understanding the transitions between such regimes are key to advancing our knowledge on the low-frequency variability of the atmosphere and have important implications in terms of weather and climate-related risks. We adapt an analysis pipeline inspired by Markov State Modelling and detect in an unsupervised manner the dominant winter mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere weather patterns in the Atlantic and Pacific sectors. The daily 500 hPa geopotential height fields are first classified in $\sim 200$ microstates. The weather dynamics is then represented in the basis of these microstates and the slowest decaying modes are identified from the spectral properties of the transition probability matrix. These modes are defined on the basis of the nonlinear dynamical processes of the system and not as tentative metastable states as often done in Markov state analysis. In the Atlantic and Pacific sectors slow relaxation processes are mainly related to transitions between blocked regimes and zonal flow. We also find strong evidence of a dynamical regime associated with the simultaneous Atlantic-Pacific blocking. When the analysis is performed in a broader geographical region of the Atlantic sector, we discover that the slowest relaxation modes of the system are associated with transitions between dynamical regimes that resemble teleconnection patterns like the North Atlantic Oscillation and weather regimes like the Scandinavian and Greenland blocking, yet have a much stronger dynamical foundation than classical methods based e.g. on EOF analysis. Our method clarifies that, as a result of the lack of a time-scale separation in the atmospheric variability of the mid-latitudes, there is no clear-cut way to represent the atmospheric dynamics in terms of few, well-defined modes of variability.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and Parameterization Inference with Uncertainty Quantification through Differentiable Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations with uncertainty quantification. Our framework incorporates online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, facilitated by differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</description>

      <title>Environmental monitoring using orbital angular momentum mode decomposition enhanced machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric interaction with light has been an area of fascination for many researchers over the last century. Environmental conditions, such as temperature and wind speed, heavily influence the complex and rapidly varying optical distortions propagating optical fields experience. The continuous random phase fluctuations commonly make deciphering the exact origins of specific optical aberrations challenging. The generation of eddies is a major contributor to atmospheric turbulence, similar in geometric structure to optical vortices that sit at the centre of OAM beams. Decomposing the received optical fields into OAM provides a unique spatial similarity that can be used to analyse turbulent channels. In this work, we present a novel mode decomposition assisted machine learning approach that reveals trainable features in the distortions of vortex beams that allow for effective environmental monitoring. This novel technique can be used reliably with Support Vector Machine regression models to measure temperature variations of 0.49C and wind speed variations of 0.029 m/s over a 36m experimental turbulent free-space channels with controllable and verifiable temperature and wind speed with short 3s measurement. The predictable nature of these findings could indicate the presence of an underlying physical relationship between environmental conditions that lead to specific eddy formation and the OAM spiral spectra.</description>
