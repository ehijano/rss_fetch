      <title>Layered Modal ML: Syntax and Full Abstraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MetaML-style metaprogramming languages allow programmers to construct, manipulate and run code. In the presence of higher-order references for code, ensuring type safety is challenging, as free variables can escape their binders. In this paper, we present Layered Modal ML (LMML), \textit{the first metaprogramming language that supports storing and running open code under a strong type safety guarantee}. The type system utilises contextual modal types to track and reason about free variables in code explicitly.
  A crucial concern in metaprogramming-based program optimisations is whether the optimised program preserves the meaning of the original program. Addressing this question requires a notion of program equivalence and techniques to reason about it. In this paper, we provide a semantic model that captures contextual equivalence for LMML, establishing \textit{the first full abstraction result for an imperative MetaML-style language}. Our model is based on traces derived via operational game semantics, where the meaning of a program is modelled by its possible interactions with the environment. We also establish a novel closed instances of use theorem that accounts for both call-by-value and call-by-name closing substitutions.</description>

      <title>From Separate Compilation to Sound Language Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of programming languages involves complex theoretical and practical challenges, particularly when addressing modularity and reusability through language extensions. While language workbenches aim to enable modular development under the constraints of the language extension problem, one critical constraint -- separate compilation -- is often relaxed due to its complexity. However, this relaxation undermines artifact reusability and integration with common dependency systems. A key difficulty under separate compilation arises from managing attribute grammars, as extensions may introduce new attributes that invalidate previously generated abstract syntax tree structures. Existing approaches, such as the use of dynamic maps in the Neverlang workbench, favor flexibility at the cost of compile-time correctness, leading to potential runtime errors due to undefined attributes. This work addresses this issue by introducing nlgcheck, a theoretically sound static analysis tool based on data-flow analysis for the Neverlang language workbench. nlgcheck detects potential runtime errors -- such as undefined attribute accesses -- at compile time, preserving separate compilation while maintaining strong static correctness guarantees. Experimental evaluation using mutation testing on Neverlang-based projects demonstrates that nlgcheck effectively enhances robustness without sacrificing modularity or flexibility and with a level of performance that does not impede its adoption in daily development activities.</description>

      <title>Efficient Algorithms for Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problems over Control-flow Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on the Partial Constraint Satisfaction Problem (PCSP) over control-flow graphs (CFGs) of programs. PCSP serves as a generalization of the well-known Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). In the CSP framework, we define a set of variables, a set of constraints, and a finite domain $D$ that encompasses all possible values for each variable. The objective is to assign a value to each variable in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. In the graph variant of CSP, an underlying graph is considered and we have one variable corresponding to each vertex of the graph and one or several constraints corresponding to each edge. In PCSPs, we allow for certain constraints to be violated at a specified cost, aiming to find a solution that minimizes the total cost. Numerous classical compiler optimization tasks can be framed as PCSPs over control-flow graphs. Examples include Register Allocation, Lifetime-optimal Speculative Partial Redundancy Elimination (LOSPRE), and Optimal Placement of Bank Selection Instructions. On the other hand, it is well-known that control-flow graphs of structured programs are sparse and decomposable in a variety of ways. In this work, we rely on the Series-Parallel-Loop (SPL) decompositions as introduced by~\cite{RegisterAllocation}. Our main contribution is a general algorithm for PCSPs over SPL graphs with a time complexity of \(O(|G| \cdot |D|^6)\), where \(|G|\) represents the size of the control-flow graph. Note that for any fixed domain $D,$ this yields a linear-time solution. Our algorithm can be seen as a generalization and unification of previous SPL-based approaches for register allocation and LOSPRE. In addition, we provide experimental results over another classical PCSP task, i.e. Optimal Bank Selection, achieving runtimes four times better than the previous state of the art.</description>

      <title>Language-Integrated Recursive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance-critical industrial applications, including large-scale program, network, and distributed system analyses, rely on fixed-point computations. The introduction of recursive common table expressions (CTEs) using the WITH RECURSIVE keyword in SQL:1999 extended the ability of relational database systems to handle fixed-point computations, unlocking significant performance advantages by allowing computation to move closer to the data. Yet with recursion, SQL becomes a Turing-complete programming language and, with that, unrecoverable safety and correctness risks. SQL itself lacks a fixed semantics, as the SQL specification is written in natural language, full of ambiguities that database vendors resolve in divergent ways. As a result, reasoning about the correctness of recursive SQL programs must rely on isolated mathematical properties of queries rather than wrestling a unified formal model out of a language with notoriously inconsistent semantics. To address these challenges, we propose a calculus that automatically derives mathematical properties from embedded recursive queries and, depending on the database backend, rejects queries that may lead to the three classes of recursive query errors - database errors, incorrect results, and non-termination. We introduce TyQL, a practical implementation in Scala for safe, recursive language-integrated query. Using Named-Tuples and type-level pattern matching, TyQL ensures query portability and safety, showing no performance penalty compared to raw SQL strings while unlocking a three-orders-of-magnitude speedup over non-recursive SQL queries.</description>

      <title>The Opaque Pointer Design Pattern in Python: Towards a Pythonic PIMPL for Modularity, Encapsulation, and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Python libraries often need to maintain a stable public API even as internal implementations evolve, gain new backends, or depend on heavy optional libraries. In Python, where internal objects are easy to inspect and import, users can come to rely on "reachable internals" that were never intended to be public, making refactoring risky and slowing long-term maintenance. This paper revisits the pointer-to-implementation (PIMPL) idiom from C++ and reinterprets it as a Pythonic pattern of opaque delegation: a small public object (or module) that delegates its behavior to a separate implementation object treated as internal. We situate this pattern within a broader taxonomy of encapsulation techniques in Python, relate it to existing practices such as module-level indirection, facade objects, and backend dispatch, and identify PIMPL-like structures already used in the standard library and the scientific Python ecosystem. We then show how a Pythonic PIMPL can be used in existing codebases to isolate heavy dependencies, support lazy imports, and enable runtime selection of alternative backends without changing the public API. Finally, we discuss the benefits and trade-offs of the approach and offer practical guidance on when the pattern is appropriate and how to apply it in large, long-lived Python libraries.</description>
