      <title>Lorentz violating backgrounds from quadratic, shift-symmetric, ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory for a shift-symmetric, quadratically-coupled, ultralight spin-0 field. The leading CP-conserving interactions with Standard Model fields in the effective theory arise at dimension 8. We discuss the renormalization group evolution and positivity bounds on these operators, as well as their possible UV origins. Assuming that the spin-0 field is associated with an ultralight dark matter candidate, we discuss the effects of the dimension-8 operators on experiments searching for the oscillation of fundamental constants and Lorentz violation. We find that the direct bounds on these two effects are of similar strength but rather weak, corresponding to a UV cutoff scale of keV order, as they are mediated by dimension-8 operators.</description>

      <title>Terawatt-level three-stage pulse compression for all-attosecond pump-probe spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generation of terawatt (TW) near-single-cycle laser pulses is of high interest for applications including attosecond science. Here we demonstrate a three-stage post-compression scheme in a non-guided geometry using He as the nonlinear medium, resulting in the generation of multi-mJ pulses with a duration of 3.7 fs. Key features of this approach are its simplicity, robustness and high stability, making it ideally suited for highly demanding applications such as attosecond-pump attosecond-probe spectroscopy (APAPS). This is demonstrated by performing two-color APAPS in Ar and Ne, where both simultaneous and sequential two-photon absorption are observed. Our approach is scalable to multi-TW powers.</description>

      <title>An entanglement-enhanced atomic gravimeter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometers based on ultra-cold atoms enable an absolute measurement of inertial forces with unprecedented precision. However, their resolution is fundamentally restricted by quantum fluctuations. Improved resolutions with entangled or squeezed atoms were demonstrated in internal-state measurements for thermal and quantum-degenerate atoms and, recently, for momentum-state interferometers with laser-cooled atoms. Here, we present a gravimeter based on Bose-Einstein condensates with a sensitivity of $-1.7^{+0.4}_{-0.5}\,$dB beyond the standard quantum limit. Interferometry with Bose-Einstein condensates combined with delta-kick collimation minimizes atom loss in and improves scalability of the interferometer to very-long baseline atom interferometers.</description>

      <title>Architecture for fast implementation of qLDPC codes with optimized Rydberg gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an implementation of bivariate bicycle codes (Nature {\bf 627}, 778 (2024)) based on long-range Rydberg gates between stationary neutral atom qubits. An optimized layout of data and ancilla qubits reduces the maximum Euclidean communication distance needed for non-local parity check operators. An optimized Rydberg gate pulse design enables $\sf CZ$ entangling operations with fidelity ${\mathcal F}&gt;0.999$ at a distance greater than $12~\mu\rm m$. The combination of optimized layout and gate design leads to a quantum error correction cycle time of $\sim 1.2~\rm ms$ for a $[[144,12,12]]$ code, an order of magnitude improvement over previous designs.</description>

      <title>Two-axis twisting using Floquet-engineered XYZ spin models with polar molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar molecules confined in an optical lattice are a versatile platform to explore spin-motion dynamics based on strong, long-range dipolar interactions. The precise tunability of Ising and spin-exchange interactions with both microwave and dc electric fields makes the molecular system particularly suitable for engineering complex many-body dynamics. Here, we used Floquet engineering to realize interesting quantum many-body systems of polar molecules. Using a spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states of ultracold KRb molecules, we mutually validated XXZ spin models tuned by a Floquet microwave pulse sequence against those tuned by a dc electric field through observations of Ramsey contrast dynamics, setting the stage for the realization of Hamiltonians inaccessible with static fields. In particular, we observed two-axis twisting mean-field dynamics, generated by a Floquet-engineered XYZ model using itinerant molecules in 2D layers. In the future, Floquet-engineered Hamiltonians could generate entangled states for molecule-based precision measurement or could take advantage of the rich molecular structure for quantum simulation of multi-level systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of Generalized t-J Spin Dynamics with Tunable Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range and anisotropic dipolar interactions profoundly modify the dynamics of particles hopping in a periodic lattice potential. Here, we report the realization of a generalized t-J model with dipolar interactions using a system of ultracold fermionic molecules with spin encoded in the two lowest rotational states. We systematically explore the role of dipolar Ising and spin-exchange couplings and the effect of motion on spin dynamics. The model parameters can be controlled independently, with dipolar couplings tuned by electric fields and motion regulated by optical lattices. Using Ramsey spectroscopy, we observed interaction-driven contrast decay that depends strongly both on the strength of the anisotropy between Ising and spin-exchange couplings and on motion. These observations are supported by theory models established in different motional regimes that provide intuitive pictures of the underlying physics. This study paves the way for future exploration of kinetic spin dynamics and quantum magnetism with highly tunable molecular platforms in regimes challenging for existing numerical and analytical methods, and it could shed light on the complex behaviors observed in real materials.</description>

      <title>Complex scaling calculation of phase shifts for positron collisions with positive ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present phase-shift calculations for positron collisions with positive ions using a complex scaling method (CSM). Based on the findings of this study [R. Suzuki, T. Myo, and K. Kat\={o}, Prog. Theor. Phys. 113, 1273 (2005).], we propose a modification of the phase shift in the CSM calculation, in which phase shifts are derived only from the complex eigenenergies of the CSM Hamiltonian. This modification is based on the fact that the contributions of high-lying complex eigenenergies can be approximated as a constant value in the case of a small collision energy, where neither target excitation nor positronium formation occurs. The proposed modification limits the contribution of the complex eigenenergies to the vicinity of the collision energy, which is also intuitively acceptable. We present a geometrical formulation of the modification and demonstrative calculations of positron scattering off positive ions. Our results agree well with those reported in the literature for the targets Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, H, He, He$^+$, and Li$^{2+}$. The phase shifts of positron scattering off a Li$^+$ ion have also been reported.</description>

      <title>Spatial Wavefunctions of Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of quantum mechanical angular momentum, based on spatial wavefunctions that depend on the Euler angles $\phi, \theta, \chi$. The wavefunctions are Wigner D-functions, $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$, for which the body-fixed projection quantum number $n$ has the unusual value $n=|j|=\sqrt{j(j+1)}$, or $n=0$. The $D_{\sqrt{j(j+1)},m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ wavefunctions are unnormalizable, however we demonstrate a renormalization procedure that allows the calculation of expectation values: for example, the states $D_{\sqrt{S(S+1)} M}^S (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ of elementary particles with spin $S$ give a gyromagnetic ratio of $g=2$ for $S&gt;0$, and we identify these as the spatial angular-momentum wavefunctions of known fundamental charged particles with spin. Therefore, we make the case that the $D_{n m}^j (\phi, \theta, \chi)$ are useful as spatial wavefunctions for angular momentum. Some implications of the quantum number $n$ for fundamental particles are discussed, such as the proposed Dirac-fermion nature of the neutrino, and some proposed dark-matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Algorithms for Maximum Independent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two quantum Hamiltonian algorithms have been proposed to solve the maximum independent set problem: the PK algorithm, introduced in [Phys. Rev. A 101 (2020) 012318; Chin. Phys. Lett. 38, (2021) 030304], and the the HV algorithm, presented in [Science 376 (2022) 1209]. Here we demonstrate that the two algorithms are mathematically equivalent. Specifically, the Hamiltonian in the PK algorithm can be viewed as the HV Hamiltonian in the interaction picture. We remark on potential practical advantages of the PK algorithm.Although they are mathematically equivalent, their most straightforward physical implementations are different, and our numerical simulations suggest that the PK algorithm might can bring significant advantages.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering area for particles with infinite or zero scattering length in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansions of the wave function of three particles having equal mass with finite-range interactions and infinite or zero two-dimensional scattering length colliding at zero energy and zero orbital angular momentum, from which a three-body parameter $D$ is defined. The dimension of $D$ is length squared, and we call $D$ three-body scattering area. We find that the ground state energy per particle of a zero-temperature dilute Bose gas with these interactions is approximately $\frac{\hbar^2 D }{6m}\rho^2$, where $\rho$ is the number density of the bosons, $m$ is the mass of each boson, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant over $2\pi$. Such a Bose gas is stable at $D\geq 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, and metastable at $D&lt;0$ in the harmonic trap if the number of bosons is less than $N_{cr}\approx 3.6413 \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega |D|}}$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the harmonic trap. If the two-body interaction supports bound states, $D$ typically acquires a negative imaginary part, and we find the relation between this imaginary part and the amplitudes of the pair-boson production processes. We derive a formula for the three-body recombination rate constant of the many-boson system in terms of the imaginary part of $D$.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous action of a single photon at two remote places</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Einstein's thought experiment that a single quantum particle diffracted after a pinhole could in principle produce an action in two or several places on a hemispherical imaging screen, here we explore theoretically the possibility to simultaneously detect the action of a single photon at two remote places. This is considered in a cascade quantum system composed of two spatially distant cavities each coupled to a qubit in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that a single-photon pulse incident on the two cavities can simultaneously excite the two remote qubits and lead to two subsequent single-photon detection events even when the separation between them is comparable to the spatial length of the photon pulse. Our results not only uncover new facets of photons at a fundamental level but also have practical applications, such as the generation of remote entanglement by a single photon through a dissipative channel which is otherwise unattainable in the strong-coupling regime.</description>
