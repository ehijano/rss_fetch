      <title>Review on the minimally extended varying speed of light model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been known that dimensional constants such as $\hbar$, $c$, $G$, $e$, and $k$ are merely human constructs whose values and units vary depending on the chosen system of measurement. Therefore, the time variation of dimensional constants lacks operational significance due to their dependence on them. It is well-structured and represents a valid discussion. However, this fact only becomes a meaningful debate within the context of a static or present universe. As well-established theoretically and observationally, the current universe is undergoing accelerated expansion, wherein dimensional quantities, like the wavelength of light, also experience redshift phenomena elongating over cosmic time. In other words, in an expanding universe, dimensional quantities of physical parameters vary with cosmic time. From this perspective, there exists the possibility that dimensional constants, such as the speed of light, could vary with the expansion of the universe. In this review paper, we contemplate under what circumstances the speed of light may change or remain constant over cosmic time, and discuss the potential for distinguishing these cases observationally.</description>

      <title>The neutrino mass: A triangular formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the flavor oscillation when a neutrino travels through spacetime, is equivalent to permanent changes on the vacuum state condition perceived by the same particle. This can be visualized via the Quantum Yang Baxter equations (QYBE). From this perspective, the neutrino never breaks the symmetry of the ground state because it never selects an specific vacuum condition. Then naturally the Higgs mechanism cannot be the generator of the neutrino masses. The constraints emerging from this model predict a normal mass hierarchy and some specific values for the mass eigenvalues once we fix the mixing angles. Interestingly, the model suggests that the sum of the mix angles is equal to $\pi/2$.</description>
