      <title>Real-Time Guidewire Tip Tracking Using a Siamese Network for Image-Guided Endovascular Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ever-growing incorporation of AI solutions into clinical practices enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare services. This paper focuses on guidewire tip tracking tasks during image-guided therapy for cardiovascular diseases, aiding physicians in improving diagnostic and therapeutic quality. A novel tracking framework based on a Siamese network with dual attention mechanisms combines self- and cross-attention strategies for robust guidewire tip tracking. This design handles visual ambiguities, tissue deformations, and imaging artifacts through enhanced spatial-temporal feature learning. Validation occurred on 3 randomly selected clinical digital subtraction angiography (DSA) sequences from a dataset of 15 sequences, covering multiple interventional scenarios. The results indicate a mean localization error of 0.421 $\pm$ 0.138 mm, with a maximum error of 1.736 mm, and a mean Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.782. The framework maintains an average processing speed of 57.2 frames per second, meeting the temporal demands of endovascular imaging. Further validations with robotic platforms for automating diagnostics and therapies in clinical routines yielded tracking errors of 0.708 $\pm$ 0.695 mm and 0.148 $\pm$ 0.057 mm in two distinct experimental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Multimodal, Multi-Disease Medical Imaging Foundation Model (MerMED-FM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence models for medical imaging are predominantly single modality and single disease. Attempts to create multimodal and multi-disease models have resulted in inconsistent clinical accuracy. Furthermore, training these models typically requires large, labour-intensive, well-labelled datasets. We developed MerMED-FM, a state-of-the-art multimodal, multi-specialty foundation model trained using self-supervised learning and a memory module. MerMED-FM was trained on 3.3 million medical images from over ten specialties and seven modalities, including computed tomography (CT), chest X-rays (CXR), ultrasound (US), pathology patches, color fundus photography (CFP), optical coherence tomography (OCT) and dermatology images. MerMED-FM was evaluated across multiple diseases and compared against existing foundational models. Strong performance was achieved across all modalities, with AUROCs of 0.988 (OCT); 0.982 (pathology); 0.951 (US); 0.943 (CT); 0.931 (skin); 0.894 (CFP); 0.858 (CXR). MerMED-FM has the potential to be a highly adaptable, versatile, cross-specialty foundation model that enables robust medical imaging interpretation across diverse medical disciplines.</description>

      <title>Towards 3D Semantic Image Synthesis for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the medical domain, acquiring large datasets is challenging due to both accessibility issues and stringent privacy regulations. Consequently, data availability and privacy protection are major obstacles to applying machine learning in medical imaging. To address this, our study proposes the Med-LSDM (Latent Semantic Diffusion Model), which operates directly in the 3D domain and leverages de-identified semantic maps to generate synthetic data as a method of privacy preservation and data augmentation. Unlike many existing methods that focus on generating 2D slices, Med-LSDM is designed specifically for 3D semantic image synthesis, making it well-suited for applications requiring full volumetric data. Med-LSDM incorporates a guiding mechanism that controls the 3D image generation process by applying a diffusion model within the latent space of a pre-trained VQ-GAN. By operating in the compressed latent space, the model significantly reduces computational complexity while still preserving critical 3D spatial details. Our approach demonstrates strong performance in 3D semantic medical image synthesis, achieving a 3D-FID score of 0.0054 on the conditional Duke Breast dataset and similar Dice scores (0.70964) to those of real images (0.71496). These results demonstrate that the synthetic data from our model have a small domain gap with real data and are useful for data augmentation.</description>

      <title>SurgiSR4K: A High-Resolution Endoscopic Video Dataset for Robotic-Assisted Minimally Invasive Procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging is crucial for enhancing visual clarity and enabling precise computer-assisted guidance in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). Despite the increasing adoption of 4K endoscopic systems, there remains a significant gap in publicly available native 4K datasets tailored specifically for robotic-assisted MIS. We introduce SurgiSR4K, the first publicly accessible surgical imaging and video dataset captured at a native 4K resolution, representing realistic conditions of robotic-assisted procedures. SurgiSR4K comprises diverse visual scenarios including specular reflections, tool occlusions, bleeding, and soft tissue deformations, meticulously designed to reflect common challenges faced during laparoscopic and robotic surgeries. This dataset opens up possibilities for a broad range of computer vision tasks that might benefit from high resolution data, such as super resolution (SR), smoke removal, surgical instrument detection, 3D tissue reconstruction, monocular depth estimation, instance segmentation, novel view synthesis, and vision-language model (VLM) development. SurgiSR4K provides a robust foundation for advancing research in high-resolution surgical imaging and fosters the development of intelligent imaging technologies aimed at enhancing performance, safety, and usability in image-guided robotic surgeries.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Fetal Birth Weight Estimation from 3D Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate fetal birth weight (FBW) estimation is essential for optimizing delivery decisions and reducing perinatal mortality. However, clinical methods for FBW estimation are inefficient, operator-dependent, and challenging to apply in cases of complex fetal anatomy. Existing deep learning methods are based on 2D standard ultrasound (US) images or videos that lack spatial information, limiting their prediction accuracy. In this study, we propose the first method for directly estimating FBW from 3D fetal US volumes. Our approach integrates a multi-scale feature fusion network (MFFN) and a synthetic sample-based learning framework (SSLF). The MFFN effectively extracts and fuses multi-scale features under sparse supervision by incorporating channel attention, spatial attention, and a ranking-based loss function. SSLF generates synthetic samples by simply combining fetal head and abdomen data from different fetuses, utilizing semi-supervised learning to improve prediction performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance, with a mean absolute error of $166.4\pm155.9$ $g$ and a mean absolute percentage error of $5.1\pm4.6$%, outperforming existing methods and approaching the accuracy of a senior doctor.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the VMSE U-Net and VM-Unet CBAM+ model, two cutting-edge deep learning architectures designed to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) techniques into the traditional VM U-Net framework, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, feature localization, and computational efficiency. Both models show superior performance compared to the baseline VM-Unet across multiple datasets. Notably, VMSEUnet achieves the highest accuracy, IoU, precision, and recall while maintaining low loss values. It also exhibits exceptional computational efficiency with faster inference times and lower memory usage on both GPU and CPU. Overall, the study suggests that the enhanced architecture VMSE-Unet is a valuable tool for medical image analysis. These findings highlight its potential for real-world clinical applications, emphasizing the importance of further research to optimize accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Anti-aliasing Algorithm Based on Three-dimensional Display Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D-display technology has been a promising emerging area with potential to be the core of next-generation display technology. When directly observing unprocessed images and text through a naked-eye 3D display device, severe distortion and jaggedness will be displayed, which will make the display effect much worse. In this work, we try to settle down such degradation with spatial and frequency processing, furthermore, we make efforts to extract degenerate function of columnar lens array thus fundamentally eliminating degradation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Learning-based Iterative Registration through Deep Equilibrium Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformable medical image registration is traditionally formulated as an optimization problem. While classical methods solve this problem iteratively, recent learning-based approaches use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to mimic this process by unrolling the prediction of deformation fields in a fixed number of steps. However, classical methods typically converge after sufficient iterations, but learning-based unrolling methods lack a theoretical convergence guarantee and show instability empirically. In addition, unrolling methods have a practical bottleneck at training time: GPU memory usage grows linearly with the unrolling steps due to backpropagation through time (BPTT). To address both theoretical and practical challenges, we propose DEQReg, a novel registration framework based on Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQ), which formulates registration as an equilibrium-seeking problem, establishing a natural connection between classical optimization and learning-based unrolling methods. DEQReg maintains constant memory usage, enabling theoretically unlimited iteration steps. Through extensive evaluation on the public brain MRI and lung CT datasets, we show that DEQReg can achieve competitive registration performance, while substantially reducing memory consumption compared to state-of-the-art unrolling methods. We also reveal an intriguing phenomenon: the performance of existing unrolling methods first increases slightly then degrades irreversibly when the inference steps go beyond the training configuration. In contrast, DEQReg achieves stable convergence with its inbuilt equilibrium-seeking mechanism, bridging the gap between classical optimization-based and modern learning-based registration methods.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural ODEs for Temporal Dynamics Modeling in Cardiac T1 Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) is an important biomarker in cardiac parametric mapping for characterizing myocardial tissue and diagnosing cardiomyopathies. Conventional Modified Look-Locker Inversion Recovery (MOLLI) acquires 11 breath-hold baseline images with interleaved rest periods to ensure mapping accuracy. However, prolonged scanning can be challenging for patients with poor breathholds, often leading to motion artifacts that degrade image quality. In addition, $T_1$ mapping requires voxel-wise nonlinear fitting to a signal recovery model involving an iterative estimation process. Recent studies have proposed deep-learning approaches for rapid $T_1$ mapping using shortened sequences to reduce acquisition time for patient comfort. Nevertheless, existing methods overlook important physics constraints, limiting interpretability and generalization. In this work, we present an accelerated, end-to-end $T_1$ mapping framework leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to model temporal dynamics and address these challenges. Our method achieves high-accuracy $T_1$ estimation from a sparse subset of baseline images and ensures efficient null index estimation at test time. Specifically, we develop a continuous-time LSTM-ODE model to enable selective Look-Locker (LL) data acquisition with arbitrary time lags. Experimental results show superior performance in $T_1$ estimation for both native and post-contrast sequences and demonstrate the strong benefit of our physics-based formulation over direct data-driven $T_1$ priors.</description>

      <title>MTCNet: Motion and Topology Consistency Guided Learning for Mitral Valve Segmentationin 4D Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mitral regurgitation is one of the most prevalent cardiac disorders. Four-dimensional (4D) ultrasound has emerged as the primary imaging modality for assessing dynamic valvular morphology. However, 4D mitral valve (MV) analysis remains challenging due to limited phase annotations, severe motion artifacts, and poor imaging quality. Yet, the absence of inter-phase dependency in existing methods hinders 4D MV analysis. To bridge this gap, we propose a Motion-Topology guided consistency network (MTCNet) for accurate 4D MV ultrasound segmentation in semi-supervised learning (SSL). MTCNet requires only sparse end-diastolic and end-systolic annotations. First, we design a cross-phase motion-guided consistency learning strategy, utilizing a bi-directional attention memory bank to propagate spatio-temporal features. This enables MTCNet to achieve excellent performance both per- and inter-phase. Second, we devise a novel topology-guided correlation regularization that explores physical prior knowledge to maintain anatomically plausible. Therefore, MTCNet can effectively leverage structural correspondence between labeled and unlabeled phases. Extensive evaluations on the first largest 4D MV dataset, with 1408 phases from 160 patients, show that MTCNet performs superior cross-phase consistency compared to other advanced methods (Dice: 87.30%, HD: 1.75mm). Both the code and the dataset are available at https://github.com/crs524/MTCNet.</description>

      <title>Mind the Detail: Uncovering Clinically Relevant Image Details in Accelerated MRI with Semantically Diverse Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, accelerated MRI reconstruction based on deep learning has led to significant improvements in image quality with impressive results for high acceleration factors. However, from a clinical perspective image quality is only secondary; much more important is that all clinically relevant information is preserved in the reconstruction from heavily undersampled data. In this paper, we show that existing techniques, even when considering resampling for diffusion-based reconstruction, can fail to reconstruct small and rare pathologies, thus leading to potentially wrong diagnosis decisions (false negatives). To uncover the potentially missing clinical information we propose ``Semantically Diverse Reconstructions'' (\SDR), a method which, given an original reconstruction, generates novel reconstructions with enhanced semantic variability while all of them are fully consistent with the measured data. To evaluate \SDR automatically we train an object detector on the fastMRI+ dataset. We show that \SDR significantly reduces the chance of false-negative diagnoses (higher recall) and improves mean average precision compared to the original reconstructions.

      <title>Prompt2SegCXR:Prompt to Segment All Organs and Diseases in Chest X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a vital role in the medical field by isolating organs or regions of interest from surrounding areas. Traditionally, segmentation models are trained on a specific organ or a disease, limiting their ability to handle other organs and diseases. At present, few advanced models can perform multi-organ or multi-disease segmentation, offering greater flexibility. Also, recently, prompt-based image segmentation has gained attention as a more flexible approach. It allows models to segment areas based on user-provided prompts. Despite these advances, there has been no dedicated work on prompt-based interactive multi-organ and multi-disease segmentation, especially for Chest X-rays. This work presents two main contributions: first, generating doodle prompts by medical experts of a collection of datasets from multiple sources with 23 classes, including 6 organs and 17 diseases, specifically designed for prompt-based Chest X-ray segmentation. Second, we introduce Prompt2SegCXR, a lightweight model for accurately segmenting multiple organs and diseases from Chest X-rays. The model incorporates multi-stage feature fusion, enabling it to combine features from various network layers for better spatial and semantic understanding, enhancing segmentation accuracy. Compared to existing pre-trained models for prompt-based image segmentation, our model scores well, providing a reliable solution for segmenting Chest X-rays based on user prompts.</description>

      <title>Tunable Wavelet Unit based Convolutional Neural Network in Optical Coherence Tomography Analysis Enhancement for Classifying Type of Epiretinal Membrane Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we developed deep learning-based method to classify the type of surgery performed for epiretinal membrane (ERM) removal, either internal limiting membrane (ILM) removal or ERM-alone removal. Our model, based on the ResNet18 convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, utilizes postoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) center scans as inputs. We evaluated the model using both original scans and scans preprocessed with energy crop and wavelet denoising, achieving 72% accuracy on preprocessed inputs, outperforming the 66% accuracy achieved on original scans. To further improve accuracy, we integrated tunable wavelet units with two key adaptations: Orthogonal Lattice-based Wavelet Units (OrthLatt-UwU) and Perfect Reconstruction Relaxation-based Wavelet Units (PR-Relax-UwU). These units allowed the model to automatically adjust filter coefficients during training and were incorporated into downsampling, stride-two convolution, and pooling layers, enhancing its ability to distinguish between ERM-ILM removal and ERM-alone removal, with OrthLattUwU boosting accuracy to 76% and PR-Relax-UwU increasing performance to 78%. Performance comparisons showed that our AI model outperformed a trained human grader, who achieved only 50% accuracy in classifying the removal surgery types from postoperative OCT scans. These findings highlight the potential of CNN based models to improve clinical decision-making by providing more accurate and reliable classifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to employ tunable wavelets for classifying different types of ERM removal surgery.</description>

      <title>Research on Improving the High Precision and Lightweight Diabetic Retinopathy Detection of YOLOv8n</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early detection and diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy is one of the current research focuses in ophthalmology. However, due to the subtle features of micro-lesions and their susceptibility to background interference, ex-isting detection methods still face many challenges in terms of accuracy and robustness. To address these issues, a lightweight and high-precision detection model based on the improved YOLOv8n, named YOLO-KFG, is proposed. Firstly, a new dynamic convolution KWConv and C2f-KW module are designed to improve the backbone network, enhancing the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions. Secondly, a fea-ture-focused diffusion pyramid network FDPN is designed to fully integrate multi-scale context information, further improving the model's ability to perceive micro-lesions. Finally, a lightweight shared detection head GSDHead is designed to reduce the model's parameter count, making it more deployable on re-source-constrained devices. Experimental results show that compared with the base model YOLOv8n, the improved model reduces the parameter count by 20.7%, increases mAP@0.5 by 4.1%, and improves the recall rate by 7.9%. Compared with single-stage mainstream algorithms such as YOLOv5n and YOLOv10n, YOLO-KFG demonstrates significant advantages in both detection accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron: An Energy-Efficient Functional Unit for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new, highly energy-efficient, Adiabatic Capacitive Neuron (ACN) hardware implementation of an Artificial Neuron (AN) with improved functionality, accuracy, robustness and scalability over previous work. The paper describes the implementation of a \mbox{12-bit} single neuron, with positive and negative weight support, in an $\mathbf{0.18\mu m}$ CMOS technology. The paper also presents a new Threshold Logic (TL) design for a binary AN activation function that generates a low symmetrical offset across three process corners and five temperatures between $-55^o$C and $125^o$C. Post-layout simulations demonstrate a maximum rising and falling offset voltage of 9$mV$ compared to conventional TL, which has rising and falling offset voltages of 27$mV$ and 5$mV$ respectively, across temperature and process. Moreover, the proposed TL design shows a decrease in average energy of 1.5$\%$ at the SS corner and 2.3$\%$ at FF corner compared to the conventional TL design. The total synapse energy saving for the proposed ACN was above 90$\%$ (over 12x improvement) when compared to a non-adiabatic CMOS Capacitive Neuron (CCN) benchmark for a frequency ranging from 500$kHz$ to 100$MHz$. A 1000-sample Monte Carlo simulation including process variation and mismatch confirms the worst-case energy savings of $\&gt;$90$\%$ compared to CCN in the synapse energy profile. Finally, the impact of supply voltage scaling shows consistent energy savings of above 90$\%$ (except all zero inputs) without loss of functionality.</description>

      <title>Automated anatomy-based post-processing reduces false positives and improved interpretability of deep learning intracranial aneurysm detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Deep learning (DL) models can help detect intracranial aneurysms on CTA, but high false positive (FP) rates remain a barrier to clinical translation, despite improvement in model architectures and strategies like detection threshold tuning. We employed an automated, anatomy-based, heuristic-learning hybrid artery-vein segmentation post-processing method to further reduce FPs. Methods: Two DL models, CPM-Net and a deformable 3D convolutional neural network-transformer hybrid (3D-CNN-TR), were trained with 1,186 open-source CTAs (1,373 annotated aneurysms), and evaluated with 143 held-out private CTAs (218 annotated aneurysms). Brain, artery, vein, and cavernous venous sinus (CVS) segmentation masks were applied to remove possible FPs in the DL outputs that overlapped with: (1) brain mask; (2) vein mask; (3) vein more than artery masks; (4) brain plus vein mask; (5) brain plus vein more than artery masks. Results: CPM-Net yielded 139 true-positives (TP); 79 false-negative (FN); 126 FP. 3D-CNN-TR yielded 179 TP; 39 FN; 182 FP. FPs were commonly extracranial (CPM-Net 27.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 42.3%), venous (CPM-Net 56.3%; 3D-CNN-TR 29.1%), arterial (CPM-Net 11.9%; 3D-CNN-TR 53.3%), and non-vascular (CPM-Net 25.4%; 3D-CNN-TR 9.3%) structures. Method 5 performed best, reducing CPM-Net FP by 70.6% (89/126) and 3D-CNN-TR FP by 51.6% (94/182), without reducing TP, lowering the FP/case rate from 0.88 to 0.26 for CPM-NET, and from 1.27 to 0.62 for the 3D-CNN-TR. Conclusion: Anatomy-based, interpretable post-processing can improve DL-based aneurysm detection model performance. More broadly, automated, domain-informed, hybrid heuristic-learning processing holds promise for improving the performance and clinical acceptance of aneurysm detection models.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-based segmentation of T1 and T2 cardiac MRI maps for automated disease detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objectives Parametric tissue mapping enables quantitative cardiac tissue characterization but is limited by inter-observer variability during manual delineation. Traditional approaches relying on average relaxation values and single cutoffs may oversimplify myocardial complexity. This study evaluates whether deep learning (DL) can achieve segmentation accuracy comparable to inter-observer variability, explores the utility of statistical features beyond mean T1/T2 values, and assesses whether machine learning (ML) combining multiple features enhances disease detection. Materials &amp; Methods T1 and T2 maps were manually segmented. The test subset was independently annotated by two observers, and inter-observer variability was assessed. A DL model was trained to segment left ventricle blood pool and myocardium. Average (A), lower quartile (LQ), median (M), and upper quartile (UQ) were computed for the myocardial pixels and employed in classification by applying cutoffs or in ML. Dice similarity coefficient (DICE) and mean absolute percentage error evaluated segmentation performance. Bland-Altman plots assessed inter-user and model-observer agreement. Receiver operating characteristic analysis determined optimal cutoffs. Pearson correlation compared features from model and manual segmentations. F1-score, precision, and recall evaluated classification performance. Wilcoxon test assessed differences between classification methods, with p &lt; 0.05 considered statistically significant. Results 144 subjects were split into training (100), validation (15) and evaluation (29) subsets. Segmentation model achieved a DICE of 85.4%, surpassing inter-observer agreement. Random forest applied to all features increased F1-score (92.7%, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion DL facilitates segmentation of T1/ T2 maps. Combining multiple features with ML improves disease detection.</description>

      <title>DMCIE: Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors to Improve the Accuracy of the Segmentation of Brain Tumors in MRI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of brain tumors in MRI scans is essential for reliable clinical diagnosis and effective treatment planning. Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in image generation and segmentation tasks. This paper introduces a novel approach to corrective segmentation based on diffusion models. We propose DMCIE (Diffusion Model with Concatenation of Inputs and Errors), a novel framework for accurate brain tumor segmentation in multi-modal MRI scans. We employ a 3D U-Net to generate an initial segmentation mask, from which an error map is generated by identifying the differences between the prediction and the ground truth. The error map, concatenated with the original MRI images, are used to guide a diffusion model. Using multimodal MRI inputs (T1, T1ce, T2, FLAIR), DMCIE effectively enhances segmentation accuracy by focusing on misclassified regions, guided by the original inputs. Evaluated on the BraTS2020 dataset, DMCIE outperforms several state-of-the-art diffusion-based segmentation methods, achieving a Dice Score of 93.46 and an HD95 of 5.94 mm. These results highlight the effectiveness of error-guided diffusion in producing precise and reliable brain tumor segmentations.</description>

      <title>Advancing Lung Disease Diagnosis in 3D CT Scans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable more accurate diagnosis of lung disease in chest CT scans, we propose a straightforward yet effective model. Firstly, we analyze the characteristics of 3D CT scans and remove non-lung regions, which helps the model focus on lesion-related areas and reduces computational cost. We adopt ResNeSt50 as a strong feature extractor, and use a weighted cross-entropy loss to mitigate class imbalance, especially for the underrepresented squamous cell carcinoma category. Our model achieves a Macro F1 Score of 0.80 on the validation set of the Fair Disease Diagnosis Challenge, demonstrating its strong performance in distinguishing between different lung conditions.</description>

      <title>MVGBench: Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-view Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose MVGBench, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-view image generation models (MVGs) that evaluates 3D consistency in geometry and texture, image quality, and semantics (using vision language models). Recently, MVGs have been the main driving force in 3D object creation. However, existing metrics compare generated images against ground truth target views, which is not suitable for generative tasks where multiple solutions exist while differing from ground truth. Furthermore, different MVGs are trained on different view angles, synthetic data and specific lightings -- robustness to these factors and generalization to real data are rarely evaluated thoroughly. Without a rigorous evaluation protocol, it is also unclear what design choices contribute to the progress of MVGs. MVGBench evaluates three different aspects: best setup performance, generalization to real data and robustness. Instead of comparing against ground truth, we introduce a novel 3D self-consistency metric which compares 3D reconstructions from disjoint generated multi-views. We systematically compare 12 existing MVGs on 4 different curated real and synthetic datasets. With our analysis, we identify important limitations of existing methods specially in terms of robustness and generalization, and we find the most critical design choices. Using the discovered best practices, we propose ViFiGen, a method that outperforms all evaluated MVGs on 3D consistency. Our code, model, and benchmark suite will be publicly released.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Unlabeled Audio-Visual Data in Speech Emotion Recognition using Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voice interfaces integral to the human-computer interaction systems can benefit from speech emotion recognition (SER) to customize responses based on user emotions. Since humans convey emotions through multi-modal audio-visual cues, developing SER systems using both the modalities is beneficial. However, collecting a vast amount of labeled data for their development is expensive. This paper proposes a knowledge distillation framework called LightweightSER (LiSER) that leverages unlabeled audio-visual data for SER, using large teacher models built on advanced speech and face representation models. LiSER transfers knowledge regarding speech emotions and facial expressions from the teacher models to lightweight student models. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets, RAVDESS and CREMA-D, demonstrate that LiSER can reduce the dependence on extensive labeled datasets for SER tasks.</description>

      <title>${\mu}^2$Tokenizer: Differentiable Multi-Scale Multi-Modal Tokenizer for Radiology Report Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated radiology report generation (RRG) aims to produce detailed textual reports from clinical imaging, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, to improve the accuracy and efficiency of diagnosis and provision of management advice. RRG is complicated by two key challenges: (1) inherent complexity in extracting relevant information from imaging data under resource constraints, and (2) difficulty in objectively evaluating discrepancies between model-generated and expert-written reports. To address these challenges, we propose $\mu^2$LLM, a $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltiscale $\underline{\textbf{mu}}$ltimodal large language models for RRG tasks. The novel ${\mu}^2$Tokenizer, as an intermediate layer, integrates multi-modal features from the multiscale visual tokenizer and the text tokenizer, then enhances report generation quality through direct preference optimization (DPO), guided by GREEN-RedLlama. Experimental results on four large CT image-report medical datasetdemonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches, highlighting the potential of our fine-tuned $\mu^2$LLMs on limited data for RRG tasks.</description>

      <title>Scope Meets Screen: Lessons Learned in Designing Composite Visualizations for Marksmanship Training Across Skill Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Marksmanship practices are required in various professions, including police, military personnel, hunters, as well as sports shooters, such as Olympic shooting, biathlon, and modern pentathlon. The current form of training and coaching is mostly based on repetition, where the coach does not see through the eyes of the shooter, and analysis is limited to stance and accuracy post-session. In this study, we present a shooting visualization system and evaluate its perceived effectiveness for both novice and expert shooters. To achieve this, five composite visualizations were developed using first-person shooting video recordings enriched with overlaid metrics and graphical summaries. These views were evaluated with 10 participants (5 expert marksmen, 5 novices) through a mixed-methods study including shot-count and aiming interpretation tasks, pairwise preference comparisons, and semi-structured interviews. The results show that a dashboard-style composite view, combining raw video with a polar plot and selected graphs, was preferred in 9 of 10 cases and supported understanding across skill levels. The insights gained from this design study point to the broader value of integrating first-person video with visual analytics for coaching, and we suggest directions for applying this approach to other precision-based sports.</description>

      <title>An Improved U-Net Model for Offline handwriting signature denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Handwriting signatures, as an important means of identity recognition, are widely used in multiple fields such as financial transactions, commercial contracts and personal affairs due to their legal effect and uniqueness. In forensic science appraisals, the analysis of offline handwriting signatures requires the appraiser to provide a certain number of signature samples, which are usually derived from various historical contracts or archival materials. However, the provided handwriting samples are often mixed with a large amount of interfering information, which brings severe challenges to handwriting identification work. This study proposes a signature handwriting denoising model based on the improved U-net structure, aiming to enhance the robustness of the signature recognition system. By introducing discrete wavelet transform and PCA transform, the model's ability to suppress noise has been enhanced. The experimental results show that this modelis significantly superior to the traditional methods in denoising effect, can effectively improve the clarity and readability of the signed images, and provide more reliable technical support for signature analysis and recognition.</description>

      <title>Efficient Depth- and Spatially-Varying Image Simulation for Defocus Deblur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern cameras with large apertures often suffer from a shallow depth of field, resulting in blurry images of objects outside the focal plane. This limitation is particularly problematic for fixed-focus cameras, such as those used in smart glasses, where adding autofocus mechanisms is challenging due to form factor and power constraints. Due to unmatched optical aberrations and defocus properties unique to each camera system, deep learning models trained on existing open-source datasets often face domain gaps and do not perform well in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient and scalable dataset synthesis approach that does not rely on fine-tuning with real-world data. Our method simultaneously models depth-dependent defocus and spatially varying optical aberrations, addressing both computational complexity and the scarcity of high-quality RGB-D datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that a network trained on our low resolution synthetic images generalizes effectively to high resolution (12MP) real-world images across diverse scenes.</description>

      <title>Customizable ROI-Based Deep Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Region of Interest (ROI)-based image compression optimizes bit allocation by prioritizing ROI for higher-quality reconstruction. However, as the users (including human clients and downstream machine tasks) become more diverse, ROI-based image compression needs to be customizable to support various preferences. For example, different users may define distinct ROI or require different quality trade-offs between ROI and non-ROI. Existing ROI-based image compression schemes predefine the ROI, making it unchangeable, and lack effective mechanisms to balance reconstruction quality between ROI and non-ROI. This work proposes a paradigm for customizable ROI-based deep image compression. First, we develop a Text-controlled Mask Acquisition (TMA) module, which allows users to easily customize their ROI for compression by just inputting the corresponding semantic \emph{text}. It makes the encoder controlled by text. Second, we design a Customizable Value Assign (CVA) mechanism, which masks the non-ROI with a changeable extent decided by users instead of a constant one to manage the reconstruction quality trade-off between ROI and non-ROI. Finally, we present a Latent Mask Attention (LMA) module, where the latent spatial prior of the mask and the latent Rate-Distortion Optimization (RDO) prior of the image are extracted and fused in the latent space, and further used to optimize the latent representation of the source image. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed customizable ROI-based deep image compression paradigm effectively addresses the needs of customization for ROI definition and mask acquisition as well as the reconstruction quality trade-off management between the ROI and non-ROI.</description>

      <title>Latent Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow for Higher-Fidelity Perceptual Face Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Perception-Distortion tradeoff (PD-tradeoff) theory suggests that face restoration algorithms must balance perceptual quality and fidelity. To achieve minimal distortion while maintaining perfect perceptual quality, Posterior-Mean Rectified Flow (PMRF) proposes a flow based approach where source distribution is minimum distortion estimations. Although PMRF is shown to be effective, its pixel-space modeling approach limits its ability to align with human perception, where human perception is defined as how humans distinguish between two image distributions. In this work, we propose Latent-PMRF, which reformulates PMRF in the latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), facilitating better alignment with human perception during optimization. By defining the source distribution on latent representations of minimum distortion estimation, we bound the minimum distortion by the VAE's reconstruction error. Moreover, we reveal the design of VAE is crucial, and our proposed VAE significantly outperforms existing VAEs in both reconstruction and restoration. Extensive experiments on blind face restoration demonstrate the superiority of Latent-PMRF, offering an improved PD-tradeoff compared to existing methods, along with remarkable convergence efficiency, achieving a 5.79X speedup over PMRF in terms of FID. Our code will be available as open-source.</description>

      <title>Just Noticeable Difference for Large Multimodal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Just noticeable difference (JND), the minimum change that the human visual system (HVS) can perceive, has been studied for decades. Although recent work has extended this line of research into machine vision, there has been a scarcity of studies systematically exploring its perceptual boundaries across multiple tasks and stimulus types, particularly in the current era of rapidly advancing large multimodal models (LMMs), where studying the multifaceted capabilities of models has become a mainstream focus. Moreover, the perceptual defects of LMMs are not investigated thoroughly, resulting in potential security issues and suboptimal response efficiency. In this paper, we take an initial attempt and demonstrate that there exist significant visual blind spots in current LMMs. To systemically quantify this characteristic, we propose a new concept, {\bf LMM-JND}, together with its determination pipeline. Targeting uncovering the behavior commonalities in HVS-aligned visual perception tasks, we delve into several LMM families and construct a large-scale dataset, named VPA-JND, which contains 21.5k reference images with over 489k stimuli across 12 distortion types, to facilitate LMM-JND studies. VPA-JND exposes areas where state-of-the-art LMMs, including GPT-4o and the InternVL2.5 series, struggle with basic comparison queries and fall significantly short of human-level visual performance. We further explore the effects of vision and language backbones and find a notable correlation between their design philosophy that may instruct the future refinement of LMMs for their visual acuity. Together, our research underscores the significance of LMM-JND as a unique perspective for studying LMMs, and predictable LMM-JND is crucial for security concerns.

      <title>Biorthogonal Tunable Wavelet Unit with Lifting Scheme in Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel biorthogonal tunable wavelet unit constructed using a lifting scheme that relaxes both the orthogonality and equal filter length constraints, providing greater flexibility in filter design. The proposed unit enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations, leading to improved image classification and anomaly detection in convolutional neural networks (CNN). When integrated into an 18-layer residual neural network (ResNet-18), the approach improved classification accuracy on CIFAR-10 by 2.12% and on the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD) by 9.73%, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine-grained details. Similar improvements were observed in ResNet-34. For anomaly detection in the hazelnut category of the MVTec Anomaly Detection dataset, the proposed method achieved competitive and wellbalanced performance in both segmentation and detection tasks, outperforming existing approaches in terms of accuracy and robustness.</description>

      <title>Realism in Action: Anomaly-Aware Diagnosis of Brain Tumors from Medical Images Using YOLOv8 and DeiT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable diagnosis of brain tumors remains challenging due to low clinical incidence rates of such cases. However, this low rate is neglected in most of proposed methods. We propose a clinically inspired framework for anomaly-resilient tumor detection and classification. Detection leverages YOLOv8n fine-tuned on a realistically imbalanced dataset (1:9 tumor-to-normal ratio; 30,000 MRI slices from 81 patients). In addition, we propose a novel Patient-to-Patient (PTP) metric that evaluates diagnostic reliability at the patient level. Classification employs knowledge distillation: a Data Efficient Image Transformer (DeiT) student model is distilled from a ResNet152 teacher. The distilled ViT achieves an F1-score of 0.92 within 20 epochs, matching near teacher performance (F1=0.97) with significantly reduced computational resources. This end-to-end framework demonstrates high robustness in clinically representative anomaly-distributed data, offering a viable tool that adheres to realistic situations in clinics.</description>

      <title>De-LightSAM: Modality-Decoupled Lightweight SAM for Generalizable Medical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14153v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The universality of deep neural networks across different modalities and their generalization capabilities to unseen domains play an essential role in medical image segmentation. The recent segment anything model (SAM) has demonstrated strong adaptability across diverse natural scenarios. However, the huge computational costs, demand for manual annotations as prompts and conflict-prone decoding process of SAM degrade its generalization capabilities in medical scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a modality-decoupled lightweight SAM for domain-generalized medical image segmentation, named De-LightSAM. Specifically, we first devise a lightweight domain-controllable image encoder (DC-Encoder) that produces discriminative visual features for diverse modalities. Further, we introduce the self-patch prompt generator (SP-Generator) to automatically generate high-quality dense prompt embeddings for guiding segmentation decoding. Finally, we design the query-decoupled modality decoder (QM-Decoder) that leverages a one-to-one strategy to provide an independent decoding channel for every modality, preventing mutual knowledge interference of different modalities. Moreover, we design a multi-modal decoupled knowledge distillation (MDKD) strategy to leverage robust common knowledge to complement domain-specific medical feature representations. Extensive experiments indicate that De-LightSAM outperforms state-of-the-arts in diverse medical imaging segmentation tasks, displaying superior modality universality and generalization capabilities. Especially, De-LightSAM uses only 2.0% parameters compared to SAM-H. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/De-LightSAM.</description>

      <title>Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning the fine-scale details of a coastal ocean simulation from a coarse representation is a challenging task. For real-world applications, high-resolution simulations are necessary to advance understanding of many coastal processes, specifically, to predict flooding resulting from tsunamis and storm surges. We propose a Downscaling Neural Network for Coastal Simulation (DNNCS) for spatiotemporal enhancement to efficiently learn the high-resolution numerical solution. Given images of coastal simulations produced on low-resolution computational meshes using low polynomial order discontinuous Galerkin discretizations and a coarse temporal resolution, the proposed DNNCS learns to produce high-resolution free surface elevation and velocity visualizations in both time and space. To efficiently model the dynamic changes over time and space, we propose grid-aware spatiotemporal attention to project the temporal features to the spatial domain for non-local feature matching. The coordinate information is also utilized via positional encoding. For the final reconstruction, we use the spatiotemporal bilinear operation to interpolate the missing frames and then expand the feature maps to the frequency domain for residual mapping. Besides data-driven losses, the proposed physics-informed loss guarantees gradient consistency and momentum changes. Their combination contributes to the overall 24% improvements in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). To train the proposed model, we propose a novel coastal simulation dataset and use it for model optimization and evaluation. Our method shows superior downscaling quality and fast computation compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Guided Latent Diffusion with Predictive Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, non-medical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM framework centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.071. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74%. Training a classifier solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to training on real images alone. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric framework enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.

      <description>arXiv:2506.12269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-Resolution (SR) is a critical task in computer vision, focusing on reconstructing high-resolution (HR) images from low-resolution (LR) inputs. The field has seen significant progress through various challenges, particularly in single-image SR. Video Super-Resolution (VSR) extends this to the temporal domain, aiming to enhance video quality using methods like local, uni-, bi-directional propagation, or traditional upscaling followed by restoration. This challenge addresses VSR for conferencing, where LR videos are encoded with H.265 at fixed QPs. The goal is to upscale videos by a specific factor, providing HR outputs with enhanced perceptual quality under a low-delay scenario using causal models. The challenge included three tracks: general-purpose videos, talking head videos, and screen content videos, with separate datasets provided by the organizers for training, validation, and testing. We open-sourced a new screen content dataset for the SR task in this challenge. Submissions were evaluated through subjective tests using a crowdsourced implementation of the ITU-T Rec P.910.</description>

Abstract: Segmenting muscle compartments and measuring their architecture can facilitate movement function assessment, accurate musculoskeletal modeling, and synergy-based electromyogram simulation. Here, we presented a novel method for volumetric segmentation of muscle compartments using in vivo imaging, focusing on the independent compartments for finger control of flexor digitorum superficialis (FDS). Besides, we measured the architectural properties of FDS compartments and validated the segmentation. Specifically, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from 10 healthy subjects were used for segmentation and measurement, while electromyography was utilized for validation. A two-step piecewise segmentation was proposed, first annotating compartment regions in the cross-sectional ultrasound image based on compartment movement, and then performing minimum energy matching to register the ultrasound data to the three-dimensional MRI coordinate system. Additionally, the architectural properties were measured in the compartment masks from the segmentation using MRI tractography. Anatomical correctness was verified by comparing known anatomy with reconstructed fiber tracts and measured properties, while segmentation accuracy was quantified as the percentage of finger electromyogram centers falling within their corresponding compartments. Results demonstrated agreement for the fiber orientation between the tractography and cadaveric photographs. Significant differences in architectural properties (P &lt; 0.001) were observed between compartments. The properties of FDS and its compartments were within the physiological ranges (P &lt; 0.01). 95% (38/40) of the electromyogram centers were located within respective compartments, with 2 errors occurring in the index and little fingers. The validated segmentation method and derived architectural properties may advance biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Dehazing Light Microscopy Images with Guided Conditional Flow Matching: finding a sweet spot between fidelity and realism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy is a major driver of scientific progress in the life sciences. Although high-end confocal microscopes are capable of filtering out-of-focus light, cheaper and more accessible microscopy modalities, such as widefield microscopy, can not, which consequently leads to hazy image data. Computational dehazing is trying to combine the best of both worlds, leading to cheap microscopy but crisp-looking images. The perception-distortion trade-off tells us that we can optimize either for data fidelity, e.g. low MSE or high PSNR, or for data realism, measured by perceptual metrics such as LPIPS or FID. Existing methods either prioritize fidelity at the expense of realism, or produce perceptually convincing results that lack quantitative accuracy. In this work, we propose HazeMatching, a novel iterative method for dehazing light microscopy images, which effectively balances these objectives. Our goal was to find a balanced trade-off between the fidelity of the dehazing results and the realism of individual predictions (samples). We achieve this by adapting the conditional flow matching framework by guiding the generative process with a hazy observation in the conditional velocity field. We evaluate HazeMatching on 5 datasets, covering both synthetic and real data, assessing both distortion and perceptual quality. Our method is compared against 7 baselines, achieving a consistent balance between fidelity and realism on average. Additionally, with calibration analysis, we show that HazeMatching produces well-calibrated predictions. Note that our method does not need an explicit degradation operator to exist, making it easily applicable on real microscopy data. All data used for training and evaluation and our code will be publicly available under a permissive license.</description>

      <title>Exposing and Mitigating Calibration Biases and Demographic Unfairness in MLLM Few-Shot In-Context Learning for Medical Image Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enormous potential to perform few-shot in-context learning in the context of medical image analysis. However, safe deployment of these models into real-world clinical practice requires an in-depth analysis of the accuracies of their predictions, and their associated calibration errors, particularly across different demographic subgroups. In this work, we present the first investigation into the calibration biases and demographic unfairness of MLLMs' predictions and confidence scores in few-shot in-context learning for medical image classification. We introduce CALIN, an inference-time calibration method designed to mitigate the associated biases. Specifically, CALIN estimates the amount of calibration needed, represented by calibration matrices, using a bi-level procedure: progressing from the population level to the subgroup level prior to inference. It then applies this estimation to calibrate the predicted confidence scores during inference. Experimental results on three medical imaging datasets: PAPILA for fundus image classification, HAM10000 for skin cancer classification, and MIMIC-CXR for chest X-ray classification demonstrate CALIN's effectiveness at ensuring fair confidence calibration in its prediction, while improving its overall prediction accuracies and exhibiting minimum fairness-utility trade-off.</description>

      <title>SurgTPGS: Semantic 3D Surgical Scene Understanding with Text Promptable Gaussian Splatting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In contemporary surgical research and practice, accurately comprehending 3D surgical scenes with text-promptable capabilities is particularly crucial for surgical planning and real-time intra-operative guidance, where precisely identifying and interacting with surgical tools and anatomical structures is paramount. However, existing works focus on surgical vision-language model (VLM), 3D reconstruction, and segmentation separately, lacking support for real-time text-promptable 3D queries. In this paper, we present SurgTPGS, a novel text-promptable Gaussian Splatting method to fill this gap. We introduce a 3D semantics feature learning strategy incorporating the Segment Anything model and state-of-the-art vision-language models. We extract the segmented language features for 3D surgical scene reconstruction, enabling a more in-depth understanding of the complex surgical environment. We also propose semantic-aware deformation tracking to capture the seamless deformation of semantic features, providing a more precise reconstruction for both texture and semantic features. Furthermore, we present semantic region-aware optimization, which utilizes regional-based semantic information to supervise the training, particularly promoting the reconstruction quality and semantic smoothness. We conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world surgical datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SurgTPGS over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its potential to revolutionize surgical practices. SurgTPGS paves the way for developing next-generation intelligent surgical systems by enhancing surgical precision and safety.
