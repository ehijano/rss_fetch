      <title>Explosive adoption of corrupt behaviors in social systems with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human behaviors in social systems are often shaped by group pressure and collective norms, especially since the rise of social media platforms. However, in the context of adopting misbehaviors, most existing contagion models rely on pairwise interactions and thus fail to capture group-level dynamics. To fill this gap, we introduce a higher-order extension of the Honesty-Corruption-Ostracism (HCO) model to study the emergence of systemic corruption in populations where individuals interact through group structures. The model incorporates contagion-like transitions mediated by hyperedges of arbitrary order, capturing the influence of peer pressure in group settings. Analytical and numerical results show that higher-order interactions induce discontinuous (explosive) transitions between fully honest and fully corrupt regimes, separated by a bistable phase. This abrupt behavior disappears in the pairwise limit, highlighting the destabilizing effect of group interactions. Furthermore, we establish a general correspondence between our model and broader classes of social contagion dynamics with symmetry breaking, recovering previous results as limiting cases. These findings underscore the critical role of higher-order structure in shaping behavioral adoption processes and the stability of social systems.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the network geometry of green bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the green bond market amid increasing emphasis on sustainable development, understanding its structural properties and potential systemic risks has become essential. This study applies Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Hierarchical Tree (HT) methods introduced by Mantegna, which gives a minimum spanning tree of bonds whose mutual distance corresponds to the correlation coefficient of the synchronous time evolution of the difference of the logarithm of their monthly price. Our analysis reveals that green bonds exhibit tighter ultrametric distances on average compared to stocks and conventional bonds, indicating a highly interconnected market structure. We also identify strong sectorial clustering, with green bonds in the utilities sector emerging as the most central nodes by average total betweenness centrality, suggesting their critical role in potential risk propagation. These findings highlight both the opportunities and vulnerabilities inherent in the green bond market, offering insights for investors and policymakers on monitoring concentration, enhancing transparency, and mitigating systemic risks as the market continues to evolve.</description>

      <title>Integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity stabilizes cooperator-defector coexistence in N-player giving games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cooperation persists among strangers despite theoretical predictions of difficulties in large, well-mixed populations, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study N-player giving games with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (X), unconditional defection (Y), and an integrated reciprocal strategy (Z) combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of unconditional defectors and integrated reciprocators whenever the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a threshold (b/c &gt; 2). Counterintuitively, introducing small complexity costs, rather than destabilizing, stabilizes the equilibrium by preventing not only unconditional cooperators (viewed as second-order freeloaders) but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. While the equilibrium frequency of integrated reciprocators decreases with group size N, it remains positive for any finite N. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. Defectors serve as "evolutionary shields" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward chains and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal random networks and their percolation properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of nonreciprocity and network structure on percolation. To this end, we investigate nonreciprocal random networks - directed networks for which the probability of a link occurring from node i to node j differs from the probability of the reverse link occurring from node j to node i. We analytically determine the degree and percolation properties of such networks with exactly two types of link probability, demonstrating that whether the networks are structured such that the nodes are not statistically indistinguishable has profound effects on these measures, both quantitively and in how such networks need to be approached. In particular, we develop a technique for solving the percolation problem which can be applied to both structured and unstructured networks. The method entails writing self-consistent integral and differential equations for the probability that each node will belong to the network's giant component. Exact solutions to these equations are obtained and simulations which confirm our analytic predictions are presented.</description>

      <title>Finite-time consensus in a compromise process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01024v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A compromise process describes the evolution of opinions through binary interactions. Opinions are real numbers, and in each step, two randomly selected agents reach a compromise by acquiring the average of their pre-interaction opinions. We prove that if the number $N$ of agents is a power of two, then consensus emerges after a finite number of compromise events with probability one; otherwise, consensus cannot be reached in a finite number of steps, provided the initial opinions are in a general position. Furthermore, the number of steps required to reach consensus is random for $N=2^k$ with $k\geq 2$. We prove that typically, the smallest number of steps to reach consensus is $k\cdot 2^{k-1}$. For $N=4$, we determine the distribution of the number of steps: we show that it has a purely exponential tail and compute all cumulants.</description>
