      <title>Quantum Simulation of Large N Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hamiltonian lattice formulation of lattice gauge theories opens the possibility for quantum simulations of the non-perturbative dynamics of QCD. By parametrizing the gauge invariant Hilbert space in terms of plaquette degrees of freedom, we show how the Hilbert space and interactions can be expanded in inverse powers of $N_c$. At leading order in this expansion, the Hamiltonian simplifies dramatically, both in the required size of the Hilbert space as well as the type of interactions involved. Adding a truncation of the resulting Hilbert space in terms of local electric energy states we give explicit constructions that allow simple representations of SU(3) gauge fields on qubits and qutrits to leading order in large $N_c$</description>

      <title>Symmetries in high-temperature lattice QCD with (u, d, s, c, b) optimal domain-wall quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial $z$-correlators of meson operators in $N_f=2+1+1+1$ lattice QCD with optimal domain-wall quarks are studied for eight temperatures in the range of 325-3250 MeV. The meson operators include a complete set of Dirac bilinears (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, tensor vector, and axial-tensor vector), and each for ten flavor combinations ($\bar u d$, $\bar u s$, $\bar s s$, $\bar u c$, $\bar s c$, $\bar u b$, $\bar s b$, $\bar c c$, $\bar c b$, $\bar b b$). We first observe the hierarchical restoration of chiral symmetry in QCD with $(u, d, s, c, b)$ quarks, from $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_A $ to $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R \times U(1)_A $, then to $SU(4)_L \times SU(4)_R \times U(1)_A $, and finally to $SU(5)_L \times SU(5)_R \times U(1)_A $, as the temperature is increased successively. Moreover, we study the emergence of the $SU(2)_{CS}$ chiral-spin symmetry, and compare the temperature windows for light and heavy vector mesons, and find that the temperature windows are dominated by the vector mesons of $\bar u b$ and $\bar s b$.</description>

      <title>Studies of nucleon isovector structure with the PACS10 superfine lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results for the nucleon axial-vector, induced pseudoscalar and pion-nucleon couplings obtained from 2+1 flavor lattice QCD at the physical point with a large spatial extent of about 10 fm. Our calculations are performed with the PACS10 gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson-clover quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $\beta$ = 1.82, 2.00 and 2.20 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.09 fm (coarse), 0.06 fm (fine) and 0.04 fm (superfine), respectively. We first evaluate the value of the nucleon axial-vector coupling. In addition, the induced pseudoscalar and pion-nucleon couplings from the induced pseudoscalar form factor are also investigated. Combining the results obtained from the all of our coarse, fine and superfine lattices, we finally discuss the systematic uncertainties in our calculation based on the comparison with both of the experimental values and lattice QCD results provided by the other collaborations.</description>

      <title>Duality and entanglement in lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of entanglement in quantum field theories provides insight into universal properties which are typically challenging to extract by means of local observables. However, calculations of quantities related to entanglement in gauge theories are limited by ambiguities that stem from the non-factorizability of the Hilbert space. On the other hand, (2+1)-dimensional lattice gauge theories are known to admit a dual description in terms of spin models, for which the replica trick and R\'enyi entropies are well defined. In this contribution, we exploit Kramers-Wannier duality to perform a numerical study of the entropic c-function of the (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory in the continuum limit. Our results are compared with analytical predictions from holographic models.</description>

Abstract: The lattice computation of the one-particle irreducible ghost-gluon Green function in the Landau gauge is revisited with a set of large gauge ensembles. The large statistical ensembles enable a precise determination of this Green function over a wide range of momenta, accessing its IR and UV properties with a control on the lattice effects.</description>

      <title>High-precision Quantum Monte-Carlo study of charge transport in a lattice model of molecular organic semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use first-principle Quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) simulations and numerical exact diagonalization to analyze the low-frequency charge carrier mobility within a simple tight-binding model of molecular organic semiconductors on a two-dimensional triangular lattice. These compounds feature transient localization, an unusual charge transport mechanism driven by dynamical disorder. The challenges of studying the transient localization of charge carriers in the low-frequency/long-time limit from first principles are discussed. We demonstrate that a combination of high-precision QMC data with prior estimates of frequency-dependent charge carrier mobility based on the static disorder approximation for phonon fields allows for improved estimates of mobility in the low-frequency limit. We also point out that a simple relaxation time approximation for charge mobility in organic semiconductors is not consistent with the QMC data. Physical similarities with charge transport in quark-gluon plasma are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Lattice simulation of nucleon distribution and shell closure in the proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proton-rich nucleus $^{22}$Si is studied using Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory with high-fidelity chiral forces. Our results indicate that $^{22}$Si is more tightly bound than $^{20}$Mg, thereby excluding the possibility of two-proton emission. The $Z = 14$ shell closure in $^{22}$Si is supported by the evolution of the $2^+$ state in the neighboring nuclei. We then focus on the charge radius and spatial distribution information of $^{22}$Si, considering the novel phenomena that may emerge due to the small two-proton separation energy and the shell closure. We present the distribution of the $14$ protons and $8$ neutrons obtained from our lattice simulation, revealing insights into the spatial arrangement of the nucleons. Moreover, the spatial localization of the outermost proton and neutron suggests that $^{22}$Si is a doubly magic nucleus. Furthermore, we develop the pinhole method based on the harmonic oscillator basis, which gives insight into the nuclear structure in terms of the shell model picture from lattice simulations. Our calculated occupation numbers support that $Z = 14$ and $N = 8$ are the shell closures and show that the $\pi 1s_{1/2}$ orbital component is minor in $^{22}$Si.</description>

      <title>Chiral-odd generalized parton distributions in the large-$N_{c}$ limit of QCD: Spin-flavor structure, polynomiality, sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nonperturbative properties of the nucleon's chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (transversity GPDs) in the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD. This includes the parametric ordering of the spin-flavor components, the polynomiality property of the moments, and the sum rules connecting the GPDs with the tensor form factors. A multipole expansion in the transverse momentum transfer is used to enumerate and interpret the structures in the nucleon matrix element of the chiral-odd partonic operator, including monopole, dipole and quadrupole terms. The $1/N_c$ expansion of the GPDs is performed using the abstract mean-field picture of baryons in the large-$N_c$ limit and its symmetries. We derive a large-$N_c$ relation between the flavor-nonsinglet GPDs $E_T^{u-d}$ and $\tilde H_T^{u-d}$ and test it with recent lattice QCD results. We show that the polynomiality property and sum rules of the GPDs are fulfilled with the restricted realization of translational and rotational invariance in the mean-field picture. The results provide a basis for the phenomenological analysis of chiral-odd GPDs and hard exclusive processes in the large-$N_c$ limit, and for calculations in specific dynamical models.</description>

      <title>Strong CP problem in the quantum rotor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies have claimed that the strong $CP$ problem does not occur in QCD, proposing a new order of limits in volume and topological sectors when studying observables on the lattice. In order to shed light on this issue, we study the effect of the topological $\theta$-term on a simple quantum mechanical rotor that allows a lattice description. The topological susceptibility and the $\theta$-dependence of the energy spectrum are both computed using local lattice correlation functions. The sign problem is overcome by considering Taylor expansions in $\theta$ exploiting automatic differentiation methods for Monte Carlo processes. Our findings confirm the conventional wisdom on the strong $CP$ problem.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing fermion mass $m$ the corresponding susceptibilities and all their derivatives with respect to $m^2$ must be finite. I then use the resulting spectral constraints to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $O(m^4)/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in $m$.</description>

      <title>Properties of the tensor state $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and decays of the exotic tensor meson $T$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are explored in the context of the diquark-antidiquark model. We treat it as a state built of axial-vector diquark $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }c$ and antidiquark $\overline{b}\gamma _{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this tetraquark are extracted from two-point sum rules. Our result for $m=(12.70 \pm 0.09)~\mathrm{GeV}$ proves that $T$ is unstable against strong dissociations to two-meson final states. Its dominant decay channels are processes $T \to J/\psi \Upsilon $, $ \eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, and $B_{c}^{(\ast) +}B_{c}^{(\ast) -}$. Kinematically allowed transformations of $T$ include also decays $T\rightarrow D^{(\ast )+}D^{(\ast )-}$ and $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, which are generated by $b\overline{b}$ annihilation inside of $T$. The full width of $ T $ is estimated by considering all of these channels. Their partial widths are calculated by invoking methods of three-point sum rule approach which are required to evaluate strong couplings at corresponding tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions for the mass and width $ \Gamma_{T}=(117.4 \pm 15.9)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor state $T$ provide useful information for experimental studies of fully heavy four-quark exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Scalar and tensor meson dominance and gravitational form factors of the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent MIT lattice data for the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion which extend up to $Q^2= 2~{\rm GeV}^2$ for $m_\pi=170$~MeV~\cite{Hackett:2023nkr}. We show that simple monopole fits comply with the old idea of meson dominance. We use Chiral Perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) to next-to-leading order (NLO) to transform the MIT data to the physical world with $m_\pi=140~$MeV and find that the spin-0 GFF is effectively saturated with the $f_0(600)$ and the spin-2 with the $f_2(1270)$, with monopole masses $m_\sigma= 630(60)$~MeV and $m_{f_2}= 1270(40)$~MeV. We determine in passing the chiral low energy constants (LECs) from the MIT lattice data alone \[ 10^3 \cdot L_{11} (m_\rho^2)=1.06(15) \, , \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{12} (m_\rho^2)= -2.2(1) \, , \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{13} (m_\rho^2) = -0.7(1.1). \] which agree in sign and order of magnitude % to be compared with the original estimates by Donoghue and Leutwyler. The corresponding D-term (druck) has the value $ D(0) = -0.95(3) $. We also analyze the sum rules based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) that imply that the corresponding spectral functions are not positive definite. We show that these sum rules are strongly violated in a variety of $\pi\pi-K \bar K$ coupled channel Omn\`es-Muskhelishvili calculations. This is not mended by the inclusion of the pQCD tail, suggesting the need for an extra negative spectral strength. Using a simple model implementing all sum rules, we find the expected onset of pQCD at very high momenta.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>
