      <title>Orthogonality Analysis in LoRa Uplink Satellite Communications Affected by Doppler Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides, for the first time, analytical expressions for the Long-Range (LoRa) waveform and cross-correlation in both continuous and discrete time domains under the Doppler effect in satellite communication. We propose the concept and formulas of the shared visibility window for satellites toward two ground devices. Our analysis covers cross-correlation results with varying spreading factors (SF) for no-Doppler and with-Doppler cases. We find the maximum cross-correlation with different SFs and the mean cross-correlation are immune to the Doppler effect. However, the maximum cross-correlation with the same SFs is only immune to high Doppler shift, with its value fluctuating between 0.6 and 1 under high Doppler rate. We interpret this fluctuation by introducing the relationship between transmission start time and cross-correlation. We provide a parameter analysis for orbit height, ground device distance, and inclination angle. Additionally, we analyze the bit error rate (BER) for LoRa signals and observe worse performance under high Doppler shift or interference with same SF. Increasing the SNR or the SIR improves the BER only when Doppler effect is below a frequency threshold. Notably, under Doppler effect, the performance behaviors of BER no longer align with those of maximum cross-correlation. Finally, our results lead to two recommendations: 1) To mitigate Doppler impact on cross-correlation, we recommend utilizing low SFs, high orbit height, short ground device distance, and the transmission start time with high Doppler shift; 2) To mitigate Doppler impact on BER, we recommend employing low SFs, high bandwidth, and transmission start time with high Doppler rate. These conflicting recommendations regarding transmission start time highlight the necessity of Doppler shift compensation techniques to help operate LoRa in space properly.</description>

      <title>Importance-Aware Source-Channel Coding for Multi-Modal Task-Oriented Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of information importance in multi-modal task-oriented semantic communication systems, emphasizing the need for high accuracy and efficiency to fulfill task-specific objectives. At the transmitter, generative AI (GenAI) is employed to partition visual data objects into semantic segments, each representing distinct, task-relevant information. These segments are subsequently encoded into tokens, enabling precise and adaptive transmission control. Building on this frame work, we present importance-aware source and channel coding strategies that dynamically adjust to varying levels of significance at the segment, token, and bit levels. The proposed strategies prioritize high fidelity for essential information while permitting controlled distortion for less critical elements, optimizing overall resource utilization. Furthermore, we address the source-channel coding challenge in semantic multiuser systems, particularly in multicast scenarios, where segment importance varies among receivers. To tackle these challenges, we propose solutions such as rate-splitting coded progressive transmission, ensuring flexibility and robustness in task-specific semantic communication.</description>

      <title>rECGnition_v2.0: Self-Attentive Canonical Fusion of ECG and Patient Data using deep learning for effective Cardiac Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variability in ECG readings influenced by individual patient characteristics has posed a considerable challenge to adopting automated ECG analysis in clinical settings. A novel feature fusion technique termed SACC (Self Attentive Canonical Correlation) was proposed to address this. This technique is combined with DPN (Dual Pathway Network) and depth-wise separable convolution to create a robust, interpretable, and fast end-to-end arrhythmia classification model named rECGnition_v2.0 (robust ECG abnormality detection). This study uses MIT-BIH, INCARTDB and EDB dataset to evaluate the efficiency of rECGnition_v2.0 for various classes of arrhythmias. To investigate the influence of constituting model components, various ablation studies were performed, i.e. simple concatenation, CCA and proposed SACC were compared, while the importance of global and local ECG features were tested using DPN rECGnition_v2.0 model and vice versa. It was also benchmarked with state-of-the-art CNN models for overall accuracy vs model parameters, FLOPs, memory requirements, and prediction time. Furthermore, the inner working of the model was interpreted by comparing the activation locations in ECG before and after the SACC layer. rECGnition_v2.0 showed a remarkable accuracy of 98.07% and an F1-score of 98.05% for classifying ten distinct classes of arrhythmia with just 82.7M FLOPs per sample, thereby going beyond the performance metrics of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models by utilizing MIT-BIH Arrhythmia dataset. Similarly, on INCARTDB and EDB datasets, excellent F1-scores of 98.01% and 96.21% respectively was achieved for AAMI classification. The compact architectural footprint of the rECGnition_v2.0, characterized by its lesser trainable parameters and diminished computational demands, unfurled several advantages including interpretability and scalability.</description>

      <title>A 2-bit Wideband 5G mm-Wave RIS with Low Side Lobe Levels and no Quantization Lobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with 1-bit phase resolution suffers from high side lobe levels (SLLs) in the near field and pronounced quantization lobe levels (QLLs) in the far field, which is detrimental for the quality of wireless communication. RIS design is further challenging in the mm-wave bands, where typically large bandwidths are required. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel wideband 5G mm-Wave RIS with 2-bit phase quantization, capable of covering the entire 5G n258 band. The proposed unit cell design is a combination of a grounded main slot, a parasitic slot, and a coupling patch, utilizing only two PIN diodes. This design achieves a 2-bit bandwidth (BW) of 24.1--27.7 GHz (13.9\%) and an effective 1-bit BW of 20.0--28.9 GHz (36.4\%). The unit cell features a compact size of 0.39$\lambda$ $\times$ 0.39$\lambda$, providing decent angular stability of $\pm30^\circ$ as well as eliminating the grating lobes. Based on this unit cell design, a 20 $\times$ 20 RIS array has been designed, fabricated, and experimentally characterized. The measured results demonstrate that, within the 5G n258 band, the proposed 2-bit 5G mm-Wave RIS achieves an SLL of -15.4 dB in the near field, representing a 7.6 dB improvement compared to its 1-bit counterpart. Furthermore, it has almost negligible QLL (-14.6 dB) in the far field, providing a suppression of 13.3 dB relative to the 1-bit design. Thus, the proposed 2-bit mm-Wave RIS offers wideband performance, low SLL, negligible QLL, decent angular stability, and a broad beam scanning range of 50$^\circ$, making it a promising solution for high-resolution and low-interference mm-Wave wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>A Multi-layer Non-Terrestrial Networks Architecture for 6G and Beyond under Realistic Conditions and with Practical Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to bolster the next generation of wireless networks, there has been a great deal of interest in non-terrestrial networks (NTN), including satellites, high altitude platform stations (HAPS), and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV). To unlock their full potential, these platforms can integrate advanced technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces~(RIS) and next-generation multiple access (NGMA). However, in practical applications, transceivers often suffer from radio frequency (RF) impairments, which limit system performance. In this regard, this paper explores the potential of multi-layer NTN architecture to mitigate path propagation loss and improve network performance under hardware impairment limitations. First, we present current research activities in the NTN framework, including RIS, multiple access technologies, and hardware impairments. Next, we introduce a multi-layer NTN architecture with hardware limitations. This architecture includes HAPS super-macro base stations (HAPS-SMBS), UAVs--equipped with passive or active transmissive RIS--, and NGMA techniques, like non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), as the multiple access techniques to serve terrestrial devices. Additionally, we present and discuss potential use cases of the proposed multi-layer architecture considering hardware impairments. The multi-layer NTN architecture combined with advanced technologies, such as RIS and NGMA, demonstrates promising results; however, the performance degradation is attributed to RF impairments. Finally, we identify future research directions, including RF impairment mitigation, UAV power management, and antenna designs.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer Accelerator ASIC for Real-Time, Low-Power Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight vision transformer aimed at automatic sleep staging in a wearable device. The model is trained on the MASS SS3 dataset and achieves an accuracy of 82.9% on a 4-stage classification task with only 31.6k weights. The model is implemented in hardware and synthesized in 65nm CMOS. The accelerator consumes 6.54mW of dynamic power and 11.0mW of leakage power over 45.6ms. Using aggressive power gating while the accelerator is idle, it is calculated that the effective power consumption is 0.56mW. The accelerator uses only 0.754mm2 of silicon and has a clock frequency of 379MHz. These metrics are possible thanks to a layer-dependent fixed-point format and data width and a window average filter on the final softmax layer of the vision transformer.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Assisted Channel Estimation for OFDM ISAC Systems: Framework, Algorithm, and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we delve into the topic of sensing-assisted communication within ISAC systems. More specifically, a novel sensing-assisted channel estimation scheme is proposed for bistatic orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC systems. A framework of sensing-assisted channel estimator is first developed, integrating a tailored low-complexity sensing algorithm to facilitate real-time channel estimation and decoding. To address the potential sensing errors caused by low-complexity sensing algorithms, a sensing-assisted linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation algorithm is then developed. This algorithm incorporates tolerance factors designed to account for deviations between estimated and true channel parameters, enabling the construction of robust correlation matrices for LMMSE estimation. Additionally, we establish a systematic mechanism for determining these tolerance factors. A comprehensive analysis of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance and computational complexity is finally conducted, providing valuable insights into the selection of the estimator's parameters. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated by extensive simulations. Compared to existing methods, our proposed scheme demonstrates superior performance, particularly in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions or with large bandwidths, while maintaining low computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling of Rat Brain Local Field Potentials using Single-Variable and Multivariable Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of neural dynamics in the brain's reward circuitry is crucial for elucidating how natural and pharmacological rewards influence neural activity and connectivity. Traditional linear models, such as autoregressive (AR) and vector autoregressive (VAR), often inadequately capture the inherent nonlinear interactions in neural data. This study develops and benchmarks both linear and advanced deep learning models for predicting local field potentials (LFPs) in the rat hippocampus (HIP) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) across morphine, food, and saline conditions. We compared AR, VAR, long short-term memory (LSTM), and wavelet-based deep learning model (WCLSA). Additionally, a novel wavelet coherence-enhanced model (WCOH CLSA) was introduced to capture cross-region connectivity. Results indicate that WCLSA achieves superior predictive accuracy (up to 0.97 for HIP in food, 0.96 for NAc in morphine), while VAR performs competitively in the food group due to significant HIP-NAc correlation. Wavelet coherence analysis reveals robust connectivity in natural reward contexts and disrupted or nonlinear relationships under pharmacological influence. These findings highlight the differential engagement of HIP and NAc in reward processing and underscore the importance of advanced nonlinear models for capturing complex neural dynamics. The study provides a robust framework for predictive neuroscience and elucidates functional interactions within the reward circuitry.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Antenna Activation for Even Power Distribution in Multi-Beam Satellite Systems Using Genetic Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in onboard satellite communication have significantly enhanced the ability to dynamically modify the radiation pattern of a Direct Radiating Array, which is essential for both conventional communication satellites like GEO and those in lower orbits such as LEO. This is particularly relevant for communication at 28 GHz, a key frequency in the mmWave spectrum, used for high-bandwidth satellite links and 5G communications. Critical design factors include the number of beams, beamwidth, and SLL for each beam. However, in multibeam scenarios, balancing these design factors can result in uneven power distribution, leading to over-saturation in centrally located antenna elements due to frequent activations. This paper introduces a GA-based approach to optimize beamforming coefficients by modulating the amplitude component of the weight matrix, while imposing a constraint on activation instances per element to avoid over-saturation in the RF chain. The proposed method, tested on an 16x16 DRA patch antenna array at 28 GHz for a CubeSat orbiting at 500 km, demonstrates how the algorithm efficiently meets beam pattern requirements and ensures uniform activation distribution. These findings are particularly relevant for emerging satellite systems and 5G networks operating in the mmWave spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for cost-effective, low-profile user terminals for satellite communications supporting multicast services for Geostationary Orbit (GEO) satellites, has become a key focus for many Direct-to-Home (DTH) providers where the high data rates in the downlink are required. Planar antenna arrays with increased frequency bandwidth and improved ratio using meta-surfaces are considered as an effective solution for such systems. This paper presents a low-cost, aperture-coupled metasurface-enhanced patch antenna, operating within the 10.7-12.7 GHz frequency range. The antenna is designed to achieve a realized gain of at least 27 dBi across the band of interest using 32 x 32 array antennas distributed in a rectangular lattice. Initially configured for linear polarization, the antenna can be upgraded to support dual or circular polarization if required.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Localization with Dynamic Metasurface Antennas at THz: A CRB Minimizing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent trend for extremely massive antenna arrays and high frequencies facilitates localization and sensing, offering increased angular and range resolution. In this letter, we focus on the emerging technology of Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs) and present a novel framework for the design of their analog beamforming weights, targeting high accuracy near-field localization at the THz frequency band. We derive the Cram\'{e}r-Rao Bound (CRB) for the estimation of the positions of multiple users with a DMA-based receiver, which is then utilized as the optimization objective for the receiver's discrete tunable states of its metamaterials. Leveraging the DMA structure, we reformulate the localization objective into a constrained Rayleigh quotient maximization problem, which is efficiently solved via two schemes: one based on projection and a greedy one. Our simulation results verify the validity of our near-field localization analysis, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed near-field localization designs over the optimum exhaustive search solution and state-of-the-art schemes.</description>

      <title>Holographic MIMO Multi-Cell Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterial antennas are appealing for next-generation wireless networks due to their simplified hardware and much-reduced size, power, and cost. This paper investigates the holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO)-aided multi-cell systems with practical per-radio frequency (RF) chain power constraints. With multiple antennas at both base stations (BSs) and users, we design the baseband digital precoder and the tuning response of HMIMO metamaterial elements to maximize the weighted sum user rate. Specifically, under the framework of block coordinate descent (BCD) and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) techniques, we derive the low-complexity closed-form solution for baseband precoder without requiring bisection search and matrix inversion. Then, for the design of HMIMO metamaterial elements under binary tuning constraints, we first propose a low-complexity suboptimal algorithm with closed-form solutions by exploiting the hidden convexity (HC) in the quadratic problem and then further propose an accelerated sphere decoding (SD)-based algorithm which yields global optimal solution in the iteration. For HMIMO metamaterial element design under the Lorentzian-constrained phase model, we propose a maximization-minorization (MM) algorithm with closed-form solutions at each iteration step. Furthermore, in a simplified multiple-input single-output (MISO) scenario, we derive the scaling law of downlink single-to-noise (SNR) for HMIMO with binary and Lorentzian tuning constraints and theoretically compare it with conventional fully digital/hybrid arrays. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithms compared to benchmarks and the benefits of HMIMO compared to conventional arrays.</description>

      <title>Joint Size and Placement Optimization for IRS-Aided Communications with Active and Passive Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different types of intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) are exploited for assisting wireless communications. The joint use of passive IRS (PIRS) and active IRS (AIRS) emerges as a promising solution owing to their complementary advantages. They can be integrated into a single hybrid active-passive IRS (HIRS) or deployed in a distributed manner, which poses challenges in determining the IRS element allocation and placement for rate maximization. In this paper, we investigate the capacity of an IRS-aided wireless communication system with both active and passive elements. Specifically, we consider three deployment schemes: 1) base station (BS)-HIRS-user (BHU); 2) BS-AIRS-PIRS-user (BAPU); 3) BS-PIRS-AIRS-user (BPAU). Under the line-of-sight channel model, we formulate a rate maximization problem via a joint optimization of the IRS element allocation and placement. We first derive the optimized number of active and passive elements for BHU, BAPU, and BPAU schemes, respectively. Then, low-complexity HIRS/AIRS placement strategies are provided. To obtain more insights, we characterize the system capacity scaling orders for the three schemes with respect to the large total number of IRS elements, amplification power budget, and BS transmit power. Finally, simulation results are presented to validate our theoretical findings and show the performance difference among the BHU, BAPU, and BPAU schemes with the proposed joint design under various system setups.</description>

      <title>220 GHz RIS-Aided Multi-user Terahertz Communication System: Prototype Design and Over-the-Air Experimental Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) communication technology is regarded as a promising enabler for achieving ultra-high data rate transmission in next-generation communication systems. To mitigate the high path loss in THz systems, the transmitting beams are typically narrow and highly directional, which makes it difficult for a single beam to serve multiple users simultaneously. To address this challenge, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), which can dynamically manipulate the wireless propagation environment, have been integrated into THz communication systems to extend coverage. Existing works mostly remain theoretical analysis and simulation, while prototype validation of RIS-assisted THz communication systems is scarce. In this paper, we designed a liquid crystal-based RIS operating at 220 GHz supporting both single-user and multi-user communication scenarios, followed by a RIS-aided THz communication system prototype. To enhance the system performance, we developed a beamforming method including a real-time power feedback control, which is compatible with both single-beam and multibeam modes. To support simultaneous multi-user transmission, we designed an OFDM-based resource allocation scheme. In our experiments, the received power gain with RIS is no less than 10 dB in the single-beam mode, and no less than 5 dB in the multi-beam mode. With the assistance of RIS, the achievable rate of the system could reach 2.341 Gbps with 3 users sharing 400 MHz bandwidth and the bit error rate (BER) of the system decreased sharply. Finally, an image transmission experiment was conducted to vividly show that the receiver could recover the transmitted information correctly with the help of RIS. The experimental results also demonstrated that the received signal quality was enhanced through power feedback adjustments.</description>

      <title>Latency-Aware Resource Allocation for Integrated Communications, Computation, and Sensing in Cell-Free mMIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO)-enabled integration communication, computation, and sensing (ICCS) system, aiming to minimize the maximum computation latency to guarantee the stringent sensing requirements. We consider a two-tier offloading framework, where each multi-antenna terminal can optionally offload its local tasks to either multiple mobile-edge servers for distributed computation or the cloud server for centralized computation while satisfying the sensing requirements and power constraint. The above offloading problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming and non-convex problem, which can be decomposed into three sub-problems, namely, distributed offloading decision, beamforming design, and execution scheduling mechanism. First, the continuous relaxation and penalty-based techniques are applied to tackle the distributed offloading strategy. Then, the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based lower bound are utilized to design the integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) beamforming. Finally, the other resources can be judiciously scheduled to minimize the maximum latency. A rigorous convergence analysis and numerical results substantiate the effectiveness of our method. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate that multi-point cooperation in cell-free massive MIMO-enabled ICCS significantly reduces overall computation latency, in comparison to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Matrix Pencil Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of detecting the number of complex exponentials and estimating their parameters from a noisy signal using the Matrix Pencil (MP) method. We introduce the MP modes and present their informative spectral structure. We show theoretically that these modes can be divided into signal and noise modes, where the signal modes exhibit a perturbed Vandermonde structure. Leveraging this structure, we proposed a new MP algorithm, termed the SAMP algorithm, which has two novel components. First, we present a new and robust model order detection with theoretical guarantees. Second, we present an efficient estimation of signal amplitudes. We show empirically that the SAMP algorithm significantly outperforms the standard MP method, particularly in challenging conditions with closely-spaced frequencies and low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values, approaching the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRB) for a broad SNR range. Additionally, compared with prevalent information-based criteria, we show that SAMP is more computationally efficient and insensitive to noise distribution.</description>

      <title>Convergence Guarantees for Unmixing PSFs over a Manifold with Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of recovering the parameters of a mixture of spike signals convolved with different PSFs is considered. Herein, the spike support is assumed to be known, while the PSFs lie on a manifold. A non-linear least squares estimator of the mixture parameters is formulated. In the absence of noise, a lower bound on the radius of the strong basin of attraction i.e., the region of convergence, is derived. Key to the analysis is the introduction of coherence and interference functions, which capture the conditioning of the PSF manifold in terms of the minimal separation of the support. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical findings. Finally, the practicality and efficacy of the non-linear least squares approach are showcased on spectral data from laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Noise Modulation over Wireless Energy Transfer: JEIH-Noise Mod</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents an innovative energy harvesting (EH) and communication scheme for Internet of Things (IoT) devices by utilizing the emerging noise modulation (Noise-Mod) technique. Our proposed approach embeds information into the mean value of real Gaussian noise samples, enabling simultaneous power transfer and data transmission. We analyze our system under the Rician fading channels with path loss and derive the bit error probability (BEP) expression. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms conventional modulation schemes in terms of energy harvesting capability across various channel conditions. This scheme offers a novel solution by directly embedding data into the noise-modulated signal to enable information decoding through mean-based detection. Furthermore, it increases energy harvesting capability thanks to the utilized Gaussian waveform.</description>

      <title>A First Look at the Performance Enhancement Potential of Fluid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna concept represents shape-flexible and position-flexible antenna technologies designed to enhance wireless communication applications. In this paper, we apply this concept to reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), introducing fluid RIS (FRIS), where each tunably reflecting element becomes a fluid element with additional position reconfigurability. This new paradigm is referred to as fluid RIS (FRIS). We investigate an FRIS-programmable wireless channel, where the fluid meta-surface is divided into non-overlapping subareas, each acting as a fluid element that can dynamically adjust both its position and phase shift of the reflected signal. We first analyze the single-user, single-input single-output (SU-SISO) channel, in which a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a single-antenna receiver via an FRIS. The achievable rate is maximized by optimizing the fluid elements using a particle swarm optimization (PSO)- based approach. Next, we extend our analysis to the multi-user, multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) case, where a multi-antenna base station (BS) transmits individual data streams to multiple single-antenna users via an FRIS. In this case, the joint optimization of the positions and phase shifts of the FRIS element, as well as the BS precoding to maximize the sum-rate is studied. To solve the problem, a combination of techniques including PSO, semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and minimum mean square error (MMSE) is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FRIS approach significantly outperforms conventional RIS configurations in terms of achievable rate performance.</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks for Channel Estimation in RIS-Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology has been explored as a potential advancement for future wireless networks, striving to effectively use spectral resources for both communication and sensing. The integration of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with ISAC further enhances this capability by optimizing the propagation environment, thereby improving both the sensing accuracy and communication quality. Within this domain, accurate channel estimation is crucial to ensure a reliable deployment. Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches, while effective, can impose performance limitations in modeling the complex dynamics of wireless channels. This paper proposes a novel application of conditional generative adversarial networks (CGANs) to solve the channel estimation problem of an RIS-assisted ISAC system. The CGAN framework adversarially trains two DL networks, enabling the generator network to not only learn the mapping relationship from observed data to real channel conditions but also to improve its output based on the discriminator network feedback, thus effectively optimizing the training process and estimation accuracy. The numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed CGAN-based method improves the estimation performance effectively compared to conventional DL techniques. The results highlight the CGAN's potential to revolutionize channel estimation, paving the way for more accurate and reliable ISAC deployments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-growing power consumption of wireless communication systems necessitates more energy-efficient algorithms. This paper introduces SpikACom ({Spik}ing {A}daptive {Com}munication), a neuromorphic computing-based framework for power-intensive wireless communication tasks. SpikACom leverages brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) for efficient signal processing. It is designed for dynamic wireless environments, helping to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and facilitate adaptation to new circumstances. Moreover, SpikACom is customizable, allowing flexibly integration of domain knowledge to enhance it interpretability and efficacy. We validate its performance on fundamental wireless communication tasks, including task-oriented semantic communication, multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming, and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) channel estimation. The simulation results show that SpikACom significantly reduces power consumption while matching or exceeding the performance of conventional algorithms. This study highlights the potential of SNNs for enabling greener and smarter wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>AIRIS2 : a Smart Gateway Diversity Algorithm for Very High-Throughput Satellite Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite communication systems are shifting to higher frequency bands (Ka, Q/V, W) to support more data-intensive services and alleviate spectral congestion. However, the use of Extremely High Frequencies, typically above 20 GHz, causes significant tropospheric impairments, such as rain attenuation, which can causes system outages.
  To mitigate these effects, Smart Gateway Diversity (SGD) has emerged as a promising method for maximizing feeder link availability through an adaptive site diversity scheme. However, implementing such technique requires a decision-making policy to dynamically select the optimal set of gateways and prevent outages.
  This paper introduces AIRIS2, a deep learning algorithm that anticipates short-term rain events from rain attenuation measurement to enable efficient gateway switching. The approach is validated from five years of measured time series collected at Ka and Q/V bands at various sites and climatic conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing CoMP-RSMA Performance with Movable Antennas: A Meta-Learning Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates a downlink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) scenario in which multiple base stations (BSs), employing a coordinated multi-point (CoMP) transmission scheme, serve users equipped with movable antenna (MA) technology. Unlike traditional fixed-position antennas (FPAs), which are subject to random variations in wireless channels, MAs can be strategically repositioned to locations with more favorable channel conditions, thereby achieving enhanced spatial diversity gains.To leverage these advantages and maximize the achievable sum rate, we formulate an optimization problem that jointly determines the optimal transmit beamforming vectors at the BSs, the common stream allocation for different users, and the optimal positioning of the MAs, all while ensuring compliance with quality of service (QoS) constraints. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and computationally challenging due to the strong interdependence among the optimization variables. Traditional methods for solving large-scale optimization problems typically incur prohibitively high computational complexity. To address the above challenge, we propose a gradient-based meta-learning (GML) algorithm that operates without pre-training and is well-suited for handling large-scale optimization tasks. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach, achieving near-optimal performance (exceeding 97% compared to the optimal solution). Moreover, the MA-enabled CoMP-RSMA model significantly outperforms conventional benchmark schemes, yielding performance gains of up to 190% over the spatial division multiple access (SDMA) scheme and 80% over the RSMA FPA-based model. Finally, the proposed approach is shown to mitigate the sum-rate limitations imposed by interference in SDMA, achieving superior performance with fewer BSs.</description>

      <title>Joint Holographic Beamforming and User Scheduling with Individual QoS Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surfaces (RHS) have emerged as a transformative material technology, enabling dynamic control of electromagnetic waves to generate versatile holographic beam patterns. This paper addresses the problem of joint hybrid holographic beamforming and user scheduling under per-user minimum quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, a critical challenge in resource-constrained networks. However, such a problem results in mixed-integer non-convex optimization, making it difficult to identify feasible solutions efficiently. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel iterative optimization framework that jointly solves the problem to maximize the RHS-assisted network sum-rate, efficiently managing holographic beamforming patterns, dynamically scheduling users, and ensuring the minimum QoS requirements for each scheduled user. The proposed framework relies on zero-forcing digital beamforming, gradient-ascent-based holographic beamformer optimization, and a greedy user selection principle. Our extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme, demonstrating their superior performance compared to the benchmark algorithms in terms of sum-rate performance, while meeting the minimum per-user QoS constraints</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and 3D Location Optimization for Multi-User Holographic UAV Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper pioneers the field of multi-user holographic unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications, laying a solid foundation for future innovations in next-generation aerial wireless networks. The study focuses on the challenging problem of jointly optimizing hybrid holographic beamforming and 3D UAV positioning in scenarios where the UAV is equipped with a reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) instead of conventional phased array antennas. Using the unique capabilities of RHSs, the system dynamically adjusts both the position of the UAV and its hybrid beamforming properties to maximize the sum rate of the network. To address this complex optimization problem, we propose an iterative algorithm combining zero-forcing digital beamforming and a gradient ascent approach for the holographic patterns and the 3D position optimization, while ensuring practical feasibility constraints. The algorithm is designed to effectively balance the trade-offs between power, beamforming, and UAV trajectory constraints, enabling adaptive and efficient communications, while assuring a monotonic increase in the sum-rate performance. Our numerical investigations demonstrate that the significant performance improvements with the proposed approach over the benchmark methods, showcasing enhanced sum rate and system adaptability under varying conditions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking machine learning for bowel sound pattern classification from tabular features to pretrained models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of electronic stethoscopes and wearable recording sensors opened the door to the automated analysis of bowel sound (BS) signals. This enables a data-driven analysis of bowel sound patterns, their interrelations, and their correlation to different pathologies. This work leverages a BS dataset collected from 16 healthy subjects that was annotated according to four established BS patterns. This dataset is used to evaluate the performance of machine learning models to detect and/or classify BS patterns. The selection of considered models covers models using tabular features, convolutional neural networks based on spectrograms and models pre-trained on large audio datasets. The results highlight the clear superiority of pre-trained models, particularly in detecting classes with few samples, achieving an AUC of 0.89 in distinguishing BS from non-BS using a HuBERT model and an AUC of 0.89 in differentiating bowel sound patterns using a Wav2Vec 2.0 model. These results pave the way for an improved understanding of bowel sounds in general and future machine-learning-driven diagnostic applications for gastrointestinal examinations</description>

      <title>Multi-Failure Localization in High-Degree ROADM-based Optical Networks using Rules-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accommodate ever-growing traffic, network operators are actively deploying high-degree reconfigurable optical add/drop multiplexers (ROADMs) to build large-capacity optical networks. High-degree ROADM-based optical networks have multiple parallel fibers between ROADM nodes, requiring the adoption of ROADM nodes with a large number of inter-/intra-node components. However, this large number of inter-/intra-node optical components in high-degree ROADM networks increases the likelihood of multiple failures simultaneously, and calls for novel methods for accurate localization of multiple failed components. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the problem of multi-failure localization for high-degree ROADM-based optical networks. To solve this problem, we first provide a description of the failures affecting both inter-/intra-node components, and we consider different deployments of optical power monitors (OPMs) to obtain information (i.e., optical power) to be used for automated multi-failure localization. Then, as our main and original contribution, we propose a novel method based on a rules-informed neural network (RINN) for multi-failure localization, which incorporates the benefits of both rules-based reasoning and artificial neural networks (ANN). Through extensive simulations and experimental demonstrations, we show that our proposed RINN algorithm can achieve up to around 20 higher localization accuracy compared to baseline algorithms, incurring only around 4.14 ms of average inference time.</description>

      <title>CacheMamba: Popularity Prediction for Mobile Edge Caching Networks via Selective State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile Edge Caching (MEC) plays a pivotal role in mitigating latency in data-intensive services by dynamically caching frequently requested content on edge servers. This capability is critical for applications such as Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR), and Autonomous Vehicles (AV), where efficient content caching and accurate popularity prediction are essential for optimizing performance. In this paper, we explore the problem of popularity prediction in MEC by utilizing historical time-series request data of intended files, formulating this problem as a ranking task. To this aim, we propose CacheMamba model by employing Mamba, a state-space model (SSM)-based architecture, to identify the top-K files with the highest likelihood of being requested. We then benchmark the proposed model against a Transformer-based approach, demonstrating its superior performance in terms of cache-hit rate, Mean Average Precision (MAP), Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), and Floating-Point Operations Per Second (FLOPS), particularly when dealing with longer sequences.</description>

      <title>From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</description>

      <title>Computation Offloading Strategies in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of computation-intensive applications like augmented reality, autonomous driving, remote healthcare, and smart cities has exposed the limitations of traditional terrestrial networks, particularly in terms of inadequate coverage, limited capacity, and high latency in remote areas. This chapter explores how integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (IT-NTNs) can address these challenges and enable efficient computation offloading. We examine mobile edge computing (MEC) and its evolution toward multiple-access edge computing, highlighting the critical role computation offloading plays for resource-constrained devices. We then discuss the architecture of IT-NTNs, focusing on how terrestrial base stations, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high-altitude platforms (HAPs), and LEO satellites work together to deliver ubiquitous connectivity. Furthermore, we analyze various computation offloading strategies, including edge, cloud, and hybrid offloading, outlining their strengths and weaknesses. Key enabling technologies such as NOMA, mmWave/THz communication, and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are also explored as essential components of existing algorithms for resource allocation, task offloading decisions, and mobility management. Finally, we conclude by highlighting the transformative impact of computation offloading in IT-NTNs across diverse application areas and discuss key challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the potential of these networks to revolutionize communication and computation paradigms.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Agricultural Monitoring with Aerial Drones and RF Energy-Harvesting Sensor Tags</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In precision agriculture and plant science, there is an increasing demand for wireless sensors that are easy to deploy, maintain, and monitor. This paper investigates a novel approach that leverages recent advances in extremely low-power wireless communication and sensing, as well as the rapidly increasing availability of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms. By mounting a specialized wireless payload on a UAV, battery-less sensor tags can harvest wireless beacon signals emitted from the drone, dramatically reducing the cost per sensor. These tags can measure environmental information such as temperature and humidity, then encrypt and transmit the data in the range of several meters. An experimental implementation was constructed at AERPAW, an NSF-funded wireless aerial drone research platform. While ground-based tests confirmed reliable sensor operation and data collection, airborne trials encountered wireless interference that impeded successfully detecting tag data. Despite these challenges, our results suggest further refinements could improve reliability and advance precision agriculture and agrarian research.</description>

      <title>Single-Channel EEG Tokenization Through Time-Frequency Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TFM-Tokenizer, a novel tokenization framework tailored for EEG analysis that transforms continuous, noisy brain signals into a sequence of discrete, well-represented tokens for various EEG tasks. Conventional approaches typically rely on continuous embeddings and inter-channel dependencies, which are limited in capturing inherent EEG features such as temporally unpredictable patterns and diverse oscillatory waveforms. In contrast, we hypothesize that critical time-frequency features can be effectively captured from a single channel. By learning tokens that encapsulate these intrinsic patterns within a single channel, our approach yields a scalable tokenizer adaptable across diverse EEG settings. We integrate the TFM-Tokenizer with a transformer-based TFM-Encoder, leveraging established pretraining techniques from natural language processing, such as masked token prediction, followed by downstream fine-tuning for various EEG tasks. Experiments across four EEG datasets show that TFM-Token outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On TUEV, our approach improves balanced accuracy and Cohen's Kappa by 5% over baselines. Comprehensive analysis of the learned tokens demonstrates their ability to capture class-distinctive features, enhance frequency representation, and ability to encode time-frequency motifs into distinct tokens, improving interpretability.</description>

      <title>From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part II: Regularized Polynomial Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Target tracking entails the estimation of the evolution of the target state over time, namely the target trajectory. Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>On Distributed Average Consensus Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Average consensus (AC) strategies play a key role in every system that employs cooperation by means of distributed computations. To promote consensus, an $N$-agent network can repeatedly combine certain node estimates until their mean value is reached. Such algorithms are typically formulated as (global) recursive matrix-vector products of size $N$, where consensus is attained either asymptotically or in finite time. We revisit some existing approaches in these directions and propose new iterative and exact solutions to the problem. Considering directed graphs, this is carried out by interplaying with standalone conterparts, while underpinned by the so-called eigenstep method of finite-time convergence. In particular, we focus on reducing complexity so as to require, overall, as little as ${\cal O}(N)$ additions to achieve the solution exactly. For undirected graphs, the latter compares favorably to existing schemes that require, in total, ${\cal O}(KN^2)$ multiplications to deliver the AC, where $K$ refers to the number of distinct eivenvalues of the underlying graph Laplacian matrix.</description>

      <title>Power Domain Sparse Dimensional Constellation Multiple Access (PD-SDCMA): A Novel PD-NOMA for More Access Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of the 6G mobile communication network era, the existing non-orthogonal multiple-access (NOMA) technology faces the challenge of high successive interference in multi-user scenarios, which limits its ability to support more user access. To address this, this paper proposes a novel power-domain sparse-dimensional constellation multiple-access scheme (PD-SDCMA). Through the signal space dimension selection strategy (S2D-strategy), this scheme sparsely superposes low-dimensional constellations onto high-dimensional signal spaces, and reduces the high-order interference caused by SC by taking advantage of the non-correlation between dimensions. Specifically, PD-SDCMA reduces the successive interference between users by sparsifying the dimension allocation of constellation superposition and designs a sparse superposition method based on the theory of vector space signal representation. Simulation results show that, under the AWGN channel, PD-SDCMA significantly outperforms the traditional PD-NOMA in terms of the number of supported users under QPSK and 16QAM modulations, and also has better BER performance. This paper provides a new solution for efficient spectrum utilization in future scenarios with large-scale user access.</description>

      <title>Study of Constrained Precoding with Zero-Crossing Modulation for Channels with 1-Bit Quantization and Oversampling</title>

Abstract: Future wireless communications systems are expected to operate at bands above 100GHz. The high energy consumption of analog-to-digital converters, due to their high resolution represents a bottleneck for future wireless communications systems which require low-energy consumption and low-complexity devices at the receiver. In this work, we derive a novel precoding method based on quality of service constraints for a multiuser multiple-input multiple-output downlink system with 1-bit quantization and oversampling. For this scenario, the time-instance zero-crossing modulation which conveys the information into the zero-crossings is considered. Unlike prior studies, the constraint is given regarding the symbol error probability related to the minimum distance to the decision threshold. Numerical results illustrate the performance of the proposed precoding method evaluated under different parameters</description>

      <title>Efficient Semantic-aware Encryption for Secure Communications in Intelligent Connected Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) significantly improves inter-vehicle interactions in intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) within limited wireless spectrum. However, the open nature of wireless communications introduces eavesdropping risks. To mitigate this, we propose the Efficient Semantic-aware Encryption (ESAE) mechanism, integrating cryptography into SemCom to secure semantic transmission without complex key management. ESAE leverages semantic reciprocity between source and reconstructed information from past communications to independently generate session keys at both ends, reducing key transmission costs and associated security risks. Additionally, ESAE introduces a semantic-aware key pre-processing method (SA-KP) using the YOLO-v10 model to extract consistent semantics from bit-level diverse yet semantically identical content, ensuring key consistency. Experimental results validate ESAE's effectiveness and feasibility under various wireless conditions, with key performance factors discussed.</description>

      <title>Downlink Multiuser Communications Relying on Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) is composed of an array of low-cost radiating elements, each of which can independently radiate electromagnetic signals and flexibly adjust its position through a 3D surface-morphing process. In our system, an FIM is deployed at a base station (BS) that transmits to multiple single-antenna users. We formulate an optimization problem for minimizing the total downlink transmit power at the BS by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and the FIM's surface shape, subject to an individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each user as well as to a constraint on the maximum morphing range of the FIM. To address this problem, an efficient alternating optimization method is proposed to iteratively update the FIM's surface shape and the transmit beamformer to gradually reduce the transmit power. Finally, our simulation results show that at a given data rate the FIM reduces the transmit power by about $3$ dB compared to conventional rigid 2D arrays.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurfaces for Enhanced MIMO Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) constitute a promising technology that could significantly boost the wireless network capacity. An FIM is essentially a soft array made up of many low-cost radiating elements that can independently emit electromagnetic signals. What's more, each element can flexibly adjust its position, even perpendicularly to the surface, to morph the overall 3D shape. In this paper, we study the potential of FIMs in point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications, where two FIMs are used as transceivers. In order to characterize the capacity limits of FIM-aided narrowband MIMO transmissions, we formulate an optimization problem for maximizing the MIMO channel capacity by jointly optimizing the 3D surface shapes of the transmitting and receiving FIMs, as well as the transmit covariance matrix, subject to a specific total transmit power constraint and to the maximum morphing range of the FIM. To solve this problem, we develop an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm. The BCD algorithm iteratively updates the 3D surface shapes of the FIMs and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other fixed. Numerical results verify that FIMs can achieve higher MIMO capacity than traditional rigid arrays. In some cases, the MIMO channel capacity can be doubled by employing FIMs.</description>

      <title>Beyond Diagonal RIS in Multiuser MIMO: Graph Theoretic Modeling and Optimal Architectures with Low Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is regarded as a key enabler of wave/analog-domain beamforming, processing, and computing in future wireless communication systems. Recently, Beyond Diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has been proposed as a generalization of conventional RIS, offering enhanced design flexibility thanks to the presence of tunable impedances that connect RIS elements. However, increased interconnections lead to high circuit complexity, which poses a significant practical challenge. In this paper, we address the fundamental open question: What is the class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance in a RIS-aided multiuser multi-input multi-output (MIMO) system? By modeling BD-RIS architectures using graph theory, we identify a class of BD-RIS architectures that achieves the optimal performance--matching that of fully-connected RIS--while maintaining low circuit complexity. Our result holds for a broad class of performance metrics, including the commonly used sum channel gain/sum-rate/energy efficiency maximization, transmit power minimization, and the information-theoretic capacity region. The number of tunable impedances in the proposed class is ${O}(N\min\{D,N/2\})$, where $N$ denotes the number of RIS elements and $D$ is the degree of freedom of the multiuser MIMO channel, i.e., the minimum between the number of transmit antennas and the total number of received antennas across all users. Since $D$ is much smaller than $N$ in practice, the complexity scales as ${O}(ND)$, which is substantially lower than the ${O}(N^2)$ complexity of fully-connected RIS. We further introduce two novel BD-RIS architectures--band-connected RIS and stem-connected RIS--and show that they belong to the optimal architecture class under certain conditions. Simulation results validate the optimality and enhanced performance-complexity tradeoff of our proposed architecture.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression for Improved Underwater Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate underwater navigation is a challenging task due to the absence of global navigation satellite system signals and the reliance on inertial navigation systems that suffer from drift over time. Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) are typically used to mitigate this drift through velocity measurements, which are commonly estimated using a parameter estimation approach such as least squares (LS). However, LS works under the assumption of ideal conditions and does not account for sensor biases, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a data-driven alternative based on multi-output Gaussian process regression (MOGPR) to improve DVL velocity estimation. MOGPR provides velocity estimates and associated measurement covariances, enabling an adaptive integration within an error-state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world AUV data and compare it against LS and a state-of-the-art deep learning model, BeamsNet. Results demonstrate that MOGPR reduces velocity estimation errors by approximately 20% while simultaneously enhancing overall navigation accuracy, particularly in the orientation states.

      <title>Pinching-Antenna System (PASS)-enabled Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna system (PASS) is a novel flexible-antenna technology, which employs long-spread waveguides to convey signals with negligible path loss and pinching antennas (PAs) with adjustable positions to radiate signals from the waveguide into the free space. Therefore, short-distance and strong line-of-sight transmission can be established. In this paper, a novel PASS-enabled multicast communication framework is proposed, where multiple PAs on a single waveguide radiate the broadcast signals to multiple users. The multicast performance maximization problem is formulated to optimize the positions of all PAs. To address this non-convex problem, a particle swarm optimization-based algorithm is developed. Numerical results show that PASS can significantly outperform the conventional multiple-antenna transmission.</description>

      <title>Design of a communication system Images for identification of vehicle plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the design and implementation of a low-energy wireless image transmission system for vehicle plate recognition, using the ESP32-CAM and LoRa DXLR01 modules. The system captures images in real time, processes them locally and transmits them via UART2 to a second ESP32. Subsequently, the data is sent through the LoRa link and stored on the ThingSpeak platform for remote monitoring. The experimental results show that the system achieves a recognition rate of 92.4% under optimal lighting conditions and an average transmission latency of 3.2 seconds. The energy efficiency of the system makes it suitable for applications in access control, vehicular surveillance and infrastructure monitoring.</description>

      <title>A Frequency-Domain Opportunistic Approach for Spectral-Efficient Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constrained by weak signal strength and significant inter-cell interference, users located at the cell edge in a cellular network suffer from inferior service quality. Recently, cell-free massive MIMO (CFmMIMO) has gained considerable attention due to its capability to offer uniform quality of service, alleviating the cell-edge problem. In contrast to previous studies focused on narrow-band CFmMIMO systems, this paper studies wideband CFmMIMO communications against channel frequency selectivity. By exploiting the frequency-domain flexibility offered by orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), and leveraging a particular spatial characteristic in the cell-free structure -- namely, the near-far effect among distributed access points (APs) -- we propose an opportunistic approach to boost spectral efficiency. The core concept lies in opportunistically activating nearby APs for certain users across their assigned OFDM subcarriers while deactivating distant APs to prevent power wastage and lower inter-user interference. Furthermore, this approach enables the use of downlink pilots by reducing the number of active APs per subcarrier to a small subset, thereby substantially improving downlink performance through coherent detection at the user receiver. Verified by numerical results, our proposed approach demonstrates considerable performance improvement compared to the two benchmark approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurological disorders represent significant global health challenges, driving the advancement of brain signal analysis methods. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) are widely used to diagnose and monitor neurological conditions. However, dataset heterogeneity and task variations pose challenges in developing robust deep learning solutions. This review systematically examines recent advances in deep learning approaches for EEG/iEEG-based neurological diagnostics, focusing on applications across 7 neurological conditions using 46 datasets. We explore trends in data utilization, model design, and task-specific adaptations, highlighting the importance of pre-trained multi-task models for scalable, generalizable solutions. To advance research, we propose a standardized benchmark for evaluating models across diverse datasets to enhance reproducibility. This survey emphasizes how recent innovations can transform neurological diagnostics and enable the development of intelligent, adaptable healthcare solutions.</description>

      <title>Time series forecasting based on optimized LLM for fault prediction in distribution power grid insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surface contamination on electrical grid insulators leads to an increase in leakage current until an electrical discharge occurs, which can result in a power system shutdown. To mitigate the possibility of disruptive faults resulting in a power outage, monitoring contamination and leakage current can help predict the progression of faults. Given this need, this paper proposes a hybrid deep learning (DL) model for predicting the increase in leakage current in high-voltage insulators. The hybrid structure considers a multi-criteria optimization using tree-structured Parzen estimation, an input stage filter for signal noise attenuation combined with a large language model (LLM) applied for time series forecasting. The proposed optimized LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DL models with a root-mean-square error equal to 2.24$\times10^{-4}$ for a short-term horizon and 1.21$\times10^{-3}$ for a medium-term horizon.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Distortion Radiated from Large Arrays and Active Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays (ELAAs) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are candidate enablers to realize connectivity goals for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. For instance, ELAAs can provide orders-of-magnitude higher area throughput compared to what massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) can deliver through spatial multiplexing, while RISs can improve the propagation conditions over wireless channels but a passively reflecting RIS must be large to be effective. Active RIS with amplifiers can deal with this issue. In this paper, we analyze the distortion generated by nonlinear amplifiers in both ELAAs and active RIS. We derive analytical expressions for the angular directions and depth of nonlinear distortion in both near-field and far-field channels. These insights are then used in a distortion-aware scheduling scheme that predicts the beamforming directions of the distortion and strategically allocates users in frequency to minimize its impact. Numerical results validate our theoretical analysis and compare distortion-aware and distortion-unaware scheduling methods, highlighting the benefits of accounting for nonlinearities. We conclude that nonlinearities can both create in-band and out-of-band distortion that is beamformed in entirely new directions and distances from the transmitter.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Spatial-Spectral Partial Volume Compartment Mapping with Applications to Multicomponent Diffusion and Relaxation MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12890v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new algorithm to solve a regularized spatial-spectral image estimation problem. Our approach is based on the linearized alternating directions method of multipliers (LADMM), which is a variation of the popular ADMM algorithm. Although LADMM has existed for some time, it has not been very widely used in the computational imaging literature. This is in part because there are many possible ways of mapping LADMM to a specific optimization problem, and it is nontrivial to find a computationally efficient implementation out of the many competing alternatives. We believe that our proposed implementation represents the first application of LADMM to the type of optimization problem considered in this work (involving a linear-mixture forward model, spatial regularization, and nonnegativity constraints). We evaluate our algorithm in a variety of multiparametric MRI partial volume mapping scenarios (diffusion-relaxation, relaxation-relaxation, relaxometry, and fingerprinting), where we consistently observe substantial ($\sim$3$\times$-50$\times$) speed improvements. We expect this to reduce barriers to using spatially-regularized partial volume compartment mapping methods. Further, the considerable improvements we observed also suggest the potential value of considering LADMM for a broader set of computational imaging problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive LPD Radar Waveform Design with Generative Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a learning-based method for adaptively generating low probability of detection (LPD) radar waveforms that blend into their operating environment. Our waveforms are designed to follow a distribution that is indistinguishable from the ambient radio frequency (RF) background -- while still being effective at ranging and sensing. To do so, we use an unsupervised, adversarial learning framework; our generator network produces waveforms designed to confuse a critic network, which is optimized to differentiate generated waveforms from the background. To ensure our generated waveforms are still effective for sensing, we introduce and minimize an ambiguity function-based loss on the generated waveforms. We evaluate the performance of our method by comparing the single-pulse detectability of our generated waveforms with traditional LPD waveforms using a separately trained detection neural network. We find that our method can generate LPD waveforms that reduce detectability by up to 90% while simultaneously offering improved ambiguity function (sensing) characteristics. Our framework also provides a mechanism to trade-off detectability and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Constant Modulus Waveform Design with Space-Time Sidelobe Reduction for DFRC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dual-function radar-communication (DFRC) is a key enabler of location-based services for next-generation communication systems. In this paper, we investigate the problem of designing constant modulus waveforms for DFRC systems. We consider the joint optimization of the spatial beam pattern and space-time correlation levels for better separating multiple targets in different angle and delay bins. In particular, we use the space-time correlation function to quantify the correlations between different angle and delay bins and formulate integrated sidelobe levels (ISLs). To serve communication users, we employ constructive interference (CI)-based precoding to modulate information symbols, which leverages distortion induced by multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) and radar transmission. We propose two solution algorithms based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) principles, which are effective for small and large block sizes, respectively. The proposed ADMM-based solution decomposes the nonconvex formulated problem into multiple tractable subproblems, each of which admits a closed-form solution. To accelerate convergence of the MM-based solution, we propose a novel majorizing function for complex quadratic functions. After majorization, we decompose the approximated problem into independent subproblems for parallelization, mitigating the complexity that increases with block size. We evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms in comparison to the existing DFRC algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods can substantially enhance the detection and estimation performance due to reduced space-time correlation levels.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03089v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</description>

      <title>Can all variations within the unified mask-based beamformer framework achieve identical peak extraction performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates mask-based beamformers (BFs), which estimate filters for target sound extraction (TSE) using time-frequency masks. Although multiple mask-based BFs have been proposed, no consensus has been reached on which one offers the best target-extraction performance. Previously, we found that maximum signal-to-noise ratio and minimum mean square error (MSE) BFs can achieve the same extraction performance as the theoretical upper-bound performance, with each BF containing a different optimal mask. However, two issues remained unsolved: only two BFs were covered, excluding the minimum variance distortionless response BF, and ideal scaling (IS) was employed to ideally adjust the output scale, which is not applicable to realistic scenarios. To address these issues, this study proposes a unified framework for mask-based BFs comprising two processes: filter estimation that can cover all possible BFs and scaling applicable to realistic scenarios by employing a mask to generate a scaling reference. Based on the operators and covariance matrices used in BF formulas, all possible BFs can be classified into 12 variations, including two new ones. Optimal masks for both processes are obtained by minimizing the MSE between the target and BF output. The experimental results using the CHiME-4 dataset suggested that 1) all 12 variations can achieve the theoretical upper-bound performance, and 2) mask-based scaling can behave like IS, even when constraining the temporal mean of a non-negative mask to one. These results can be explained by considering the practical parameter count of the masks. These findings contribute to 1) designing a TSE system, 2) improving scaling accuracy through mask-based scaling, and 3) estimating the extraction performance of a BF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM) is a novel approach for achieving environment-aware communication and sensing. This paper presents an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-based CKM prototype system, demonstrating the mutualistic relationship between ISAC and CKM. The system consists of an ISAC base station (BS), a user equipment (UE), and a server. By using a shared orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform over the millimeter wave (mmWave) band, the ISAC BS is able to communicate with the UE while simultaneously sensing the environment and acquiring the UE's location. The prototype showcases the complete process of the construction and application of the ISAC-based CKM. For CKM construction phase, the BS stores the UE's channel feedback information in a database indexed by the UE's location, including beam indices and channel gain. For CKM application phase, the BS looks up the best beam index from the CKM based on the UE's location to achieve training-free mmWave beam alignment. The experimental results show that ISAC can be used to construct or update CKM while communicating with UEs, and the pre-learned CKM can assist ISAC for training-free beam alignment.</description>

Abstract: Accurately localizing multiple sources is a critical task with various applications in wireless communications, such as emergency services, including natural post-disaster search and rescue operations. However, scenarios where the receiver is moving have not been sufficiently addressed in recent studies. This paper tackles the angle of arrival (AOA) 3D-localization problem for multiple sparse signal sources with a moving receiver, which has a limited number of antennas that may be outnumbered by the sources. First, an energy detector algorithm is proposed to leverage signal sparsity for eliminating noisy samples. Subsequently, elevation and azimuth AOAs of sources are roughly estimated using two dimensional multiple signal classification (2D-MUSIC) method. Next, an iterative algorithm is proposed to refine and estimate the AOAs more accurately. To this end, we introduce a sparse recovery algorithm to exploit signal sparsity, followed by a phase smoothing algorithm to refine the estimates. The K-SVD algorithm is then applied to the smoothed output to accurately determine the elevation and azimuth AOAs of the sources. For localization, a new multi-source 3D-localization algorithm is proposed to estimate the positions of sources using the refined AOA estimates over a sequence of time windows. Extensive simulations are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

Abstract: The reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology shows great potential in sixth-generation (6G) terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) since it can effectively change wireless settings to improve connectivity. Extensive research has been conducted on traditional RIS systems with diagonal phase response matrices. The straightforward RIS architecture, while cost-effective, has restricted capabilities in manipulating the wireless channels. The beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) greatly improves control over the wireless environment by utilizing interconnected phase response elements. This work proposes the integration of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications and BD-RIS in 6G NTNs, which has the potential to further enhance wireless coverage and spectral efficiency. We begin with the preliminaries of UAV communications and then discuss the fundamentals of BD-RIS technology. Subsequently, we discuss the potential of BD-RIS and UAV communications integration. We then proposed a case study based on UAV-mounted transmissive BD-RIS communication. Finally, we highlight future research directions and conclude this work.</description>

      <title>Conformal Distributed Remote Inference in Sensor Networks Under Reliability and Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents communication-constrained distributed conformal risk control (CD-CRC) framework, a novel decision-making framework for sensor networks under communication constraints. Targeting multi-label classification problems, such as segmentation, CD-CRC dynamically adjusts local and global thresholds used to identify significant labels with the goal of ensuring a target false negative rate (FNR), while adhering to communication capacity limits. CD-CRC builds on online exponentiated gradient descent to estimate the relative quality of the observations of different sensors, and on online conformal risk control (CRC) as a mechanism to control local and global thresholds. CD-CRC is proved to offer deterministic worst-case performance guarantees in terms of FNR and communication overhead, while the regret performance in terms of false positive rate (FPR) is characterized as a function of the key hyperparameters. Simulation results highlight the effectiveness of CD-CRC, particularly in communication resource-constrained environments, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the performance and reliability of distributed sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Improving the Estimation of Attenuation in Q/V Band Systems with a Kalman-Based Scintillation Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of the Scintillation Filter by Kalman-colored algorithm (SciFi), which is used to remove tropospheric scintillation from Q/V bands total attenuation data series. In contrast to the classical methods using low-pass filters, the SciFi algorithm allows to estimate both the attenuation, its slope and a confidence interval. Moreover, the linear observer structure of the Kalman filter allows it to operate in real time. Therefore, the states and uncertainties estimated by SciFi can be used as input for Fade Mitigation Techniques (FMT) such as Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) or Site Diversity (SD). In this article, we propose a method to tune the noise level based on recommendations approved by the ITU-R. Finally, some results of filtering on Alphasat experimental data are discussed.</description>

      <title>CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/wjq-learning/CBraMod.</description>

Abstract: Researches on leveraging big artificial intelligence model (BAIM) technology to drive the intelligent evolution of wireless networks are emerging. However, since the breakthrough in generalization brought about by BAIM techniques mainly occurs in natural language processing, there is still a lack of a clear technical roadmap on how to efficiently apply BAIM techniques to wireless systems with many additional peculiarities. To this end, this paper first reviews recent research works on BAIM for wireless and assesses the current research situation. Then, this paper analyzes and compares the differences between language intelligence and wireless intelligence on multiple levels, including scientific foundations, core usages, and technical details. It highlights the necessity and scientific significance of developing BAIM technology in a wireless-native way, as well as new issues that need to be considered in specific technical implementation. Finally, by synthesizing the evolutionary laws of language models with the particularities of wireless system, this paper provides several instructive methodologies for how to develop wireless-native BAIM.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we rethink delay Doppler channels (also called doubly selective channels). We prove that no modulation schemes (including the current active VOFDM/OTFS) can compensate a non-trivial Doppler spread well. We then discuss some of the existing methods to deal with time-varying channels, in particular time-frequency (TF) coding in an OFDM system. TF coding is equivalent to space-time coding in the math part. We also summarize state of the art on space-time coding that was an active research topic over a decade ago.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) have emerged as a transformative technology for wireless networks by improving coverage, capacity, and energy efficiency through intelligent manipulation of wireless propagation environments. This paper provides a comprehensive study on the deployment and coordination of IRSs for wireless networks. By addressing both single- and multi-reflection IRS architectures, we examine their deployment strategies across diverse scenarios, including point-to-point, point-to-multipoint, and point-to-area setups. For the single-reflection case, we highlight the trade-offs between passive and active IRS architectures in terms of beamforming gain, coverage extension, and spatial multiplexing. For the multi-reflection case, we discuss practical strategies to optimize IRS deployment and element allocation, balancing cooperative beamforming gains and path loss. The paper further discusses practical challenges in IRS implementation, including environmental conditions, system compatibility, and hardware limitations. Numerical results and field tests validate the effectiveness of IRS-aided wireless networks and demonstrate their capacity and coverage improvements. Lastly, promising research directions, including movable IRSs, near-field deployments, and network-level optimization, are outlined to guide future investigations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10621v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic machine-learning approach for classifying acute pain from raw electrophysiological signals. We address binary and ternary classification tasks, leveraging Power-In-Band (PIB) and signal coherence as distinguishing features. Our method evaluates the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms on a manually curated electrophysiological dataset obtained from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), offering valuable insights into model performance for pain detection. Furthermore, we identify critical electrode pairings associated with acute pain, providing a clearer understanding of the neural markers that differentiate pain states. This work highlights the potential of targeted feature engineering in advancing pain classification, setting the stage for future enhancements in real-time and personalized pain assessment tools. Additionally, these findings have promising applications in neuromodulation and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), where adaptive and closed-loop systems could leverage identified pain markers to modulate pain-related brain regions more precisely, offering improved therapeutic options for chronic pain management</description>

      <title>Near-Field Motion Parameter Estimation: A Variational Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A near-field motion parameter estimation method is proposed. In contract to far-field sensing systems, the near-field sensing system leverages spherical-wave characteristics to enable full-vector location and velocity estimation.
  Despite promising advantages, the near-field sensing system faces a significant challenge, where location and velocity parameters are intricately coupled within the signal.
  To address this challenge, a novel subarray-based variational message passing (VMP) method is proposed for near-field joint location and velocity estimation. First, a factor graph representation is introduced, employing subarray-level directional and Doppler parameters as intermediate variables to decouple the complex location-velocity dependencies.
  Based on this, the variational Bayesian inference is employed to obtain closed-form posterior distributions of subarray-level parameters.
  Subsequently, the message passing technique is employed, enabling tractable computation of location and velocity marginal distributions. Two implementation strategies are proposed: 1) System-level fusion that aggregates all subarray posteriors for centralized estimation, or 2) Subarray-level fusion where locally processed estimates from subarrays are fused through Guassian product rule.
  Cram\'er-Rao bounds for location and velocity estimation are derived, providing theoretical performance limits.
  Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed VMP method outperforms existing approaches while achieving a magnitude lower complexity.
  Specifically, the proposed VMP method achieves centimeter-level location accuracy and sub-m/s velocity accuracy.
  It also demonstrates robust performance for high-mobility targets, making the proposed VMP method suitable for real-time near-field sensing and communication applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog to digital converters (ADCs) are a major contributor to the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers in large bandwidth millimeter-wave systems. Prior works have considered two mitigating solutions to reduce the ADC power consumption: i) decreasing the number of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming, and ii) decreasing the ADC resolution, i.e., utilizing one-bit and few-bit ADCs. These mitigating solutions lead to performance loss in terms of achievable rates due to increased quantization error. In this work, the use of nonlinear analog operators such as envelope detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling and quantization is considered, as a way to reduce the aforementioned rate-loss. The receiver architecture consists of linear combiners, nonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs. The fundamental performance limits of the resulting communication system, in terms of achievable rates, are investigated under various assumptions on the set of implementable analog operators. Extensive numerical evaluations are provided to evaluate the set of achievable rates and the power consumption of the proposed receiver architectures. Circuit simulations and measurement results, based on both 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology and 65 nm Bulk CMOS transistor technologies, are provided to justify the power efficiency of the proposed receiver architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave,&gt;30 GHz) radars are the key enabler in the coming 6G era for high-resolution sensing and detection of targets. Photonic radar provides an effective approach to overcome the limitations of electronic radars thanks to the high frequency, broad bandwidth, and excellent reconfigurability of photonic systems. However, conventional photonic radars are mostly realized in tabletop systems composed of bulky discrete components, whereas the more compact integrated photonic radars are difficult to reach the mmWave bands due to the unsatisfactory bandwidths and signal integrity of the underlining electro-optic modulators. Here, we overcome these challenges and demonstrate a centimeter-resolution integrated photonic radar operating in the mmWave V band (40-50 GHz) based on a 4-inch wafer-scale thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) technology. The fabricated TFLN mmWave photonic integrated circuit consists of a first electro-optic modulator capable of generating a broadband linear frequency modulated mmWave radar waveform through optical frequency multiplication of a low-frequency input signal, and a second electro-optic modulator responsible for frequency de-chirp of the received reflected echo wave, therefore greatly relieving the bandwidth requirements for the analog-to-digital converter in the receiver. Thanks to the absence of optical and electrical filters in the system, our integrated photonic mmWave radar features continuous on-demand tunability of the center frequency and bandwidth, currently only limited by the bandwidths of electrical amplifiers. We achieve multi-target ranging with a resolution of 1.50 cm and velocity measurement with a resolution of 0.067 m/s. Furthermore, we construct an inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) and successfully demonstrate the imaging of targets with various shapes and postures with a two-dimensional resolution of 1.50 cm * 1.06 cm.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Geological Prediction for Tunnel Excavation Using Full Waveform Inversion Integrating Sobolev Space Regularization with a Quadratic Penalty Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16812v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the process of tunnel excavation, advanced geological prediction technology has become indispensable for safe, economical, and efficient tunnel construction. Although traditional methods such as drilling and geological analysis are effective, they typically involve destructive processes, carry high risks, and incur significant costs. In contrast, non-destructive geophysical exploration offers a more convenient and economical alternative. However, the accuracy and precision of these non-destructive methods can be severely compromised by complex geological structures, restrictions on observation coverage and environmental noise. To address these challenges effectively, a novel approach using frequency domain full waveform inversion, based on a penalty method and Sobolev space regularization, has been proposed to enhance the performance of non-destructive predictions. The proposed method constructs a soft-constrained optimization problem by restructuring the misfit function into a combination of data misfit and wave equation drive terms to enhance convexity. Additionally, it semi-extends the search space to both the wavefield and the model parameters to mitigate the strong nonlinearity of the optimization, facilitating high-resolution inversion. Furthermore, a Sobolev space regularization algorithm is introduced to flexibly adjust the regularization path, addressing issues related to noise and artefacts to enhance the robustness of the algorithm. We evaluated the performance of the proposed full waveform inversion using several tunnel models with fault structures by comparing the results of the enhanced method with those of traditional least-squares-based Tikhonov regularization and total variation regularization full waveform inversion methods. The verification results confirm the superior capabilities of the proposed method as expected.</description>

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide critical insights for applications in disease diagnosis and healthcare. However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model (GEFM), a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization Through Multi-Resonance Architecture: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy in Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The field analysis reveals Mie resonances as the physical reason behind the peaks. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Online Resource Management for the Uplink of Wideband Hybrid Beamforming System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the radio resource management (RRM) for the uplink (UL) of a cellular system with codebook-based hybrid beamforming. We consider the often neglected but highly practical multi-channel case with fewer radio frequency chains in the base station than user equipment (UEs) in the cell, assuming one RF chain per UE. As for any UL RRM, a per-time slot solution is needed as the allocation of power to subchannels by a UE can only be done once it knows which subchannels it has been allocated. The RRM in this system comprises beam selection, user selection and power allocation, three steps that are intricately coupled and we will show that the order in which they are performed does impact performance and so does the amount of coupling that we take into account. Specifically, we propose 4 online sequential solutions with different orders in which the steps are called and of different complexities, i.e., different levels of coupling between the steps. Our extensive numerical campaign for a mmWave system shows how a well-designed heuristic that takes some level of couplings between the steps can make the performance exceedingly better than a benchmark.</description>
