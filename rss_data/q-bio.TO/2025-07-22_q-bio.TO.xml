      <title>A Hybrid Mixture Approach for Clustering and Characterizing Cancer Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based clustering is widely used for identifying and distinguishing types of diseases. However, modern biomedical data coming with high dimensions make it challenging to perform the model estimation in traditional cluster analysis. The incorporation of factor analyzer into the mixture model provides a way to characterize the large set of data features, but the current estimation method is computationally impractical for massive data due to the intrinsic slow convergence of the embedded algorithms, and the incapability to vary the size of the factor analyzers, preventing the implementation of a generalized mixture of factor analyzers and further characterization of the data clusters. We propose a hybrid matrix-free computational scheme to efficiently estimate the clusters and model parameters based on a Gaussian mixture along with generalized factor analyzers to summarize the large number of variables using a small set of underlying factors. Our approach outperforms the existing method with faster convergence while maintaining high clustering accuracy. Our algorithms are applied to accurately identify and distinguish types of breast cancer based on large tumor samples, and to provide a generalized characterization for subtypes of lymphoma using massive gene records.</description>

      <title>Modulation of Calcium Signaling on Demand to Decipher the Molecular Mechanisms of Primary Aldosteronism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BACKGROUND: Primary aldosteronism is the most common form of secondary hypertension. The most frequent genetic cause of aldosterone-producing adenomas is somatic mutations in the potassium channel KCNJ5. They affect the ion selectivity of the channel, with sodium influx leading to cell membrane depolarization and activation of calcium signaling, the major trigger for aldosterone biosynthesis. METHODS: To investigate how KCNJ5 mutations lead to the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas, we established an adrenocortical cell model in which sodium entry into the cells can be modulated on demand using chemogenetic tools [H295R-S2 $\alpha$7-5HT3-R ($\alpha$7-5HT3 receptor) cells]. We investigated their functional and molecular characteristics with regard to aldosterone biosynthesis and cell proliferation. RESULTS: A clonal cell line with stable expression of the chimeric $\alpha$7-5HT3-R in H295R-S2 (human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, Strain 2) cells was obtained. Increased sodium entry through $\alpha$7-5HT3-R upon stimulation with uPSEM-817 (uPharmacologically Selective Effector Molecule-817) led to cell membrane depolarization, opening of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels, and increased intracellular Ca 2+ concentrations, resulting in the stimulation of CYP11B2 expression and increased aldosterone biosynthesis. Increased intracellular sodium influx did not increase proliferation but rather induced apoptosis. RNA sequencing and steroidome analyses revealed unique profiles associated with Na + entry, with only partial overlap with Ang II (angiotensin II) or potassium-induced changes. CONCLUSIONS: H295R-S2 $\alpha$7-5HT3-R cells are a new model reproducing the major features of cells harboring KCNJ5 mutations. Increased expression of CYP11B2 and stimulation of the mineralocorticoid biosynthesis pathway are associated with a decrease of cell proliferation and an increase of apoptosis, indicating that additional events may be required for the development of aldosterone-producing adenomas.</description>

      <title>TopoGEN: topology-driven microstructure generation for in silico modeling of fiber network mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fields of mechanobiology and biomechanics are expanding our understanding of the complex behavior of soft biological tissues across multiple scales. Given the intricate connection between tissue microstructure and its macroscale mechanical behavior, unraveling this mechanistic relationship remains an ongoing challenge. Reconstituted fiber networks serve as valuable in vitro models to simplify the intricacy of in vivo systems for targeted investigations. Concurrently, advances in imaging enable microstructure visualization and, through generative pipelines, modeling as discrete element networks. These mesoscale models provide insights into macroscale tissue behavior. However, there is still no clear way to systematically incorporate experimentally observed microstructural changes into in silico models of biological networks. In this work, we develop a novel framework to generate topologically-driven discrete fiber networks using high-resolution images that account for how environmental changes during polymerization influence the resulting structure. Leveraging these networks, we generate models of interconnected load-bearing fiber components that exhibit softening under compression and are bending-resistant. The generative topology framework enables control over network-level features, such as fiber volume fraction and cross-link density, along with fiber-level properties, like length distribution, to simulate changes driven by different polymerization conditions. We validate the robustness of our simulations against experimental data in a collagen-specific study case where we examine nonlinear elastic responses of collagen networks across varying conditions. TopoGEN provides a tool for tissue biomechanics and engineering, helping to bridge microstructural insights and bulk mechanical behavior by linking image-derived microstructural topological organization to soft tissue mechanics.</description>
