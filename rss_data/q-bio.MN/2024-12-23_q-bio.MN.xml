      <title>Finest decomposition coarsening of reaction networks of biochemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biochemical reaction networks are typically modeled by $\dfrac{dx}{dt}=N\cdot K(x)=Y\cdot I_a\cdot K(x)$, with $x$ and $K(x)$ as the concentration and rate vectors, respectively, and $N$, $Y$, and $I_a$ as the stoichiometric, molecularity, and incidence matrices, respectively. Steady states, which describe their long-term behaviors, are determined by solving $N\cdot K(x)=0$, while complex balanced steady states are found by solving $I_a \cdot K(x)=0$. To investigate these complex networks, decomposition techniques are important, in particular, for computing steady states. Previously, we identified a widespread property across many networks: the existence of independent and incidence-independent decompositions, characterized by the ability to directly sum the stoichiometric and incidence matrices of the subnetworks, respectively, to match those of the entire network. Here, we discover the ubiquitous property that we call the Finest Decomposition Coarsening (FDC), where the finest independent decomposition (FID) is a coarsening of the finest incidence-independent decomposition (FIID). To support the analysis of this property, we introduce a MATLAB package designed to compute both these decompositions. We then characterize the FDC property and its relationship to structural factors such as the invertibility of the molecularity matrix. We also introduce and characterize the Finest Decompositions Equality (FDE) property, where FIID equals FID. Notably, we show that all deficiency zero networks exhibit the FDE property. Furthermore, we establish important relationships of the FID and FIID with decomposition of the network into its connected components. Our results highlight the prevalence of the coarsening property in reaction networks and deepens the understanding of the algebraic structure and dynamics of biochemical networks.</description>

      <title>Learning Biomolecular Models using Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling dynamical biological systems is key for understanding, predicting, and controlling complex biological behaviors. Traditional methods for identifying governing equations, such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), typically require extensive quantitative data, which is often scarce in biological systems due to experimental limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach that determines biomolecular models from qualitative system behaviors expressed as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) statements, which are naturally suited to translate expert knowledge into computationally tractable specifications. Our method represents the biological network as a graph, where edges represent interactions between species, and uses a genetic algorithm to identify the graph. To infer the parameters of the ODEs modeling the interactions, we propose a gradient-based algorithm. On a numerical example, we evaluate two loss functions using STL robustness and analyze different initialization techniques to improve the convergence of the approach.</description>

      <title>Pathway Realisability in Chemical Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10629v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exploration of pathways and alternative pathways that have a specific function is of interest in numerous chemical contexts. A framework for specifying and searching for pathways has previously been developed, but a focus on which of the many pathway solutions are realisable, or can be made realisable, is missing. Realisable here means that there actually exists some sequencing of the reactions of the pathway that will execute the pathway. We present a method for analysing the realisability of pathways based on the reachability question in Petri nets. For realisable pathways, our method also provides a certificate encoding an order of the reactions which realises the pathway. We present two extended notions of realisability of pathways, one of which is related to the concept of network catalysts. We exemplify our findings on the pentose phosphate pathway. Furthermore, we discuss the relevance of our concepts for elucidating the choices often implicitly made when depicting pathways. Lastly, we lay the foundation for the mathematical theory of realisability.</description>
