      <title>Simplification of Trajectory Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there are software systems that simplify trajectory streams on the fly, few curve simplification algorithms with quality guarantees fit the streaming requirements. We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$.
  Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta &gt; 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees.
  We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>The Stamp Folding Problem From a Mountain-Valley Perspective: Enumerations and Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A strip of square stamps can be folded in many ways such that all of the stamps are stacked in a single pile in the folded state. The stamp folding problem asks for the number of such foldings and has previously been studied extensively. We consider this problem with the additional restriction of fixing the mountain-valley assignment of each crease in the stamp pattern. We provide a closed form for counting the number of legal foldings on specific patterns of mountain-valley assignments, including a surprising appearance of the Catalan numbers. We construct upper and lower bounds for the number of ways to fold a given mountain-valley assignment on the strip of stamps. Lastly, we provide experimental evidence towards more general results.</description>

      <title>Fast Approximation Algorithms for Euclidean Minimum Weight Perfect Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of finding a Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that a deterministic approximation algorithm for this problems must have at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ runtime. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.206})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.412})$ in all fixed dimensions.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds on the Number of Closest Pairs in Vertical Slabs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a set of $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where $d \geq 2$ is a constant, and let $H_1,H_2,\ldots,H_{m+1}$ be a sequence of vertical hyperplanes that are sorted by their first coordinates, such that exactly $n/m$ points of $S$ are between any two successive hyperplanes. Let $|A(S,m)|$ be the number of different closest pairs in the ${{m+1} \choose 2}$ vertical slabs that are bounded by $H_i$ and $H_j$, over all $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq m+1$. We prove tight bounds for the largest possible value of $|A(S,m)|$, over all point sets of size $n$, and for all values of $1 \leq m \leq n$.
  As a result of these bounds, we obtain, for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, a data structure of size $O(n)$, such that for any vertical query slab $Q$, the closest pair in the set $Q \cap S$ can be reported in $O(n^{1/2+\epsilon})$ time. Prior to this work, no linear space data structure with sublinear query time was known.</description>

      <title>General Position Subset Selection in Line Arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a set of points in the plane, the \textsc{General Position Subset Selection} problem is that of finding a maximum-size subset of points in general position, i.e., with no three points collinear. The problem is known to be ${\rm NP}$-complete and ${\rm APX}$-hard, and the best approximation ratio known is $\Omega\left({\rm OPT}^{-1/2}\right) =\Omega(n^{-1/2})$. Here we obtain better approximations in three specials cases:
  (I) A constant factor approximation for the case where the input set consists of lattice points and is \emph{dense}, which means that the ratio between the maximum and the minimum distance in $P$ is of the order of $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$.
  (II) An $\Omega\left((\log{n})^{-1/2}\right)$-approximation for the case where the input set is the set of vertices of a \emph{generic} $n$-line arrangement, i.e., one with $\Omega(n^2)$ vertices. The scenario in (I) is a special case of that in (II).
  (III) An $\Omega\left((\log{n})^{-1/2}\right)$-approximation for the case where the input set has at most $O(\sqrt{n})$ points collinear and can be covered by $O(\sqrt{n})$ lines.
  Our approximations rely on probabilistic methods and results from incidence geometry.</description>

      <title>Tagged barcodes for the topological analysis of gradient-like vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intending to introduce a method for the topological analysis of fields, we present a pipeline that takes as an input a weighted and based chain complex, produces a factored chain complex, and encodes it as a barcode of tagged intervals (briefly, a tagged barcode). We show how to apply this pipeline to the weighted and based Morse chain complex of a gradient-like Morse-Smale vector field on a compact Riemannian manifold in both the smooth and discrete settings. Interestingly for computations, it turns out that there is an isometry between factored chain complexes endowed with the interleaving distance and their tagged barcodes endowed with the bottleneck distance. Concerning stability, we show that the map taking a generic enough gradient-like vector field to its barcode of tagged intervals is continuous. Finally, we prove that the tagged barcode of any such vector field can be approximated by the tagged barcode of a combinatorial version of it with arbitrary precision.</description>
