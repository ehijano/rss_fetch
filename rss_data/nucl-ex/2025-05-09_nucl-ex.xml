      <title>Total cross section of $^{14}$N+$n$ from 0.1 to 12~MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reaction $^{14}$N$(n,p)^{14}$C is one of the main neutron poisons during $s$-process nucleosynthesis. In addition, the reaction provides insight into the yields of atmospheric nuclear weapon testing. Because of their high level of sensitivity, total neutron cross sections provide a great deal of constraint on the modeling of reaction cross sections through the $R$-matrix analyses used for nuclear data evaluations. Yet for $^{14}$N+$n$, only one high sensitivity measurement is available and it lacks detailed information about its experimental conditions and uncertainties. With these motivations in mind, a new measurement of the $^{14}$N+$n$ total cross section has been performed at the nELBE facility. The cross sections were found to be in good agreement with previous data over much of the energy range with the key exception of the lowest energy resonance at a neutron energy of 433 keV.</description>

      <title>Hyperon global polarization in isobar Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization of Lambda, Anti-Lambda, Xi, and Anti-Xi hyperons along the angular momentum of the system has been measured in isobar collisions of Ru+Ru and Zr+Zr at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV with the STAR detector at RHIC. The polarization dependence on collision centrality is explored and found to show an increasing trend in more peripheral collisions. Dependencies on transverse momentum and pseudorapidity are investigated for Lambda and Anti-Lambda hyperons, but no significant dependence has been observed. The polarization measurements for Lambda and Anti-Lambda are consistent with each other, indicating little contribution of the spin-magnetic coupling in the observed polarization. The results for Lambda hyperons measurements are qualitatively consistent with hydrodynamic calculations incorporating effects from shear-induced polarization and thermal vorticity, and show no obvious system size dependence in comparison with previous results in Au+Au collisions. For the first time, the dependence of the polarization on the hyperon's emission azimuthal angle with respect to the second harmonic event plane is extracted and shows stronger polarization for the in-plane emitted hyperons at the level of 2.4$\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality. The measurements of Xi hyperons polarization via the polarization transfer analysis exhibit a finite positive polarization, 2.9$\sigma$ significance in 20-50% centrality, slightly enhanced compared to the inclusive Lambda polarization.</description>

      <title>Point-proton density distributions of stable nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-proton density distributions are deduced for 130 stable nuclei from $^{7}\mathrm{Li}$ to $^{232}\mathrm{Th}$ from nuclear charge densities determined in elastic electron scattering. There are 171 cases are presented in model-dependent forms, including the modified Harmonic-oscillator function, two-parameter Femi function (2pF), three-parameter Femi function, three-parameter Gaussian function, and 97 in Fourier-Bessel series model-independent forms. Independent of density functions, the point-proton root-mean-square (rms) radii of the derived point-proton density show excellent agreement with each other. We identify cases where the tabulated data of charge densities and charge radii are inconsistent, and the deduced point-proton density distributions are inaccurate due to insufficient experimental momentum transfer coverage or inconsistent scattering experiments. For the widely used 2pF distribution, it is found that the surface diffuseness parameters can be empirically calculated from those of charge density, while the half-density radius parameters follow the $A^{1/3}$ rule. The derived point-proton density distributions can be used as input in nuclear reaction studies and compared with nuclear model predictions.</description>

      <title>The candidates of 2$\alpha$ condensate around the 16O nucleus studied by the real-time evolution method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background: Searching for alpha condensation around a core nucleus, a new class of nuclear clustering, is an interesting topic. Previous theoretical studies predicted 16O + 2$\alpha$ condensed states. However, in those studies, the strong mixing with non-resonant states made the identification of true resonant states non-trivial. Purpose: To address this issue, we aim to provide a more robust theoretical verification of the 16O + 2$\alpha$ condensation. Our goal is to clearly identify the resonant states and predict their properties, such as decay widths. Method: We employ the real-time evolution method (REM), which generates physically important basis states using the equation of motion, minimizing contamination from the continuum. The analytical continuation in the coupling constant (ACCC) was used to estimate the $\alpha$-decay widths. Results: The present calculations show much better convergence of eigenstates, and the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states showed remarkable isoscalar monopole transition strengths, which were in good agreement with the predictions of Ichikawa et al. The small alpha-decay widths for these states suggest that experimental observation appears feasible. Conclusion: The present results show the reasonable agreement with a previous work, firmly establishing the $0^+_3$ and $0^+_4$ states approximately 5 and 1 MeV below the 16O + 2$\alpha$ threshold as candidates for the 2$\alpha$ condensation around the core nucleus 16O. The REM proved effective in identifying these states.</description>

      <title>Directed flow from parton spin-orbit coupling in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out a novel mechanism to generate $\cos \phi$ two-particle azimuthal correlation (`directed flow') in unpolarized proton-proton and proton-nucleus collisions in the forward rapidity region of the projectile proton. This is a direct consequence of the recently discovered strong spin-orbit coupling in gluons at small-$x$. The observable simultaneously serves as a unique probe into the double helicity parton distribution functions of the proton.</description>

      <title>Theoretical modeling of approximate universality of tidally deformed neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-universal relations are known to exist among various neutron star observables that do not depend sensitively on the underlying nuclear matter equations of state. For example, some of these relations imply that the tidally induced multipole moments are approximately characterized by the electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability. Such relations can be used to reduce the number of independent tidal parameters in gravitational-waveform modeling, thereby allowing us to infer extreme nuclear matter properties more accurately and test General Relativity in an insensitive manner to uncertainties in nuclear physics. We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation into approximate universality of neutron stars. Our approach employs a semi-analytic relativistic stellar interior model, which extends the Tolman VII solution, thereby enabling a refined exploration of the tidal properties of nonrotating stars within a semi-analytic framework. The derived power-law relations among various tidal deformabilities -- referred to as the universal Love relations -- agree well with expressions in previous work found empirically. We elucidate how the equation-of-state dependence is suppressed in a particular combination of macroscopic physical parameters induced by perturbations and demonstrate that the relation between the moment of inertia and electric-type quadrupolar tidal deformability (I-Love relation) rests on the same underlying mechanism. Our findings indicate that the approximate universality of neutron stars can be attributed to low compressibility, consistent with some of the previous studies on the possible origin of the universality.</description>

      <title>Manifest Gauge Invariance for Structure Dependent Radiative Corrections to Processes Involving Atoms and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to reactions involving atoms or nuclei can become sensitive to the structure of the bound state. Generically, one encounters correlation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities. At intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often violated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we outline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned correlators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target (i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables manifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed representation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate scattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass. We analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss radiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction.</description>

      <title>Systematic Uncertainties in the Measurement of Neutron lifetime Using Lunar Prospector Neutron Spectrometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18831v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lifetime of free neutrons measured in the lab has a long standing disparity of $\sim$9~s. A space-based technique has recently been proposed to independently measure the neutron lifetime using interactions between the galactic cosmic rays and a low atmosphere planetary body. This technique has not produced competitive results yet due to constraints of non-optimized data that contain large systematic errors. We use data from the neutron spectrometer on-board NASA's Lunar Prospector, and study two large systematics in the measurement of neutron lifetime: the lunar sub-surface temperature and the lunar surface composition. We use the HeCd and HeSn neutron spectrometer data when the spacecraft was in a highly elliptical orbit during the orbit insertion period. We report the neutron lifetime using four different models that each have different choices of surface temperature and composition. 5$^{\circ}$ \cite{prettyman2006elemental} and 2$^{\circ}$ re-binned \cite{wilson2021measurement} maps result in 777.6$\pm$11.7~s and 739.6$\pm$10.8~s respectively. For the 20$^{\circ}$ map, constant equatorial and a latitude-dependent temperature model result in 738.6$\pm$10.8~s and 767.3$\pm$11.2~s respectively. Increasing the complexities of the models accounting for the systematic effects increase the measured lifetime. However, the reported measurements are not competitive with the laboratory results due to large unaccounted systematics resulting from non-optimized measurements and modeling assumptions. This work serves as a study of systematic uncertainties for future neutron lifetime measurements using the space-based technique. We estimate the effect on the lifetime from the choice of temperature model to be to be 28.7 $\pm$ 15.5~s, and choice of compositional map (for 20$^\circ$ and 5$^\circ$ maps) to be 10.3 $\pm$ 12.2~s.</description>

      <title>Valence quark-stopping and gluon junction-stopping scenarios in electron-nucleus collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider: Which one is correct?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the current literature, two stopping scenarios are being discussed in the context of high-energy collisions: the valence quark scenario and the gluon or baryon junction scenario. In the valence quark-stopping scenario, three valence quarks each contribute one-third of the baryon number within a baryon. Conversely, in the gluon junction-stopping scenario, the gluon junction is responsible for carrying the entire baryon number. At present, there is no consensus regarding which type of stopping scenario is correct. Based on a multi-source thermal model, our investigation indicates that experimental data analyzed in previous and present studies suggest that the valence quark-stopping scenario is indeed accurate. It is anticipated that this scenario can be further validated through electron-nucleus ($eA$) collisions at the forthcoming Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).</description>

      <title>Electroweak form factors of baryons in dense nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is evidence that the properties of hadrons are modified in a nuclear medium. Information about the medium modifications of the internal structure of hadrons is fundamental for the study of dense nuclear matter and high-energy processes, including heavy-ion and nucleus--nucleus collisions. At the moment, however, empirical information about medium modifications of hadrons is limited; therefore, theoretical studies are essential for progress in the field. In the present work, we review theoretical studies of the electromagnetic and axial form factors of octet baryons in symmetric nuclear matter. The calculations are based on a model that takes into account the degrees of freedom revealed in experimental studies of low and intermediate square transfer momentum $q^2=-Q^2$: valence quarks and meson cloud excitations of baryon cores. The formalism combines a covariant constituent quark model, developed for a free space (vacuum) with the quark--meson coupling model for extension to the nuclear medium. We conclude that the nuclear medium modifies the baryon properties differently according to the flavor content of the baryons and the medium density. The effects of the medium increase with density and are stronger (quenched or enhanced) for light baryons than for heavy baryons. In particular, the in-medium neutrino--nucleon and antineutrino--nucleon cross-sections are reduced compared to the values in free space. The proposed formalism can be extended to densities above the normal nuclear density and applied to neutrino--hyperon and antineutrino--hyperon scattering in dense nuclear matter.</description>
