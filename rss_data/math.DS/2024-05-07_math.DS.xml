      <title>Incorporating changeable attitudes toward vaccination into an SIR infectious disease model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a mechanistic model that classifies individuals both in terms of epidemiological status (SIR) and vaccination attitude (willing or unwilling), with the goal of discovering how disease spread is influenced by changing opinions about vaccination. Analysis of the model identifies existence and stability criteria for both disease-free and endemic disease equilibria. The analytical results, supported by numerical simulations, show that attitude changes induced by disease prevalence can destabilize endemic disease equilibria, resulting in limit cycles.</description>

      <title>Piecewise continuous maps on the interval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f$ be a piecewise continuous map on the interval with at most a finite number of turning points. In this paper we study some basic properties about this class of functions and show its main difference from the continuous case. We define and study the notion of closed structure, which can be seen as an extension of the notion of periodic orbit. Moreover, we also study the periodic orbits which are away from the discontinuities of $f$, extending the notion of trapped and free periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>A density-dependent metapopulation model: Extinction, persistence and source-sink dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear coupled discrete-time model of population dynamics. This model describes the movement of populations within a heterogeneous landscape, where the growth of subpopulations are modelled by (possibly different) bounded Kolmogorov maps and coupling terms are defined by nonlinear functions taking values in $(0,1)$. These couplings describe the proportions of individuals dispersing between regions. We first give a brief survey of similar discrete-time dispersal models. We then derive sufficient conditions for the stability/instability of the extinction equilibrium, for the existence of a positive fixed point and for ensuring uniform strong persistence. Finally we numerically explore a planar version of our model in a source-sink context, to show some of the qualitative behaviour that the model we consider can capture: for example, periodic behaviour and dynamics reminiscent of chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a finite coloring of an amenable group contains `many' monochromatic sets of the form $\{x,y,xy,yx\},$ and natural extensions with more variables. This gives the first combinatorial proof and extensions of Bergelson and McCutcheon's non-commutative Schur theorem. Our main new tool is the introduction of what we call `quasirandom colorings,' a condition that is automatically satisfied by colorings of quasirandom groups, and a reduction to this case.</description>

      <title>Homeostasis in Input-Output Networks: Structure, Classification and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homeostasis is concerned with regulatory mechanisms, present in biological systems, where some specific variable is kept close to a set value as some external disturbance affects the system. Mathematically, the notion of homeostasis can be formalized in terms of an input-output function that maps the parameter representing the external disturbance to the output variable that must be kept within a fairly narrow range. This observation inspired the introduction of the notion of infinitesimal homeostasis, namely, the derivative of the input-output function is zero at an isolated point. This point of view allows for the application of methods from singularity theory to characterize infinitesimal homeostasis points (i.e. critical points of the input-output function). In this paper we review the infinitesimal approach to the study of homeostasis in input-output networks. An input-output network is a network with two distinguished nodes `input' and `output', and the dynamics of the network determines the corresponding input-output function of the system. This class of dynamical systems provides an appropriate framework to study homeostasis and several important biological systems can be formulated in this context. Moreover, this approach, coupled to graph-theoretic ideas from combinatorial matrix theory, provides a systematic way for classifying different types of homeostasis (homeostatic mechanisms) in input-output networks, in terms of the network topology. In turn, this leads to new mathematical concepts, such as, homeostasis subnetworks, homeostasis patterns, homeostasis mode interaction. We illustrate the usefulness of this theory with several biological examples: biochemical networks, chemical reaction networks (CRN), gene regulatory networks (GRN), Intracellular metal ion regulation and so on.</description>

      <title>Essential freeness, allostery and $\mathcal{Z}$-stability of crossed products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore classifiability of crossed products of actions of countable amenable groups on compact, metrizable spaces. It is completely understood when such crossed products are simple, separable, unital, nuclear and satisfy the UCT: these properties are equivalent to the combination of minimality and topological freeness, and the challenge in this context is establishing $\mathcal{Z}$-stability. While most of the existing results in this direction assume freeness of the action, there exist numerous natural examples of minimal, topologically free (but not free) actions whose crossed products are classifiable.
  In this work, we take the first steps towards a systematic study of $\mathcal{Z}$-stability for crossed products beyond the free case, extending the available machinery around the small boundary property and almost finiteness to a more general setting. Among others, for actions of groups of polynomial growth with the small boundary property, we show that minimality and topological freeness are not just necessary, but also \emph{sufficient} conditions for classifiability of the crossed product.
  Our most general results apply to actions that are essentially free, a property weaker than freeness but stronger than topological freeness in the minimal setting. Very recently, M. Joseph produced the first examples of minimal actions of amenable groups which are topologically free and not essentially free. While the current machinery does not give any information for his examples, we develop ad-hoc methods to show that his actions have classifiable crossed products.</description>

      <title>Derivation of kinetic and diffusion equations from a hard-sphere Rayleigh gas using collision trees and semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We will revisit the classical questions of understanding the statistics of various deterministic dynamics of $N$ hard spheres of diameter $\varepsilon$ with random initial data in the Boltzmann-Grad scaling as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero and $N$ tends to infinity. The convergence of the empiric particle dynamics to the Boltzmann-type dynamics is shown using semigroup methods to describe probability measures on collision trees associated to physical trajectories in the case of a Rayleigh gas. As an application we derive the diffusion equation by a further rescaling.</description>

      <title>Consistent spectral approximation of Koopman operators using resolvent compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Koopman operators and transfer operators represent dynamical systems through their induced linear action on vector spaces of observables, enabling the use of operator-theoretic techniques to analyze nonlinear dynamics in state space. The extraction of approximate Koopman or transfer operator eigenfunctions (and the associated eigenvalues) from an unknown system is nontrivial, particularly if the system has mixed or continuous spectrum. In this paper, we describe a spectrally accurate approach to approximate the Koopman operator on $L^2$ for measure-preserving, continuous-time systems via a ``compactification'' of the resolvent of the generator. This approach employs kernel integral operators to approximate the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a family of skew-adjoint operators with compact resolvent, whose spectral measures converge in a suitable asymptotic limit, and whose eigenfunctions are approximately periodic. Moreover, we develop a data-driven formulation of our approach, utilizing data sampled on dynamical trajectories and associated dictionaries of kernel eigenfunctions for operator approximation. The data-driven scheme is shown to converge in the limit of large training data under natural assumptions on the dynamical system and observation modality. We explore applications of this technique to dynamical systems on tori with pure point spectra and the Lorenz 63 system as an example with mixing dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a good dynamical framework allowing to generalize Thurston's asymmetric metric and the associated Finsler norm from Teichm\"uller space to large classes of Anosov representations. In many cases, including the space of Hitchin representations, this gives a (possibly asymmetric) Finsler distance. In some cases we explicitly compute the associated Finsler norm.</description>

      <title>Joint Parameter and Parameterization Inference with Uncertainty Quantification through Differentiable Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate representations of unknown and sub-grid physical processes through parameterizations (or closure) in numerical simulations with quantified uncertainty are critical for resolving the coarse-grained partial differential equations that govern many problems ranging from weather and climate prediction to turbulence simulations. Recent advances have seen machine learning (ML) increasingly applied to model these subgrid processes, resulting in the development of hybrid physics-ML models through the integration with numerical solvers. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for the joint estimation of physical parameters and machine learning parameterizations with uncertainty quantification. Our framework incorporates online training and efficient Bayesian inference within a high-dimensional parameter space, facilitated by differentiable programming. This proof of concept underscores the substantial potential of differentiable programming in synergistically combining machine learning with differential equations, thereby enhancing the capabilities of hybrid physics-ML modeling.</description>
