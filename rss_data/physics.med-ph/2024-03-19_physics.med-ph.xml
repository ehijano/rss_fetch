      <title>Dual-Energy Cone-Beam CT Using Two Complementary Limited-Angle Scans with A Projection-Consistent Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Dual-energy imaging on cone-beam CT (CBCT) scanners has great potential in different clinical applications, including image-guided surgery and adaptive proton therapy. However, the clinical practice of dual-energy CBCT (DE-CBCT) has been hindered by the requirement of sophisticated hardware components. Purpose: In this work, we aim to propose a practical solution for single-scan dual-energy imaging on current CBCT scanners without hardware modifications, using two complementary limited-angle scans with a projection-consistent diffusion model. Methods: Our approach has two major components: data acquisition using two complementary limited-angle scans, and dual-energy projections restoration with subsequent FDK reconstruction. Two complementary scans at different kVps are performed in a single rotation by switching the tube voltage at the middle of the source trajectory, acquiring the mixed-spectra projection in a single CBCT scan. Full-sampled dual-energy projections are then restored by a projection-consistent diffusion model in a slice-by-slice manner, followed by the DE-CBCT reconstruction using the FDK algorithm. Results: The proposed method was evaluated in a simulation study of digital abdomen phantoms and a study of real rat data. In the simulation study, the proposed method produced DE-CBCT images at a mean absolute error (MAE) of 20 HU. In the small-animal study, reconstructed DE-CBCT images using the proposed method gave an MAE of 25 HU. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of DE-CBCT imaging using two complementary limited-angle scans with a projection-consistent diffusion model in both half-fan and short scans. The proposed method may allow quantitative applications of DE-CBCT and enable DE-CBCT-based adaptive proton therapy.</description>

Abstract: This guide is intended for authors who are willing to publish an original paper in journal Radiological Physics and Technology. They should follow the journal submission guidelines as well as the standard guidelines and conventions for scientific writing. The journal recommends using standard sections, but requires including an extra section for declarations. Each section or subsection has a heading to announce the topic of its contents. The text comprises paragraphs for subtopics. Original contents should be detailed while unoriginal contents available elsewhere should be minimized and distinguished by reference citation. Expression of quantities and equations should follow academic conventions. Minimum necessary tables and figures should be used to present essential information unambiguously and efficiently. The original manuscript of this guide is available online and may be used as a manuscript template. A checklist is also included for authors to use at the time of submission.</description>

      <title>Beneath the Surface: Revealing Deep-Tissue Blood Flow in Human Subjects with Massively Parallelized Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03968</link>

Abstract: Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS) allows the label-free investigation of microvascular dynamics deep within living tissue. However, common implementations of DCS are currently limited to measurement depths of $\sim 1-1.5cm$, which can limit the accuracy of cerebral hemodynamics measurement. Here we present massively parallelized DCS (pDCS) using novel single photon avalanche detector (SPAD) arrays with up to 500x500 individual channels. The new SPAD array technology can boost the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of up to 500 compared to single-pixel DCS, or by more than 15-fold compared to the most recent state-of-the-art pDCS demonstrations. Our results demonstrate the first in vivo use of this massively parallelized DCS system to measure cerebral blood flow changes at $\sim 2cm$ depth in human adults. We compared different modes of operation and applied a dual detection strategy, where a secondary SPAD array is used to simultaneously assess the superficial blood flow as a built-in reference measurement. While the blood flow in the superficial scalp tissue showed no significant change during cognitive activation, the deep pDCS measurement showed a statistically significant increase in the derived blood flow index of 8-12% when compared to the control rest state.</description>

      <title>Fast-Track of F-18 Positron paths simulations using GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the domain of Medical Physics has become a state-of-the-art technology that consumes lots of computational resources for the accurate prediction of particle interactions. The use of generative adversarial network (GAN) has been recently proposed as an alternative to improve the efficiency and extending the applications of computational tools in both medical imaging and therapeutic applications. This study introduces a new approach to simulate positron paths originating from Fluorine 18 (18 F) isotopes through the utilization of GANs. The proposed methodology developed a pure conditional transformer least squares (LS)-GAN model, designed to generate positron paths, and to track their interaction within the surrounding material. Conditioning factors include the pre-determined number of interactions, and the initial momentum of the emitted positrons, as derived from the emission spectrum of 18 F. By leveraging these conditions, the model aims to quickly and accurately simulate electromagnetic interactions of positron paths. Results were compared to the outcome produced with Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission (GATE) MC simulations toolkit. Less than 10 % of difference was observed in the calculation of the mean and maximum length of the path and the 1-D point spread function (PSF) for three different materials (Water, Bone, Lung).</description>

      <title>Resonant Inductive Coupling Network for Human-Sized Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Magnetic Particle Imaging, a field-free region is maneuvered throughout the field of view using a time-varying magnetic field known as the drive-field. Human-sized systems operate the drive-field in the kHz range and generate it by utilizing strong currents that can rise to the kA range within a coil called the drive field generator. Matching and tuning between a power amplifier, a band-pass filter and the drive-field generator is required. Here, for reasons of safety in future human scanners, a symmetrical topology and a transformer, called inductive coupling network is used. Our primary objectives are to achieve floating potentials to ensure patient safety, attaining high linearity and high gain for the resonant transformer. We present a novel systematic approach to the design of a loss-optimized resonant toroid with a D-shaped cross section, employing segmentation to adjust the inductance-to-resistance ratio while maintaining a constant quality factor. Simultaneously, we derive a specific matching condition of a symmetric transmit-receive circuit for magnetic particle imaging. The chosen setup filters the fundamental frequency and allows simultaneous signal transmission and reception. In addition, the decoupling of multiple drive field channels is discussed and the primary side of the transformer is evaluated for maximum coupling and minimum stray field. Two prototypes were constructed, measured, decoupled, and compared to the derived theory and to method-of-moment based simulations.</description>
