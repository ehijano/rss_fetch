      <title>Cosmological and High Energy Physics implications from gravitational-wave background searches in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA's O1-O4a runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for gravitational-wave background signals produced by various early Universe processes in the Advanced LIGO O4a dataset, combined with the data from the earlier O1, O2, and O3 (LIGO-Virgo) runs. The absence of detectable signals enables powerful constraints on fundamental physics. We derive gravitational-wave background energy density upper limits from the O1-O4a data to constrain parameters associated with various possible processes in the early Universe: first-order phase transitions, cosmic strings, domain walls, stiff equation of state, axion inflation, second-order scalar perturbations, primordial black hole binaries, and parity violation. In our analyses, the presence of an astrophysical background produced by compact (black hole and neutron star) binary coalescences throughout the Universe is also considered. We address the implications for various cosmological and high energy physics models based on the obtained parameter constraints. We conclude that LIGO-Virgo data already yield significant constraints on numerous early Universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Gauss-Bonnet Gravity in Riemann-Cartan Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conformal regularization of Gauss-Bonnet gravity in four-dimensional Riemann-Cartan geometry, employing a consistent dimensional derivative scheme. Within this regularized framework, we derive the complete field equations and construct novel static spherically symmetric black hole solutions. Our central finding is that the regularized Gauss-Bonnet term acts as an intrinsic source for a long-range torsion field, providing a purely four-dimensional mechanism to sustain torsion as a hair on black holes, without reliance on extra dimensions.</description>

      <title>Third law of repetitive electric Penrose process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Ruffini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 (2025) 8, 081403] pointed out that the repetitive Penrose process cannot drain the entire extractable energy of a Kerr black hole. In this Letter, we further point out that the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole cannot drop down to exactly zero via the repetitive electric Penrose process that is terminated after a finite number of iterative steps, indicating a thermodynamical third-law analog for the repetitive electric Penrose process.</description>

      <title>On the adiabatic initial conditions for a particle gas in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of recent interest in the role of "dark" radiation in cosmology, such as cosmic gravitational waves, sterile neutrinos, and dark photons, we clarify the definition of adiabatic initial conditions in the kinetic theory of gases in an expanding universe. Without assuming any form for the phase space distribution function, we identify two possibilities: a strong and a weak adiabatic initial condition. The strong one corresponds to the standard adiabatic initial conditions, while the weak one is related to the strong via internal isocurvature fluctuations. We show that both types of adiabatic initial conditions are consistent with the separate universe approach, although the latter requires initial internal isocurvature. In passing, we stress the importance of using the particle local momentum in the phase space to define the notion of adiabatic initial conditions. Doing so, we clarify that a gas of gravitons can have adiabatic initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity through Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for computing entanglement entropy across surfaces in Loop Quantum Gravity by employing techniques from quantum error correcting codes. In this construction, the redundancy encoded in the gauge invariant subspace is made manifest by embedding it in a larger Hilbert space. The enlarged Hilbert space of a surface does not factorize, which necessitates an algebraic formulation of the entanglement entropy using von Neumann algebras. Using this approach, we are able to reproduce the expected black hole entropy through the canonical ensemble. This includes a direct realization of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, providing a first principles derivation of the black hole entropy within a kinematical framework of loop quantum gravity. The algebraic techniques developed in this work can be used to compute the entanglement entropy across arbitrary surfaces.</description>

      <title>Scattered light noise due to dust particles contamination in the vacuum pipes of the Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-sensitivity optical measurements such as those performed in interferometric gravitational wave detectors are prone to scattered light noise. To minimize it, optical components must meet tight requirements on surface roughness and bulk defects. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of these measures can be undermined by other sources of scattered light. In this article, we examine scattered light noise caused by particles deposited on surfaces, especially on the baffles inside the vacuum pipes of the Einstein Telescope's interferometer arms. First, we study light scattering by particles deposited on a surface and having diameters from about one tenth to hundred times the light wavelength: we discuss its angular distribution and dependence on particle size and refractive index, and on polarization. Then, we specialize to the case of the Einstein Telescope arms and quantify the maximum allowed density of particles on each arm baffle. We conclude with cleanliness guidelines for the assembly of the vacuum pipes, including the required cleanliness class of the installation environment.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy in Loop Quantum Gravity and geometrical area law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-factorizing nature of the Hilbert space in Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG) due to gauge invariance requires a generalized definition of entanglement entropy. This work employs the framework of von Neumann algebras to investigate the entanglement entropy in LQG. On a graph, the holonomy and flux operators within a region and on the boundary generate a non-factor type I von Neumann algebra, which is used to define the entanglement entropy for LQG states. This algebraic formalism is applied to ``fixed-area states''--superpositions of spin networks associated with a surface with a definite macroscopic area given by the LQG area spectrum. By maximizing the entropy, we derive a geometrical area law where the entanglement entropy is proportional to the area. In addition, we show that bulk entanglement can renormalize the area-law coefficient and produce logarithmic corrections. The results in this paper closely relate to LQG black hole entropy.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian spinfoam gravity path integral and geometrical area-law entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates entanglement entropy in 3+1 dimensional Lorentzian covariant Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). We compute the entanglement entropy for a spatial region from states dynamically generated by a spinfoam path integral that sums over a family of 2-complexes. The resulting entropy exhibits a geometric area law, $S \simeq \beta a$, where the area $a$ of the entangling surface is determined by the LQG area spectrum and the leading coefficient $\beta&gt;0$ is independent of the underlying 2-complexes. By relating the coupling constant of the sum over 2-complexes to the Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$, we reproduce the Bekenstein-Hawking formula for the range $0 &lt; \gamma \lesssim 1/2$. This work provides a Lorentzian path integral approach to gravitational entropy without the need for contour prescriptions.</description>

      <title>On the summation and triangulation independence of Lorentzian spinfoam amplitudes for all LQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental issue of triangulation dependence in spinfoam quantum gravity. It introduces a novel framework, named spinfoam stack, to systematically sum spinfoam amplitudes over an infinite class of 2-complexes. These complexes are generated by stacking an arbitrary number of faces upon a simpler root complex. The central result is obtained by analyzing the amplitude of spinfoam stack in the limit where an upper cut-off on the area of internal faces is taken to infinity. In this limit, the amplitude as an integral localizes via a stationary phase mechanism onto a critical manifold. This manifold is shown to be the space of SU(2) flat connections on the underlying complex. This localization effectively reduces the bulk dynamics from a theory of quantum geometry to a topological theory akin to SU(2) BF theory. For spinfoams on topologically trivial manifolds, this result has a powerful consequence: the spinfoam stack amplitude factorizes into a triangulation-dependent normalization factor and a finite part that depends only on the boundary data. Renormalizing the amplitude yields a finite result that is manifestly independent of the bulk structure of the 2-complex. This provides a concrete realization of triangulation independence in a well-defined limit, suggesting the possibility of existing a non-trivial fixed point of quantum gravity within the spinfoam formalism.</description>

      <title>Axial Gravitational Normal Modes of Uniform Density Star in Anti-de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article studies the dynamical behavior of axial gravitational perturbations of homogeneous stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime. Because the radial coordinate $r$ transforms into the tortoise coordinate $y = y(r)$, obeying $y(r=0)=0$ and $y(r\rightarrow\infty)=y_\text{max}&lt;\infty$, the tortoise coordinates domain is finite, and the gravitational waves fail to reach out of the domain. Thus, from the perspective of tortoise coordinates, the perturbation equation of uniform density stars in Anti-de Sitter spacetime is analogous to the infinite deep potential well in quantum mechanics. Therefore, the perturbative behavior in this spacetime represents a standing wave vibration. Here we use shooting method and finite difference method to show the imagery of standing waves in this spacetime for $n=0,1,2$ as examples. On the other hand, by finite difference method, a Gaussian wave packet bounces back and forth within this potential well. Furthermore, due to the shape of the gravitational potential function $V$ within the range $0\le y\le y_\text{max}$, an echo phenomenon occurs at the surface of the star. As the energy of the wave packet remains within the potential well, each time it traverses the surface of the star, a reflective echo is generated. Consequently, after multiple reflections, the Gaussian wave packet cannot maintain its original shape and ultimately disperses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the mass of magnetized relativistic compact star is larger than that of non-magnetized one for the same equation of state and central density, albeit the excess of mass is sizable only if the magnetic fields are strong enough B~10^17-10^18G. Using our recently developed numerical code COCAL, we systematically compute such compact star solutions in equilibrium associated with mixed poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields, and show the magnetically supramassive solutions whose masses exceed by more than 10% of the maximum mass of the static and spherically symmetric solutions. For some extremely strong magnetic field configurations, we also obtain solutions more massive than the maximum mass of the uniformly rotating solutions at the Kepler (mass-shedding) limit, namely magnetically hypermassive solutions.</description>

      <title>The quasinormal modes of the rotating quantum corrected black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a rotating quantum corrected black hole (RQCBH) are studied by employing the hyperboloidal framework for the scalar perturbation. This framework is used to cast the QNMs spectra problem into the two-dimensional eigenvalues problem, then the spectra are calculated by imposing two-dimensional pseudo-spectral method. Based on the resulting spectra, a parameter estimation pipeline for this RQCBH model with gravitational wave data is constructed by using \texttt{pyRing} in the ringdown phase. We find that, even when the RQCBH spectra exhibits a small deviation from the Kerr spectra, the strong correlation between the extra parameter coming from the quantum gravity theory and the intrinsic parameter of black hole may significantly affect the posterior distributions of the mass $M$ and the dimensionless spin $\bar{a}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $f(Q,C)$ framework of gravity enables the depiction of an effective dark energy fluid that emerges from geometry itself, thus leading to modifications in the cosmological phenomenology of General Relativity. We pursue this approach to discover new and observationally supported (effective) evolving dark energy models. We propose a general $f(Q,C)$ formulation that cannot be simply split into separate functions of $Q$ and $C$, yet it still results in second-order field equations. By employing a particular type of connection, we derive guidelines for new cosmological models, including a variant of the DGP model that appears to be statistically favored over $\Lambda$CDM. Notably, we also demonstrate how to translate solutions within this $f(Q,C)$ framework to $f(Q)$ counterparts at the background level.</description>

      <title>Extracting Properties of Dark Dense Environment Around Black Holes From Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) can form dense condensates around black holes (BHs), such as superradiant clouds and ultracompact mini halos, which can significantly affect the orbital evolution of their companion objects through dynamical friction (DF). In this work, we define a novel quantity to quantify such effects in the emitted gravitational waves (GWs) in terms of GW amplitude, frequency, and their time derivatives. The information about the density profile can be extracted from this quantity, which characterizes the type of condensate and, therefore, the corresponding DM property. This quantity allows us to probe the dark dense environment by multi-wavelength GW observation with existing ground-based and future space-based GW detectors, potentially reveals the properties of the dark sector and sheds light on the primordial origin of the stellar mass BHs. A null detection can place strong constraints on the relevant DM parameters.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Null Energy Condition Violations and Thermodynamics in Kiselev Black Hole Evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation of black holes with two horizons presents a rich thermodynamic landscape that departs fundamentally from the Schwarzschild paradigm. In this work, we analyze the Hawking temperature dynamics of the Kiselev black hole under varying mass $M$ and anisotropic fluid parameter $N$, explicitly connecting temperature behavior to phase transitions and violations of the null energy condition (NEC). We find that the temperature does not necessarily diverge during evaporation; instead, it typically falls to zero as the black hole evaporates. This cooling behavior is preceded, in certain parameter regimes, by a phase transition marked by a peak in temperature and a divergence in heat capacity. Crucially, the presence and nature of these phase transitions are dictated by the spacetime regions where the NEC is violated: global NEC violation leads to horizon merger and temperature suppression, while partial or absent violation can restore the standard evaporation picture. Our results establish a direct correspondence between thermodynamic stability, horizon dynamics, and energy condition structure in anisotropic black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Renormalisation Group approach to General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has intensified the need for efficient, high-precision modeling of the two-body problem in General Relativity. Current analytical methods, primarily the Post-Minkowskian and Post-Newtonian expansions, are inherently perturbative, while numerical relativity remains computationally expensive. In this Letter, we introduce a middle path: an exact renormalization group (RG) equation for classical gravitational systems. We demonstrate that our equation correctly reproduces the first three orders of the Post-Minkowskian expansion. Crucially, it provides a framework for non-perturbative approximations. As a first application, we show that our method efficiently recovers the 1PN two-body action, bypassing the need for complex three-graviton vertex calculations by leveraging the intrinsic nonlinearity of the RG flow. This establishes the exact RG as a powerful new tool for tackling strong-field dynamics in gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from restriction theory and rapid-decay homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for computing frequency-domain gravitational waveforms from relativistic binary scattering in different asymptotic regimes. The method yields a controlled series expansion that can in principle be extended to arbitrary order in the relevant kinematic parameter. By combining differential-equation techniques with restriction theory and algebraic-geometry methods for impact-parameter-space Fourier integrals, we derive recursion relations that generate the leading-order (tree-level) waveform in both the soft-emission and post-Newtonian regimes, establishing a proof of principle for extending the approach to higher-loop computations. Finally, following constraints from rapid-decay homology, we show that the Fourier integrals underlying the waveform satisfy epsilon-form differential equations mixing Bessel- and exponential-type kernels, marking a first step toward uncovering the analytic structure of the exact solution.</description>

      <title>GW241011 and GW241110: Exploring Binary Formation and Fundamental Physics with Asymmetric, High-Spin Black Hole Coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the observation of gravitational waves from two binary black hole coalescences during the fourth observing run of the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA detector network, GW241011 and GW241110. The sources of these two signals are characterized by rapid and precisely measured primary spins, non-negligible spin--orbit misalignment, and unequal mass ratios between their constituent black holes. These properties are characteristic of binaries in which the more massive object was itself formed from a previous binary black hole merger, and suggest that the sources of GW241011 and GW241110 may have formed in dense stellar environments in which repeated mergers can take place. As the third loudest gravitational-wave event published to date, with a median network signal-to-noise ratio of $36.0$, GW241011 furthermore yields stringent constraints on the Kerr nature of black holes, the multipolar structure of gravitational-wave generation, and the existence of ultralight bosons within the mass range $10^{-13}$--$10^{-12}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Birefringence in Highly-reflective Substrate-Transferred GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As Coatings at 1064 nm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a custom-built scanning system, we generated maps of birefringence on reflection at $\lambda=1064$~nm from single-crystal GaAs/Al$_{0.92}$Ga$_{0.08}$As Bragg reflectors (henceforth ``AlGaAs coatings''). Ten coatings were bonded to fused silica substrates and one remained on the epitaxial growth wafer. The average phase difference on reflection between beams polarized along the fast and slow axes of the coating was found to be $\psi = 1.09 \pm 0.18$~mrad, consistent with values observed in high-finesse optical reference cavities using similar AlGaAs coatings. Scans of substrate-transferred coatings with diameters between 18 and 194 millimeters showed birefringence non-uniformity at a median level of $0.1$~mrad. A similar epitaxial multilayer that was not substrate transferred, but remained on the growth wafer, had by far the least birefringence non-uniformity of all mirrors tested at $0.02$~mrad. On the other hand, the average birefringence of the epi-on-wafer coating and substrate-transferred coatings was indistinguishable. Excluding non-uniformity found at the location of crystal and bonding defects, we conclude that the observed non-uniformity was imparted during the substrate transfer process, likely during bonding. Quantifying the impact on the scatter loss in a LIGO-like interferometer, we find that birefringence non-uniformity at the levels seen here is unlikely to have a significant impact on performance. Nonetheless, future efforts will focus on improved process control to minimize and ultimately eliminate the observed non-uniformity.</description>

      <title>Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and E\"ot-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</description>

      <title>$Q$-ball superradiance: Analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently discovered that waves scattering off a $Q$-ball can extract energy from it. We present an analytical treatment of this process by adopting a multi-step function approximation for the background field, which yields perturbative solutions expressed in terms of Bessel functions. For thin-wall $Q$-balls, the amplification factors reduce to simple sinusoidal functions, which explains the multi-peak structure of the spectrum and identifies the physical quantities that determine it. For instance, at high frequencies, the peak spacing is simply the inverse of the $Q$-ball size. The analytical solution further enables us to delineate the full range of possible amplification factors. For general $Q$-balls, this analytical framework also substantially improves the efficiency of evaluating the amplification factors.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoders for cosmological model discrimination and anomaly detection in cosmic microwave background power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background power spectra are a primary window into the early universe. However, achieving interpretable, likelihood-compatible compression and fast inference under weak model assumptions remains challenging. We propose a parameter-conditioned variational autoencoder (CVAE) that aligns a data-driven latent representation with cosmological parameters while remaining compatible with standard likelihood analyses. The model achieves high-fidelity compression of the $D_\ell^{TT}$, $D_\ell^{EE}$, and $D_\ell^{TE}$ spectra into just 5 latent dimensions, with reconstruction accuracy exceeding $99.9\%$ within Planck uncertainties. It reliably reconstructs spectra for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM scenarios, even under parameter extrapolation, and enables rapid inference, reducing the computation time from $\sim$40 hours to $\sim$2 minutes while maintaining posterior consistency. The learned latent space demonstrates a physically meaningful structure, capturing a distributed representation that mirrors known cosmological parameters and their degeneracies. Moreover, it supports highly effective unsupervised discrimination among cosmological models, achieving performance competitive with supervised approaches. Overall, this physics-informed CVAE enables anomaly detection beyond $\Lambda$CDM and points to physically meaningful directions for refinement.</description>

      <title>Energy Detectors and Asymptotic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study detector operators measuring energy to a power $\Delta-2$ at null infinity in four-dimensional gauge theories and gravity. These operators transform as conformal primaries on the celestial sphere and provide a natural basis for describing energy-flux observables in scattering processes. Using the collinear factorization of scattering amplitudes, we derive the universal leading structure of the operator product expansion. A key consequence of our analysis is the precise identification of the $\Delta=2$ detector, the number operator. Exploiting the fact that soft charges generate symmetries of the S-matrix, we demonstrate that the number of particles is entirely determined by the product of two soft currents: in gravity, the operator is the square of the supertranslation generator, while in Yang-Mills yields a product of $SU(N)$ Kac-Moody soft currents. This work establishes thus a direct link between detector observables and the soft sector of celestial holography.</description>

      <title>Probing the Penrose Process: Images of Split Hotspots and Their Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While theoretically established for decades, the Penrose process - energy extraction from rotating black holes - still lacks clear observational evidence. A promising theoretical framework posits magnetic reconnection in the ergosphere as a trigger, causing a plasmoid to separate into an escaping positive-energy fragment and an infalling negative-energy one. In this work, we investigate the observational imprints of this scenario. We treat the energized plasmoid as a hotspot and calculate its light curves for a realistic plasma magnetization. In particular, we further compare with the scenario in which the plasmoid, after fragmentation, falls into the black hole with positive energy, while all other conditions remain unchanged. Our results reveal that the process of fragmentation generates distinct flares, whose characteristics depend heavily on whether the infalling fragment carries negative or positive energy. We propose that these differences serve as identifiable signatures of the Penrose process.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the matching of the holographic equation of state with the equation of Hadron Resonance Gas for studying the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Machine learning methods are applied to the calibration of model's free parameters using the lattice QCD results for the physical values of quark masses. One of the most advanced procedures for matching is used with the function that approximate behavior of both models on particular limit adopted from NEOS equation. Final hadronic spectra are obtained within multi-staged numerical approach of the iEBE-MUSIC and SMASH-vHLLE packages. The code of relativistic hydrodynamics is modified by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches are utilized at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <title>Probing Gravity at Large Scales with kSZ-Reconstructed Velocities and CMB Lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for measuring the $E_G$ statistic that combines two CMB secondaries -- the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (kSZ) effect and CMB lensing -- for the first time to probe gravity on linear scales. The $E_G$ statistic is a discriminating tool for modified gravity theories, which leave imprints in lensing observables and peculiar velocities. Existing $E_G$ measurements rely on redshift space distortions (RSD) to infer the velocity field. Here, we employ kSZ velocity-reconstruction instead of RSD, a complementary technique that constrains the largest-scale modes better than the galaxy survey it uses. We construct a novel $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator that involves a ratio between cross-correlations of a galaxy sample with a CMB convergence map and that with a 3D kSZ-reconstructed velocity field. We forecast for current and upcoming CMB maps from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and the Simons Observatory (SO), respectively, in combination with three spectroscopic galaxy samples from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). We find cumulative detection significances in the range $S/N \sim 20-55$, which can robustly test the scale-independent $E_G$ prediction under general relativity (GR) at different effective redshifts of the galaxy samples ($z\approx 0.73, 1.33, 1.84$). In particular, the SO$\times$DESI LRG measurement would be able to distinguish between GR and certain modified gravity models, including Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ and Chameleon theories, with high confidence. The proposed $\widehat{V}_G$ estimator opens up a new avenue for stress-testing gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM+GR model at the largest observable scales.</description>

      <title>An Intrinsic Coordinate Reference Frame Procedure I: Tensorial Canonical Weyl Scalars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Canonical quantization of gravity in general relativity is greatly simplified by the artificial decomposition of space and time into a 3+1 formalism. Such a simplification may appear to come at the cost of general covariance. This requires tangential and perpendicular infinitesimal diffeomorphisms generated by the symmetry group under the Legendre transformation of the given action. This gauge generator, along with the fact that Weyl curvature scalars may act as ``intrinsic coordinates" (or a dynamical reference frame) which depend only on the spatial metric $g_{ab}$ and the conjugate momenta $p^{cd}$, allow for an alternative approach to canonical quantization of gravity. In this paper we present the tensorial solution of the set of Weyl scalars in terms of canonical phase-space variables.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics of Spherically Symmetric Static Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general relativity, the Einstein equations provide spherically symmetric static spacetimes with dynamics defined as an evolution along the radial coordinate $r$. The geometrical sector becomes a one-dimensional mechanical system, with the Misner-Sharp mass and lapse as canonically conjugate variables, and a vanishing Hamiltonian for pure gravity. Coupling classical or quantum matter fields, or introducing (quantum) corrections to general relativity, then generate a non-vanishing effective Hamiltonian, leading to non-trivial evolutions of the mass and lapse. We illustrate this mechanism through various examples of classical matter fields and identify Hamiltonians describing the effective dynamics of gravity coupled to perfect fluids with linear barotropic equation of state. Finally, we derive effective Hamiltonians that reproduce the gravitational semi-classical dynamics coupled to renormalized quantum matter fields and discuss the conditions for which the singularity at $r=0$ is resolved. In particular, we find a singularity-free black-hole-like solution, stabilized by quantum matter, smoothly transitioning from a bulk with constant negative Ricci scalar to the standard outside Schwarzschild metric. This opens new possibilities for the modeling of both semi-classical corrections and deep quantum effects on the interior structure of self-gravitating compact objects and black holes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Love numbers of black holes: Theory and gravitational waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In General Relativity, the static tidal Love numbers of black holes vanish identically. Whether this remains true for time-dependent tidal fields -- i.e., in the case of dynamical tidal Love numbers -- is an open question, complicated by subtle issues in the definition and computation of the tidal response at finite frequency. In this work, we analyze the dynamical tidal perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole to quadratic order in the tidal frequency. By employing the Teukolsky formalism in advanced null coordinates, which are regular at the horizon, we obtain a particularly clean perturbative scheme. Furthermore, we introduce a response function based on the full solution of the perturbation equation which does not depend on any arbitrary constant. Our analysis recovers known results for the dissipative response at linear order and the logarithmic running at quadratic order, associated with scale dependence in the effective theory. In addition, we find a finite, nonvanishing conservative correction at second order in frequency, thereby possibly demonstrating a genuine dynamical deformation of the black hole geometry. Although removing any ambiguity in the dynamical tidal response would require a matching with some gauge-invariant coefficient, we assess the impact of these effects on the gravitational-wave phase. These contributions enter at eighth post-Newtonian order, and can be expressed in terms of generic $\mathcal{O}(1)$ coefficients, which have to be matched to the perturbative result. Regardless of the matching ambiguities, we argue that such corrections are too small to be observable even with future-generation gravitational wave detectors. Moreover, the corresponding phase shifts are degenerate with unknown point-particle contributions entering at the same post-Newtonian order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grumiller metric is an effective model for gravity at large distances and plays a significant role in constructing galactic models and explaining dark matter. Here, in Grumiller spacetime, we analytically compute the quasinormal-mode frequencies and wave functions for massless particles with spin $\leq 2$ by introducing a new transformation relation. Our findings indicate that the quasinormal-mode frequencies are identical for different fermions with the same quantum number $n$. Notably, no bosonic quasinormal modes associated with Heun polynomials were found. Furthermore, for a given quasinormal-mode frequency, the corresponding particles exhibit a $2(n + 1)$-fold degeneracy. These results provide a theoretical basis for the mutual simulation of fermionic waves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.21220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct $F(R)$ gravity models with scalar fields to describe cosmological inflation and formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). By adding the induced gravity term and the fourth-order polynomial potential for the scalar field to the known $F(R)$ gravity model, and using a conformal transformation of the metric, we obtain a two-field chiral cosmological model. For some values of the model parameters, we get that the inflationary parameters of this model are in good agreement with the observations of the cosmic microwave background radiation obtained by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. The estimation of PBH masses suggests that PBHs could be dark matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum cosmology of supersymmetric, homogeneous and isotropic, higher derivative models. We recall superfield actions obtained in previous works and give classically equivalent actions leading to second order equations for the bosons, and first order for the fermions. Upon quantization, the algebra of fermions leads to a multi-component state, which is annihilated by the Hamiltonian and supersymmetric constraint operators. We obtain asymptotic wave functions of the oscillatory type, whose classical limit corresponds to inflationary evolution, and exact exponential wave functions. We use the latter to derive probability distributions of the initial curvature that are compatible with those obtained using the non-supersymmetric model.</description>

Abstract: We introduce new systems of PDE on initial data sets $(M,g,k)$ whose solutions model double-null foliations.

      <description>arXiv:2308.13704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the nature of running couplings in the higher derivative linear and nonlinear sigma models and show that the results in dimensional regularization for the physical running couplings do not always match the values quoted in the literature. Heat kernel methods identify divergences correctly, but not all of these divergences are related to physical running couplings. Likewise the running found using the Functional Renormalization Group does not always appear as running couplings in physical processes, even for the case of logarithmic running. The basic coupling of the higher derivative SU(N) nonlinear sigma model does not run at all at one loop, in contrast to published claims for asymptotic freedom. At one loop we describe how to properly identify the physical running couplings in these theories, and provide revised numbers for the higher derivative nonlinear sigma model.</description>

Abstract: We provide a concrete and computable realization of the $ER=EPR$ conjecture, by deriving the Einstein-Rosen bridge from the quantum entanglement in the thermofield double CFT. The Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the wormhole is explicitly identified as an entanglement entropy between subsystems of the thermofield double state. Furthermore, our results provide a quantitative verification of Van Raamsdonk's conjecture about spacetime emergence.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric extensions of nuclear equations of state: probing the breakdown scale of relativistic mean-field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phenomenological calculations of the properties of dense matter, such as relativistic mean-field theories, represent a pathway to predicting the microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars. However, such theories do not generically have well-controlled uncertainties and may break down within neutron stars. To faithfully represent the uncertainty in this breakdown scale, we develop a hybrid representation of the dense-matter equation of state, which assumes the form of a relativistic mean-field theory at low densities, while remaining agnostic to any nuclear theory at high densities. To achieve this, we use a nonparametric equation of state model to incorporate the correlations of the underlying relativistic mean-field theory equation of state at low pressures and transition to more flexible correlations above some chosen pressure scale. We perform astrophysical inference under various choices of the transition pressure between the theory-informed and theory-agnostic models. We further study whether the chosen relativistic mean-field theory breaks down above some particular pressure and find no such evidence. Using simulated data for future astrophysical observations at about two-to-three times the precision of current constraints, we show that our method can identify the breakdown pressure associated with a potential strong phase transition.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Models with Gauss-Bonnet Coupling in Light of ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses combining Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data with other cosmological datasets report a higher scalar spectral index $n_s$, creating tension with a wide range of inflationary models. Since a Gauss-Bonnet term with a coupling function $\xi(\phi) = 3\lambda/[4V(\phi)]$ leaves $n_s$ nearly unchanged (up to a field rescaling) while reducing the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ by a factor $(1-\lambda)$, so choosing $(1-\lambda)$ sufficiently small effectively removes $r$ as a limiting observable, making it easier for inflationary models to satisfy the latest observational constraints and alleviating this tension. Applying this mechanism to chaotic inflation, E-models, T-models, and hilltop inflation, we find that broad regions of parameter space become consistent with the latest ACT-based CMB constraints. These results demonstrate that Gauss-Bonnet couplings can help bring a broad class of inflationary models into agreement with current CMB measurements.</description>
