      <title>On Novel Approach for Computing Distance based Indices of Anti-tuberculosis Drugs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to assess the molecular architectures of anti-tuberculosis drugs using both degree-based topological indices and novel distance based indices. We can represent the chemical arrangement as a graph, with atoms serving as the vertices and connections as the edges. Here, the multi bonds were considered as multi edges and included all the hydrogen atoms. Also, we consider three dimensional molecular graph. As a result, the actual bond lengths have been used for computation of new distance based indices. Compared to numerous studies, this is a significant improvement. Furthermore, the investigation of these indices includes a study on the quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR). The research demonstrates a notable correlation between these indicators and the physical attributes of anti-tuberculosis drugs. Here, Since we reduced the some of existing critical assumptions in the literature, chemists and pharmaceutical professionals might potentially eliminate the need for clinical trials by employing this theoretical model. These models would enable them to predict the characteristics of anti-tuberculosis medications.</description>

      <title>Persistent Directed Flag Laplacian (PDFL)-Based Machine Learning for Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directionality in molecular and biomolecular networks plays a significant role in an accurate represention of the complex, dynamic, and asymmetrical nature of interactions present in protein-ligand binding, signal transduction, and biological pathways. Most traditional techniques in topological data analysis (TDA), such as persistent homology (PH) and persistent Laplacian (PL), overlook this aspect in their standard form. To address this, we present the persistent directed flag Laplacian (PDFL), which incorporates directed flag complexes to account for edges with directionality originated from polarization, gene regulation, heterogeneous interactions, etc. This study marks the first application of the PDFL, providing an in-depth analysis of spectral graph theory combined with machine learning. Besides its superior accuracy and reliability, the PDFL model offers simplicity by requiring only raw inputs without complex data processing. We validated our multi-kernel PDFL model for its scoring power against other state-of-art methods on three popular benchmarks, namely PDBbind v2007, v2013, and v2016. Computational results indicate that the proposed PDFL model outperforms competitors in protein-ligand binding affinity predictions, indicating that PDFL is a promising tool for protein engineering, drug discovery, and general applications in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Multiscale differential geometry learning for protein flexibility analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein flexibility is crucial for understanding protein structures, functions, and dynamics, and it can be measured through experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography. Theoretical approaches have also been developed to predict B-factor values, which reflect protein flexibility. Previous models have made significant strides in analyzing B-factors by fitting experimental data. In this study, we propose a novel approach for B-factor prediction using differential geometry theory, based on the assumption that the intrinsic properties of proteins reside on a family of low-dimensional manifolds embedded within the high-dimensional space of protein structures. By analyzing the mean and Gaussian curvatures of a set of kernel-function-defined low-dimensional manifolds, we develop effective and robust multiscale differential geometry (mDG) models. Our mDG model demonstrates a 27\% increase in accuracy compared to the classical Gaussian network model (GNM) in predicting B-factors for a dataset of 364 proteins. Additionally, by incorporating both global and local protein features, we construct a highly effective machine learning model for the blind prediction of B-factors. Extensive least-squares approximations and machine learning-based blind predictions validate the effectiveness of the mDG modeling approach for B-factor prediction.</description>

      <title>Hotter isn't faster for a melting RNA hairpin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the denaturation dynamics of nucleic acids through extensive molecular dynamics simulations of a coarse-grained RNA hairpin model. In apparent contradiction with Arrhenius' law, our findings reveal that the denaturation time of RNA hairpins is a non-monotonous function of temperature for molecules longer than few persistence lengths, with an optimal temperature above the melting point, $T_m$, at which denaturation occurs fastest. This anomaly arises from the existence of two distinct pathways: ``unidirectional'' unzipping, progressing from one end to the other and favored near $T_m$, and ``bidirectional'' denaturation, where competing unzipping events initiate from both ends at higher temperatures. The two regimes manifest distinct scaling laws for the melting time \textit{vs.} length, $L$, and are separated by a crossover temperature $T_\times$, with $(T_\times-T_m) \sim L^{-1}$. The results highlight the significant role of the helical structure in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of RNA/DNA denaturation and unveil multiple surprises in a decades-old problem.</description>

      <title>FoldMark: Protecting Protein Generative Models with Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein structure is key to understanding protein function and is essential for progress in bioengineering, drug discovery, and molecular biology. Recently, with the incorporation of generative AI, the power and accuracy of computational protein structure prediction/design have been improved significantly. However, ethical concerns such as copyright protection and harmful content generation (biosecurity) pose challenges to the wide implementation of protein generative models. Here, we investigate whether it is possible to embed watermarks into protein generative models and their outputs for copyright authentication and the tracking of generated structures. As a proof of concept, we propose a two-stage method FoldMark as a generalized watermarking strategy for protein generative models. FoldMark first pretrain watermark encoder and decoder, which can minorly adjust protein structures to embed user-specific information and faithfully recover the information from the encoded structure. In the second step, protein generative models are fine-tuned with watermark Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to preserve generation quality while learning to generate watermarked structures with high recovery rates. Extensive experiments are conducted on open-source protein structure prediction models (e.g., ESMFold and MultiFlow) and de novo structure design models (e.g., FrameDiff and FoldFlow) and we demonstrate that our method is effective across all these generative models. Meanwhile, our watermarking framework only exerts a negligible impact on the original protein structure quality and is robust under potential post-processing and adaptive attacks.</description>
