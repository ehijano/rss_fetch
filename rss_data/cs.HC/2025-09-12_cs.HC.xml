      <title>A Contextual Bandits Approach for Personalization of Hand Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-computer interaction applications like hand gesture recognition, supervised learning models are often trained on a large population of users to achieve high task accuracy. However, due to individual variability in sensor signals and user behavior, static models may not provide optimal performance for all users. Personalizing pretrained models via calibration--collecting labeled data from each user--can improve performance but introduces user friction and struggles with limited data. To overcome these issues, we propose a calibrationless longitudinal personalization method: a contextual multi-arm bandit (MAB) algorithm combined with a pretrained neural network for gesture recognition. This reinforcement-learning-style approach enables personalization using binary reward signals, either user-provided or inferred by the system.
  We validated this method in a user study. Participants wore a surface electromyography (sEMG) device and played multiple rounds of a 2-D navigation game using six hand gestures. In the session, they completed a baseline round and then a round with our algorithm; in the second session, they played another round with our algorithm. Our approach led to a significant reduction in users' average false negative rate by 0.113 from the initial to the final round, with further decreases between sessions. Average precision also trended upward (by 0.139) from the start to end of a round, continuing in the next session. Notably, some users who could not complete the game with the baseline model succeeded with our contextual MAB model. In summary, our</description>

      <title>Characterizing Multimodal Interaction in Visualization Authoring Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal interaction has been increasingly considered in designing visualization authoring tools. However, multimodal interaction has a broad meaning in visualization authoring, according to our literature review. Although some previous studies compare different authoring tools, a comprehensive overview of the diverse characteristics of multimodal interaction in visualization authoring tools is still missing. This paper seeks to offer a systematic perspective on how multimodal interaction is integrated within visualization authoring tools. Such an overview can enhance understanding of current practices, highlight distinguishing features among tools, and help identify future research directions, guiding designers in developing more accessible and effective authoring systems. We review 20 visualization authoring tools that incorporate multimodal interaction and characterize how multimodal interaction is applied in these tools. Based on the review results, we discuss design implications and future directions.</description>

      <title>YouthSafe: A Youth-Centric Safety Benchmark and Safeguard Model for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used by teenagers and young adults in everyday life, ranging from emotional support and creative expression to educational assistance. However, their unique vulnerabilities and risk profiles remain under-examined in current safety benchmarks and moderation systems, leaving this population disproportionately exposed to harm. In this work, we present Youth AI Risk (YAIR), the first benchmark dataset designed to evaluate and improve the safety of youth LLM interactions. YAIR consists of 12,449 annotated conversation snippets spanning 78 fine grained risk types, grounded in a taxonomy of youth specific harms such as grooming, boundary violation, identity confusion, and emotional overreliance. We systematically evaluate widely adopted moderation models on YAIR and find that existing approaches substantially underperform in detecting youth centered risks, often missing contextually subtle yet developmentally harmful interactions. To address these gaps, we introduce YouthSafe, a real-time risk detection model optimized for youth GenAI contexts. YouthSafe significantly outperforms prior systems across multiple metrics on risk detection and classification, offering a concrete step toward safer and more developmentally appropriate AI interactions for young users.</description>

      <title>Extended Version: It Should Be Easy but... New Users Experiences and Challenges with Secret Management Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software developers face risks of leaking their software secrets, such as API keys or passwords, which can result in significant harm. Secret management tools (SMTs), such as HashiCorp Vault Secrets or Infisical, are highly recommended by industry, academia, and security guidelines to manage secrets securely. SMTs are designed to help developers secure their secrets in a central location, yet secrets leaks are still commonplace, and developers report difficulty in learning how to setup and use SMTs. While SMTs typically come with publicly available help resources (e.g., tool documentation and interfaces), it is unclear if these actually help developers learn to effectively use SMTs. Without usable help resources that onboards developers, quick adoption and effective use of SMTs may be unrealistic. In a qualitative two-step study, we observed 21 new users in person while they used SMTs to perform two secret management tasks: secret storage and access, then secret injection. We interviewed participants after each task to identify their challenges and experiences using SMTs, with the assistance of help resources. While our study sample is narrow, it serves as a reasonable proxy for new developers who are likely to adopt SMTs early in their careers. We found that even in a laboratory setting where new users found tool functionality, interface flexibility helpful, they still experienced increased difficulty to effectively use SMTs to securely remediate a hard-coded secret when they felt tool documentation was insufficient and it motivated participants to deviate from official tool documentation to access secondary sources or attempt workaround methods. Specific challenges reported by participants were tool documentation content quality, navigation difficulties with both tool documentation and web interfaces for finding helpful content, and supportive tool features.</description>

      <title>Digital Iran Reloaded: Gamer Mitigation Tactics of IRI Information Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet censorship in the Islamic Republic of Iran restricts access to global platforms and services, forcing users to rely on circumvention technologies such as VPNs, proxies, and tunneling tools. This report presents findings from a mixed-methods study of 660 Iranian internet users, with a focus on gamers as a digitally literate and socially networked community. Survey data are combined with network measurements of latency and VPN performance to identify both technical and social strategies of circumvention. Results show that while younger users report higher confidence with circumvention, peer networks, rather than formal training, are the strongest predictors of resilience. Gaming communities, particularly those active on platforms such as Discord and Telegram, serve as hubs for sharing tactics and lowering barriers to adoption. These findings extend existing work on usable security and censorship circumvention by highlighting the intersection of infrastructural conditions and social learning. The study concludes with design and policy implications for developers, researchers, and funders working on digital rights and information controls.</description>

      <title>Content Moderation Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the failures and possibilities of contemporary social media governance through the lived experiences of various content moderation professionals. Drawing on participatory design workshops with 33 practitioners in both the technology industry and broader civil society, this research identifies significant structural misalignments between corporate incentives and public interests. While experts agree that successful content moderation is principled, consistent, contextual, proactive, transparent, and accountable, current technology companies fail to achieve these goals, due in part to exploitative labor practices, chronic underinvestment in user safety, and pressures of global scale. I argue that successful governance is undermined by the pursuit of technological novelty and rapid growth, resulting in platforms that necessarily prioritize innovation and expansion over public trust and safety. To counter this dynamic, I revisit the computational history of care work, to motivate present-day solidarity amongst platform governance workers and inspire systemic change.</description>

      <title>User Exploration and Exploitation Behavior Under the Influence of Real-time Interactions in Live Streaming Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Live streaming platforms offer a distinctive way for users and content creators to interact with each other through real-time communication. While research on user behavior in online platforms has explored how users discover their favorite content from creators and engage with them, the role of real-time features remains unclear. There are open questions as to what commonalities and differences exist in users' relationships with live streaming platforms compared to traditional on-demand style platforms. To understand this, we employ the concept of Exploration/Exploitation (E/E) and analyze a large-scale dataset from a live streaming platform over two years. Our results indicate that even on live streaming platforms, users exhibit E/E behavior but experience a longer exploration period. We also identify external factors, such as circadian rhythms, that influence E/E dynamics and user loyalty. The presented study emphasizes the importance of balancing E/E in online platform design, especially for live streaming platforms, providing implications that suggest design strategies for platform developers and content creators to facilitate timely engagement and retention.</description>

      <title>Sensible Agent: A Framework for Unobtrusive Interaction with Proactive AR Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proactive AR agents promise context-aware assistance, but their interactions often rely on explicit voice prompts or responses, which can be disruptive or socially awkward. We introduce Sensible Agent, a framework designed for unobtrusive interaction with these proactive agents. Sensible Agent dynamically adapts both "what" assistance to offer and, crucially, "how" to deliver it, based on real-time multimodal context sensing. Informed by an expert workshop (n=12) and a data annotation study (n=40), the framework leverages egocentric cameras, multimodal sensing, and Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to infer context and suggest appropriate actions delivered via minimally intrusive interaction modes. We demonstrate our prototype on an XR headset through a user study (n=10) in both AR and VR scenarios. Results indicate that Sensible Agent significantly reduces perceived interaction effort compared to voice-prompted baseline, while maintaining high usability and achieving higher preference.</description>

      <title>Flip Co-op: Cooperative Takeovers in Shared Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shared autonomy requires principled mechanisms for allocating and transferring control between a human and an autonomous agent. Existing approaches often rely on blending control inputs between human and autonomous agent or switching rules, which lack theoretical guarantees. This paper develops a game-theoretic framework for modeling cooperative takeover in shared autonomy. We formulate the switching interaction as a dynamic game in which authority is embedded directly into the system dynamics, resulting in Nash equilibrium(NE)-based strategies rather than ad hoc switching rules. We establish the existence and characterization of NE in the space of pure takeover strategies under stochastic human intent. For the class of linear-quadratic systems, we derive closed-form recursions for takeover strategies and saddle-point value functions, providing analytical insight and efficient computation of cooperative takeover policies. We further introduce a bimatrix potential game reformulation to address scenarios where human and autonomy utilities are not perfectly aligned, yielding a unifying potential function that preserves tractability while capturing intent deviations. The framework is applied to a vehicle trajectory tracking problem, demonstrating how equilibrium takeover strategies adapt across straight and curved path segments. The results highlight the trade-off between human adaptability and autonomous efficiency and illustrate the practical benefits of grounding shared autonomy in cooperative game theory.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Device Type, Data Practices, and Use Case Scenarios on Privacy Concerns about Eye-tracked Augmented Reality in the United States and Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Augmented reality technology will likely be prevalent with more affordable head-mounted displays. Integrating novel interaction modalities such as eye trackers into head-mounted displays could lead to collecting vast amounts of biometric data, which may allow inference of sensitive user attributes like health status or sexual preference, posing privacy issues. While previous works broadly examined privacy concerns about augmented reality, ours is the first to extensively explore privacy concerns on behavioral data, particularly eye tracking in augmented reality. We crowdsourced four survey studies in the United States (n1 = 48, n2 = 525) and Germany (n3 = 48, n4 = 525) to understand the impact of user attributes, augmented reality devices, use cases, data practices, and country on privacy concerns. Our findings indicate that participants are generally concerned about privacy when they know what inferences can be made based on the collected data. Despite the more prominent use of smartphones in daily life than augmented reality glasses, we found no indications of differing privacy concerns depending on the device type. In addition, our participants are more comfortable when a particular use case benefits them and less comfortable when other humans can consume their data. Furthermore, participants in the United States are less concerned about their privacy than those in Germany. Based on our findings, we provide several recommendations to practitioners and policymakers for privacy-aware augmented reality.</description>

      <title>Proactive AI Adoption can be Threatening: When Help Backfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) assistants are increasingly embedded in workplace tools, raising the question of how initiative-taking shapes adoption. Prior work highlights trust and expectation mismatches as barriers, but the underlying psychological mechanisms remain unclear. Drawing on self-affirmation and social exchange theories, we theorize that unsolicited help elicits self-threat, reducing willingness to accept assistance, likelihood of future use, and performance expectancy. We report two vignette-based experiments (Study~1: $N=761$; Study~2: $N=571$, preregistered). Study~1 compared anticipatory and reactive help provided by an AI vs. a human, while Study~2 distinguished between \emph{offering} (suggesting help) and \emph{providing} (acting automatically). In Study 1, AI help was more threatening than human help. Across both studies, anticipatory help increased perceived threat and reduced adoption outcomes. Our findings identify self-threat as a mechanism explaining why proactive AI features may backfire and suggest design implications for AI initiative.</description>

      <title>Smart Device Development for Gait Monitoring: Multimodal Feedback in an Interactive Foot Orthosis, Walking Aid, and Mobile Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart assistive technologies such as sensor-based footwear and walking aids offer promising opportunities to support rehabilitation through real-time feedback and patient-centered monitoring. However, most orthotic devices remain passive and lack integrated sensing or feedback functionalities, while existing research often focuses on isolated prototypes rather than cohesive, interactive systems. In this work, we present the design and implementation of a novel modular sensor system that combines a smart foot orthosis with an instrumented forearm crutch. The system integrates plantar pressure and motion sensing, vibrotactile feedback, and wireless communication via a smartphone application. We conducted an experimental user study with eight participants to validate the feasibility of the smart foot orthosis for mobile gait detection, explore the potential of haptic feedback for user interaction, and assess the usability of the accompanying mobile health application. Our work contributes to the field of smart assistive technology in rehabilitation and prevention by demonstrating a functional and comprehensive system. We further discuss system limitations, outline potential application scenarios, and provide recommendations for future development and clinical integration.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Kinematic Positioning and Optical See-Through Head-Mounted Display for Outdoor Tracking: Hybrid System and Preliminary Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an outdoor tracking system using Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) positioning and Optical See-Through Head Mounted Display(s) (OST-HMD(s)) in urban areas where the accurate tracking of objects is critical and where displaying occluded information is important for safety reasons. The approach presented here replaces 2D screens/tablets and offers distinct advantages, particularly in scenarios demanding hands-free operation. The integration of RTK, which provides centimeter-level accuracy of tracked objects, with OST-HMD represents a promising solution for outdoor applications. This paper provides valuable insights into leveraging the combined potential of RTK and OST-HMD for outdoor tracking tasks from the perspectives of systems integration, performance optimization, and usability. The main contributions of this paper are: \textbf{1)} a system for seamlessly merging RTK systems with OST-HMD to enable relatively precise and intuitive outdoor tracking, \textbf{2)} an approach to determine a global location to achieve the position relative to the world, \textbf{3)} an approach referred to as 'semi-dynamic' for system assessment. Moreover, we offer insights into several relevant future research topics aimed at improving the OST-HMD and RTK hybrid system for outdoor tracking.</description>

      <title>Changing the Paradigm from Dynamic Queries to LLM-generated SQL Queries with Human Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interaction layer for medical visualization systems. In domains like healthcare, where users must navigate high-dimensional, coded, and heterogeneous datasets, LLM-generated queries enable expert medical users to express complex analytical intents in natural language. These intents are then translated into editable and executable queries, replacing the dynamic query interfaces used by traditional visualization systems built around sliders, check boxes, and drop-downs. This interaction model reduces visual clutter and eliminates the need for users to memorize field names or system codes, supporting fluid exploration, with the drawback of not exposing all the filtering criteria. We also reintroduce dynamic queries on demand to better support interactive exploration. We posit that medical users are trained to know the possible filtering options but challenged to remember the details of the attribute names and code values. We demonstrate this paradigm in ParcoursVis, our scalable EventFlow-inspired patient care pathway visualization system powered by the French National Health Data System, one of the largest health data repositories in the world.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Affordances in Visualization: Related Constructs, Design Factors, and Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classically, affordance research investigates how the shape of objects communicates actions to potential users. Cognitive affordances, a subset of this research, characterize how the design of objects influences cognitive actions, such as information processing. Within visualization, cognitive affordances inform how graphs' design decisions communicate information to their readers. Although several related concepts exist in visualization, a formal translation of affordance theory to visualization is still lacking. In this paper, we review and translate affordance theory to visualization by formalizing how cognitive affordances operate within a visualization context. We also review common methods and terms, and compare related constructs to cognitive affordances in visualization. Based on a synthesis of research from psychology, human computer interaction, and visualization, we propose a framework of cognitive affordances in visualization that enumerates design decisions and reader characteristics that influence a visualization's hierarchy of communicated information. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework can guide the evaluation and redesign of visualizations.</description>

      <title>Explaining the Reputational Risks of AI-Mediated Communication: Messages Labeled as AI-Assisted Are Viewed as Less Diagnostic of the Sender's Moral Character</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When someone sends us a thoughtful message, we naturally form judgments about their character. But what happens when that message carries a label indicating it was written with the help of AI? This paper investigates how the appearance of AI assistance affects our perceptions of message senders. Adding nuance to previous research, through two studies (N=399) featuring vignette scenarios, we find that AI-assistance labels don't necessarily make people view senders negatively. Rather, they dampen the strength of character signals in communication. We show that when someone sends a warmth-signalling message (like thanking or apologizing) without AI help, people more strongly categorize the sender as warm. At the same time, when someone sends a coldness-signalling message (like bragging or blaming) without assistance, people more confidently categorize them as cold. Interestingly, AI labels weaken both these associations: An AI-assisted apology makes the sender appear less warm than if they had written it themselves, and an AI-assisted blame makes the sender appear less cold than if they had composed it independently. This supports our signal diagnosticity explanation: messages labeled as AI-assisted are viewed as less diagnostic than messages which seem unassisted. We discuss how our findings shed light on the causal origins of previously reported observations in AI-Mediated Communication.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Mapping Study on Chatbots in Programming Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Educational chatbots have gained prominence as support tools for teaching programming, particularly in introductory learning contexts. This paper presents a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) that investigated how such agents have been developed and applied in programming education. From an initial set of 3,216 publications, 54 studies were selected and analyzed based on five research subquestions, addressing chatbot types, programming languages used, educational content covered, interaction models, and application contexts. The results reveal a predominance of chatbots designed for Python instruction, focusing on fundamental programming concepts, and employing a wide variety of pedagogical approaches and technological architectures. In addition to identifying trends and gaps in the literature, this study provides insights to inform the development of new educational tools for programming instruction.</description>

      <title>Investigating Student Interaction Patterns with Large Language Model-Powered Course Assistants in Computer Science Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Providing students with flexible and timely academic support is a challenge at most colleges and universities, leaving many students without help outside scheduled hours. Large language models (LLMs) are promising for bridging this gap, but interactions between students and LLMs are rarely overseen by educators. We developed and studied an LLM-powered course assistant deployed across multiple computer science courses to characterize real-world use and understand pedagogical implications. By Spring 2024, our system had been deployed to approximately 2,000 students across six courses at three institutions. Analysis of the interaction data shows that usage remains strong in the evenings and nights and is higher in introductory courses, indicating that our system helps address temporal support gaps and novice learner needs. We sampled 200 conversations per course for manual annotation: most sampled responses were judged correct and helpful, with a small share unhelpful or erroneous; few responses included dedicated examples. We also examined an inquiry-based learning strategy: only around 11% of sampled conversations contained LLM-generated follow-up questions, which were often ignored by students in advanced courses. A Bloom's taxonomy analysis reveals that current LLM capabilities are limited in generating higher-order cognitive questions. These patterns suggest opportunities for pedagogically oriented LLM-based educational systems and greater educator involvement in configuring prompts, content, and policies.</description>

      <title>Towards Trustworthy AI: Characterizing User-Reported Risks across LLMs "In the Wild"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly integrating into daily life, research on their risks often remains lab-based and disconnected from the problems users encounter "in the wild." While recent HCI research has begun to explore these user-facing risks, it typically concentrates on a singular LLM chatbot like ChatGPT or an isolated risk like privacy. To gain a holistic understanding of multi-risk across LLM chatbots, we analyze online discussions on Reddit around seven major LLM chatbots through the U.S. NIST's AI Risk Management Framework. We find that user-reported risks are unevenly distributed and platform-specific. While "Valid and Reliable" risk is the most frequently mentioned, each product also exhibits a unique "risk fingerprint;" for instance, user discussions associate GPT more with "Safe" and "Fair" issues, Gemini with "Privacy," and Claude with "Secure and Resilient" risks. Furthermore, the nature of these risks differs by their prevalence: less frequent risks like "Explainability" and "Privacy" manifest as nuanced user trade-offs, more common ones like "Fairness" are experienced as direct personal harms. Our findings reveal gaps between risks reported by system-centered studies and by users, highlighting the need for user-centered approaches that support users in their daily use of LLM chatbots.</description>

      <title>Understanding Economic Tradeoffs Between Human and AI Agents in Bargaining Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordination tasks traditionally performed by humans are increasingly being delegated to autonomous agents. As this pattern progresses, it becomes critical to evaluate not only these agents' performance but also the processes through which they negotiate in dynamic, multi-agent environments. Furthermore, different agents exhibit distinct advantages: traditional statistical agents, such as Bayesian models, may excel under well-specified conditions, whereas large language models (LLMs) can generalize across contexts. In this work, we compare humans (N = 216), LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro), and Bayesian agents in a dynamic negotiation setting that enables direct, identical-condition comparisons across populations, capturing both outcomes and behavioral dynamics. Bayesian agents extract the highest surplus through aggressive optimization, at the cost of frequent trade rejections. Humans and LLMs can achieve similar overall surplus, but through distinct behaviors: LLMs favor conservative, concessionary trades with few rejections, while humans employ more strategic, risk-taking, and fairness-oriented behaviors. Thus, we find that performance parity -- a common benchmark in agent evaluation -- can conceal fundamental differences in process and alignment, which are critical for practical deployment in real-world coordination tasks.</description>

      <title>Measuring Implicit Spatial Coordination in Teams: Effects on Collective Intelligence and Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated teamwork is essential in fast-paced decision-making environments that require dynamic adaptation, often without an opportunity for explicit communication. Although implicit coordination has been extensively considered in the existing literature, the majority of work has focused on co-located, synchronous teamwork (such as sports teams) or, in distributed teams, primarily on coordination of knowledge work. However, many teams (firefighters, military, law enforcement, emergency response) must coordinate their movements in physical space without the benefit of visual cues or extensive explicit communication. This paper investigates how three dimensions of spatial coordination, namely exploration diversity, movement specialization, and adaptive spatial proximity, influence team performance in a collaborative online search and rescue task where explicit communication is restricted and team members rely on movement patterns to infer others' intentions and coordinate actions. Our metrics capture the relational aspects of teamwork by measuring spatial proximity, distribution patterns, and alignment of movements within shared environments. We analyze data from 34 four-person teams (136 participants) assigned to specialized roles in a search and rescue task. Results show that spatial specialization positively predicts performance, while adaptive spatial proximity exhibits a marginal inverted U-shaped relationship, suggesting moderate levels of adaptation are optimal. Furthermore, the temporal dynamics of these metrics differentiate high- from low-performing teams over time. These findings provide insights into implicit spatial coordination in role-based teamwork and highlight the importance of balanced adaptive strategies, with implications for training and AI-assisted team support systems.</description>

      <title>Incorporating AI Incident Reporting into Telecommunications Law and Policy: Insights from India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into telecommunications infrastructure introduces novel risks, such as algorithmic bias and unpredictable system behavior, that fall outside the scope of traditional cybersecurity and data protection frameworks. This paper introduces a precise definition and a detailed typology of telecommunications AI incidents, establishing them as a distinct category of risk that extends beyond conventional cybersecurity and data protection breaches. It argues for their recognition as a distinct regulatory concern. Using India as a case study for jurisdictions that lack a horizontal AI law, the paper analyzes the country's key digital regulations. The analysis reveals that India's existing legal instruments, including the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the CERT-In Rules, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focus on cybersecurity and data breaches, creating a significant regulatory gap for AI-specific operational incidents, such as performance degradation and algorithmic bias. The paper also examines structural barriers to disclosure and the limitations of existing AI incident repositories. Based on these findings, the paper proposes targeted policy recommendations centered on integrating AI incident reporting into India's existing telecom governance. Key proposals include mandating reporting for high-risk AI failures, designating an existing government body as a nodal agency to manage incident data, and developing standardized reporting frameworks. These recommendations aim to enhance regulatory clarity and strengthen long-term resilience, offering a pragmatic and replicable blueprint for other nations seeking to govern AI risks within their existing sectoral frameworks.</description>

      <title>Personality-Enhanced Social Recommendations in SAMI: Exploring the Role of Personality Detection in Matchmaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social connection is a vital part of learning, yet online course environments present barriers to the organic formation of social groups. SAMI offers one solution by facilitating student connections, but its effectiveness is constrained by an incomplete Theory of Mind, limiting its ability to create an effective mental model of a student. One facet of this is its inability to intuit personality, which may influence the relevance of its recommendations. To explore this, we propose a personality detection model utilizing GPTs zero-shot capability to infer Big-Five personality traits from forum introduction posts, often encouraged in online courses. We benchmark its performance against established models, demonstrating its efficacy in this task. Furthermore, we integrate this model into SAMIs entity-based matchmaking system, enabling personality-informed social recommendations. Initial integration suggests personality traits can complement existing matching factors, though additional evaluation is required to determine their full impact on student engagement and match quality.</description>

      <title>CryptoGuard: An AI-Based Cryptojacking Detection Dashboard Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies, cryptojacking has become a significant security threat to crypto wallet users. This paper presents a front-end prototype of an AI-powered security dashboard, namely, CryptoGuard. Developed through a user-centered design process, the prototype was constructed as a high-fidelity, click-through model from Figma mockups to simulate key user interactions. It is designed to assist users in monitoring their login and transaction activity, identifying any suspicious behavior, and enabling them to take action directly within the wallet interface. The dashboard is designed for a general audience, prioritizing an intuitive user experience for non-technical individuals. Although its AI functionality is conceptual, the prototype demonstrates features like visual alerts and reporting. This work is positioned explicitly as a design concept, bridging cryptojacking detection research with human-centered interface design. This paper also demonstrates how usability heuristics can directly inform a tool's ability to support rapid and confident decision-making under real-world threats. This paper argues that practical security tools require not only robust backend functionality but also a user-centric design that communicates risk and empowers users to take meaningful action.</description>

      <title>Scalable Evaluation of Online Facilitation Strategies via Synthetic Simulation of Discussions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Limited large-scale evaluations exist for facilitation strategies of online discussions due to significant costs associated with human involvement. An effective solution is synthetic discussion simulations using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create initial pilot experiments. We propose design principles based on existing methodologies for synthetic discussion generation. Based on these principles, we propose a simple, generalizable, LLM-driven methodology to prototype the development of LLM facilitators by generating synthetic data without human involvement, and which surpasses current baselines. We use our methodology to test whether current Social Science strategies for facilitation can improve the performance of LLM facilitators. We find that, while LLM facilitators significantly improve synthetic discussions, there is no evidence that the application of these strategies leads to further improvements in discussion quality. In an effort to aid research in the field of facilitation, we release a large, publicly available dataset containing LLM-generated and LLM-annotated discussions using multiple open-source models. This dataset can be used for LLM facilitator finetuning as well as behavioral analysis of current out-of-the-box LLMs in the task. We also release an open-source python framework that efficiently implements our methodology at great scale.</description>

      <title>VeriSafe Agent: Safeguarding Mobile GUI Agent via Logic-based Action Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Foundation Models (LFMs) have unlocked new possibilities in human-computer interaction, particularly with the rise of mobile Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents capable of interacting with mobile GUIs. These agents allow users to automate complex mobile tasks through simple natural language instructions. However, the inherent probabilistic nature of LFMs, coupled with the ambiguity and context-dependence of mobile tasks, makes LFM-based automation unreliable and prone to errors. To address this critical challenge, we introduce VeriSafe Agent (VSA): a formal verification system that serves as a logically grounded safeguard for Mobile GUI Agents. VSA deterministically ensures that an agent's actions strictly align with user intent before executing the action. At its core, VSA introduces a novel autoformalization technique that translates natural language user instructions into a formally verifiable specification. This enables runtime, rule-based verification of agent's actions, detecting erroneous actions even before they take effect. To the best of our knowledge, VSA is the first attempt to bring the rigor of formal verification to GUI agents, bridging the gap between LFM-driven actions and formal software verification. We implement VSA using off-the-shelf LFM services (GPT-4o) and evaluate its performance on 300 user instructions across 18 widely used mobile apps. The results demonstrate that VSA achieves 94.33%-98.33% accuracy in verifying agent actions, outperforming existing LFM-based verification methods by 30.00%-16.33%, and increases the GUI agent's task completion rate by 90%-130%.</description>

      <title>New Kid in the Classroom: Exploring Student Perceptions of AI Coding Assistants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The arrival of AI coding assistants in educational settings presents a paradigm shift, introducing a "new kid in the classroom" for both students and instructors. Thus, understanding the perceptions of these key actors about this new dynamic is critical. This exploratory study contributes to this area by investigating how these tools are shaping the experiences of novice programmers in an introductory programming course. Through a two-part exam, we investigated student perceptions by first providing access to AI support for a programming task and then requiring an extension of the solution without it. We collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to understand their perceptions on the challenges they faced. Our findings reveal that students perceived AI tools as helpful for grasping code concepts and boosting their confidence during the initial development phase. However, a noticeable difficulty emerged when students were asked to work unaided, pointing to potential overreliance and gaps in foundational knowledge transfer. These insights highlight a critical need for new pedagogical approaches that integrate AI effectively while effectively enhancing core programming skills, rather than impersonating them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03700v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents MagicGUI, a foundational mobile GUI agent designed to address critical challenges in perception, grounding, and reasoning within real-world mobile GUI environments. The framework is underpinned by following six key components: (1) a comprehensive and accurate dataset, constructed via the scalable GUI Data Pipeline, which aggregates the largest and most diverse GUI-centric multimodal data to date from open-source repositories, automated crawling, and targeted manual annotation; (2) enhanced perception and grounding capabilities, facilitating fine-grained multimodal alignment for UI element referencing, grounding, and screen comprehension; (3) a comprehensive and unified action space, encompassing both fundamental UI operations and complex interactive intents to support human-agent interactions; (4) planning-oriented reasoning mechanisms that enable the model to decompose complex user instructions into sequential actions with explicit intermediate meta-paln reasoning; (5) an iterative two-stage training procedure, combining large-scale continue pre-training on 7.8M samples with reinforcement fine-tuning utilizing a spatially enhanced composite reward and dual filtering strategy; and (6) competitive performance on both the proprietary Magic-RICH benchmark and over a dozen public benchmarks, achieving superior performance across GUI perception and agent tasks, while demonstrating robust generalization and real-world deployment potential in practical mobile GUI scenarios, as detailed in Figure 1.</description>

Abstract: Complex problem-solving requires cognitive flexibility--the capacity to entertain multiple perspectives while preserving their distinctiveness. This flexibility replicates the "wisdom of crowds" within a single individual, allowing them to "think with many minds." While mental simulation enables imagined deliberation, cognitive constraints limit its effectiveness. We propose synthetic deliberation, a Large Language Model (LLM)-based method that simulates discourse between agents embodying diverse perspectives, as a solution. Using a custom GPT-based model, we showcase its benefits: concurrent processing of multiple viewpoints without cognitive degradation, parallel exploration of perspectives, and precise control over viewpoint synthesis. By externalizing the deliberative process and distributing cognitive labor between parallel search and integration, synthetic deliberation transcends mental simulation's limitations. This approach shows promise for strategic planning, policymaking, and conflict resolution.</description>

      <title>Effort-aware Fairness: Incorporating a Philosophy-informed, Human-centered Notion of Effort into Algorithmic Fairness Metrics</title>

Abstract: Although popularized AI fairness metrics, e.g., demographic parity, have uncovered bias in AI-assisted decision-making outcomes, they do not consider how much effort one has spent to get to where one is today in the input feature space. However, the notion of effort is important in how Philosophy and humans understand fairness. We propose a philosophy-informed approach to conceptualize and evaluate Effort-aware Fairness (EaF), grounded in the concept of Force, which represents the temporal trajectory of predictive features coupled with inertia. Besides theoretical formulation, our empirical contributions include: (1) a pre-registered human subjects experiment, which shows that for both stages of the (individual) fairness evaluation process, people consider the temporal trajectory of a predictive feature more than its aggregate value; (2) pipelines to compute Effort-aware Individual/Group Fairness in the criminal justice and personal finance contexts. Our work may enable AI model auditors to uncover and potentially correct unfair decisions against individuals who have spent significant efforts to improve but are still stuck with systemic disadvantages outside their control.</description>

      <title>LLMs for sensory-motor control: Combining in-context and iterative learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method that enables large language models (LLMs) to control embodied agents by directly mapping continuous observation vectors to continuous action vectors. At the outset, the LLMs generate a control strategy based on a textual description of the agent, its environment, and the intended goal. This strategy is then iteratively refined through a learning process in which the LLMs are repeatedly prompted to improve the current strategy, using performance feedback and sensory-motor data collected during its evaluation. The method is validated on classic control tasks from the Gymnasium library and the inverted pendulum task from the MuJoCo library. The approach proves effective with relatively compact models such as Gpt-oss:120b and Qwen2.5:72b. In most cases, it successfully identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions by integrating symbolic knowledge derived through reasoning with sub-symbolic sensory-motor data gathered as the agent interacts with its environment.</description>

      <title>JAX-IK: Real-Time Inverse Kinematics for Generating Multi-Constrained Movements of Virtual Human Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating accurate and realistic virtual human movements in real-time is of high importance for a variety of applications in computer graphics, interactive virtual environments, robotics, and biomechanics. This paper introduces a novel real-time inverse kinematics (IK) solver specifically designed for realistic human-like movement generation. Leveraging the automatic differentiation and just-in-time compilation of TensorFlow, the proposed solver efficiently handles complex articulated human skeletons with high degrees of freedom. By treating forward and inverse kinematics as differentiable operations, our method effectively addresses common challenges such as error accumulation and complicated joint limits in multi-constrained problems, which are critical for realistic human motion modeling. We demonstrate the solver's effectiveness on the SMPLX human skeleton model, evaluating its performance against widely used iterative-based IK algorithms, like Cyclic Coordinate Descent (CCD), FABRIK, and the nonlinear optimization algorithm IPOPT. Our experiments cover both simple end-effector tasks and sophisticated, multi-constrained problems with realistic joint limits. Results indicate that our IK solver achieves real-time performance, exhibiting rapid convergence, minimal computational overhead per iteration, and improved success rates compared to existing methods.
