      <title>Academic Miscommunication in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Academic Miscommunication (AM) is the phenomenon of a professor's expectations, beliefs, or goals in the classroom differing from those of the students. In this study, a survey was given to undergraduates in two introductory physics classes (one class intended for majors, another for non-majors) who had recently received their grade for the first exam of the semester. The survey measured whether the exam had matched the students' expectations of the exam, both in form and in content. From these responses, students were assigned an "AM score," a numerical value in which higher numbers indicate a greater deviation between the actual exam and the students' expectations. Students' exam scores were compared with their AM scores; both classes displayed an inverse linear correlation between exam scores and AM scores. The class for majors displayed R-squared = 0.291 (n=14), corresponding to a p-value of 0.031. The class for non-majors displayed an R-squared = 0.457 (n=30), corresponding to a p-value of 0.000035. The survey also inquired about several other phenomena, such as Impostor Syndrome and the growth-versus-fixed mindset paradigm; 20 graphs were plotted in total. The Bonferroni correction therefore requires a p-value of 0.0025 for statistical significance. We reject the null hypothesis concerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics class for non-majors. In contrast, we fail to reject the null hypothesis concerning exam scores and feelings of AM for the physics class for majors. Our findings indicate that non- physics-major students who performed poorly on the first exam of the semester had misunderstood the expectations about the style and content of the exam.</description>

      <title>Intercultural perspective in teacher training: Astronomy as an entry point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of incorporating an intercultural perspective into Physics teacher training programs, we ask ourselves which current disciplinary contents could begin to be addressed from this perspective. We started out by exploring the current state of the field exclusively in relation to intercultural science education, focusing on direct relationships with Physics. We present here a synthesis of publications from the past five years that we have found so far. These publications were categorized based on their approach, whether related to theoretical dimensions or to the practical implementation. We develop the following categories: reflections on practical implementation, boundary objects, and practical implementation experiences. We find coincidences that allow us to identify the concept of the celestial sphere as the one that would facilitate the incorporation of an intercultural perspective into Physics teacher training programs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Science Literacy through Cognitive Conflict-Based Generative Learning Model: An Experimental Study in Physics Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This experimental study investigates the effectiveness of the Cognitive Conflict-Based Generative Learning Model (GLBCC) in enhancing science literacy among high school physics students. The novelty of this research lies in the innovative integration of cognitive conflict strategies with generative learning principles through a six stage structured framework, specifically designed to address persistent misconceptions in physics education while systematically developing scientific literacy competencies. The research employed pretest-posttest control group design involving 167 Grade XI students from three schools. Students were randomly assigned to experimental groups (n = 83) that received GLBCC instruction and control groups (n = 84) that used the expository learning model. Science literacy was measured using validated instruments assessing scientific knowledge, inquiry processes, and application skills across six key indicators. Statistical analysis using ANOVA with Tukey HSD post-hoc tests revealed significant improvements in science literacy scores for students receiving GLBCC instruction compared to traditional methods (p &lt; 0.001). This study makes a unique contribution to physics education by demonstrating how the deliberate creation of cognitive conflict, combined with authentic real-world physics phenomena, can effectively restructure students conceptual understanding and enhance their scientific thinking capabilities. Factor analysis identified four critical implementation factors: science literacy development components, learning stages and orientation, and objectives, and knowledge construction processes. The findings provide empirical evidence supporting the integration of cognitive conflict strategies with generative learning approaches in physics education, offering practical implications</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Education in Latin America: Experiences and Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field with the potential to drive scientific, educational, and technological development. However, it faces a significant shortage of qualified experts, creating an urgent demand for skilled professionals. In Latin America, quantum education remains in its early stages, further widening the regional talent and access gap due to limited educational infrastructure and financial constraints. This work presents an initiative to integrate quantum computing into higher education in Latin America through the application of the European Competence Framework for Quantum Technologies, which offers a standardized approach to defining competency requirements and assessing essential skills in the field. We propose introductory courses aligned with the frameworks guidelines, designed to meet industry standards and reach a broad audience. Additionally, we introduce supplementary resources, including team dynamics and evaluation methodologies, to enhance the educational ecosystem. These initiatives aim to create a sustainable and comprehensive quantum education model across Latin America, to close the regional skills gap, foster inclusivity, and prepare a diverse workforce to contribute innovative solutions on the global stage.</description>

      <title>Smartphone-Based Undergraduate Physics Labs: A Comprehensive Review of Innovation, Accessibility, and Pedagogical Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smartphone-integrated physics laboratories (SmartIPLs) have emerged as a cost-effective and scalable approach that offers new opportunities for enhancing introductory physics education. By leveraging the sensing, imaging, and computing capabilities of smartphones, SmartIPLs enable hands-on, inquiry-based experiments that can be conducted flexibly, in classrooms, at home, or in remote environments. This review presents a comprehensive synthesis of over 200 documented SmartIPL activities across key physics domains, including mechanics, optics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, and modern physics. Activities are systematically categorized by topic, sensor modality (sensor-based versus camera-based), and instructional design. The pedagogical value of SmartIPLs is examined through the lens of context-based learning, open-ended inquiry, cognitive scaffolding, and student motivation, with particular attention to issues of accessibility and equity. We also analyze implementation challenges such as device heterogeneity, sensor limitations, and integration into traditional curricula. Looking forward, we identify emerging directions for the field, including AI-driven feedback systems, open-source curricular platforms, and expanded applications in modern physics. This review positions SmartIPLs not merely as technological supplements, but as transformative tools for fostering scientific thinking, modeling skills, and epistemic agency in 21st-century physics education.</description>

      <title>Blowing in a drinking straw: introducing quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an educational approach aimed at introducing the fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics (QM). By exploiting the formal analogy between sound wave behavior in an acoustic pipe (a drinking straw) and the quantum infinite square potential well, we provide an intuitive framework that explains the origin of energy quantization in bound quantum systems (such as atoms), introduces the concept of wave function (WF), and lays the groundwork for discussing the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. The proposed method enables low-cost experimental activities that actively involve students, facilitating a meaningful connection between theoretical principles and empirical observations. Moreover, it encourages critical reflection on the Copenhagen interpretation of the WF, promoting a deeper conceptual understanding.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the Inter-Rater Reliability between Large Language Models and Human Raters in Qualitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qualitative analysis is typically limited to small datasets because it is time-intensive. Moreover, a second human rater is required to ensure reliable findings. Artificial intelligence tools may replace human raters if we demonstrate high reliability compared to human ratings. We investigated the inter-rater reliability of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), ChatGPT-4o and ChatGPT-4.5-preview, in rating audio transcripts coded manually. We explored prompts and hyperparameters to optimize model performance. The participants were 14 undergraduate student groups from a university in the midwestern United States who discussed problem-solving strategies for a project. We prompted an LLM to replicate manual coding, and calculated Cohen's Kappa for inter-rater reliability. After optimizing model hyperparameters and prompts, the results showed substantial agreement (${\kappa}&gt;0.6$) for three themes and moderate agreement on one. Our findings demonstrate the potential of GPT-4o and GPT-4.5 for efficient, scalable qualitative analysis in physics education and identify their limitations in rating domain-general constructs.</description>
