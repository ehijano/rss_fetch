      <title>Regular $K_3$-irregular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem proposed by Chartrand, Erd\H{o}s and Oellermann (1988) about the existence of regular $K_3$-irregular graphs. We first establish bounds on the $K_3$-degrees of such graphs and use them to prove that there are no such graphs with regularities at most $7$. For the regularity $8$, we narrow down the bounds on the order of such graphs to six possible values. We then present an explicit example of a $9$-regular $K_3$-irregular graph. Finally, we discuss an evolutionary algorithm developed to discover more examples of $r$-regular $K_3$-irregular graphs for consecutive values $r \in \{9, \dots, 30\}$.</description>

      <title>Largest planar graphs of diameter $3$ and fixed maximum degree -- connection with fractional matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree diameter problem asks for the maximum possible number of vertices in a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ and diameter $D$. In this paper, we focus on planar graphs of diameter $3$. Fellows, Hell and Seyffarth (1995) proved that for all $\Delta\geq 8$, the maximum number $\mathrm{np}_{\Delta, D}$ of vertices of a planar graph with maximum degree at most $\Delta$ and diameter at most 3 satisfies $\frac{9}{2}\Delta - 3 \leq \mathrm{np}_{\Delta,3} \leq 8 \Delta + 12$. We show that the lower bound they gave is optimal, up to an additive constant, by proving that there exists $c&gt;0$ such that $\mathrm{np}_{\Delta,3} \leq \frac{9}{2}\Delta + c$ for every $\Delta\geq 0$. Our proof consists in a reduction to the fractional maximum matching problem on a specific class of planar graphs, for which we show that the optimal solution is $\tfrac{9}{2}$, and characterize all graphs attaining this bound.</description>

      <title>Equivariant volumes of symmetric edge polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetric edge polytope ($\mathrm{SEP}$) of a finite simple graph $G$ is a centrally symmetric lattice polytope whose vertices are defined by the edges of the graph. Among the information encoded by these polytopes are the symmetries of the graph, which appear as symmetries of the polytope. We find an explicit relationship between the relative volumes of the subsets of the symmetric edge polytope $\mathrm{SEP}(G)$ fixed by the natural action of symmetric group elements and the symmetric edge polytopes of smaller graphs to which the subsets are linearly equivalent. We also provide a vertex description of the fixed polytopes and find a description of the symmetric edge polytopes to which they are equivalent, in terms of contractions of the graph $G$ induced by the cycle decompositions of the permutations under which the subsets are fixed. Specializations of our results provide equivalence and volume relationships for fixed polytopes of symmetric edge polytopes of complete graphs (equivalently, for fixed polytopes embedded in root polytopes of type $A_n$), and describe the symmetry group of this family of polytopes.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Rubey's Lattice Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2011, Rubey generalized chute and ladder moves on the set of reduced pipe dreams for a permutation $w$ and conjectured that the induced poset on reduced pipe dreams is a lattice. In this paper, we prove this conjecture. Our key tool is a new type of move operation $\mathcal{M}_{ij}$, defined as a composite of certain general ladder moves in Rubey's poset. We show that joins and meets exist in Rubey's poset by proving simple recursive formulas in terms of $\mathcal{M}_{ij}$ operations. In addition, we give an explicit criterion to determine if two elements of Rubey's poset are comparable.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Stirling cycle and subset triangles: Total positivity, continued fractions and real-rootedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a lower-triangular matrix of real numbers, one can ask the following four total-positivity questions: total positivity of the triangle itself; total positivity of its row-reversal; Toeplitz-total positivity of its row sequences (equivalent to negative-real-rootedness of the row-generating polynomials); and coefficientwise Hankel-total positivity of the sequence of row-generating polynomials. In this paper, we introduce two infinite families of lower-triangular matrices generalising the Stirling cycle and subset triangles, parametrised by an integer $r \ge 1$; we call these the $r$th-order Stirling cycle and subset numbers. We then ask the foregoing four questions for each of these triangles, leading us to several conjectures. We then prove some of these conjectures for the case $r=2$.</description>

      <title>Roux schemes which carry association schemes locally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A roux scheme is an association scheme formed from a special "roux" matrix and the regular permutation representation of an associated group. They were introduced by Iverson and Mixon for their connection to equiangular tight frames and doubly transitive lines. We show how roux matrices can be produced from association schemes and characterise roux schemes for which the neighbourhood of a vertex induces an association scheme possessing the same number of relations as the thin radical. An important example arises from the $64$ equiangular lines in $\mathbb{C}^8$ constructed by Hoggar which we prove is unique (determined by its parameters up to isomorphism). We also characterise roux schemes by their eigenmatrices and provide new families of roux schemes using our construction.</description>

      <title>Partitions with Durfee triangles of fixed size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A well-studied statistic of an integer partition is the size of its Durfee square. In particular, the number $D_k (n)$ of partitions of $n$ with Durfee square of fixed size $k$ has a well-known simple rational generating function. We study the number $R_k (n)$ of partitions of $n$ with Durfee triangle of size $k$ (the largest subpartition with parts $1, 2, \ldots, k$). We determine the corresponding generating functions which are rational functions of a similar form. Moreover, we explicitly determine the leading asymptotic of $R_k (n)$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$.</description>

      <title>On $q$-deformed Markov numbers. Cohn matrices and perfect matchings with weighted edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a natural $q$-deformation of the classical Markov numbers. This $q$-deformation is closely related to $q$-deformed rational numbers recently introduced by two of us. Both notions, those of $q$-rationals and $q$-Markov numbers, are based on invariance with respect to the action of the modular group $mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. We prove that every Markov number has a unique $q$-deformation, which is a monic unimodal palindromic Laurent polynomial with positive integer coefficients. The $q$-Markov numbers can be calculated in terms of the traces of $q$-deformed Cohn matrices, and we show that $q$-Markov numbers are independent of the choice of such matrices. We construct a combinatorial model counting perfect matchings of snake graphs with weighted edges.</description>

      <title>Balanced Gray Codes for Permutations and Rainbow Cycles for Associahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle the problem of constructing a balanced transposition Gray code for permutations of $[n] := \{1, \dots, n\}$ with $n \in \mathbb{N}\setminus\{0\}$. More generally, we obtain a~$2(m-2)!$-rainbow cycle for the permutations of $[n]$ for $m \in [n]$, a notion recently introduced by Felsner, Kleist, M\"utze, and Sering. Furthermore, we extend a result of theirs by presenting a $k$-rainbow cycle for the classical associahedron $\mathcal{A}_{n}$ for $k \in [2n + 2]$.
  For even $n$, we also construct a balanced Gray code for permutations of $[n]$, using only cyclically adjacent transpositions, complementing the construction for odd $n$ by Gregor, Merino, and M\"utze.
  Additionally, we show that the Permutahedron $P_{n}$ admits a $2$-rainbow cycle for all $n\ge5$ and a $3$-rainbow cycle for odd $n\ge3$.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Configurations and Boundary Cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a $k\times \ell$ (0,1)-matrix. Define a (0,1)-matrix $A$ to have a $F$ as a \emph{configuration} if there is a submatrix of $A$ which is a row and column permutation of $F$. In the language of sets, a configuration is a \emph{trace}. Define a matrix to be {\it simple} if it is a (0,1)-matrix with no repeated columns. Let $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$ be all simple $m$-rowed matrices $A$ with no configuration $F$. Define $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)$ as the maximum number of columns of any matrix in $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$. Determining $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)$ requires determining bounds and constructions of matrices in $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$. The paper considers some column maximal $k$-rowed simple $F$ that have the bound $\Theta(m^{k-2})$ and yet adding a column increases bound to $\Omega(m^{k-1})$. By a construction, $\mathrm{forb(m,F)}$ is determined exactly.</description>

      <title>The Density of Zero and One in Fibonacci Word for Subwords and Their Palindromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the density of zero and one in subwords of the Fibonacci word with lengths less than thirty and compares them to the densities of their corresponding palindromes. We used computational methods to produce a sufficiently large piece of the Fibonacci word, extract all unique subwords up to a predetermined length, and calculate their palindrome. The density of each character (0 and 1) was then determined for both the original subwords and their palindromic counterparts. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the combinatorial properties of the Fibonacci word and the behavior of its constituent elements under reversal.</description>

      <title>Raising and lowering maps for tridiagonal pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ denote a nonzero finite-dimensional vector space. A tridiagonal pair on $V$ is an ordered pair $A, A^*$ of maps in ${\rm End}(V)$ such that (i) each of $A, A^*$ is diagonalizable; (ii) there exists an ordering $\lbrace V_i \rbrace_{i=0}^d$ of the eigenspaces of $A$ such that $A^* V_i \subseteq V_{i-1} + V_i + V_{i+1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$, where $V_{-1} =0$ and $V_{d+1}=0$; (iii) there exists an ordering $\lbrace V^*_i \rbrace_{i=0}^\delta$ of the eigenspaces of $A^*$ such that $A V^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i-1} + V^*_i + V^*_{i+1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq \delta)$, where $V^*_{-1} =0$ and $V^*_{\delta+1}=0$; (iv) there does not exist a subspace $W \subseteq V$ such that $W \not=0$, $W\not=V$, $A W \subseteq W$, $A^*W \subseteq W$. Assume that $A, A^*$ is a tridiagonal pair on $V$. It is known that $d=\delta$. For $0 \leq i \leq d$ let $\theta_i$ (resp. $\theta^*_i$) denote the eigenvalue of $A$ (resp. $A^*$) for $V_i$ (resp. $V^*_i$). By construction, there exist $R,F,L \in {\rm End}(V)$ such that $A=R+F+L$ and $R V^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i+1}$, $F V^*_i \subseteq V^*_i$, $LV^*_i \subseteq V^*_{i-1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$. For $0 \leq i \leq d$ define $U_i = (V^*_0 + V^*_1 + \cdots + V^*_i ) \cap (V_i + V_{i+1} + \cdots + V_d)$. It is known that the sum $V=\sum_{i=0}^d U_i$ is direct. By construction, there exists $\mathcal R, \mathcal L \in {\rm End}(V)$ such that $\mathcal R=A - \theta_i I$ and $\mathcal L= A^*-\theta^*_i I$ on $U_i$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$. It is known that $\mathcal R U_i \subseteq U_{i+1}$ and $\mathcal L U_i \subseteq U_{i-1}$ $(0 \leq i \leq d)$, where $U_{-1}=0$ and $U_{d+1}=0$. In this paper, our main goal is to describe how $R,F,L,\mathcal R, \mathcal L$ are related. We also give some results concerning injectivity/surjectivity and $R, L$.</description>

      <title>Cycle-factors of regular graphs via entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a classical result that a random permutation of $n$ elements has, on average, about $\log n$ cycles. We generalise this fact to all directed $d$-regular graphs on $n$ vertices by showing that, on average, a random cycle-factor of such a graph has $\mathcal{O}((n\log d)/d)$ cycles. This is tight up to the constant factor and improves the best previous bound of the form $\mathcal{O}(n/\sqrt{\log d})$ due to Vishnoi. Our results also yield randomised polynomial-time algorithms for finding such a cycle-factor and for finding a tour of length $(1+\mathcal{O}((\log d)/d)) \cdot n$ if the graph is connected. This makes progress on a conjecture of Magnant and Martin and on a problem studied by Vishnoi and by Feige, Ravi, and Singh. Our proof uses the language of entropy to exploit the fact that the upper and lower bounds on the number of perfect matchings in regular bipartite graphs are extremely close.</description>

      <title>Odd Ramsey numbers of multipartite graphs and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $G$ and a subhypergraph $H$ of $G$, the \emph{odd Ramsey number} $r_{odd}(G,H)$ is the minimum number of colors needed to edge-color $G$ so that every copy of $H$ intersects some color class in an odd number of edges. Generalizing a result of \cite{BHZ} in two different ways, in this paper we prove $r_{odd} \left(K_{n,n}, K_{2,t} \right)=\frac{n}{t} + o(n)$ for all $t\geq 2$, and $r_{odd} \left(\mathcal{K}^{(k)}_{n,\dots,n}, \mathcal{K}_{1,\dots,1,2,2} \right) = \frac{n}{2} + o(n)$ for all $k\geq 2$. The latter is the first result studying odd Ramsey numbers for hypergraphs.</description>

Abstract: We settle a conjecture by Bik and Marigliano stating that the degree of a one-dimensional discrete model with rational maximum likelihood estimator is bounded above by a linear function in the size of its support, therefore showing that there are only finitely many fundamental such models for any given number of states. We study these models from a combinatorial perspective with regard to their existence and enumeration. In particular, sharp models, those whose degree attains the maximal bound, enjoy special properties and have been studied as monomial maps between unit spheres. In this way, we present a novel link between Cauchy-Riemann geometry and algebraic statistics.</description>

      <title>Characterizing (multi-)semi-directed phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In evolutionary biology, phylogenetic networks are graphs that provide a flexible framework for representing complex evolutionary histories that involve reticulate evolutionary events. Recently phylogenetic studies have started to focus on a special class of such networks called semi-directed networks. These graphs are defined as mixed graphs that can be obtained by de-orienting some of the arcs in some rooted phylogenetic network, that is, a directed acyclic graph whose leaves correspond to a collection of species and that has a single source or root vertex. However, this definition of semi-directed networks is implicit in nature since it is not clear when a mixed-graph enjoys this property or not. In this paper, we introduce novel, explicit mathematical characterizations of semi-directed networks, and also multi-semi-directed networks, that is mixed graphs that can be obtained from directed phylogenetic networks that may have more than one root. In addition, through extending foundational tools from the theory of rooted networks into the semi-directed setting - such as cherry picking sequences, omnians, and path partitions - we characterize when a (multi-)semi-directed network can be obtained by de-orienting some rooted network that is contained in one of the well-known classes of tree-child, orchard, tree-based or forest-based networks. These results address structural aspects of (multi-)semi-directed networks and pave the way to improved theoretical and computational analyses of such networks, for example, within the development of algebraic evolutionary models that are based on such networks.</description>

      <title>Maximizing entropy for power-free languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A power-free language is characterized by the number of symbols used and a limit on how many times a block of symbols can repeat consecutively. For certain values of these parameters, it is known that the number of legal words grows exponentially fast with respect to length. In the terminology of dynamical systems and ergodic theory, this means that the corresponding shift space has positive topological entropy.
  We prove that in many cases, this shift space has a unique measure of maximal entropy. The proof uses a weak analogue of Bowen's specification property. The lack of any periodic points in power-free shift spaces stands in striking contrast to other applications of specification-based techniques, where the number of periodic points often has exponential growth rate given by the topological entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denote by $E_r$ the $r^{th}$ elementary symmetric polynomial in $\dim V$ variables for a vector space $V$ over an infinite field $\Bbbk$. We describe the rational points on the Fano scheme $F_{d-1}(Z(E_{\dim V-1}))$ of projective $(d-1)$-spaces contained in the zero locus of $E_{\dim V-1}$. Isolated points exist precisely for $\dim V=2d$, in which case they are in bijection with the $1\cdot 3\cdots (2d-1)$ pairings on a $2d$-element set. This, in particular, confirming a conjecture of Ambartsoumian, Auel and Jebelli to the effect that (over $\mathbb{R}$) all isolated points are recoverable via integral star transforms with appropriate symbols.</description>

      <title>On entropic and almost multilinear representability of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03465v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article studies two notions of generalized matroid representations motivated by algorithmic information theory and cryptographic secret sharing. The first (entropic representability) involves discrete random variables, while the second (almost-multilinear representability) deals with approximate subspace arrangements. In both cases, we prove that determining whether an input matroid has such a representation is undecidable. Consequently, the conditional independence implication problem is also undecidable, providing an independent answer to a question posed by Geiger and Pearl, recently resolved by Cheuk Ting Li. These problems are also closely related to characterizing achievable rates in network coding and constructing secret sharing schemes. For example, another corollary of our work is that deciding whether an access structure admits an ideal secret sharing scheme is undecidable. Our approach reduces undecidable problems from group theory to matroid representation problems. Specifically, we reduce the uniform word problem for finite groups to entropic representability and the word problem for sofic groups to almost-multilinear representability. A key part of this reduction involves modifying group presentations into forms where linear representations are generic in an appropriate sense when restricted to the generating set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate hyperbinary expansions of a nonnegative integer~$n$, an edge-labeled directed graph $A(n)$ has recently been introduced. After pointing out some new simple facts about its cyclomatic number, we give a relatively simple description of its structure and prove that if $m,n$ are even numbers for which $A(n)$ and $A(m)$ are isomorphic as edge-labeled graphs, then $m=n$. From the structure of $A(n)$ we also derive a formula related to Stern's diatomic sequence, and in the same vein discuss some algorithms that recently appeared in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A family $\mathcal{F}$ of spanning trees of the complete graph on $n$ vertices $K_n$ is \emph{$t$-intersecting} if any two members have a forest on $t$ edges in common. We prove an Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado result for $t$-intersecting families of spanning trees of $K_n$. In particular, we show there exists a constant $C &gt; 0$ such that for all $n \geq C (\log n) t$ the largest $t$-intersecting families are the families consisting of all trees that contain a fixed set of $t$ disjoint edges (as well as the stars on $n$ vertices for $t = 1$). The proof uses the spread approximation technique in conjunction with the Lopsided Lov\'asz Local Lemma.</description>

      <title>State transfer in Grover walks on unitary and quadratic unitary Cayley graphs over finite commutative rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on periodicity and perfect state transfer of Grover walks on two well-known families of Cayley graphs, namely, the unitary Cayley graphs and the quadratic unitary Cayley graphs. Let $R$ be a finite commutative ring. The unitary Cayley graph $G_R$ has vertex set $R$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $u-v$ is a unit in $R$. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the periodicity of the Cayley graph $G_R$. We also completely determine the rings $R$ for which $G_R$ exhibits perfect state transfer. The quadratic unitary Cayley graph $\mathcal{G}_R$ has vertex set $R$, where two vertices $u$ and $v$ are adjacent if $u-v$ or $v-u$ is a square of some units in $R$. It is well known that any finite commutative ring $R$ can be expressed as $R_1\times\cdots\times R_s$, where each $R_i$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $M_i$ for $i\in\{1,...,s\}$. We characterize periodicity and perfect state transfer on $\mathcal{G}_R$ under the condition that $|R_i|/|M_i|\equiv 1 \pmod 4$ for $i\in\{1,...,s\}$. Also, we characterize periodicity and perfect state transfer on $\mathcal{G}_R$, where $R$ can be expressed as $R_0\times\cdots\times R_s$ such that $|R_0|/|M_0|\equiv3\pmod 4$, and $|R_i|/|M_i|\equiv1\pmod4$ for $i\in\{1,..., s\}$, where $R_i$ is a local ring with maximal ideal $M_i$ for $i\in\{0,...,s\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23252v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we initiate the study of discrepancy questions for combinatorial designs. Specifically, we show that, for every fixed $r\ge 3$ and $n\equiv 1,3 \pmod{6}$, any $r$-colouring of the triples on $[n]$ admits a Steiner triple system of order $n$ with discrepancy $\Omega(n^2)$. This is not true for $r=2$, but we are able to asymptotically characterise all $2$-colourings which do not contain a Steiner triple system with high discrepancy. The key step in our proofs is a characterization of 3-uniform hypergraphs avoiding a certain natural type of induced subgraphs, contributing to the structural theory of hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Kernelization for list $H$-coloring for graphs with small vertex cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a fixed graph $H$, in the List $H$-Coloring problem, we are given a graph $G$ along with list $L(v) \subseteq V(H)$ for every $v \in V(G)$, and we have to determine if there exists a list homomorphism $\varphi$ from $(G,L)$ to $H$, i.e., an edge preserving mapping $\varphi: V(G)\to V(H)$ that satisfies $\varphi(v)\in L(v)$ for every $v\in V(G)$. Note that if $H$ is the complete graph on $q$ vertices, the problem is equivalent to List $q$-Coloring. We investigate the kernelization properties of List $H$-Coloring parameterized by the vertex cover number of $G$: given an instance $(G,L)$ and a vertex cover of $G$ of size $k$, can we reduce $(G,L)$ to an equivalent instance $(G',L')$ of List $H$-Coloring where the size of $G'$ is bounded by a low-degree polynomial $p(k)$ in $k$? This question has been investigated previously by Jansen and Pieterse [Algorithmica 2019], who provided an upper bound, which turns out to be optimal if $H$ is a complete graph, i.e., for List $q$-Coloring. This result was one of the first applications of the method of kernelization via bounded-degree polynomials. We define two new integral graph invariants, $c^*(H)$ and $d^*(H)$, with $d^*(H) \leq c^*(H) \leq d^*(H)+1$, and show that for every graph $H$, List $H$-Coloring
  -- has a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^{c^*(H)})$ vertices,
  -- admits no kernel of size $\mathcal{O}(k^{d^*(H)-\varepsilon})$ for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.
  -- Furthermore, if $c^*(H) &gt; d^*(H)$, then there is a kernel with $\mathcal{O}(k^{c^*(H)-\varepsilon})$ vertices where $\varepsilon \geq 2^{1-c^*(H)}$.
  Additionally, we show that for some classes of graphs, including powers of cycles and graphs $H$ where $\Delta(H) \leq c^*(H)$ (which in particular includes cliques), the bound $d^*(H)$ is tight, using the polynomial method. We conjecture that this holds in general.</description>

      <title>Symmetric decompositions and Euler-Stirling statistics on Stirling permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Stirling permutations introduced by Gessel-Stanley have recently received considerable attention. Motivated by Ji's work on $(\alpha,\beta)$-Eulerian polynomials (Sci China Math., 2025) and Yan-Yang-Lin's work on $1/k$-Eulerian polynomials (J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 2026), we present several symmetric decompositions of the enumerators related to Euler-Stirling statistics on Stirling permutations. Firstly, we provide a partial symmetric decomposition for the $1/k$-Eulerian polynomial. Secondly, we give several unexpected applications of the $(p,q)$-Eulerian polynomials, where $p$ marks the number of fixed points of permutations and $q$ marks that of cycles. From this paper, one can see that $(p,q)$-Eulerian polynomial contains a great deal of information about permutations and Stirling permutations. Using the change of grammars, we show that the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Eulerian polynomials introduced by Carlitz-Scoville can be deduced from the $(p,q)$-Eulerian polynomials by special parametrizations. We then introduce proper and improper ascent-plateau statistics on Stirling permutations. Moreover, we introduce proper ascent, improper ascent, proper descent and improper descent statistics on permutations. Furthermore, we consider the joint distributions of Euler-Stirling statistics on permutations, including the numbers of improper ascents, proper ascents, left-to-right minima and right-to-left minina. In the final part, we first give a symmetric decomposition of the joint distribution of the ascent-plateau and left ascent-plateau statistics, and then we show that the $q$-ascent-plateau polynomials are bi-$\gamma$-positive, where $q$ marks the number of left-to-right minima.</description>

      <title>An Invariance Principle for the Multi-slice, with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.10725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an alphabet size $m\in\mathbb{N}$ thought of as a constant, and $\vec{k} = (k_1,\ldots,k_m)$ whose entries sum of up $n$, the $\vec{k}$-multi-slice is the set of vectors $x\in [m]^n$ in which each symbol $i\in [m]$ appears precisely $k_i$ times. We show an invariance principle for low-degree functions over the multi-slice, to functions over the product space $([m]^n,\mu^n)$ in which $\mu(i) = k_i/n$. This answers a question raised by Filmus et al.
  As applications of the invariance principle, we show:
  1. An analogue of the "dictatorship test implies computational hardness" paradigm for problems with perfect completeness, for a certain class of dictatorship tests. Our computational hardness is proved assuming a recent strengthening of the Unique-Games Conjecture, called the Rich $2$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture. Using this analogue, we show that assuming the Rich $2$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture, (a) there is an $r$-ary CSP $\mathcal{P}_r$ for which it is NP-hard to distinguish satisfiable instances of the CSP and instances that are at most $\frac{2r+1}{2^r} + o(1)$ satisfiable, and (b) hardness of distinguishing $3$-colorable graphs, and graphs that do not contain an independent set of size $o(1)$.
  2. A reduction of the problem of studying expectations of products of functions on the multi-slice to studying expectations of products of functions on correlated, product spaces. In particular, we are able to deduce analogues of the Gaussian bounds from \cite{MosselGaussian} for the multi-slice.
  3. In a companion paper, we show further applications of our invariance principle in extremal combinatorics, and more specifically to proving removal lemmas of a wide family of hypergraphs $H$ called $\zeta$-forests, which is a natural extension of the well-studied case of matchings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the restrictions on the number $m$ of conic-line curves in special pencils. The most general result we obtain is the relation between upper bounds on $m$ and the number $p$ of concurrent lines in these pencils. We construct a one-parameter family of pencils such that each pencil in the family contains exactly 4 conic-line curves. We also deal with pencils whose conic-line curves are in general position.</description>

      <title>On Lattice Isomorphism Problems for Lattices from LCD Codes over Finite Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These days, post-quantum cryptography based on the lattice isomorphism problem has been proposed. Ducas-Gibbons introduced the hull attack, which solves the lattice isomorphism problem for lattices obtained by Construction A from an LCD code over a finite field. Using this attack, they showed that the lattice isomorphism problem for such lattices can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem with the trivial lattice $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem. While the previous work by Ducas-Gibbons only considered lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite field}, this paper considers lattices constructed by a code over a \textit{finite ring} $\mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z}$, which is a more general case. In particular, when $k$ is odd, an odd prime power, or not divisible by $4$, we show that the lattice isomorphism problem can be reduced to the lattice isomorphism problem for $\mathbb{Z}^n$ and the graph isomorphism problem.</description>
