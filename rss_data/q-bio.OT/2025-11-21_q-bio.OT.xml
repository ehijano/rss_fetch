      <title>Prediction of Retention Time in Larger Antisense Oligonucleotide Datasets using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are nucleic acid molecules with transformative therapeutic potential, especially for diseases that are untreatable by traditional drugs. However, the production and purification of ASOs remain challenging due to the presence of unwanted impurities. One tool successfully used to separate an ASO compound from the impurities is ion pair liquid chromatography (IPC). It is a critical step in separation, where each compound is identified by its retention time (tR) in the IPC. Due to the complex sequence-dependent behavior of ASOs and variability in chromatographic conditions, the accurate prediction of tR is a difficult task. This study addresses this challenge by applying machine learning (ML) to predict tR based on the sequence characteristics of ASOs. Four ML models Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Regression were evaluated on three large ASO datasets with different gradient times. Through feature engineering and grid search optimization, key predictors were identified and compared for model accuracy using root mean square error, coefficient of determination R-squared, and run time. The results showed that Gradient Boost performance competes with the Support Vector Machine in two of the three datasets, but is 3.94 times faster to tune. Additionally, newly proposed features representing the sulfur count and the nucleotides residing at the first and last positions of a sequence were found to improve the predictive power of the models. This study demonstrates the advantages of ML-based tR prediction at scale and provides insights into interpretable and efficient utilization of ML in chromatographic applications.</description>

      <title>Modelling the impact of improving access to healthcare on Hepatitis B prevalence in the Thai-Myanmar border region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: In Thailand, Hepatitis B is still endemic despite a strong program to eliminate the disease. A higher prevalence is reported in the border region and among migrants due to physical, financial and cultural barriers. Policies and programs targeting the border region and migrant communities have been suggested. Models can be used to understand and quantify the impact of these policies, given they can capture the heterogeneity within the population.
  Methods: In this study, we developed an Agent-based model that captures the differences between the Thai and migrant populations living in this region, notably the higher level of mobility, lower access to healthcare, and the higher prevalence of Hepatitis B among migrants, by modelling the origin of each individual explicitly. We used the model to estimate future trends of Hepatitis B prevalence in Thailand near the border with Myanmar under different scenarios of intervention.
  Results: Our study shows that although the current intervention level is effective in the Thai population, it is insufficient to reach national elimination targets due to high prevalence in migrants. Improving access to healthcare for migrants and the border region could potentially help to reach elimination targets, and we quantified the level of improvement needed to achieve elimination.
  Conclusion: Although there already exist policies to make healthcare more accessible to migrants and the border regions, they are still not yet effective due to financial and cultural barriers. Bringing down those barriers could reduce Hepatitis B prevalence in those communities and regions and contribute to reaching elimination targets in a reasonable timeline.</description>
