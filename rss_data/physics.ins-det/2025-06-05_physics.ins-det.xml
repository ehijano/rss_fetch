      <title>A planning tool for neutron powder diffraction experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a computer program to simulate the results of neutron powder-diffraction experiments at the High Flux Isotope Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The program is freely available as a web application at http://addie.ornl.gov/hfirestimate, and is designed to be straightforward to use for researchers who are new to neutron diffraction. The input includes the crystal structure of the proposed sample, the sample mass, and the instrument configuration. The results include a plot of the simulated data -- including realistic estimates of background and the error bars due to counting statistics -- and suggestions of how to resolve potential problems with the experiment. Here, we explain the design and implementation of this program and demonstrate its performance using comparisons of simulated and experimental data. We hope that this program will enable researchers to plan neutron-scattering experiments more effectively, increasing the likelihood of successful experiments and improving the productivity of neutron-diffraction research.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Resolution of Organic Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuations in photon production within scintillators contribute to the overall energy resolution of scintillation detectors. While typically negligible, this contribution - known as intrinsic resolution (IR) - presents significant challenges for both experimental measurement and Monte Carlo simulation. Using the phenomenological model proposed in~[1], we interpreted multiple datasets of IR measurements in organic scintillators. Although our results generally agree with the IR dataset examined in~[1], a comprehensive evaluation of systematic uncertainties highlights the necessity for more detailed investigation. Based on our findings, we offer specific recommendations for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Synchronous and asynchronous Data Quality Control of the ALICE Inner Tracking System in the LHC Run 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Inner Tracking System (ITS) of the ALICE experiment at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is the largest Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor technology application in high-energy physics. The upgraded version of the tracking system, called ITS2, consists of seven concentric layers of ALPIDE monolithic active pixel sensors produced in the 180 nm CMOS process, covering a total sensitive area of about 10 m${}^2$. The ALPIDE sensor features a pixel pitch of 27 $\mu$m $\times$ 29 $\mu$m and a position resolution of about 5 $\mu$m. The very low material budget, 0.36\% $X_{0}$/layer for the three innermost layers and 1.10\% $X_{0}$/layer for the outer layers, in combination with the small radial distance of only 23 mm from the beam, leads to an excellent impact parameter resolution at low transverse momentum. This makes the detector well suited for experimentally challeging physics measurements such as the reconstruction of low transverse momentum heavy-flavor particles in the heavy-ion collision environment. This contribution provides an overview of the ITS2 data Quality Control system (QC), a framework designed to synchronously monitor the detector operating parameters and provide asynchronous reconstruction of the collected data, with the goal of guaranteeing a stable and efficient data taking. The monitoring for fake-hit rate, front-end electronics status, data integrity, cluster and track distributions, are presented, together with an overview of the ITS2 performance during the recent Run 3 pp and Pb--Pb data taking campaigns, as extracted from the QC asynchronous reconstruction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two recent electrical incidents demonstrate how the design of equipment encouraged electrical workers to take actions that violated NFPA 70E principles. The features that encouraged non-compliant work execution will be described, as well as how the equipment was improved to facilitate safe work practices. Design-stage processes that help identify features that will foster rather than compromise safe work practices will be identified as well.</description>

      <title>Develoment of thin high-pressure-laminate RPC electrodes for future high-energy experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this R&amp;D, an innovative method for producing thin high-pressure laminate (HPL) electrodes for resistive plate chambers (RPC) for future high-energy experiments is introduced. Instead of using thick phenolic HPL (2-mm thick Bakelite), which has been used for conventional RPC triggers, the RPC electrodes in the present study are constructed by bonding 500 {\mu}m-thick melamine-based HPL to a graphite-coated polycarbonate plate. A double-gap RPC prototype to demostrate the present technology has been constructed and tested for cosmic muons. Furthermore, the uniform detector characteristrics shown in the test result allows us to explore the present technology in future high-energy experiments.</description>

      <title>Simulation of MAPS and a MAPS-based Inner Tracker for the Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) are a promising detector candidate for the inner tracker of the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). To evaluate the performance of MAPS and the MAPS-based inner tracker, a dedicated simulation workflow has been developed, offering essential insights for detector design and optimization.
  The intrinsic characteristics of MAPS, designed using several fabrication processes and pixel geometries, were investigated through a combination of Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) and Monte Carlo simulations. Simulations were conducted with both minimum ionizing particles and $^{55}$Fe X-rays to assess critical parameters such as detection efficiency, cluster size, spatial resolution, and charge collection efficiency. Based on these evaluations, a MAPS sensor featuring a strip-like pixel and a high-resistivity epitaxial layer is selected as the baseline sensor design for the STCF inner tracker due to its excellent performance.
  Using this optimized MAPS design, a three-layer MAPS-based inner tracker was modeled and simulated. The simulation demonstrated an average detection efficiency exceeding 99%, spatial resolutions of 44.8$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $z$ direction and 8.2$\rm{\mu m}$ in the $r-\phi$ direction, and an intrinsic sensor time resolution of 5.9ns for 1GeV/c $\mu^-$ particles originating from the interaction point. These promising results suggest that the MAPS-based inner tracker fulfills the performance requirements of the STCF experiment.</description>

      <title>Effect of chromatic dispersion on image size and lattice plane curvature measurements with Rocking Curve Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ADP crystals of large dimensions (80x80x20 mm3), to be used as a X-ray beam expanders in the BEaTriX facility at INAF-OABrera, have been characterised at BM05 beamline at ESRF synchrotron with the main purpose to determine lattice plane curvature with a unprecedent accuracy, as the BEaTriX setup requires a radius of curvature larger than 22 km. In this beamline, the monochromator is made by 2 Si(111) parallel crystals in the non-dispersive configuration. Due to the difference in the Bragg angles between the Si(111) monochromator and the ADP(008) diffractions, only a limited part of the sample area, hit by the X-ray beam (11x11 mm2 cross section), produced a diffracted beam for a given value of angle of incidence. In the rocking curve imaging techniques, a full image of the sample for a given peak position is obtained by combining images taken at different angles of incidence compensated by the dispersion correction, that is the Bragg condition difference in different points of the sample. It is found that the resulting image size parallel to the scattering plane is affected by this dispersion correction. A 4.5 % elongation along the scattering plane was evaluated in the present Bragg case. This contribution is opposite in the Laue case.</description>

      <title>Quasioptic, Calibrated, Full 2-port Measurements of Cryogenic Devices under Vacuum in the 220-330 GHz Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quasi-optical (QO) test bench was designed, simulated, and calibrated for characterizing S-parameters of devices in the 220-330 GHz (WR-3.4) frequency range, from room temperature down to 4.8 K. The devices were measured through vacuum windows via focused beam radiation. A de-embedding method employing line-reflect-match (LRM) calibration was established to account for the effects of optical components and vacuum windows. The setup provides all four S-parameters with the reference plane located inside the cryostat, and achieves a return loss of 30 dB with an empty holder. System validation was performed with measurements of cryogenically cooled devices, such as bare silicon wafers and stainless-steel frequency-selective surface (FSS) bandpass filters, and superconducting bandpass FSS fabricated in niobium. A permittivity reduction of Si based on 4-GHz resonance shift was observed concomitant with a drop in temperature from 296 K to 4.8 K. The stainless steel FSS measurements revealed a relatively temperature invariant center frequency and return loss level of 263 GHz and 35 dB on average, respectively. Finally, a center frequency of 257 GHz was measured with the superconducting filters, with return loss improved by 7 dB on average at 4.8 K. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported attempt to scale LRM calibration to 330 GHz and use it to de-embed the impact of optics and cryostat from cryogenically cooled device S-parameters.</description>

      <title>The QTF-Backbone: Proposal for a Nationwide Optical Fibre Backbone in Germany for Quantum Technology and Time and Frequency Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent breakthroughs in the distribution of quantum information and high-precision time and frequency (T&amp;F) signals over long-haul optical fibre networks have transformative potential for physically secure communications, resilience of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and fundamental physics. However, so far these capabilities remain confined to isolated testbeds, with quantum and T&amp;F signals accessible, for example in Germany, to only a few institutions.
  We propose the QTF-Backbone: a dedicated national fibre-optic infrastructure in Germany for the networked distribution of quantum and T&amp;F signals using dark fibres and specialized hardware. The QTF-Backbone is planned as a four-phase deployment over ten years to ensure scalable, sustainable access for research institutions and industry. The concept builds on successful demonstrations of high-TRL time and frequency distribution across Europe, including PTB-MPQ links in Germany, REFIMEVE in France, and the Italian LIFT network. The QTF-Backbone will enable transformative R&amp;D, support a nationwide QTF ecosystem, and ensure the transition from innovation to deployment. As a national and European hub, it will position Germany and Europe at the forefront of quantum networking, as well as time and frequency transfer.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot, Single-Mask X-ray Dark-field and Phase Contrast Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray imaging, traditionally relying on attenuation contrast, struggles to differentiate materials with similar attenuation coefficients like soft tissues. X-ray phase contrast imaging (XPCI) and dark-field (DF) imaging provide enhanced contrast by detecting phase shifts and ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS). However, they typically require complex and costly setups, along with multiple exposures to retrieve various contrast features. In this study, we introduce a novel single-mask X-ray imaging system design that simultaneously captures attenuation, differential phase contrast (DPC), and dark-field images in a single exposure. Most importantly, our proposed system design requires just a single mask alignment with relatively low-resolution detectors. Using our novel light transport models derived for these specific system designs, we show intuitive understanding of contrast formation and retrieval method of different contrast features. Our approach eliminates the need for highly coherent X-ray sources, ultra-high-resolution detectors, spectral detectors or intricate gratings. We propose three variations of the single-mask setup, each optimized for different contrast types, offering flexibility and efficiency in a variety of applications. The versatility of this single-mask approach along with the use of befitting light transport models holds promise for broader use in clinical diagnostics and industrial inspection, making advanced X-ray imaging more accessible and cost-effective.</description>

      <title>Lens based Kinetic Inductance Detectors with Distributed Dual Polarised Absorbers for Far Infra-red Space-based Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future space-based far infra-red astronomical observations require background limited detector sensitivities and scalable focal plane array solutions to realise their vast potential in observation speed. In this work, a focal plane array of lens absorber coupled Kinetic Inductance Detectors (KIDs) is proposed to fill this role. The figures of merit and design guidelines for the proposed detector concept are derived by employing a previously developed electromagnetic spectral modelling technique. Two designs operating at central frequencies of $6.98$ and $12$ THz are studied. A prototype array of the former is fabricated, and its performance is experimentally determined and validated. Specifically, the optical coupling of the detectors to incoherent distributed sources (i.e. normalised throughput) is quantified experimentally with good agreement with the estimations provided by the model. The coupling of the lens absorber prototypes to an incident plane wave, i.e. aperture efficiency, is also indirectly validated experimentally matching the expected value of $54\%$ averaged over two polarisation. The noise equivalent power of the KIDs are also measured with limiting value of $8\times10^{-20}$ $\mathrm{W/\sqrt{Hz}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical lattices play a significant role in the field of cold atom physics, particularly in quantum simulations. Varying the lattice period is often a useful feature, but it presents the challenge of maintaining lattice phase stability in both stationary and varying-period regimes. Here, we report the realization of a feedback loop for a tunable optical lattice. Our scheme employs a CCD camera, a computer, and a piezoelectric actuator mounted on a mirror. Using this setup, we significantly improved the long-term stability of an optical lattice over durations exceeding 10 seconds. More importantly, we demonstrated a rapid change in the optical lattice period without any loss of phase.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Resolution of the Timepix4 Detector for 100 keV and 200 keV Electrons for Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have evaluated the imaging capabilities of the Timepix4 hybrid silicon pixel detector for 100 keV and 200 keV electrons in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Using the knife-edge method, we have measured the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at both energies. Our results show a decrease in MTF response at Nyquist (spatial) frequency, dropping from approximately 0.16 at 100 keV to 0.0046 at 200 keV. However, by using the temporal structure of the detected events, including the arrival time and amplitude provided by the Timepix4, we enhanced the spatial discrimination of electron arrival. This approach improved the MTF at Nyquist by factors of 2.12 for 100 keV and 3.16 for 200 keV. These findings demonstrate that the blurring effects caused by extended electron trajectories within the sensing layer can be partially corrected in the image data.</description>

      <title>Modeling frequency instability in high-quality resonant experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern resonant sensing tools can achieve increasingly high quality factors, which correspond to extremely narrow linewidths. In such systems, time-variation of the resonator's natural frequency can potentially impact its ability to accumulate power and its resulting sensitivity. One such example is the Dark SRF experiment, which utilizes superconducting radio frequency (SRF) cavities with quality factors of $Q\sim10^{10}$. Microscopic deformations of the cavity lead to stochastic jittering of its resonant frequency with amplitude 20 times its linewidth. Naively, one may expect this to lead to a large suppression in accumulated power. In this work, we study in detail the effects of frequency instability on high-quality resonant systems, utilizing the Dark SRF experiment as a case study. We show that the timescale of jittering is crucial to determining its effect on power accumulation. Namely, when the resonant frequency varies sufficiently quickly, the system accumulates power as if there were no jittering at all. This implies that the sensitivity of a jittering resonator is comparable to that of a stable resonator. In the case of Dark SRF, we find that jittering only induces a $\sim 10\%$ loss in power. Our results imply that the dark-photon exclusion bound from Dark SRF's pathfinder run can potentially be refined to be an order of magnitude stronger.</description>

Abstract: The response of Low Gain Avalanche Diodes (LGADs), a type of thin silicon detector with internal gain, to X-rays of energies between 6-16~keV was characterized at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource (SSRL). The utilized beamline at SSRL was 7-2, with a nominal beam size of 30~$\mu$m, repetition rate of 500~MHz, and with an energy dispersion $\Delta E/E$ of $10^{-4}$. Multi-channel LGADs, AC-LGADs, and TI-LGADs of different thicknesses and gain layer configurations from Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) and Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) were tested. The sensors were read out with a discrete component board and digitized with a fast oscilloscope or a CAEN fast digitizer. The devices' energy response, energy resolution, and time resolution were measured as a function of X-ray energy and position. The charge collection and multiplication mechanism were simulated using TCAD Sentaurus, and the results were compared with the collected data.</description>

      <title>Test of LGAD as Potential Next-Generation {\mu}SR Spectrometer Detectors</title>

Abstract: Muon Spin Rotation/Relaxation/Resonance ($\mu$SR) is a versatile and powerful non-destructive technology for investigating the magnetic properties of materials at the microscopic level. The $\mu$SR technique typically utilizes fully spin polarized beams of positive muons generated at particle accelerator facilities and measures the evolution of the muon spin polarization inside a sample to extract information about the local magnetic environment in materials. With the development of accelerator technologies, intensities of muon beams are being continuously improved, which will cause a pile-up problem to the $\mu$SR spectrometer. The first muon source in China, named MELODY, is currently under construction and will be a pulsed source of muons operated at a repetition frequency of only 1 Hz due to limitations of the accelerator system at CSNS. Consequently, there is a strong motivation to operate MELODY at significantly higher muon intensities. This necessitates an upgrade of the detector system inside the spectrometer, which should be smaller and faster to accommodate the increased intensity per pulse of muons. The Low Gain Avalanche Diode (LGAD), characterized by a typical pulse width of 2 ns and a segmentation size in the centimeters range, has the potential to significantly improve the counting rates of $\mu$SR spectrometers that utilize a high intensity pulsed muon source. Thus, it is expected that the LGAD detector is a promising candidate to enhance the performance of $\mu$SR spectrometers at the new MELODY muon source.To validate this, tests on the LGAD were conducted at the ISIS pulsed muon source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK. This paper will describe the setup of the candidate LGAD devices and the subsequent analysis of the experiment data.</description>

      <title>Rapid Muon Tomography for Border Security</title>

Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.</description>
