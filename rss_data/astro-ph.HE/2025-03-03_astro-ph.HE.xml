      <title>Theoretical study of Th III energy levels and transitions for applications to kilonova spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neutron star merger is a promising site of heavy element production. By producing heavy elements, the neutron star merger gives rise to a thermal transient called a kilonova. Studying kilonova spectra enables us to quantify the heavy element production. Among the heaviest elements, doubly ionized Thorium (Th, Z=90) is one of the important candidates for producing detectable absorption features in kilonova spectra. This paper investigates the atomic properties of Th III to provide energy level and transition data. The multiconfiguration Dirac-Hartree-Fock and relativistic configuration interaction methods, which are implemented in the general-purpose relativistic atomic structure package GRASP2018, are used to compute energy levels of the $\mathrm{5f6d}$, $\mathrm{6d^2}$, $\mathrm{7s^2}$, $5\mathrm{f^2}$, $\mathrm{6d7s}$, $\mathrm{5f7p}$ and $\mathrm{5f7s}$ configurations and electric dipole transitions between states of these configurations. The accuracy of energy levels is evaluated by comparing it with experimental data and with various theoretical methods. Our calculated energy levels are consistent with the experimental results with a root mean square (RMS) deviation of 436 cm$^{-1}$. The accuracy of transition data is investigated using the quantitative and qualitative evaluation method.By performing radiative transfer simulations for kilonova spectra with our transition data, we show that kilonova including Th with a mass fraction of $(3-10) \times 10^{-5}$ can produce Th III absorption features around 18,000 A.</description>

      <title>Numerical studies of (in)stabilities of shocks in perturbed advective flows around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using two dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we studied the evolution of hot advective accretion flow and its properties. In our investigation, we examined the stability properties of shocked flows around black holes upon introducing non-axisymmetric perturbations. The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) appeared in power density spectra obtained in several cases of our simulation results and their distribution is in the range 0.44 - 146.67 Hz which encompasses low- to high-frequency QPOs observed in black hole X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Photon-ALP beam propagation from Mrk 501</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very high energy (VHE, E $&gt;$ $100 \mathrm~{GeV}$) $\gamma$-ray observations offer a possibility of indirectly detecting the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs). The paper focuses on detecting photon-ALP oscillations on $\gamma$-ray spectra from distant sources in astrophysical magnetic fields. Strong evidence indicates that: (1) the photon-ALP oscillations can effectively decrease the photon absorption at energies of several tens of TeV -- caused by the extragalactic background light (EBL) -- to a level able to explain better the observational data; (2) the impact of magnetic-field models in photon-ALP beams crossing several magnetized media is significant. We revisit the expected signature for the photon-ALP oscillation effects on $\gamma-\gamma $ absorption in the TeV spectra of Mrk 501. The result issues that the photon-ALP beam propagation with mass $\mathrm{m_a}\sim10^{-10} eV$ and two-photon coupling constant $\begin{aligned}g_{a\gamma}\sim0.417\times10^{-11}GeV^{-1}\end{aligned}$ crossing reasonable magnetic field scenarios considered here can roughly reproduce the observed TeV $\gamma$-ray spectra for Mrk 501.</description>

      <title>The Chinese pulsar timing array data release I. Polarimetry for 56 millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present polarization pulse profiles for 56 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) monitored by the Chinese Pulsar Timing Array (CPTA) collaboration using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The observations centered at 1.25 GHz with a raw bandwidth of 500 MHz. Due to the high sensitivity ($\sim$16 K/Jy) of the FAST telescope and our long integration time, the high signal-to-noise ratio polarization profiles show features hardly detected before. Among 56 pulsars, the polarization profiles of PSRs J0406$+$3039, J1327$+$3423, and J2022$+$2534 were not previously reported. 80\% of MSPs in the sample show weak components below 3\% of peak flux, 25\% of pulsars show interpulse-like structures, and most pulsars show linear polarization position angle jumps. Six pulsars seem to be emitting for full rotation phase, with another thirteen pulsars being good candidates for such a 360$^\circ$ radiator. We find that the distribution of the polarization percentage in our sample is compatible with the normal pulsar distribution. Our detailed evaluation of the MSP polarization properties suggests that the wave propagation effects in the pulsar magnetosphere are important in shaping the MSP polarization pulse profiles.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 15 new pulsars at high Galactic Latitudes with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery and timing results of 15 pulsars discovered in a high Galactic latitude survey conducted with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST). The survey targeted a region as close as possible to the Galactic Center, encompassing an area near the Galactic Bulge.The newly discovered pulsars consist of eleven normal pulsars and four millisecond pulsars (MSPs). Among the MSPs, three are identified in binary systems with orbital periods of ~3.1, 4.6 and 12.5 days, respectively. We have successfully obtained coherent timing solutions for three of the normal pulsars (PSRs J1745-0059, J1746-0156 and J1800-0059). Furthermore, within our data set we found that four pulsars (three new and one known) show mode-changing and/or subpulse drifting phenomena. Comparing our discoveries with simulations of the Galactic disk and Bulge MSP populations indicates that these new pulsars are most likely located in the disk. Nonetheless, our discoveries demonstrate that deep surveys at high Galactic latitudes have significant potential to enhance our understanding of the MSP population in the direction of the Bulge.</description>

      <title>Pattern and Origin for the Extreme $\gamma$-ray Flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279: An Astrophysical Critical Damper?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a Gaussian process method to the extreme $\gamma$-ray flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279 to discover the variable patterns and then to investigate the physical origins of the giant flares. The kernels of stochastically driven damped simple harmonic oscillator (SHO), the damped random-walk (DRW), and Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 are respectively used to describe the adaptive-binning $\gamma$-ray light curves of the two flares. Our findings show that both the extreme $\gamma$-ray flares of 3C 454.3 and 3C 279 clearly prefer the SHO kernel in the over-damped mode and the Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 kernel over the DRW kernel. The resulted SHO and Mat$\acute{\rm e}$rn-3/2 power spectral densities (PSDs) are the same for each object, with the index changing from -4 at high frequencies to 0 at low frequencies. The patterns of the two flares are both approaching the critical damping mode with the quality factor Q $\approx$ 0.4 (i.e., the damping ratio $\eta \approx$ 1.25), but with slightly different damping timescales. The characteristic timescale (corresponding to the broken frequency in the PSD) for 3C 454.3 is 2-3 days and 3-5 days for 3C 279. The variable patterns found here suggest that once the system responds to the energy injection disturbance, the release of the energy in the system is finished abruptly. The obtained timescale provides a constraint on the size of energy dissipation region for each source.</description>

      <title>Probing the interstellar medium toward GRB 221009A through X-ray dust scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of 21 X-ray dust-scattering rings around the extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) 221009A provides a unique opportunity to study the interstellar medium (ISM) through which the X-ray radiation traveled in our Galaxy and, by difference, in the host galaxy as well. In particular, since the ring intensity and radius at a given time depend on the amount of dust and on its distance, respectively XMM-Newton and Swift images allowed us to map the ISM around the direction of the GRB with better resolution than in the existing optical and infrared-based 3D dust maps, both in the plane of the sky (few arcminutes) and along the line of sight (from $\simeq 1$ pc for dust clouds within 1 kpc to $\simeq 100$ pc for structures at distances larger than 10 kpc). As a consequence, we can revise prior estimates of the GRB soft X-ray fluence, obtaining a $\sim$35\% lower value, which, however, still indicates a substantial excess with respect to the extrapolation of the spectral models constrained by hard X-ray observations.
  Additionally, we detect significant spectral variability in two azimuthal sectors of the X-ray rings, which can be fully attributed to different Galactic absorption in these two directions. The comparison of the total hydrogen column density inferred from spectral fitting, with the Galactic contribution derived from the intensity of the X-ray rings, in the same sectors, allowed us to more robustly constrain the absorption in the host galaxy to $N_{\rm{H,z=0.151}}= (3.7\pm0.3)\,\times\,10^{21}\,\rm{cm^{-2}}$. This result is relevant not only to characterize the ISM of the host galaxy and to understand how the GRB radiation might have affected it, but also to model the broad-band spectrum of the GRB afterglow and to constrain the properties of a possible underlying supernova.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of spider system's observables from orbital period modulations via the Applegate mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redback and black widow pulsars are two classes of peculiar binary systems characterized by very short orbital periods, very low mass companions, and, in several cases, regular eclipses in their pulsed radio signal. Long-term timing revealed systematic but unpredictable variations in the orbital period, which can most likely be explained by the so-called Applegate mechanism. This relies on the magnetic dynamo activity generated inside the companion star and triggered by the pulsar wind, which induces a modification of the star's oblateness (or quadrupole variation). This, in turn, couples with the orbit by gravity, causing a consequent change in the orbital period. The Applegate description limits to provide estimates of physical quantities by highlighting their orders of magnitude. Therefore, we derive the time-evolution differential equations underlying the Applegate model, that is, we track such physical quantities in terms of time. Our strategy is to employ the orbital period modulations, measured by fitting the observational data, and implementing a highly accurate approximation scheme to finally reconstruct the dynamics of the spider system under study and the relative observables. Among the latter is the magnetic field activity inside the companion star, which is still a matter of debate for its complex theoretical modeling and the ensuing expensive numerical simulations. As an application, we exploit our methodology to examine two spider sources: 47 Tuc W (redback) and 47 Tuc O (black widow). The results obtained are analyzed and then discussed with the literature.</description>

      <title>When resonances kick in: the cumulative effect of orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital resonances in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) have been proven to be a key feature for accurate gravitational-wave template modeling. Decades of research have led to schemes that can not only model the adiabatic inspiral of such a binary system, but also account for the effects of resonances on their evolution. In this work, we use an effective resonance model that includes analytically derived corrections to the radiation reaction fluxes, to study the combined effects of both dominant and sub-dominant resonances on EMRIs. We show that using single, universal shifts for all fluxes overestimates the resonance impact, and therefore individualized shifts for each resonance crossing are needed for accurate modeling. Our analysis reveals that the cumulative effects from multiple resonance crossings can significantly impact the orbital evolution of the EMRIs, especially for highly eccentric orbits. Our results provide further evidence that resonance effects have to be included in template production to extract detailed astrophysical parameters from EMRI signals.</description>

      <title>Highly Variable Magnetic Pressure-Driven YSO Jets in the Polar Cavity from Toroidal Fields Generated by Inner Disk Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jets and outflows are commonly observed in young stellar objects (YSOs), yet their origins remain debated. Using 3D non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a circumstellar disk threaded by a large-scale open poloidal magnetic field, we identify three components in the disk-driven outflow: (1) a fast, collimated jet, (2) a less collimated, slower laminar disk wind, and (3) a magneto-rotational instability (MRI)-active disk wind that separates the former two. At high altitudes, the MRI-active wind merges with the laminar disk wind, leaving only the jet and disk wind as distinct components. The jet is powered by a novel mechanism: a lightly mass-loaded outflow driven primarily by toroidal magnetic pressure in the low-density polar funnel near the system's rotation axis. A geometric analysis of the magnetic field structure confirms that magnetic tension does not contribute to the outflow acceleration, with magnetic pressure acting as the dominant driver. While the outflow in our model shares similarities with the classical magneto-centrifugal model-such as angular momentum extraction from the accreting disk-centrifugal forces play a negligible role in jet acceleration. In particular, the flow near the jet base does not satisfy the conditions for magneto-centrifugal wind launching. Additionally, the jet in our simulation exhibits strong spatial and temporal variability. These differences challenge the applicability of rotation-outflow velocity relations derived from steady-state, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal jet models for estimating the jet's launching radius. For the slower disk wind, vertical motion is primarily driven by toroidal magnetic pressure, while centrifugal forces widen the wind's opening angle near its base.</description>

      <title>On the Extremely X-ray Variable Active Galactic Nuclei in the XMM-LSS Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of extremely X-ray variable active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the $\approx 5.3~{\rm deg}^2$ XMM-SERVS XMM-LSS region. Eight variable AGNs are identified with rest-frame 2 keV flux density variability amplitudes around 6-12. We comprehensively analyze the X-ray and multiwavelength data to probe the origin of their extreme X-ray variability. It is found that their extreme X-ray variability can be ascribed to changing accretion state or changing obscuration from dust-free absorbers. For five AGNs, their X-ray variability is attributed to changing accretion state, supported by contemporaneous multiwavelength variability and the absence of X-ray absorption in the low-state spectra. With new Multiple Mirror Telescope (MMT) spectra for four of these sources, we confirm one changing-look AGN. One MMT AGN lacks multi-epoch spectroscopic observations, while the other two AGNs do not exhibit changing-look behavior, likely because the MMT observations did not capture their high states. The X-ray variability of the other three AGNs is explained by changing obscuration, and they show only mild long-term optical/IR variability. The absorbers of these sources are likely clumpy accretion-disk winds, with variable column densities and covering factors along the lines of sight.</description>

      <title>Resummed multi-line gamma-ray spectra for Cherenkov Telescopes from heavy spin-1 dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electroweakly interacting stable spin-1 particle in the $(1-10)$ TeV mass range can be a dark matter candidate with rich testability. In particular, one or even two gamma-ray line-like features are expected to be a smoking-gun signature for indirect detection in this scenario. The presence of large Sudakov logarithmic corrections, though, significantly complicates the theoretical prediction of the gamma-ray spectrum. We resum these corrections at the next-to-leading-log (NLL) accuracy using Soft-Collinear Effective field Theory (SCET). Rather interestingly, we find that the LL- and NLL-resummed endpoint spectra for this model are, up to an overall factor, identical to already existing calculations in the contexts of spin-$0$ and spin-$1/2$ (i.e. wino-like) scenarios. We discuss how this non-trivial "exact universality" irrespective of DM spin at these accuracies comes about despite the completely different SCET operator bases. Our resummations allow us to reduce the uncertainty, demonstrated in the energy spectrum with distinctive two peaks from annihilations into $\gamma \gamma, Z \gamma$ channel and a photon with $Z_2$-even extra heavy neutral boson $Z'$. We discuss the prospect of improving accuracy further, which is crucial for the heavier DM mass region and realistic resolution in future gamma-ray observations.</description>

      <title>Does the 220 PeV Event at KM3NeT Point to New Physics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT collaboration recently reported the observation of KM3-230213A, a neutrino event with an energy exceeding 100 PeV, more than an order of magnitude higher than the most energetic neutrino in IceCube's catalog. Given its longer data-taking period and larger effective area relative to KM3NeT, IceCube should have observed events around that energy. This tension has recently been quantified to lie between $2\sigma$ and $3.5\sigma$, depending on the neutrino source. A $\mathscr{O}(100)$ PeV neutrino detected at KM3NeT has traversed approximately $147$ km of rock and sea en route to the detector, whereas neutrinos arriving from the same location in the sky would have only traveled through about $14$ km of ice before reaching IceCube. We use this difference in propagation distance to address the tension between KM3NeT and IceCube. Specifically, we consider a scenario in which the source emits sterile neutrinos that partially convert to active neutrinos through oscillations. We scrutinize two such realizations, one where a new physics matter potential induces a resonance in sterile-to-active transitions and another one where off-diagonal neutrino non-standard interactions are employed. In both cases, sterile-to-active neutrino oscillations become relevant at length scales of $\sim100$ km, resulting in increased active neutrino flux near the KM3NeT detector, alleviating the tension between KM3NeT and IceCube. Overall, we propose the exciting possibility that neutrino telescopes may have started detecting new physics.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the curvature and some properties of the neutron star</title>

Abstract: According to the general theory of relativity, a massive body induces curvature in the surrounding spacetime. In this study, the surface curvature (SC) of neutron stars is computed using various curvature quantities derived from the relativistic mean-field, density-dependent RMF, and Skyrme-Hartree-Fock equations of states. Neutron star properties, including mass, radius, compactness, and central density, are calculated utilizing the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. The analysis reveals a significant cubic correlation between the SC and compactness for the canonical 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star, with a correlation coefficient of 0.99, indicating an almost linear relationship. A similarly significant inverse cubic correlation is observed between the SC and the radius of the canonical star. However, these correlations diminish for the maximum mass NS. Furthermore, a universal relation between the SC and the dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) for the canonical neutron star is established. Using the tidal deformability constraint of GW170817 ($\Lambda_{1.4} = 190_{-120}^{+390}$), the surface curvature is limited to SC$_{1.4} (10^{14}) = 2.87^{+0.30}_{-0.78}$ at a confidence level 90\%. Furthermore, the tidal deformability constraint of the secondary component in the GW190814 event ($\Lambda_{1.4} = 616_{-158}^{+273}$) offers a more stringent limit, with the result of SC$_{1.4} (10^{14}) = 2.03^{+0.27}_{-0.36}$. These findings indicate that the GW190814 event imposes more rigorous constraints on SC compared to GW170817.</description>

      <title>Simulations of Interacting Binary Systems -- Pathways to Radio Bright GRB Progenitors</title>

Abstract: Although the association of gamma-ray bursts with massive stellar death is on firm footing, the nature of the progenitor system and the key ingredients required for a massive star to produce a gamma-ray burst remain open questions. Here, we investigate the evolution of a massive star with a closely orbiting black hole using the stellar evolution code \textsc{MESA}. In particular, we examine how the companion influences the angular momentum of the massive star as it evolves over its lifetime under a range of orbital periods where the tidal effects are significant. We consider dependence on stellar metallicity, mass ratio, initial stellar spin, as well as accretion and dynamo prescriptions while tracking the mass loss and angular momentum in the simulations. We conclude that massive star-black hole binary systems with low metallicity massive stars under an initial orbital period range of $\sim$20-50 days may be viable GRB progenitors with post-collapse black hole masses of 5-10 $M_\odot$ and a black hole spin parameter $\geq 0.5$.</description>

      <title>Exploring hidden priors when interpreting gravitational wave and electromagnetic probes of the nuclear equation of state</title>

Abstract: The wide range of sub- and super-nuclear densities achieved in neutron stars makes them ideal probes of dense nuclear behavior in the form of the nuclear equation of state (EoS). Studying neutron stars both in isolation and in highly dynamic events, many recent observations, most famously the gravitational wave and electromagnetic signals associated with the BNS merger GW170817/AT2017gfo, have provided suggestive insight into these highest nuclear densities. Measurements of galactic neutron star masses and radii from NICER and other radio and X-ray measurements provide critical complementary perspectives, bounding other features of the EoS. Though nominally congruent, in this paper we highlight many underappreciated "hidden" priors embedded in joint analysis of these many messengers, and their systematic impact on joint EoS inference. In this work, we perform a careful step-by-step Bayesian inference using a simple low-dimensional parametric EoS model, incrementally adding information from galactic pulsars, gravitational wave sources, and more speculative constraints involving kilonovae and the neutron star maximum mass. At each stage, we carefully discuss the marginal likelihood, explaining how hidden priors impact conclusions. Conversely, we also quantify how much information these measurements have, arguing that many if not most have minimal impact relative to the explicit and hidden prior assumptions. Specifically, we find two features dominate our inference: on the one hand, the choice of EoS parameterization and particularly hyperprior, and on the other the astrophysical priors associated with interpreting events, particularly the multimessenger source GW170817. In an appendix, we outline a simple semianalytic projection suitable for assessing the measurability of the EoS with ensembles of present and future detections.</description>

      <title>Breaking into the window of primordial black hole dark matter with x-ray microlensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) in the mass range $10^{-16}-10^{-11}~M_\odot$ may constitute all the dark matter. We show that gravitational microlensing of bright x-ray pulsars provide the most robust and immediately implementable opportunity to uncover PBH dark matter in this mass window. As proofs of concept, we show that the currently operational NICER telescope can probe this window near $10^{-14}~M_\odot$ with just two months of exposure on the x-ray pulsar SMC-X1, and that the forthcoming STROBE-X telescope can probe complementary regions in only a few weeks. These times are comparable to the week-long exposures obtained by NICER on various individual sources. We take into account the effects of wave optics and the finite extent of the source, which become important for the mass range of our PBHs. We also provide a spectral diagnostic to distinguish microlensing from transient background events and to broadly mark the PBH mass if true microlensing events are observed. In light of the powerful science case, i.e., the imminent discovery of dark matter searchable over multiple decades of PBH masses with achievable exposures, we strongly urge the commission of a dedicated large broadband telescope for x-ray microlensing. We derive the microlensing reach of such a telescope by assuming sensitivities of detector components of proposed missions, and find that with hard x-ray pulsar sources PBH masses down to a few $10^{-17}~M_\odot$ can be probed.</description>

      <title>PSR J1922+37: a 1.9-second pulsar discovered in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: More than 300 pulsars have been discovered in Galactic globular clusters; however, none have been found in open clusters. Here we present results from 20-hour pulsar searching observations in seven open clusters with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Our first discovery is a 1.9-second pulsar (J1922+37) found in the direction of the old open cluster NGC 6791. The measured dispersion measure (DM) implies a distance of 4.79 kpc and 8.92 kpc based on the NE2001 and YMW16 electron density models, respectively. Given the large uncertainty of DM distance estimates, it is likely that PSR J1922+37 is indeed a member of NGC 6791, for which the distance is $4.19\pm0.02$ kpc based on Gaia Data Release 3. If confirmed, PSR J1922+37 will be the first pulsar found in Galactic open clusters. We outline future observations that can confirm this pulsar-open cluster association and discuss the general prospects of finding pulsars in open clusters.</description>

      <title>IXPE detection of highly polarized X-rays from the magnetar 1E 1841-045</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) observed for the first time highly polarized X-ray emission from the magnetar 1E 1841-045, targeted after a burst-active phase in August 2024. To date, IXPE has observed four other magnetars during quiescent periods, highlighting substantially different polarization properties. 1E 1841-045 exhibits a high, energy-dependent polarization degree, which increases monotonically from ~15% at 2-3 keV up to ~55% at 5.5-8 keV, while the polarization angle, aligned with the celestial North, remains fairly constant. The broadband spectrum (2-79 keV) obtained by combining simultaneous IXPE and NuSTAR data is well modeled by a blackbody and two power-law components. The unabsorbed 2-8 keV flux (~2E-11 erg/cm2/s) is about 10% higher than that obtained from archival XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations. The polarization of the soft, thermal component does not exceed ~25%, and may be produced by a condensed surface or a bombarded atmosphere. The intermediate power law is polarized at around 30%, consistent with predictions for resonant Compton scattering in the star magnetosphere; while, the hard power law exhibits a polarization degree exceeding 65%, pointing to a synchrotron/curvature origin.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics and dissipation in the binary magnetosphere of pre-merger neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate energy release in the interacting magnetospheres of binary neutron stars (BNSs) with global 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations. The system dynamics depend on the inclinations $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ of the stars' magnetic dipole moments relative to their orbital angular momentum. The simplest aligned configuration ($\chi_1=\chi_2=0^\circ$) has no magnetic field lines connecting the two stars. Remarkably, it still develops separatrix current sheets warping around each star and a dissipative region at the interface of the two magnetospheres. A Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH)-type instability drives significant dissipation at the magnetospheric interface, generating local Alfv\'enic turbulence and escaping fast magnetosonic waves. Binaries with inclined magnetospheres release energy in two ways: via KH instability at the interface and via magnetic reconnection flares in the twisted flux bundles connecting the companions. Outgoing compressive waves occur in a broad range of BNS parameters, possibly developing shocks and sourcing fast radio bursts. We discuss implications for X-ray and radio precursors of BNS mergers.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested disk flux eruption events to describe SgrA* flares</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Magnetically arrested disks are among the most suitable candidates for describing the gas accretion and observed emission in the vicinity of supermassive black holes. Aims. This work aims to provide a direct correlation between the quasi-periodic flux eruption events, characteristic of MAD accretion disk simulations, and the observed flaring behavior in the Galactic center. Methods. We employ a MAD accretion disk with a distinct counter-clockwise rotation and investigate the evolution of magnetized flux tubes generated during a prominent flux eruption event. Although these flux tubes demonstrate a clockwise pattern, they experience significant dragging by the accretion disk's rotation. This study models the motion of hot spots, formed on the disk's equatorial plane due to magnetic reconnection, as they travel along the magnetized flux tubes at a fraction of the speed of light. Results. Hot spots with a relativistic ejection velocity are able to balance out the counter-clockwise dragging of the flux tube's foot-point on the disk and demonstrate a clockwise motion in the sky, that is in good agreement with the NIR flares in the Galactic center. In addition, our flare models favor face-on inclinations in the range $[0^\circ, 34^\circ]$ and $[163^\circ, 180^\circ]$ for SgrA*. Conclusions. The flux eruption events that arise naturally in the MAD accretion state provide a promising framework for reproducing the observed flaring behavior in the vicinity of SgrA*.</description>

Abstract: The mass and the spin of accreting and jetted black holes, at the center of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), can be probed by analyzing their electromagnetic spectra. For this purpose, we use the Spin-Modified Fundamental Plane of black hole activity, which non-linearly connects the following four variables (in the source frame): radio luminosity, X-ray or optical luminosity (via the [OIII] emission line), black hole mass and spin. Taking into account the uncertainties in luminosity measurements, conversion factors, relativistic beaming and physical properties of the AGN system, we derive lower bounds on the spins of a group of heavy, jetted AGNs. Using these results, we study the direct implications on the mass spectrum of the ultra-light particles of scalar (axion-like), vector (dark photon) and tensor types (additional spin-2 particles). We close unexplored gap in the parameter space $10^{-20}-10^{-19}$eV. We obtain upper bounds on the axion decay constant (equivalently lower bounds on the self-interaction strength) considering self-interactions could prevent the axion particles entering the instability, and be the reason for non-observation of superradiance. Assuming axion/scalar is described by mass and decay constant, we obtain upper limits on what fraction of dark matter can be formed by ultra-light particles and find that single spieces axion-like light particle can constitute at most $10\%$ of the dark matter in the mass range: $ 10^{-21} &lt; \mu \, (\mathrm{eV}) &lt; 10^{-17}$. Moreover, we derive similar bounds for vector and spin-2 particles and find that light vector fields can constitute at most $10^{-6}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-21}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range, and light spin-2 fields can constitute at most $10^{-9}$ of the dark matter in $10^{-23}\, \mathrm{eV} &lt; \mu &lt; 10^{-17} \, \mathrm{eV}$ range.</description>

      <title>Identifying thermal effects in neutron star merger remnants with model-agnostic waveform reconstructions and third-generation detectors</title>

Abstract: We probe the intrinsic differences in simulated gravitational-wave signals from binary neutron star (BNS) mergers, arising from varying approaches to incorporating thermal effects in numerical-relativity modeling. We consider a hybrid approach in which the equation of state (EOS) comprises a cold, zero-temperature, piecewise-polytropic part and a thermal part described by an ideal gas, and a {\it tabulated} approach based on self-consistent, microphysical, finite-temperature EOS. We use time-domain waveforms corresponding to BNS merger simulations with four different EOSs. Those are injected into Gaussian noise given by the sensitivity of the third-generation detector Einstein Telescope and reconstructed using BayesWave, a Bayesian data-analysis algorithm that recovers the signals through a model-agnostic approach. The two representations of thermal effects result in different dominant peak frequencies in the spectra of the postmerger signals, for both the quadrupole fundamental mode and the late-time inertial modes. For some of the EOSs investigated those differences are large enough to be told apart, especially in the early postmerger phase when the signal amplitude is the loudest. Our results suggest that a self-consistent treatment of thermal effects in BNS postmerger modeling is essential to prevent significant parameter biases in upcoming gravitational-wave detections.</description>

      <title>SpectrAx: Spectral Search of Axion-Like Particles Using Multi-Band Observations of Galaxy Clusters from SKA, SO, CMB-S4 and eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of axions or Axion-Like Particles (ALPs) has been predicted by various Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories, and the proposed photon-ALP interaction is one of the ways to probe them. Such an interaction will lead to photon-ALP resonant conversion in galaxy clusters, resulting in a polarized spectral distortion in the CMB along the cluster line of sight. The estimation of this signal from galaxy clusters requires an estimation of their electron density and magnetic field profiles, as well as their redshifts. We have developed a new Bayesian framework \texttt{SpectrAx} that can use observations from different electromagnetic bands such as radio, CMB, optical, and X-ray to infer the astrophysical properties of a galaxy cluster, such as cluster its redshift, electron density and magnetic field, along with the BSM physics such as ALPs. We use simulated redshifts in our analysis, but that can be obtained by cross-matching with optical surveys having overlapping sky regions with the galaxy clusters. Also, we use radial profiles that are motivated from observations of galaxy clusters at low redshifts. By using the simulated data corresponding to the ALP mass of $10^{-14}$ eV for upcoming CMB surveys such as Simons Observatory (SO) and CMB-S4 in combination with Square Kilometer Array (SKA) and extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) we demonstrate the capability in accurately inferring the ALPs coupling strength along with the radial profile of electron density and magnetic field from galaxy clusters. The application of this framework to the data from future surveys by combining SKA+SO+eROSITA and SKA+CMB-S4+eROSITA will make it possible for the first time to explore both astrophysics and BSM physics from low-redshift galaxy clusters using a multi-band approach.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>

Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight bosons. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we focus on the superradiance of a scalar boson, and perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modeled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

      <title>From Supernovae to Neutron Stars: A Systematic Approach to Axion Production at Finite Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10945</link>

Abstract: We present a systematic study of QCD axion production in environments with finite baryon density and temperature, implying significant changes to axion phenomenology. Within heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory, we derive the effective Lagrangian describing axion interactions with nucleons and mesons up to next-to-leading-order in the chiral expansion. We focus on corrections to the axion-nucleon couplings from higher orders and finite density. These couplings are modified by up to an order of magnitude near nuclear saturation density, significantly impacting axion production in supernovae and neutron stars. Density-dependent corrections enhance the axion luminosity in supernovae by an order of magnitude, strengthening current best bounds by a factor of three. We stress the importance of including all axion production channels up to a given chiral order for a consistent luminosity calculation and classify the missing contributions up to the third chiral order. The modified axion-nucleon couplings also affect neutron star cooling rates via axion emission. A re-evaluation of existing neutron star cooling bounds, constrained to regions where perturbative control is reliable, weakens these bounds by a factor of four. Lastly, our results have implications for terrestrial axion searches that rely on precise knowledge of axion-nucleon couplings.</description>

      <title>An upper limit on the frequency of short-period black hole companions to Sun-like stars</title>

Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes descend from high-mass stars, most of which had stellar binary companions. However, the number of those binary systems that survive the binary evolution and black hole formation is uncertain by multiple orders of magnitude. The survival rate is particularly uncertain for massive stars with low-mass companions, which are thought to be the progenitors of most black hole X-ray binaries. We present a search for close black hole companions (separations less than 20 solar radii) to AFGK-type stars in TESS, i.e. the non-accreting counterparts to and progenitors of low-mass X-ray binaries. Such black holes can be detected by the tidally induced ellipsoidal deformation of the visible star, and the ensuing photometric light-curve variations. From an initial sample of 4.7 million TESS stars, we have selected 457 candidates for such variations. However, spectroscopic followup of 250 of them shows that none are consistent with a close black hole companion. On the basis of this non-detection, we determine (2 $\sigma$ confidence) that fewer than one in $10^5$ Solar-type stars in the Solar neighbourhood host a short-period black hole companion. This upper limit is in tension with a number of ``optimistic'' population models in the literature that predict short-period black hole companions around one in $10^{4-5}$ stars. Our limits are still consistent with other models that predict only a few in $10^{7-8}$.</description>
