      <title>Non-invasive Assessment of Pancreatic Duct Hypertension Using Computational Flow Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive inflammatory disease frequently associated with severe, treatment-resistant abdominal pain, which is hypothesized to result from pancreatic ductal hypertension (PDH) secondary to ductal strictures or obstructions. However, direct measurement of pancreatic duct pressure (PDP) remains technically demanding and invasive, thereby significantly limiting its routine clinical application. Here, we propose and validate a novel, non-invasive approach for estimating PDP. The method integrates patient-specific magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) imaging with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling. Three-dimensional ductal models reconstructed from MRCP data enabled simulation of intraductal pressure distributions with high anatomical fidelity. The simulated pressure gradients showed strong correlation with in vivo measurements obtained via endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), as well as with clinical outcomes such as pain relief following ductal decompression. To improve clinical usability, we developed a quasi-one-dimensional analytical model that accurately predicted PDP from ductal geometry and flow parameters, showing strong concordance with CFD results. These findings establish the feasibility and clinical relevance of MRCP-based PDP estimation, and underscore its potential as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting PDH and informing therapeutic decisions in patients with CP.</description>

      <title>Dosimetric Evaluation of MapCHECK in MapPHAN for Conformal Arc SABR Quality Assurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the sensitivity and specificity of the MapCHECK phantom housed in MapPHAN to errors in conformal arc Stereotactic Ablative Body Radiotherapy (SABR). A specific focus is applied to Organ At Risk (OAR) dosimetry. Multi-Leaf Collimator (MLC) class shift errors up to 2 mm, and isocentre shift errors of up to 1 mm, were introduced to 23 simulated 6 MV X-ray conformal arc lung SABR plans in Raystation. Overall, 198 plans were delivered on a Varian Clinac iX linear accelerator to an in-house modified MapCHECK in MapPHAN. Gamma analysis was used to compare the MapCHECK measurements to the simulated Raystation plans. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were generated from these results to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the measurement technique to the introduced errors. For MapCHECK in MapPHAN, a combination of 5%/1 mm with 95% gamma tolerance and 2%/1 mm with 90% tolerance provides good sensitivity and specificity for Quality Assurance (QA) of conformal arc SABR plans.</description>

      <title>T2 Radiomic Features Are More Sensitive Than Mean T2 for Cartilage Load Response: A Stress MRI Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: To assess response-to-loading in a human cadaveric knee joint model under different loading conditions before and after meniscectomy
  Design: In this prospective study, stress magnetic resonance imaging was performed using an MR-compatible loading device and quantitative T2 mapping in unloaded (UL), 0${\deg}$ neutrally loaded (LN) and 10${\deg}$ varus loaded (LV) condition before and after meniscectomy. Mean T2 values and four radiomic texture parameters were assessed within the cartilage of medial femur (MF) and medial tibia (MT) for all conditions.
  Results: Medial joint space width decreased from UL to LN to LV and after meniscectomy (all p&lt;0.05). T2 values did not show any significant dependency on pressure or meniscectomy (all p&gt;0.05). The radiomic parameter variance could assess loading induced textural T2 changes in the MF (UL vs. LN: p=0.042; UL vs. LV: p&lt;0.001; LN vs. LV: p=0.022), and, in part, in the MT (LN vs. LV: p&lt;0.013). Meniscectomy did not significantly alter the T2 mean values or radiomic parameters, respectively.
  Conclusions: T2-based radiomic features were more sensitive to assess cartilage response to loading than T2-mapping alone.</description>

      <title>Technical Note: Low-Dose Simulation for Grating-Based X-Ray Dark-Field Radiography Using a Virtually Decreased Irradiation Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: X-ray dark-field radiography uses small-angle scattering to visualize the structural integrity of lung alveoli. To study the influence of dose reduction on clinical dark-field radiographs, one can simulate low-dose images by virtually reducing the irradiated area. However, these simulations can exhibit stripe artifacts. Purpose: Validation of the low-dose simulation algorithm reported by Schick &amp; Bast et al., PLoS ONE, 2024. Furthermore, we want to demonstrate that stripe artifacts observed in simulated images at very low-dose levels are introduced by limitations of the algorithm and would not appear in actual low-dose dark-field images. Methods: Dark-field radiographs of an anthropomorphic chest phantom were acquired at different tube currents equaling different radiation doses. Based on the measurement with a high radiation dose, dark-field radiographs corresponding to lower radiation doses were simulated by virtually reducing the irradiated area. The simulated low-dose radiographs were evaluated by a quantitative comparison of the dark-field signal using different regions of interests. Results: Dark-field radiographs acquired at one quarter of the standard dose were artifact-free. The dark-field signal differed from the simulated radiographs by up to 10%. Algorithm-induced stripe artifacts decrease the image quality of the simulated radiographs. Conclusions: Virtually reducing the irradiation area is a simple approach to generate low-dose radiographs based on images acquired with scanning-based dark-field radiography. However, as the algorithm creates stripe artifacts in the dark-field images, particularly at higher dose reductions, that are not present in measured low-dose images, simulated images have reduced image quality compared to their measured counterparts.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-spectral model of elastic-wave propagation through toothed-whale head anatomy, and implications for biosonar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sound-localization and, in particular, biosonar system of toothed whales is exceptionally performant. How this is achieved is not clear, given that: (i) toothed whales have no pinnae; (ii) while their auditory pathways have been studied in detail, no specific feature apparently replacing the pinna has been identified. In this study, we employ a pseudo-spectral time domain (PSTD) numerical scheme to model three-dimensional elastic wave propagation through a toothed-whale head including soft tissues. Computed tomography (CT) scans were utilized to build a three-dimensional velocity-density model of the specimen's head, parametrized on a high-resolution $1.11$ mm voxel grid. We first validate our wave propagation solver, identifying a range of frequencies and spatial scale lengths where the PSTD scheme captures the complexities of elastic wave propagation through toothed-whale anatomy. We next focus on the toothed whale's ability to locate sources on the median plane, where the role of anatomy is crucial. A 45 kHz central frequency burst (dolphin-like click) was modeled and directed at elevation angles from $-90^\circ$ to $+90^\circ$ in $5^\circ$ steps along the midsagittal plane. We find that the incoming sound can be localized, via correlation, from the reverberated portion of the time-domain waveforms recorded at the tympano-periotic complex locations.</description>

      <title>Thermally Drawn Bioelectric Catheters: Enabling Proprioceptive Endovascular Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To navigate medical instruments safely and accurately inside a patient's vascular tree, combining X-ray fluoroscopy with intermittent contrast injections is the gold standard. However, prolonged exposure to ionizing radiation poses health risks, necessitates the use of cumbersome lead vests for the clinicians, and contrast injections can lead to acute kidney injury in patients. Bioelectric Navigation, a non-fluoroscopic tracking modality, aims to provide an alternative. It uses weak electric currents to detect local anatomical features in the vasculature and localize instruments without x-ray imaging. In this work, we advance Bioelectric Navigation on two frontiers. Firstly, we introduce a new class of bespokely designed electrode catheters. They are fabricated using 3D printing, thermal drawing, and laser micro-machining. Specifically, we manufacture a 6 Fr catheter incorporating 16 electrodes, a guidewire channel and an additional sensor compartment. We thoroughly assess the catheter's mechanical and electrical properties. Secondly, we introduce an algorithm to localize the catheter along the centerline of a vascular phantom, for the first time fusing electric detection of vascular geometry with electric distance estimation. We report both tracking accuracy and usability evaluated by an expert endovascular surgeon, demonstrating the strong potential of this technology for integration into the existing clinical workflow.</description>

      <title>Kinetic-Diffusion-Rotation Algorithm for Dose Estimation in Electron Beam Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are state-of-the-art when it comes to dosimetric computations in radiotherapy. However, the execution time of these methods suffers in high-collisional regimes. We address this problem by introducing a kinetic-diffusion particle tracing scheme. This algorithm, first proposed in the context of neutral transport in fusion energy, relies on explicit simulation of the kinetic motion in low-collisional regimes and dynamically switches to motion based on a random walk in high-collisional regimes. The random walk motion maintains the first two moments (mean and variance) of the kinetic motion. We derive an analytic formula for the mean kinetic motion and discuss the addition of a multiple scattering distribution to the algorithm. In contrast to neutral transport, the radiation transfer setting does not readily admit to an analytical expression for the variance of the kinetic motion, and we therefore resort to the use of a lookup table. We test the algorithm for dosimetric computations in radiation therapy on a 2D CT scan of a lung patient. Using a simple particle model, our Python implementation of the algorithm is nearly 33 times faster than an equivalent kinetic simulation at the cost of a small modeling error.</description>
