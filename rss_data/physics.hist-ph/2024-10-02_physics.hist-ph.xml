      <title>The Interaction of Matter and Radiation: The Physics of C.V. Raman, S.N. Bose and M.N. Saha. Part 1: Historical Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three extraordinary physics discoveries were made from colonial India, which did not have any previous tradition of research in modern physics: Saha ionization equation (1920), Bose statistics (1924), Raman effect (1928). All the three discoverers were founding faculty members of the new small physics department of Calcutta University, which started functioning from 1916. These discoveries were all in the general topic of interaction between matter and radiation. In Part 1 of this article, we describe the social and the intellectual environment in which these discoveries were made. Part 2 will focus on the science involved in these discoveries.</description>

Abstract: Three extraordinary physics discoveries were made from colonial India, which did not have any previous tradition of research in modern physics: Saha ionization equation (1920), Bose statistics (1924), Raman effect (1928). All the three discoverers were founding faculty members of the new small physics department of Calcutta University, which started functioning from 1916. These discoveries were all in the general topic of interaction between matter and radiation. In Part 1, we have described the social and the intellectual environment in which these discoveries were made. Now, in Part 2, we shall first give a background of the revolutionary developments taking place in physics at that time. Then we shall provide a non-technical account of the three discoveries and point out the kind of impact these discoveries made in the subsequent development of physics.</description>

      <title>A translation of L. Euler's " Examination of an artifice for propelling a ship by the principle of internal motion"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following translation of Leonhard Euler's "Examination of an Artifice for Propelling a Ship by the Principle of Internal Motion," originally published in 1750, offers a glimpse into a fascinating historical debate in the field of mechanics. This work critically examines a proposal by Jacob Bernoulli, one of the foremost mathematicians of the 17th century, who suggested that a ship could be propelled by forces entirely confined within the vessel itself-a concept that contradicts the principles of classical mechanics. This translation is intended to make Euler's insights accessible to a modern audience, highlighting the enduring relevance of these foundational principles. The commentary provided offers context and clarification, drawing parallels between Euler's work and contemporary understandings of mechanics. By examining the arguments of two of the greatest minds in the history of science, readers are invited to appreciate the depth and precision of classical mechanics as it was developed during the Enlightenment.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Jacob Bernoulli's Ship Propulsion Artifice: Euler's Analysis and Critique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work examines and compares the approaches of Jacob Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler to the problem of ship propulsion generated by internal forces. Jacob Bernoulli's analysis, developed in the late 17th century, relies on geometric interpretations and algebraic relationships to estimate the impulse exerted by a pendulum within a ship. His results, however, are shown to overestimate the force by scaling it with the height of fall rather than the velocity at the end of the fall and by amplifying it with a time dependence factor that proves to be erroneous. Euler's subsequent analysis, conducted nearly 50 years later, provides a more rigorous and mechanically sound treatment of the problem. Utilizing differential equations and a deeper understanding of the principles of motion, Euler demonstrates that no net motion can be generated by internal forces alone, thus refuting the concept of perpetual motion as proposed by Jacob Bernoulli. By comparing the two methodologies, this work highlights the evolution of mathematical and physical analysis from the intuitive but flawed approaches of the early calculus pioneers to the more precise and reliable methods established by later mathematicians. Euler's work not only corrects the errors in Jacob Bernoulli's analysis but also solidifies the understanding that propulsion requires external forces, a conclusion consistent with the laws of Newtonian mechanics.</description>

      <title>The Epistemology of Contemporary Physics: Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the first of a series of papers that we intend to publish about the epistemology of fundamental physics in its current state. One of the main objectives of these papers is to improve our understanding of fundamental physics (and modern physics in particular) from an epistemological and interpretative perspective (i.e. versus formal perspective). Another main objective is to investigate and assess the merit of searching for a unified physical theory (the so-called ``theory of everything'') considering the fact that contemporary physics is a collection of theories created and developed by different individuals and groups of scientists in different eras of history reflecting different levels of scientific, philosophical and epistemological development and dealing with largely separate physical phenomena and hence such unification may mean ``stitching together'' an inhomogeneous collection of theoretical structures which may be clumsy (if not impossible) at least from an epistemological viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the second edition of "The Supersymmetric World"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first Edition of this book was released in 2000, just before the symposium ``Thirty Years of Supersymmetry'' was held at the William I. Fine Theoretical Physics Institute (FTPI) of the University of Minnesota. Founders and trailblazers of supersymmetry descended on FTPI, as well as a large crowd of younger theorists deeply involved in research in this area. Since then 23 years have elapsed and significant changes happened in supersymmetry (SUSY). Its history definitely needs an update. Such an update is presented below. The Second Edition of the revised collection will be released in 2024.</description>

      <title>Richard Kirwan a [united] Irish man of science in Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries have long been considered as a formative period for modern Irish political traditions such as nationalism, republicanism and unionism. For Europe it was the time of a turnover in science moving from observation to experiment and from speculation to fact. Richard Kirwan was a well known natural philosopher in Europe and a respected man of science in his time. Throughout all the wars, he was connected with his colleagues in a network reaching across Europe and even to America. Using a few examples, this article is intended to provide an insight how the network worked in a time that was marked by political conflicts and revolutionary events in both science and social life.</description>
