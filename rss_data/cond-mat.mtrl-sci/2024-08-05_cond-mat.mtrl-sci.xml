      <title>Interplay between Exchange Interaction and Magnetic Shape Anisotropy of ferromagnetic nanoparticles in a non-magnetic matrix for rare-earth-free permanent magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing permanent magnets with fewer critical elements requires understanding hysteresis effects and coercivity through visualizing magnetization reversal. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of the geometry of nanoscale ferromagnetic inclusions in a paramagnetic/non-magnetic matrix to understand the key factors that maximize the magnetic energy product of such nanocomposite systems. Specifically, we have considered a matrix of 3 micron x 3 micron x40 nanometer dimension, which is a sufficiently large volume, two-dimensional representation considering that the ferromagnetic inclusions thickness is less than 3.33% of the lateral dimensions simulated. Using this approach that is representative of bulk behavior while being computationally tractable for simulation, we systematically studied the effect of the thickness of ferromagnetic strips, the separation between the ferromagnetic strips due to the nonmagnetic matrix material, and the length of these ferromagnetic strips on magnetic coercivity and remanence by simulating the hysteresis loop plots for each geometry. Furthermore, we study the underlying micromagnetic mechanism for magnetic reversal to understand the factors that could help attain the maximum magnetic energy densities for ferromagnetic nanocomposite systems in a paramagnetic/non-magnetic material matrix. In this study, we have used material parameters of an exemplary Alnico alloy system, a rare-earth-free, thermally stable nanocomposite, which could potentially replace high-strength NdFeB magnets in applications that don't require large energy products. This can stimulate further experimental work on the fabrication and large-scale manufacturing of RE-free PMs with such nanocomposite systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetodynamics of few-nanoparticle chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the understanding and application of nanoparticle assemblies driven by external fields. Although these systems can exhibit marked transitions in behavior compared to non-interacting counterparts, it has often proven challenging to connect their dynamics with underlying physical mechanisms or even to verifiably establish their structure under realistic experimental conditions. We have studied colloidal iron oxide nanoparticles that assemble into ordered, few-particle linear chains under the influence of oscillating and pulsed magnetic fields. Cryo-EM has been used to flash freeze and image the structures formed by oscillatory drive fields, and magnetic relaxometry has been used to extract the multiple time constants associated with magnetic switching of the short chains. Armed with the physical structure from cryo-EM and the field-dependent switching times from magnetic measurements, we have conducted extensive micromagnetic simulations, revealing probable mechanisms for each time constant regime spanning $10^{9}$ in time and how switching develops from individual particles to entire chains. These types of magnetic nanomaterials have great potential for biomedical technologies, particularly magnetic particle imaging and hyperthermia, and rigorous elucidation of their physics will hasten their optimization.</description>

      <title>First-principles investigation of the emergence of multiferroicity and skyrmions in CrI2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently discovered van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrI2 shows promise for spintronic applications. Its electronic and magnetic properties are known to be strongly influenced by electronic correlations. In this work, we employ density functional theory calculations where electronic correlations in CrI2 are considered within an on-site Coulomb interaction, U, with U being determined using the perturbative approach based on the linear response method. We show that the accuracy of an on-site Coulomb interaction is essential for predicting the non-centrosymmetric orthorhombic ground state of CrI2, which allows the existence of ferroelectricity and non-zero Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) interaction. Our calculation shows that the ground state of bulk CrI2 has electric polarization of 0.15 {\mu}C/cm-2 pointing along the z-axis and the small DMI energy that changes sign with the ferroelectric polarization switching. The DMI and polarization are enhanced to 0.28 meV/formula-unit and 0.63 {\mu}C/cm-2 when Pt intercalates bilayers of CrI2, due to its large spin-orbit coupling strength and large off-center displacement. Such an enhanced DMI leads to the N\'eel skyrmions, whose handedness is controlled by ferroelectric polarization. Our work contributes to the creation and manipulation of bits in skyrmions-based memory devices.</description>

      <title>In situ Etching of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 using tert-Butyl Chloride in an MOCVD System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate in situ etching of \b{eta}-Ga2O3 in a metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) system using tert-Butyl chloride (TBCl). We report the successful etching of both heteroepitaxial (-201)-oriented and homoepitaxial (010)-oriented \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films over a wide range of substrate temperature, TBCl molar flows, and reactor pressures. We identify that the likely etchant is HCl (g) formed by the pyrolysis of TBCl in the hydrodynamic boundary layer above the substrate. The temperature dependence of the etch rate reveals two distinct regimes characterized by markedly different apparent activation energies. The extracted apparent activation energies suggest that at temperatures below ~800 {\deg}C the etch rate is likely limited by desorption of etch products, while at higher substrate temperatures chemisorption of HCl limits the etch rate. The relative etch rates of heteroepitaxial (-201) and homoepitaxial (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 were observed to scale by the ratio of the surface energies indicating an anisotropic etch. For (010) homoepitaxial films, relatively smooth post-etch surface morphology was achieved by tuning the etching parameters.</description>

      <title>Improved interfacial resistance and crystal-structure stability in a low-cobalt P2-type sodium-ion battery cathode material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe Na0.67Mn0.625Fe0.25Co0.125O2 (NMFCO), a P2-type sodium-ion battery cathode. Our composition, with significantly less Co than in an earlier study, shows discharge capacity close to 190 mAhg-1 and specific energy density exceeding 500 mWhg-1 in the 1.5 to 4.3 V range. The material also shows an improved structural stability over similar materials. Such changes, between the pristine phase (P63/mmc, P63 (OP4), or orthorhombic Cmcm) and the so-called Z phase, are endemic to other P2-type cathodes such as Na0.67Mn0.65Fe0.35O2 (NMFO). We propose two equivalent circuit models of impedance spectroscopy to understand electrochemical processes in our cells with a sodium metal anode. Our equivalent circuit modeling, combined with an analysis of the initial galvanostatic slope, reveals a significant reduction in the polarization and interfacial charge-transfer resistance at the solid electrolyte interface. We reveal that the combined effects of crystal structure stability, lower internal resistance, relatively high specific energy density, and improved battery health make this low-cobalt P2-type cathode composition a very promising candidate for new sodium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Double-leaf Riemann surface topological converse magnetoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field control of magnetism in solids, i.e. the converse magnetoelectricity, is highly desired for applications of scalable energy-efficient logic devices. However, it is not only a technical challenge but also a scientific paradox, since in principle the electric and magnetic degrees of freedom obey distinct rules of symmetries. Despite the great progresses obtained in the community of multiferroics during the past decades, the success of magnetoelectricity remains on its way and more alternative approaches with conceptual revolution are urgently needed. Here, by introducing the concept of topology into multiferroics, an exotic magnetoelectric double-leaf Riemann-surface is unveiled based on the mechanism of spin-dependent $d-p$ hybridization in a two-dimensional magnet: GdI$_2$ monolayer. Protected by the topology, a $180^\circ$ spin reversal can be precisely achieved by an electric cycle, leading to a robust and dissipationless converse magnetoelectric function. Such a topological magnetoelectricity allows the nontrivial manipulation of magnetization by AC electric field. In this category, more candidate materials with better performance are designed targetedly, which pave the road to the potential applications with topological magnetoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order-dependent giant tunneling magnetoresistance and electroresistance in van der Waals antiferromagnetic-multiferroic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics exhibits ultra-high operational speed and stability in a magnetic field, holding promise for the realization of next-generation ultra-high-speed magnetic storage. However, theoretical exploration of the electronic transport properties of antiferromagnetic-multiferroic tunnel junction (AMFTJ) devices remains largely unexplored. Here, we design an antiferromagnet/ferroelectric barrier/antiferromagnet van der Waals heterojunction, renamed vdW AMFTJ, using a bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/In$_2$Se$_3$/bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT-2L/IS/MBT-2L) as the prototype. Based on first-principles calculations using the nonequilibrium Green's function method combined with density functional theory, we theoretically investigate the spin-resolved electronic transport properties of this AMFTJ. By manipulating the various possible magnetization directions of the multilayer antiferromagnetic MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ and the ferroelectric polarization direction of the In$_2$Se$_3$ within the junction, sixteen distinct non-volatile resistance states can be revealed and manipulated by applying external biaxial strain and bias voltage. We predict maximum tunneling magnetoresistance (electroresistance) values of $3.79\times10^{4}$\% ($2.41\times10^{5}$\%) in the equilibrium state, which can increase up to $5.01\times10^{5}$\% ($4.97\times10^{5}$\%) under external bias voltage. Furthermore, the perfect spin filtering effect is also present in our AMFTJ. Our results highlight the tremendous potential of the MBT-2L/IS/MBT-2L vdW AMFTJ in non-volatile memory, expanding the application avenues for antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electrically-driven control of nanoscale chemical changes in amorphous complex oxide memristive devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study demonstrates that strong cationic segregation can occur in amorphous complex oxide memristors during electrical operation. With the help of analytic techniques, we observed that switching the electrical stimulation from voltage to current significantly prevents structural changes and cation segregation at the nanoscale, improving also the device cycle-to-cycle variability. These findings could contribute to the design of more reliable oxide-based memristors and underscore the crucial effect that has the type of electrical stimulation applied to the devices on their integrity and reliability.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in Hafnia: The Origin of Nanoscale Stabilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnia-based materials have boosted the potential of incorporating ferroelectrics in advanced electronics, thanks to their compatibility with silicon technology. However, comprehending why these materials defy the common trend of reduced ferroelectric ordering at the nanoscale, and the mechanism that stabilizes the ferroelectric phase (absent in hafnia phase diagram) presents significant challenges to traditional knowledge of ferroelectricity. In this work, we show that the formation of the orthorhombic ferroelectric phase (o-FE, space group Pca21) of the single-crystalline epitaxial films of 10% La-doped HfO2 (LHO) on (111)-oriented yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) relies on the stability of the high-pressure orthorhombic antiferroelectric phase (o-AFE, space group Pbca). Our detailed structural characterizations demonstrate that as-grown LHO films represent largely the o-AFE phase being thermodynamically stabilized by the compressive strain. Our Kelvin probe force microscopy studies show, under mechanical poling, the o-AFE phase is converted to the o-FE phase which remains stable under ambient conditions. We find that the orthorhombic phase stability is enhanced in thinner films down to one-unit-cell thickness, a trend that is unknown in any other ferroelectric films. This is due to the vanishing depolarization field of the o-AFE phase and the isomorphic LHO/YSZ interface, supporting strain-enhanced ferroelectricity in the ultrathin films. This results in an unprecedented increase of the Curie temperature up to 850 {\deg}C, the highest reported for sub-nanometer-thick ferroelectrics. Overall, our findings opens the way for advanced engineering of hafnia-based materials for ferroelectric applications and heralding a new frontier of high-temperature ferroelectrics at the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Dissolution zone model of the oxide structure in additively manufactured dispersion-strengthened alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural evolution of oxides in dispersion-strengthened superalloys during laser-powder bed fusion is considered in detail. Alloy chemistry and process parameter effects on oxide structure are assessed through a parameter study on the model alloy Ni-20Cr, doped with varying concentrations of Y2O3 and Al. A scaling analysis of mass and momentum transport within the melt pool, presented here, establishes that diffusional structural evolution mechanisms dominate for nanoscale dispersoids, while fluid forces and advection become significant for larger micron-scale slag inclusions. These findings are developed into a theory of dispersoid structural evolution, integrating quantitative models of diffusional processes -- dispersoid dissolution, nucleation, growth, coarsening -- with a reduced order model of time-temperature trajectories of fluid parcels within the melt pool. Calculations of the dispersoid size in single-pass melting reveal a zone in the center of the melt track in which the oxide feedstock fully dissolves. Within this zone the final Y2O3 size is independent of feedstock size and determined by nucleation and growth kinetics. If the dissolution zones of adjacent melt tracks overlap sufficiently with each other to dissolve large oxides, formed during printing or present in the powder feedstock, then the dispersoid structure throughout the build volume is homogeneous and matches that from a single pass within the dissolution zone. Gaps between adjacent dissolution zones result in oxide accumulation into larger slag inclusions. Predictions of final dispersoid size and slag formation using this dissolution zone model match the present experimental data and explain process-structure linkages speculated in the open literature.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Behavior of Origami Structures: Computational and Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami structures have been receiving a lot of attention from engineering and scientific researchers owing to their unique properties such as deployability, multi-stability, negative stiffness, etc. However, dynamic properties of origami structures have not been explored much due to a lack of validated analytical dynamic modeling approaches. Given the range of interesting properties and applications of origami structures, it is important to study the dynamic behavior of origami structures. In this study, a dynamic modeling approach for origami structures is presented considering distributed mass modeling, which has the potential to be a generalizable approach. In the proposed approach, stiffness is modeled using the bar and hinge modeling approach while the mass is modeled using the mass distribution approach. Various candidate mass distribution approaches were investigated by comparing their responses to the finite element method responses for various geometric conditions, loading and boundary conditions, and deformation modes. It was observed that a dynamic modeling approach with triangle circumcenter mass distribution was able to capture most of the dynamics satisfactorily consistently. Subsequently, a Miura-ori specimen was manufactured and its free vibration response was determined experimentally and then compared to the prediction of the analytical model. The comparison demonstrated that the analytical model was able to capture most of the dynamics in the longitudinal direction.</description>

      <title>Native defects and $p$-type dopability in transparent $\beta$-TeO$_2$: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although $\beta$-TeO$_2$ is a promising $p$-type transparent conducting oxide (TCO) due to the large optical gap ($\sim$ 3.7 eV) and a light effective hole mass, its hole dopability still remains unexplored. In this work, electronic structure of $\beta$-TeO$_2$ and its point defects are investigated using the HSEsol functional with the band-gap-tuned mixing parameter. Our calculations reveal that $\beta$-TeO$_2$ exhibits a significant difference between the fundamental and optical band gaps because lower energy optical transitions are dipole forbidden. Additionally, it has a low hole effective mass, especially in-plane. The point defect calculations show that $\beta$-TeO$_2$ is intrinsically an insulator. From systematic calculations of the trivalent dopants as well as hydrogen, Bi doping is suggested as the best candidate as an acceptor dopant. This work paves the way for the material design of the $p$-type $\beta$-TeO$_2$.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Topological Ferroelectric Metal with Giant Ghift Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit for "ferroelectric metal" which combines seemingly incompatible spontaneous electric polarization and metallicity, has been assiduously ongoing but remains elusive. Unlike traditional ferroelectrics with a wide band gap, ferroelectric (FE) metals can naturally incorporate nontrivial band topology near the Fermi level, endowing them with additional exotic properties. Here, we show first-principles evidence that the metallic PtBi2 monolayer is an intrinsic two-dimensional (2D) topological FE metal, characterized by out-of-plane polarization and a moderate switching barrier. Moreover, it exhibits a topologically nontrivial electronic structure with Z2 invariant equal to 1, leading to a significant FE bulk photovoltaic effect. A slight strain can further enhance this effect to a remarkable level, which far surpass that of previously reported 2D/3D FE materials. Our work provides an important step towards realizing intrinsic monolayer topological FE metals and paves a promising way for future nonlinear optical devices.</description>

      <title>Scientific Exploration with Expert Knowledge (SEEK) in Autonomous Scanning Probe Microscopy with Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopy techniques have played vital roles in materials science, biology, and nanotechnology, offering high-resolution imaging and detailed insights into properties at nanoscale and atomic level. The automation of microscopy experiments, in combination with machine learning approaches, is a transformative advancement, offering increased efficiency, reproducibility, and the capability to perform complex experiments. Our previous work on autonomous experimentation with scanning probe microscopy (SPM) demonstrated an active learning framework using deep kernel learning (DKL) for structure-property relationship discovery. This approach has demonstrated broad applications in various microscopy techniques. Here, to address limitations of workflows based on DKL, we developed methods to incorporate prior knowledge and human interest into DKL-based workflows and implemented these workflows in SPM. By integrating expected rewards from structure libraries or spectroscopic features, we enhanced the exploration efficiency of autonomous microscopy, demonstrating more efficient and targeted exploration in autonomous microscopy. We demonstrated the application of these methods in SPM, but we suggest that these methods can be seamlessly applied to other microscopy and imaging techniques. Furthermore, the concept can be adapted for general Bayesian optimization in material discovery across a broad range of autonomous experimental fields.</description>

      <title>Field-Tunable Valley Coupling and Localization in a Dodecagonal Semiconductor Quasicrystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are characterized by atomic arrangements possessing long-range order without periodicity. Van der Waals (vdW) bilayers provide a unique opportunity to controllably vary atomic alignment between two layers from a periodic moir\'e crystal to an aperiodic quasicrystal. Here, we reveal a remarkable consequence of the unique atomic arrangement in a dodecagonal WSe2 quasicrystal: the K and Q valleys in separate layers are brought arbitrarily close in momentum space via higher-order Umklapp scatterings. A modest perpendicular electric field is sufficient to induce strong interlayer K-Q hybridization, manifested as a new hybrid excitonic doublet. Concurrently, we observe the disappearance of the trion resonance and attribute it to quasicrystal potential driven localization. Our findings highlight the remarkable attribute of incommensurate systems to bring any pair of momenta into close proximity, thereby introducing a novel aspect to valley engineering.</description>

      <title>In-depth Understanding of the Band Alignment and Interface States Scenario in Bi2O2Se/SrTiO3 Ultrathin Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bismuth oxyselenide (Bi2O2Se), a novel quasi-2D charge-carrying semiconductor, is hailed as one of the best emerging platforms for the next generation semiconductor devices. Recent efforts on developing diverse Bi2O2Se heterojunctions have produced extensive potential applications in electronics and optoelectronics. In-depth understanding of the band alignment and especially interface dynamics is, however, still challenging. In this work, a comprehensive experimental investigation on the band alignment is performed by a high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (HRXPS), and the properties of interface states are also fully discussed. The results show that the ultrathin film Bi2O2Se grown on SrTiO3 (TiO2 (001) termination) exhibits Type-I (straddling gap) band alignment with a valence band offset (VBO) of about 1.77\pm0.04 eV and conduction band offset (CBO) of about 0.68\pm0.04 eV. However, further considering the contribution of the interface states, the bands on the interface present a herringbone configuration due to sizable build-in electric fields, which is significantly different from the conventional band alignment. In this sense, our results provide an insightful guidance to the development of high-efficiency electronic and optoelectronic devices, specifically of the devices where the charge transfer is highly sensitive to interface states.</description>

      <title>Above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism in ultrathin van der Waals crystal Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets are crucial for ultra-compact spintronics. However, so far, no vdW crystal has exhibited tunable above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism in the 2D ultrathin regime. Here, we report the tunable above-room-temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism in ultrathin vdW crystal Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ ($x$ = 0 and 0.3). By increasing the Fe content, the Curie temperature (TC) and room-temperature saturation magnetization of bulk Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ crystals are enhanced from 354 to 376 K and 43.9 to 50.4 emu/g, respectively. Remarkably, the robust anomalous Hall effect in 3-nm Fe$_{3.3}$GaTe$_2$ indicate a record-high TC of 340 K and a large room-temperature perpendicular magnetic anisotropy energy of 6.6 * 10^5 J/m$^3$, superior to other ultrathin vdW ferromagnets. First-principles calculations reveal the asymmetric density of states and an additional large spin exchange interaction in ultrathin Fe$_{3+x}$GaTe$_2$ responsible for robust intrinsic ferromagnetism and higher Tc. This work opens a window for above-room-temperature ultrathin 2D magnets in vdW-integrated spintronics.</description>

      <title>Learning Atoms from Crystal Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational modelling of materials using machine learning, ML, and historical data has become integral to materials research. The efficiency of computational modelling is strongly affected by the choice of the numerical representation for describing the composition, structure and chemical elements. Structure controls the properties, but often only the composition of a candidate material is available. Existing elemental descriptors lack direct access to structural insights such as the coordination geometry of an element. In this study, we introduce Local Environment-induced Atomic Features, LEAFs, which incorporate information about the statistically preferred local coordination geometry for atoms in crystal structure into descriptors for chemical elements, enabling the modelling of materials solely as compositions without requiring knowledge of their crystal structure. In the crystal structure, each atomic site can be described by similarity to common local structural motifs; by aggregating these features of similarity from the experimentally verified crystal structures of inorganic materials, LEAFs formulate a set of descriptors for chemical elements and compositions. The direct connection of LEAFs to the local coordination geometry enables the analysis of ML model property predictions, linking compositions to the underlying structure-property relationships. We demonstrate the versatility of LEAFs in structure-informed property predictions for compositions, mapping of chemical space in structural terms, and prioritising elemental substitutions. Based on the latter for predicting crystal structures of binary ionic compounds, LEAFs achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy of 86 per cent. These results suggest that the structurally informed description of chemical elements and compositions developed in this work can effectively guide synthetic efforts in discovering new materials.</description>

      <title>Microscale chemical imaging to characterize and quantify corrosion processes at the metal-electrolyte interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an experimental setup to chemically image corrosion processes at metal-electrolyte interfaces under stagnant, confined conditions relevant in a wide range of situations. The setup is based on a glass capillary, in which precipitation of corrosion products in the interfacial aqueous phase can be monitored over time with optical microscopy, and chemically and structurally characterized with microscopic synchrotron-based techniques (X-ray fluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy). Moreover, quantification of precipitates through X-ray transmission measurements provides in-situ corrosion rates. We illustrate this setup for iron corrosion in a pH 8 electrolyte, revealing the critical role of O2 and iron diffusion in governing the precipitation of ferrihydrite and its transformation to goethite. Corrosion and coupled reactive transport processes can thus be monitored and fundamentally investigated at the metal-electrolyte interface, with micrometer-scale resolution. This capillary setup has potential applications for in-situ corrosion studies of various metals and environments.</description>

      <title>Towards atom counting from first moment STEM images: methodology and possibilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through a simulation-based study we develop a statistical model-based quantification method for atomic resolution first moment scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images. This method uses the uniformly weighted least squares estimator to determine the unknown structure parameters of the images and to isolate contributions from individual atomic columns. In this way, a quantification of the projected potential per atomic column is achieved. Since the integrated projected potential of an atomic column scales linearly with the number of atoms it contains, it can serve as a basis for atom counting. The performance of atom counting from first moment STEM imaging is compared to that from traditional HAADF STEM in the presence of noise. Through this comparison, we demonstrate the advantage of first moment STEM images to attain more precise atom counts. Finally, we compare the integrated intensities extracted from first-moment images of a wedge-shaped sample to those values from the bulk crystal. The excellent agreement found between these values proves the robustness of using bulk crystal simulations as a reference library. This enables atom counting for samples with different shapes by comparison with these library values.</description>

      <title>Electron-beam-induced modification of gold microparticles in an SEM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-beam-induced conversion of materials in a transmission electron microscope uses the high power density of a localized electron beam of acceleration voltages above 100 kV as an energy source to transform matter at the sub-micron scale. Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor microparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30 kV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility and efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be classified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes in or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where matter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold microparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of inelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the observed melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the electron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling further support the findings.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-enabled molecular dynamics study of HfO2 phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advances of machine-learned force fields have opened up molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for compounds for which ab-initio MD is too resource-intensive and phenomena for which classical force fields are insufficient. Here we describe a neural-network force field parametrized to reproduce the r2SCAN potential energy landscape of HfO2 . Based on an automatic differentiable implementation of the isothermal-isobaric (NPT) ensemble with flexible cell fluctuations, we study the phase space of HfO2. We find excellent predictive capabilities regarding the lattice constants and experimental X-ray diffraction data. The phase transition away from monoclinic is clearly visible at a temperature around 2000 K, in agreement with available experimental data and previous calculations. Another abrupt change in lattice constants occurs around 3000 K. While the resulting lattice constants are closer to cubic, they exhibit a small tetragonal distortion, and there is no associated change in volume. We show that this high-temperature structure is in agreement with the available high-temperature diffraction data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Switchability of materials properties by applying controlled stimuli such as voltage pulses is an emerging field of study with applicability in adaptive and programmable devices like neuromorphic transistors or non-emissive smart displays. One of the most exciting approaches to modulate materials performance is mobile ion/vacancy insertion for inducing changes in relevant electrical, optical, or magnetic properties, among others. Unveiling the interplay between changes in the concentration of mobile defects (like oxygen vacancies) and functional properties in relevant materials represents a step forward for underpinning the emerging oxide iontronics discipline. In this work, electrochemical oxide-ion pumping cells were fabricated for an analog control of the oxygen stoichiometry in thin films of mixed ionic-electronic conductor La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-{\delta}. We demonstrate over more than 4 orders of magnitude electronic conductivity control within the same crystallographic phase through the precise and continuous voltage control of the oxygen stoichiometry. We show that behind the modification of the transport properties of the material lays a paramagnetic-to-antiferromagnetic transition. We exploit such magnetoelectric coupling to show control over the exchange interaction between La0.5Sr0.5FeO3-{\delta} and a ferromagnetic Co layer deposited on top.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Engineering of Wurtzite Ferroelectrics: Unveiling Phase Transition and Ferroelectric Switching in ScAlN Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of extreme device miniaturization and the exploration of novel physical phenomena have spurred significant interest in crystallographic phase control and ferroelectric switching in reduced dimensions. Recently, wurtzite ferroelectrics have emerged as a new class of functional materials, offering intriguing piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties, CMOS compatibility, and seamless integration with mainstream semiconductor technology. However, the exploration of crystallographic phase and ferroelectric switching in reduced dimensions, especially in nanostructures, has remained a largely uncharted territory. In this study, we present the first comprehensive investigation into the crystallographic phase transition of ScAlN nanowires across the full Sc compositional range. While a gradual transition from wurtzite to cubic phase was observed with increasing Sc composition, we further demonstrated that a highly ordered wurtzite phase ScAlN could be confined at the ScAlN/GaN interface for Sc contents surpassing what is possible in conventional films, holding great potential to addressing the fundamental high coercive field of wurtzite ferroelectrics. In addition, we provide the first evidence of ferroelectric switching in ScAlN nanowires, a result that holds significant implications for future device miniaturization. Our demonstration of tunable ferroelectric ScAlN nanowires opens new possibilities for nanoscale, domain, alloy, strain, and quantum engineering of wurtzite ferroelectrics, representing a significant stride towards the development of next-generation, miniaturized devices based on wurtzite ferroelectrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transient behaviour of organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) is complex due to mixed ionic-electronic properties that play a central role in bioelectronics, sensing and neuromorphic applications. We investigate the impedance response of ion-controlled transistors using a model that combines electronic motion along the channel and vertical ion diffusion by insertion from the electrolyte, depending on the chemical capacitance, the diffusion coefficient of ions, the electronic transit time, and the series impedance components due to the electrolyte and its interfaces. Based on transport and charge conservation equations, we show that the vertical impedance produces a standard result of diffusion in intercalation systems, while the transversal impedance (drain current vs gate voltage) contains the electronic parameters of hole accumulation and transport along the channel. We establish the spectral shapes of drain and gate currents and the complex admittance spectra by reference to equivalent circuit models for the vertical and transversal impedances, that describe well the measurements of a PEDOT:PSS OECT. We obtain new insights to the determination of mobility by the relationship between drain and gate currents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical representation learning has gained increasing interest due to the limited availability of supervised data in fields such as drug and materials design. This interest particularly extends to chemical language representation learning, which involves pre-training Transformers on SMILES sequences -- textual descriptors of molecules. Despite its success in molecular property prediction, current practices often lead to overfitting and limited scalability due to early convergence. In this paper, we introduce a novel chemical language representation learning framework, called MolTRES, to address these issues. MolTRES incorporates generator-discriminator training, allowing the model to learn from more challenging examples that require structural understanding. In addition, we enrich molecular representations by transferring knowledge from scientific literature by integrating external materials embedding. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on popular molecular property prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Domain-Aware Electron Microscopy Analysis Using Deep Learning Models with Synthetic Data and Image-Wide Confidence Scoring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) models enhances the efficiency, affordability, and reliability of feature detection in microscopy, yet their development and applicability are hindered by the dependency on scarce and often flawed manually labeled datasets and a lack of domain awareness. We addressed these challenges by creating a physics-based synthetic image and data generator, resulting in a machine learning model that achieves comparable precision (0.86), recall (0.63), F1 scores (0.71), and engineering property predictions (R2=0.82) to a model trained on human-labeled data. We enhanced both models by using feature prediction confidence scores to derive an image-wide confidence metric, enabling simple thresholding to eliminate ambiguous and out-of-domain images resulting in performance boosts of 5-30% with a filtering-out rate of 25%. Our study demonstrates that synthetic data can eliminate human reliance in ML and provides a means for domain awareness in cases where many feature detections per image are needed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of topological phase transitions driven by a high-frequency time-periodic field is a promising approach to realizing new topological phases of matter distinct from static states. Here, we theoretically investigate Floquet engineering topological phase transitions in the quantum spin Hall $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ system driven by an off-resonant circularly polarized light. In addition to the quantum spin (anomalous) Hall insulator phase with multiple helical (chiral) edge states, spin-polarized topological metallic phases are expected, where the bulk topological band gap of one spin sub-band overlaps with the other gapless spin sub-band. Moreover, with a staggered potential, the topological invariants of the system depend on whether the middle band is occupied because of the breaking of particle-hole symmetry. Our work highlights the significance of Floquet engineering in realizing new topological phases in the $\alpha$-$T_{3}$ lattice.</description>

      <title>The Role of Superlattice Phonons in Charge Localization Across Quantum Dot Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot (QD) assemblies are utilized in solar cells and light-harvesting devices because of their distinct physical and optical properties. Recent experiments have successfully synthesized QD molecules, arrays, and assemblies with precision by directly attaching QDs. These systems demonstrate high carrier mobility while preserving the optical properties of the individual QD components. However, despite advancements in fabricating these superstructures, a comprehensive understanding of the charge transfer process at the microscopic level is still lacking. Here, we theoretically investigated the electron transfer dynamics across finite 1-dimensional CdSe-CdS core-shell QD arrays, with $N_{\rm dot}=2,3, \cdots$ QDs. The electronic and vibronic properties of the QD arrays were calculated using a semiempirical pseudopotential method and the electron transfer dynamics were studied using a mixed quantum-classical mapping approach. We find that as $N_{\rm dot}$ increases, the superlattice bending and the symmetric stretch modes can significantly localize electron transfer in the nonadiabatic regime, particularly when the connecting neck between the QDs is narrow, resulting in charge localization for large values of $N_{\rm dot}$. This behavior is quite different in the adiabatic limit when the neck connecting the QDs is wide, where such modes can facilitate electron transfer, partially governed by decoherence times. The interplay between electronic and super-lattice couplings is thus crucial for designing high-mobility devices based on QD superlattices and avoiding charge localization.</description>

      <title>Role of softness on transition temperatures for pNIPAM microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (pNIPAM) microgels are renowned for their thermoresponsive behavior, exhibiting a distinct volume phase transition (VPT) upon temperature changes. This study investigates the influence of microgel softness, controlled by varying the crosslinking density during synthesis via free radical polymerization (FRP), on the difference between the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) and the electrokinetic transition temperature (ETT). These transition temperatures mark the points at which the microgel size and surface charge, respectively, undergo significant alterations in response to temperature. Here, we investigate this phenomenon, employing dynamic light scattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) measurements to characterize the size and electrophoretic mobility response of pNIPAM microgels with different crosslinking densities as a function of temperature. By analyzing the observed trends in the difference between the transition temperatures, we aim to develop a hypothesis that provides a deeper physical understanding of the microgel structure and its relationship to transition temperatures. This investigation thus sheds light on the intricate interplay between microgel structure and its thermoresponsive behavior, offering insights for the design and optimization of pNIPAM microgels for future applications.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of Co-Doped CaKFe4As4 Investigated via Point-Contact Spectroscopy and London Penetration Depth Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iron-based superconductors (IBSs) of the recently discovered 1144 class, unlike many other IBSs, display superconductivity in their stoichiometric form and are intrinsically hole doped. The effects of chemical substitutions with electron donors are thus particularly interesting to investigate. Here, we study the effect of Co substitution in the Fe site of CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ single crystals on the critical temperature, on the energy gaps, and on the superfluid density by using transport, point-contact Andreev-reflection spectroscopy (PCARS), and London penetration depth measurements. The pristine compound (T$_\mathrm{c}\simeq$ 36 K) shows two isotropic gaps whose amplitudes ($\Delta_1$ = 1.4$-$3.9 meV and $\Delta_2$ = 5.2$-$8.5 meV) are perfectly compatible with those reported in the literature. Upon Co doping (up to $\approx$7% Co), T$_\mathrm{c}$ decreases down to $\simeq$ 20 K, the spin-vortex-crystal order appears, and the low-temperature superfluid density is gradually suppressed. PCARS and London penetration depth measurements perfectly agree in demonstrating that the nodeless multigap structure is robust upon Co doping, while the gap amplitudes decrease as a function of T$_\mathrm{c}$ in a linear way with almost constant values of the gap ratios 2$\Delta_i$/k$_\mathrm{B}$T$_\mathrm{c}$.</description>

      <title>Ultimately deformed double-network gels possess positive energetic elasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elasticity of rubbery polymer networks has been considered to be entropy-driven. On the other hand, studies on single polymer chain mechanics have revealed that the elasticity of ultimately stretched polymer chains is dominated by the energetic contribution mainly originating from chemical bond deformation. Here, we experimentally found that the elasticity of the double-network gel transits from the entropy-dominated one to the internal energy-driven one with its uniaxial deformation through the thermodynamic analysis. Based on this finding, we developed a simple mechanical model that takes into account the energetic contribution and found that this model approximately reproduces the temperature dependence of the stress-strain curve of the double-network gel. This study demonstrates the importance of the chemical perspective in the mechanical analysis of highly deformed rubbery polymer networks.</description>

      <title>Lattice and magnetic structure in the van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the lattice and magnetic structure in van der Waals antiferromagnet VBr3, characterized by a BiI3-type structure at room temperature. Neutron diffraction experiments were performed on both polycrystalline and single-crystalline VBr3 samples, revealing clear magnetic Bragg peaks emerging below the N\'eel temperature of TN = 26.5 K. These magnetic Bragg peaks can be indexed by k = (0, 0.5, 1) in hexagonal notation. Our refinement analysis suggests that the antiferromagnetic order in VBr3 manifests as a zigzag structure. Moreover, we observed peak splitting for nuclear Bragg peaks in the HK-plane below the structure transition temperature of Ts = 94 K, indicating the breaking of 3-fold symmetry within the ab-plane.</description>

      <title>Rapid Discovery of Graphene Nanocrystals Using DFT and Bayesian Optimization with Neural Network Kernel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.07612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful computational method used to obtain physical and chemical properties of materials. In the materials discovery framework, it is often necessary to virtually screen a large and high-dimensional chemical space to find materials with desired properties. However, grid searching a large chemical space with DFT is inefficient due to its high computational cost. We propose an approach utilizing Bayesian optimization (BO) with an artificial neural network kernel to enable smart search. This method leverages the BO algorithm, where the neural network, trained on a limited number of DFT results, determines the most promising regions of the chemical space to explore in subsequent iterations. This approach aims to discover materials with target properties while minimizing the number of DFT calculations required. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, we investigated 63 doped graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with sizes ranging from 1 to 2 nm to find the structure with the highest light absorbance. Using time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) only 12 times, we achieved a significant reduction in computational cost, approximately 20% of what would be required for a full grid search, by employing the BO algorithm with a neural network kernel. Considering that TDDFT calculations for a single GQD require about half a day of wall time on high-performance computing nodes, this reduction is substantial. Our approach can be generalized to the discovery of new drugs, chemicals, crystals, and alloys with high-dimensional and large chemical spaces, offering a scalable solution for various applications in materials science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of materials science, comprehending material properties is often hindered by the complexity of datasets originating from various sources. This study introduces the Automated Model Training (AMT) Graphical User Interface (GUI), specifically crafted for the use of researchers and scientists without a programming background to design the next set of experiments either in a chemistry lab or on the computer. The GUI integrates diverse machine learning models, such as XG-Boost, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression, Linear Regression, Generalized Additive Model (GAM), and Stack Regressors, offering a robust toolkit for data analysis. It facilitates the exploration of complex relationships, non-linear patterns, and predictive accuracy optimization. To further enhance its utility, the GUI integrates the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique, allowing researchers to systematically explore vast parameter spaces and identify optimal experimental conditions. This synergy between machine learning and PSO empowers material scientists through a user-friendly platform for data-driven discovery. The AMT GUI bridges the gap between traditional experimentation and machine learning, enabling precise and efficient exploration of the materials research space.</description>

      <title>Spintronic devices and applications using noncollinear chiral antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01977v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials have a vanishingly small net magnetization, which generates weak dipolar fields and makes them robust against external magnetic perturbation and rapid magnetization dynamics, as dictated by the geometric mean of their exchange and anisotropy energies. However, experimental and theoretical techniques to detect and manipulate the antiferromagnetic order in a fully electrical manner must be developed to enable advanced spintronic devices with antiferromagnets (AFMs) as their active spin-dependent elements. Among the various AFMs, conducting AFMs offer high electrical and thermal conductivities and strong electron-spin-phonon interactions. Noncollinear metallic AFMs with negative chirality, including Mn3Sn, Mn3Ge, and Mn3GaN, offer rich physics that arises from their topology. In this review article, we introduce the crystal structure and the physical phenomena observed in negative chirality AFMs. Experimental and theoretical advances related to current-induced dynamics on the spin structure of Mn3Sn are discussed. We then present a potential AFM spintronic device that can serve as a non-volatile memory, high-frequency signal generator, neuron emulator, and even a probabilistic bit, depending on the design parameters and the input stimuli, i.e., amplitude and pulse width of the injected spin current and the external magnetic field. In this device, spin-orbit torques can be used to manipulate the order parameter, while the device state can be read via tunneling magnetoresistance. We also present analytic models that relate the performance characteristics of the device with its design parameters, thus enabling a rapid technology-device assessment. Effects of Joule heating and thermal noise on the device characteristics are briefly discussed. We close the paper by summarizing the status of research and present our outlook in this rapidly evolving research field.</description>

      <title>Direct visualization of defect-controlled diffusion in van der Waals gaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion processes govern fundamental phenomena such as phase transformations, doping, and intercalation in van der Waals (vdW) bonded materials. Here, we quantify the diffusion dynamics of W atoms by visualizing the motion of individual atoms at three different vdW interfaces: BN/vacuum, BN/BN, and BN/WSe2, by recording scanning transmission electron microscopy movies. Supported by density functional theory calculations, we infer that in all cases diffusion is governed by intermittent trapping at electron beam-generated defect sites. This leads to diffusion properties that depend strongly on the number of defects. These results suggest that diffusion and intercalation processes in vdW materials are highly tunable and sensitive to crystal quality. The demonstration of imaging, with high spatial and temporal resolution, of layers and individual atoms inside vdW heterostructures offers possibilities for direct visualization of diffusion and atomic interactions, as well as for experiments exploring atomic structures, their in-situ modification, and electrical property measurements of active devices combined with atomic resolution imaging.</description>

      <title>Effect of biquadratic magnetic exchange interaction in the 2D antiferromagnets MPS_3 (M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials MPS_3(M = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) display antiferromagnetic ordering of the magnetic moments at the transition metal ions. The possibility to exfoliate thin layers that preserve the magnetic order makes these materials interesting for numerous applications in devices that require integration of flexible patches of magnetic materials, e.g. in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Hence, an improved understanding of their magnetic properties is desirable. Here, we parameterize spin Hamiltonians for a monolayer of all four materials of this class using density functional theory plus Hubbard U calculations. We provide a step-by-step guide for calculating the magnetic exchange interactions and magnetic anisotropy energy using the (non-)collinear DFT+U(+ SOC) approach with a suitably chosen U for each material. It is found that the biquadratic interactions gain in importance while moving through the 3d series. Retaining the leading terms of a Holstein-Primakoff-transformed spin Hamiltonian, the magnon spectra are calculated. While MnPS_3 is found to be an almost isotropic antiferromagnet with a tiny gap, the biquadratic interaction opens an increasingly wider gap for FePS_3, CoPS_3 and NiPS_3. In line with this observation, Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the biquadratic interactions contribute to a systematic rise in the Neel temperature from FePS_3 to NiPS_3.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, recently spotlighted in condensed matter physics, presents captivating physical properties and holds promise for spintronics applications. This study delves into the theoretical description and categorization of two-dimensional altermagnetism using spin group theory. Employing spin-group formalism, we establish seven distinct spin layer groups, extending beyond the conventional five spin Laue groups, to describe two-dimensional altermagnetism. Utilizing these findings, we classify previously reported two-dimensional altermagnets and identify novel materials exhibiting altermagnetism. Specifically, monolayer MnTeMoO$_6$ and VP$_2$H$_8$(NO$_4$)$_2$ are predicted to be two-dimensional altermagnets. Furthermore, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristics through symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations, substantiating their altermagnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamic In-context Learning with Conversational Models for Data Extraction and Materials Property Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of natural language processing and large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the extraction of data from unstructured scholarly papers. However, ensuring data trustworthiness remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we introduce PropertyExtractor, an open-source tool that leverages advanced conversational LLMs like Google gemini-pro and OpenAI gpt-4, blends zero-shot with few-shot in-context learning, and employs engineered prompts for the dynamic refinement of structured information hierarchies - enabling autonomous, efficient, scalable, and accurate identification, extraction, and verification of material property data. Our tests on material data demonstrate precision and recall that exceed 95\% with an error rate of approximately 9%, highlighting the effectiveness and versatility of the toolkit. Finally, databases for 2D material thicknesses, a critical parameter for device integration, and energy bandgap values are developed using PropertyExtractor. Specifically for the thickness database, the rapid evolution of the field has outpaced both experimental measurements and computational methods, creating a significant data gap. Our work addresses this gap and showcases the potential of PropertyExtractor as a reliable and efficient tool for the autonomous generation of various material property databases, advancing the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lead-free antiferroelectric perovskite $\rm AgNbO_3$ is nowadays attracting extensive research interests due to its promising applications in energy storage. Although great progress has been made in optimizing the material performance, fundamental questions remain regarding the mechanism stabilizing the antiferroelectric $Pbcm$ phase. Here, combining structural symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identified crucial anharmonic couplings of oxygen octahedra rotations and cation antipolar motions which contribute significantly to lowering the energy of the $Pbcm$ phase. The stabilization of this phase shows close similarities with the stabilization of the $Pbam$ phase in $\rm PbZrO_3$ except that in $\rm AgNbO_3$ the octahedra rotations are the primary distortions while the antipolar cation motions appear to be secondary. The appearance and significant amplitude of the latter are explained from the combination of hybrid-improper and triggered mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Hot-Carrier Degradation driven by silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation in SPADs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach for modeling Dark Count Rate (DCR) drift in Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) is proposed based on Hot-Carrier Degradation (HCD) inducing silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation at the Si/SiO2 interface. The energy and the quantity of hot-carriers are modeled by the interplay of carrier energy distribution and current density. The carrier energy distribution, achieved by a Full-Band Monte-Carlo simulation considering the band structure and the scattering mechanisms, establishes a crucial link to the degradation of the top SPAD interface, primarily influenced by hot electrons due to their broader energy spread. The current density is determined by analyzing the generation rates of carriers under dark and photo conditions, along with the multiplication rate, through a combination of experimental data and modeling techniques. Subsequently,these hot carriers are correlated with the distribution of bond dissociation energy, which is modeled by the disorder-induced local variations among the Si-H bond energy at the Si/SiO2 interface. The impact-ionization probability between hot carriers and Si-H bonds is then calculated by differentiating their energies, thereby determining the degradation kinetics. This enables the capture of the rise in dark current density with stress duration by the increasing number of defects, which in turn affects the modeling of degradation rate. For the first time, a direct correlation between the dark current and DCR, along with their drift over stress time, has been established, relying on the carrier generation rate originating from these defects together with the position-dependent breakdown probability Pt.This physic-based model allows to predict DCR for unprecedented long-term stress measurement time up to 10e6s, covering a whole set of characterization and stress conditions for SPAD devices.</description>

Abstract: Topology and superconductivity, two distinct phenomena offer unique insight into quantum properties and their applications in quantum technologies, spintronics, and sustainable energy technologies if system can be found where they coexist. Tin (Sn) plays a pivotal role here as an element due to its two structural phases, $\alpha$-Sn and $\beta$-Sn, exhibiting topological characteristics ($\alpha$-Sn) and superconductivity ($\beta$-Sn). In this study we show how precise control of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ phases of Sn thin films can be achieved by using molecular beam epitaxy grown buffer layers with systematic control over the lattice parameter. The resulting Sn films showed either $\beta$-Sn or $\alpha$-Sn phases as the lattice constant of the buffer layer was varied from 6.10 A to 6.48 A, covering the range between GaSb (closely matched to InAs) and InSb. The crystal structures of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn films were characterized by x-ray diffraction and confirmed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. The smooth and continuous surface morphology of the Sn films was validated using atomic force microscopy. The characteristics of $\alpha$- and $\beta$-Sn phases were further verified using electrical transport measurements by observing resistance drop near 3.7 K for superconductivity of the $\beta$-Sn phase and Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations for the $\alpha$-Sn phase. Density functional theory calculations showed that the stability of the Sn phases is highly dependent on lattice strain, with $\alpha$-Sn being more stable under tensile strain and $\beta$-Sn becoming favorable under compressive strain, which is in good agreement with experimental observations. Hence, this study sheds light on controlling Sn phases through lattice engineering, enabling innovative applications in quantum technologies and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Nanoparticle surface structural dynamics is believed to play a significant role in regulating functionalities such as diffusion, reactivity, and catalysis but the atomic-level processes are not well understood. Atomic resolution characterization of nanoparticle surface dynamics is challenging since it requires both high spatial and temporal resolution. Though ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) can achieve picosecond temporal resolution, it is limited to nanometer spatial resolution. On the other hand, with the high readout rate of new electron detectors, conventional TEM has the potential to visualize atomic structure with millisecond time resolutions. However, the need to limit electron dose rates to reduce beam damage yields millisecond images that are dominated by noise, obscuring structural details. Here we show that a newly developed unsupervised denoising framework based on artificial intelligence enables observations of metal nanoparticle surfaces with time resolutions down to 10 ms at moderate electron dose. On this timescale, we find that many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition between ordered and disordered configurations. The associated stress fields can penetrate below the surface leading to defect formation and destabilization making the entire nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser with electron microscopy greatly improves spatio-temporal characterization capabilities, opening a new window for future exploration of atomic-level structural dynamics in materials.</description>

      <title>Planar structured materials with extreme elastic anisotropy</title>

Abstract: Designing anisotropic structured materials by reducing symmetry results in unique behaviors, such as shearing under uniaxial compression or tension. This direction-dependent coupled mechanical phenomenon is crucial for applications such as energy redirection. While rank-deficient materials such as hierarchical laminates have been shown to exhibit extreme elastic anisotropy, there is limited knowledge about the fully anisotropic elasticity tensors achievable with single-scale fabrication techniques. No established upper and lower bounds on anisotropic moduli achieving extreme elastic anisotropy exist, similar to Hashin-Shtrikman bounds in isotropic composites. In this paper, we estimate the range of anisotropic stiffness tensors achieved by single-scale two-dimensional structured materials. To achieve this, we first develop a database of periodic anisotropic single-scale unit cell geometries using linear combinations of periodic cosine functions. The database covers a wide range of anisotropic elasticity tensors, which are then compared with the elasticity tensors of hierarchical laminates. Through this comparison, we identify the regions in the property space where hierarchical design is necessary to achieve extremal properties. We demonstrate a method to construct various 2D functionally graded structures using this cosine function representation for the unit cells. These graded structures seamlessly interpolate between unit cells with distinct patterns, allowing for independent control of several functional gradients, such as porosity, anisotropic moduli, and symmetry. The graded structures exhibit unique mechanical behaviors when designed with unit cells positioned at extreme parts of the property space. Specific graded designs are numerically studied to observe behaviors such as selective strain energy localization, compressive strains under tension, and localized rotations.</description>

      <title>Displacive Jahn--Teller transition in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>

      <title>Theory of elastic constants of athermal amorphous solids with internal stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.09582v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new microscopic derivation of the elastic constants of amorphous solids is presented within the framework of nonaffine lattice dynamics, which makes use of a perturbative form of the low-frequency eigenvectors of the dynamical matrix introduced in [V. Mazzacurati, G. Ruocco, M. Sampoli EPL 34, 681 (1996)]. The theory correctly recovers the shear modulus at jamming, $\mu \sim (z-2d)$, including prefactors in quantitative agreement with simulations. Furthermore, this framework allows us, for the first time, to include the effect of internal stresses. The theory shows that the Maxwell rigidity criterion $z=2d$ is violated with internal stress. In particular, $\mu \sim (z-2df)$ where $f&lt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, stretched, and the solid is thus rigid below the Maxwell isostatic limit, while $f&gt;1$ if the bonds are, on average, compressed. The coefficient $f$ is derived in analytical form and depends only on $d$ and on the average particle displacement from the interaction energy minimum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, high composition (&gt;35%) thick (&gt;30 nm) barrier AlGaN/AlN/GaN HEMT structure grown on a sapphire substrate with ultra-low sheet resistivity (&lt;250 \Omega / \Box ) is reported. Optimization of growth conditions, such as reduced growth rate, low carbon incorporation, and thickness optimization of different epitaxial layers allowed to grow a crack-free high composition and thick AlGaN barrier layer HEMT structure. A significantly high two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) density of 1.46 \times 10^{13} cm^{-2} with a room temperature mobility of 1710 cm^{2}/V.s is obtained by Hall measurement using the Van-Der-Pauw method. These state-of-the-art results show great potential for high-power Ga-polar HEMT design on the sapphire substrate.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Debye scaling in the density of states of liquids under nanoconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the realm of nanoscience, the dynamic behaviors of liquids at scales beyond the conventional structural relaxation time, $\tau$, unfold a fascinating blend of solid-like characteristics, including the propagation of collective shear waves and the emergence of elasticity. However, in classical bulk liquids, where $\tau$ is typically of the order of 1 ps or less, this solid-like behavior remains elusive in the low-frequency region of the density of states (DOS). Here, we provide evidence for the emergent solid-like nature of liquids at short distances through inelastic neutron scattering measurements of the low-frequency DOS in liquid water and glycerol confined within graphene oxide membranes. In particular, upon increasing the strength of confinement, we observe a transition from a liquid-like DOS (linear in the frequency $\omega$) to a solid-like behavior (Debye law, $\sim\omega^2$) in the range of $1$-$4$ meV. Molecular dynamics simulations confirm these findings and reveal additional solid-like features, including propagating collective shear waves and a reduction in the self-diffusion constant. Finally, we show that the onset of solid-like dynamics is pushed towards low frequency along with the slowing-down of the relaxation processes upon confinement. This nanoconfinement-induced transition, aligning with k-gap theory, underscores the potential of leveraging liquid nanoconfinement in advancing nanoscale science and technology, building more connections between fluid dynamics and materials engineering.</description>

      <title>Novel magnetic topological insulator FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ with controllable topological quantum phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report a new intrinsic magnetic topological insulator FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ based on first-principles calculations and it can achieve a rich topological phase under pressure modulation. Without pressure, we predict that both FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic orders are non-trivial topological insulators. Furthermore, FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ of FM-z order will undergo a series of phase transitions from topological insulator to semimetals and then to trivial insulator under pressure. Finally, we further clarify and verify topological phase transitions with low-energy effective model calculations. This topological phase transition process is attributed to the synergy of the magnetic moment and the spin-orbit coupling. The unique topological properties of FeBi$_2$Te$_4$ will be of great interest in driving the development of quantum effects.</description>

      <title>Change Point Detection of Events in Molecular Simulations using dupin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15090v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle tracking is commonly used to study time-dependent behavior in many different types of physical and chemical systems involving constituents that span many length scales, including atoms, molecules, nanoparticles, granular particles, etc. Behaviors of interest studied using particle tracking information include disorder-order transitions, thermodynamic phase transitions, structural transitions, protein folding, crystallization, gelation, swarming, avalanches and fracture. A common challenge in studies of these systems involves change detection. Change point detection discerns when a temporal signal undergoes a change in distribution. These changes can be local or global, instantaneous or prolonged, obvious or subtle. Moreover, system-wide changes marking an interesting physical or chemical phenomenon (e.g. crystallization) are often preceded by events (e.g. pre-nucleation clusters) that are localized and can occur anywhere at anytime in the system. For these reasons, detecting events in particle trajectories generated by molecular simulation is challenging and typically accomplished via ad hoc solutions unique to the behavior and system under study. Consequently, methods for event detection lack generality, and those used in one field are not easily used by scientists in other fields. Here we present a new Python-based tool, dupin, that allows for event detection from particle trajectory data irrespective of the system details. dupin works by creating a signal representing the simulation and partitioning the signal based on events (changes within the trajectory). This approach allows for studies where manual annotating of event boundaries would require a prohibitive amount of time. Furthermore, dupin can serve as a tool in automated and reproducible workflows. We demonstrate the application of dupin using two examples and discuss its applicability to a wider class of problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations in Magnetically Frustrated Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 Pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 pyrochlore compounds exhibit quantum fluctuations in a spin ice-like state. These compounds have not been adequately studied based on the concept of magnetic frustration. Here, we have synthesised and characterised Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 to investigate their ground-state magnetic properties. We confirmed the cubic pyrochlore structure via X-ray powder diffraction. Magnetic and heat capacity measurements show an absence of magnetic order down to 400 mK. Interestingly, the low-temperature magnetic heat capacity of Gd2GaSbO7 and Gd2InSbO7 exhibits a broad maximum around T_{\text{max}} = 0.9 K and T_{\text{max}} = 1 K, respectively. The low-temperature Cmag data fit with the power-law C_{\text{mag}} \approx T^{\frac{d}{n}} with dependencies of T^{1.71} for Gd2GaSbO7 and T^{1.49} for Gd2InSbO7, suggesting spin fluctuations caused by the disorder of magnetic moments at low temperatures. Both compounds retain residual entropy akin to water ice, resembling the spin ice state. Additionally, we analysed the ratio between nearest-neighbour exchange and dipolar interaction for all reported Gd-based pyrochlores, finding that Gd2InSbO7 has the lowest and weakest exchange interaction among them. This indicates that chemical pressure affects exchange interaction due to the different pathways of mediators between magnetic ions. This study reveals robust quantum fluctuations in the ground state in GGSO and GISO, similar to quantum spin ice compounds such as Pr2Zr2O7, Pr2Sn2O7, and Yb2GaSbO7. Other Gd-pyrochlore compounds exhibit long-range magnetic order, which is in stark contrast to this.</description>

      <title>Quantum valley Hall states in low-buckled counterparts of graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With low-buckled structure for each layer in graphene bilayer system, there breaks inversion symmetry (P-symmetry) for one stacking when both A and B sublattices in top layer are aligned with those in bottom layer. In consideration of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), there opens nontrivial topological gap in each monolayer system to achieve quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE). As long as time-reversal symmetry (T-symmetry) is preserved the gapless edge states is robust in each individual layer even for the bilayer absent of PT symmetry. Based on this platform and through tight-binding (TB) model calculations we find it becomes a typical system that can exhibit quantum valley Hall effect (QVHE) when introduced a layer-resolved Rashba SOC that leads to band inversion at each K valley in the hexagonal Brillion zone (BZ). The topological transition comes from that the valley Chern number Cv = CK - CK' switches from 0 to 2, which characterizes the nontrivial QVHE phase transited from two coupled Z2 topological insulators. We also point that the layer-resolved Rashba SOC can be introduced equivalently by twisting two van der Waals touched layers. And through TB calculations, it is shown that the K bands inverts in its corresponding mini BZ when the two layers twisted by a small angle. Our findings advance potential applications for the devices design in topological valleytronics and twistronics.</description>

      <title>Ferri-ionic Coupling in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoflakes: Polarization States and Controllable Negative Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nanoflakes of van der Waals ferrielectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$ covered by an ionic surface charge and reveal the appearance of polar states with relatively high polarization ~5 microC/cm$^2$ and stored free charge ~10 microC/cm$%2$, which can mimic "mid-gap" states associated with a surface field-induced transfer of Cu and/or In ions in the van der Waals gap. The change in the ionic screening degree and mismatch strains induce a broad range of the transitions between paraelectric phase, antiferroelectric, ferrielectric, and ferri-ionic states in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. The states' stability and/or metastability is determined by the minimum of the system free energy consisting of electrostatic energy, elastic energy, and a Landau-type four-well potential of the ferrielectric dipole polarization. The possibility to govern the transitions by strain and ionic screening can be useful for controlling the tunneling barrier in thin film devices based on CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes. Also, we predict that the CuInP$_2$S$_6$ nanoflakes reveal features of the controllable negative capacitance effect, which make them attractive for advanced electronic devices, such as nano-capacitors and gate oxide nanomaterials with reduced heat dissipation.</description>

      <title>Tuning structural modulation and magnetic properties in metal-organic coordination polymers [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15650v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three solid solutions of [CH$_3$NH$_3$]Co$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$(HCOO)$_3$, with $x$ = 0.25 (1), 0.50 (2) and 0.75 (3), were synthesized and their nuclear structures and magnetic properties were characterized using single crystal neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements. At room temperature, all three compounds crystallize in the Pnma orthorhombic space group, akin to the cobalt and nickel end series members. Upon cooling, each compound undergoes distinct series of structural transitions to modulated structures. Compound 1 exhibits a phase transition to a modulated structure analogous to the pure nickel compound, while compound 3 maintains the behaviour observed in the pure cobalt compound, although in both cases the temperatures at which the phase transitions occur differ slightly from the pure phases. Monochromatic neutron diffraction measurements showed that the structural evolution of 2 diverges from that of either parent compound, with the competing hydrogen bond interactions which drive the modulation throughout the series producing a unique sequence of phases. It involves two modulated phases below 96(3) K and 59(3) K, with different q vectors, similar to the pure cobalt compound (with modulated phases below 128 K and 96 K), however it maintains the modulated phase below magnetic order (at 22.5(7) K), resembling the pure nickel compound (which present magnetic order below 34 K), resulting in an improper modulated magnetic structure. Despite these large scale structural changes, magnetometry data reveal that the bulk magnetic properties of these solid solutions form a linear continuum between the end members. Notably, doping of the metal site in these solid solutions allows for tuning of bulk magnetic properties, including magnetic ordering temperature, transition temperatures, and the nature of nuclear phase transitions, through adjustment of metal ratios.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Si-doped Al-rich thin regrown Al(Ga)N films on AlN on sapphire templates with $\gt10^{15}/cm^3$ free carrier concentration using close-coupled showerhead MOCVD reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin Si-doped Al-rich (Al&gt;0.85) regrown Al(Ga)N layers were deposited on AlN on Sapphire template using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) techniques. The optimization of the deposition conditions such as temperature, V/III ratio, deposition rate, and Si concentration resulted in a high charge carrier concentration (&gt;$10^{15}/cm^{3}$) in the Si-doped Al-rich Al(Ga)N films. A pulsed deposition condition was employed to achieve a controllable Al composition greater than 95% and to prevent unintended Ga incorporation in the AlGaN material deposited using the close-coupled showerhead reactor. Also, the effect of unintentional Si incorporation on free charge carrier concentration at the regrowth interface was observed by varying the thickness of the regrown Al(Ga)N layer. A maximum charge carrier concentration of $4.8\times 10^{16}/cm^3$ and $7.5\times 10^{15}/cm^3$ were achieved for Al0.97Ga0.03N and AlN films with thickness &lt;300 nm compared to previously reported n-Al(Ga)N films with thickness $\ge$400 nm deposited using MOCVD technique.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a computationally efficient methodology that utilizes a local real-space formulation of the projector augmented wave (PAW) method discretized with a finite-element (FE) basis to enable accurate and large-scale electronic structure calculations. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first real-space approach for DFT calculations, combining the efficiency of PAW formalism involving smooth electronic fields with the ability of systematically improvable higher-order finite-element basis to achieve significant computational gains. In particular, we have developed efficient strategies for solving the underlying FE discretized PAW generalized eigenproblem by employing the Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration approach to compute the desired eigenspace in each self-consistent field iteration. These strategies leverage the low-rank perturbation of the FE basis overlap matrix in conjunction with reduced order quadrature rules to invert the discretized PAW overlap matrix while also exploiting the sparsity of both the local and non-local parts of the discretized PAW Hamiltonian and overlap matrices. Using the proposed approach, we benchmark the accuracy and performance on various representative examples involving periodic and non-periodic systems with plane-wave-based PAW implementations. Furthermore, we also demonstrate a considerable computational advantage ($\sim$ 5$\times$ -- 10$\times$) over state-of-the-art plane-wave methods for medium to large-scale systems ($\sim$ 6,000 -- 35,000 electrons). Finally, we show that our approach (PAW-FE) significantly reduces the degrees of freedom to achieve the desired accuracy, thereby enabling large-scale DFT simulations ($&gt;$ 50,000 electrons) at an order of magnitude lower computational cost compared to norm-conserving pseudopotential calculations.</description>
