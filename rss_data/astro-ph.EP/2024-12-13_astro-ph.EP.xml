      <title>The Spin-Orbit Alignment of 8 Warm Gas Giant Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Essential information about the formation and evolution of planetary systems can be found in their architectures -- in particular, in stellar obliquity ($\psi$) -- as they serve as a signature of their dynamical evolution. Here, we present ESPRESSO observations of the Rossiter-Mclaughlin (RM) effect of 8 warm gas giants, revealing that independent of the eccentricities, all of them have relatively aligned orbits. Our 5 warm Jupiters -- WASP-106 b, WASP-130 b, TOI-558 b, TOI-4515 b, and TOI-5027 b -- have sky-projected obliquities $|\lambda|\simeq0-10$ deg while the 2 less massive warm Saturns -- K2-139 b and K2-329 A b -- are slightly misaligned having $|\lambda|\simeq15-25$ deg. Furthermore, for K2-139 b, K2-329 A b, and TOI-4515 b, we also measure true 3D obliquities $\psi\simeq15-30$ deg. We also report a non-detection of the RM effect produced by TOI-2179 b. Through hierarchical Bayesian modeling of the true 3D obliquities of hot and warm Jupiters, we find that around single stars, warm Jupiters are statistically more aligned than hot Jupiters. Independent of eccentricities, 95\% of the warm Jupiters have $\psi\lesssim30$ deg with no misaligned planets, while hot Jupiters show an almost isotropic distribution of misaligned systems. This implies that around single stars, warm Jupiters form in primordially aligned protoplanetary disks and subsequently evolve in a more quiescent way than hot Jupiters. Finally, we find that Saturns may have slightly more misaligned orbits than warm Jupiters, but more obliquity measurements are necessary to be conclusive.</description>

      <title>Two Earth-size Planets and an Earth-size Candidate Transiting the Nearby Star HD 101581</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the validation of multiple planets transiting the nearby ($d = 12.8$ pc) K5V dwarf HD 101581 (GJ 435, TOI-6276, TIC 397362481). The system consists of at least two Earth-size planets whose orbits are near a mutual 4:3 mean-motion resonance, HD 101581 b ($R_{p} = 0.956_{-0.061}^{+0.063}~R_{\oplus}$, $P = 4.47$ days) and HD 101581 c ($R_{p} = 0.990_{-0.070}^{+0.070}~R_{\oplus}$, $P = 6.21$ days). Both planets were discovered in Sectors 63 and 64 TESS observations and statistically validated with supporting ground-based follow-up. We also identify a signal that probably originates from a third transiting planet, TOI-6276.03 ($R_{p} = 0.982_{-0.098}^{+0.114}~R_{\oplus}$, $P = 7.87$ days). These planets are remarkably uniform in size and their orbits are evenly spaced, representing a prime example of the "peas-in-a-pod" architecture seen in other compact multi-planet systems. At $V = 7.77$, HD 101581 is the brightest star known to host multiple transiting planets smaller than $1.5~R_{\oplus}$. HD 101581 is a promising system for atmospheric characterization and comparative planetology of small planets.</description>

      <title>Journey of complex organic molecules: Formation and transport in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex organic molecules serve as indicators of molecular diversity. Their detection on comets, planets, and moons has prompted inquiries into their origins, particularly the conditions conducive to their formation. One hypothesis suggests that the UV irradiation of icy grains in the protosolar nebula generates significant molecular complexity, a hypothesis supported by experiments on methanol ice irradiation. We investigated the irradiation of methanol ice particles as they migrate through the protosolar nebula. Our objective is to ascertain whether the encountered conditions facilitate the formation of complex organics molecules, and we leverage experimental data in our analysis. We developed a two-dimensional model that describes the transport of pebbles during the evolution of the protosolar nebula, employing a Lagrangian scheme. This model computes the interstellar UV flux received by the particles along their paths, which we compared with experimental values. On average, particles ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers in size, released at a local temperature of 20 K, undergo adequate irradiation to attain the same molecular diversity as methanol ice during the experiments within timescales of 25 kyr of protosolar nebula evolution. In contrast, 1 cm sized particles require 911 kyr of irradiation to reach similar molecular diversity, making comparable molecular complexity unlikely. Similarly, particles ranging from 1 to 100 micrometers in size, released at a local temperature of 80 K, receive sufficient irradiation after 141 and 359 kyr. The particles readily receive the irradiation dose necessary to generate the molecular diversity observed in the experiments within the outer regions of the disk. Our model, combined with future irradiation experiments, can provide additional insights into the specific regions where the building blocks of planets form.</description>

      <title>Meteoroid Ablation within the Jovian Atmosphere: Implications on the Oxygen Delivery to the Gas Giant's Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of water molecules within the atmosphere of Jupiter, first by the Galileo Atmospheric Probe, and later by the Juno spacecraft, has given rise to the question of whether those molecules are sourced endogenously or exogenously. One hypothesis is that the ablation of meteoroids deposited the necessary oxygen into the atmosphere, which was subsequently used in chemical processes to form water. This paper aims to evaluate this hypothesis by simulating the ablation of carbonaceous objects entering the planet's atmosphere to determine the possible rates of oxygen delivery and the most likely altitude for such delivery within the Jovian atmosphere. We estimate that carbonaceous meteoroids have the potential to deliver $\sim 1.4 \times 10^7 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over a billion years. We further estimate that most of the ablation is expected to occur in the stratosphere, or 450-400 km above the region of 1 bar of atmospheric pressure. In comparison, Interplanetary Dust Particles (IDPs) are estimated to deliver roughly $\sim 10^2 \, \text{kg/m}^2$ of oxygen over the same period.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Temperature Variations In Protoplanetary disks: I. Linear Theory and Corotating Spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks can exhibit asymmetric temperature variations due to phenomena such as shadows cast by the inner disk or localized heating by young planets. We have performed both linear analyses and hydrodynamical simulations to investigate the disk perturbations induced by these asymmetric temperature variations. Our findings demonstrate that the effects of temperature variations share similarities with those caused by external potentials. Specifically, rotating temperature variations launch steady spiral structures at Lindblad resonances, which corotate with the temperature patterns. When the cooling time exceeds the orbital period, these spiral structures are significantly weakened. Then, depending on the boundary condition, a checkerboard pattern can appear. We provide expressions for the amplitudes of the resulting density and velocity perturbations, primarily determined by the magnitude of the temperature variations. Notably, a temperature variation of about 10\% can induce spirals with density perturbation amplitudes of order unity, comparable to those generated by a thermal mass planet. The coupling between temperature variations and spirals outside the resonances leads to a radially varying angular momentum flux, which could result in efficient ring formation within the disk. We speculate that spirals induced by temperature variations may contribute to disk accretion. Overall, considering that irradiation determines the temperature structure of protoplanetary disks, the change of irradiation both spatially or/and temporarily may produce observable effects in protoplanetary disks, especially spirals in outer disks beyond tens of AU.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of massless particles in star clusters with NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS: I. Free-floating MLPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Low-mass bodies, such as comets, asteroids, planetesimals, and free-floating planets, are continuously injected into the intra-cluster environment after expulsion from their host planetary systems. These can be modeled as massless particles (MLPs, hereafter). The dynamics of large populations of MLPs, however, has yet received little attention in literature. Aims. We investigate the dynamical evolution of MLP populations in star clusters, and characterize their kinematics and ejection rates. Methods. We present NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS, a modified version of the N-body simulation code NBODY6++GPU, that allows fast integration of star clusters that contain large numbers of massless particles (MLPs). NBODY6++GPU-MASSLESS contains routines specifically directed at the dynamical evolution of low-mass bodies, such as planets. Results. Unlike stars, MLPs do not participate in the mass segregation process. Instead, MLPs mostly follow the gravitational potential of the star cluster, which gradually decreases over time due to stellar ejections and stellar evolution. The dynamical evolution of MLPs is primarily affected by the evolution of the core of the star cluster. This is most apparent in the outer regions for clusters with higher initial densities. High escape rates of MLPs are observed before the core-collapse, after which escape rates remain stable. Denser star clusters undergo a more intense core collapse, but this does not impact the dynamical evolution of MLPs. The speeds of escaping stars are similar to those of escaping MLPs, when disregarding the high-velocity ejections of neutron stars during the first 50 Myr.</description>

      <title>Stellar parameter prediction and spectral simulation using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied machine learning to the entire data history of ESO's High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) instrument. Our primary goal was to recover the physical properties of the observed objects, with a secondary emphasis on simulating spectra. We systematically investigated the impact of various factors on the accuracy and fidelity of the results, including the use of simulated data, the effect of varying amounts of real training data, network architectures, and learning paradigms. Our approach integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques within autoencoder frameworks. Our methodology leverages an existing simulation model that utilizes a library of existing stellar spectra in which the emerging flux is computed from first principles rooted in physics and a HARPS instrument model to generate simulated spectra comparable to observational data. We trained standard and variational autoencoders on HARPS data to predict spectral parameters and generate spectra. Our models excel at predicting spectral parameters and compressing real spectra, and they achieved a mean prediction error of approximately 50 K for effective temperatures, making them relevant for most astrophysical applications. Furthermore, the models predict metallicity ([M/H]) and surface gravity (log g) with an accuracy of approximately 0.03 dex and 0.04 dex, respectively, underscoring their broad applicability in astrophysical research. The models' computational efficiency, with processing times of 779.6 ms on CPU and 3.97 ms on GPU, makes them valuable for high-throughput applications like massive spectroscopic surveys and large archival studies. By achieving accuracy comparable to classical methods with significantly reduced computation time, our methodology enhances the scope and efficiency of spectroscopic analysis.</description>

      <title>Substellar candidates at the earliest stages: the SUCANES database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs are the bridge between low-mass stars and giant planets. One way of shedding light on their dominant formation mechanism is to study them at the earliest stages of their evolution, when they are deeply embedded in their parental clouds. Several works have identified pre- and proto-brown dwarfs candidates using different observational approaches. The aim of this work is to create a database with all the objects classified as very young substellar candidates in the litearature in order to study them in an homogeneous way. We have gathered all the information about very young substellar candidates available in the literature until 2020. We have retrieved their published photometry from the optical to the centimeter regime, and we have written our own codes to derive their bolometric temperatures and luminosities, and their internal luminosities. We have also populated the database with other parameters extracted from the literature, like e.g. the envelope masses, their detection in some molecular species, and presence of outflows. The result of our search is the SUCANES database, containing 174 objects classified as potential very young substellar candidates in the literature. We present an analysis of the main properties of the retrieved objects. Since we have updated the distances to several star forming regions, this has allowed us to reject some candidates based on their internal luminosities. We have also discussed the derived physical parameters and envelope masses for the best substellar candidates isolated in SUCANES. As an example of a scientific exploitation of this database, we present a feasibility study for the detection of radiojets with upcoming facilities: the ngVLA and the SKA interferometers. The SUCANES database is accessible through a Graphical User Interface and it is open to any potential user.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic observations of flares and superflares on AU Mic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The young active flare star AU~Mic is the planet host star with the highest flare rate from TESS data. Therefore, it represents an ideal target for dedicated ground-based monitoring campaigns with the aim to characterize its numerous flares spectroscopically. We performed such spectroscopic monitoring with the ESO1.52m telescope of the PLATOSpec consortium. In more than 190 hours of observations, we find 24 flares suitable for detailed analysis. We compute their parameters (duration, peak flux, energy) in eight chromospheric lines (H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, H$\gamma$, H$\delta$, Na I D1&amp;D2, He I D3, He I 6678) and investigate their relationships. Furthermore, we obtained simultaneous photometric observations and low-resolution spectroscopy for part of the spectroscopic runs. We detect one flare in the g'-band photometry which is associated with a spectroscopic flare. Additionally, an extreme flare event occurred on 2023-09-16 of which only a time around its possible peak was observed, during which chromospheric line fluxes were raised by up to a factor of three compared to the following night. The estimated energy of this event is around $10^{33}$ erg in H$\alpha$ alone, i.e. a rare chromospheric line superflare.</description>

      <title>Dusty substructures induced by planets in ALMA disks: how dust growth and dynamics changes the picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks exhibit a rich variety of substructure in millimeter continuum emission, often attributed to unseen planets. As these planets carve gaps in the gas, dust particles can accumulate in the resulting pressure bumps, forming bright features in the dust continuum. We investigate the role of dust dynamics in the gap-opening process with 2D radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet--disk interaction and a two-population dust component modeled as a pressureless fluid. We consider the opacity feedback and backreaction due to drag forces as mm grains accumulate in pressure bumps at different stages of dust growth. We find that dust dynamics can significantly affect the resulting substructure driven by the quasi-thermal-mass planet with $M_p/M_\star=10^{-4}$. Opacity feedback causes nonaxisymmetric features to become more compact in azimuth, whereas the drag-induced backreaction tends to dissolve nonaxisymmetries. For our fiducial model, this results in multiple concentric rings of dust rather than the expected vortices and corotating dust clumps found in models without dust feedback. A higher coagulation fraction disproportionately enhances the effect of dust opacity feedback, favoring the formation of crescents rather than rings. Our results suggest that turbulent diffusion is not always necessary to explain the rarity of observed nonaxisymmetric features, and that incorporating dust dynamics is vital for interpreting the observed substructure in protoplanetary disks. We also describe and test the implementation of the publicly-available dust fluid module in the PLUTO code.</description>

      <title>JWST captures a sudden stellar outburst and inner disk wall destruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI observations of T~Cha, a highly variable ($\Delta V \sim$3-5\,mag) accreting Sun-like star surrounded by a disk with a large ($\sim 15$\,au) dust gap. We find that the JWST mid-infrared spectrum is signiticantly different from the {\it Spitzer} spectrum obtained 17 years before, where the emission at short wavelengths ($5-10 \mu m$) has decreased by $\sim 2/3$ while at longer wavelengths ($15-25 \mu m$) it increased by up to a factor of $\sim 3$. This 'seesaw' behavior is contemporary with a fairly constant higher optical emission captured by the All Sky Automated Survey. By analyzing and modelling both SEDs, we propose that JWST caught the star during an outburst that destructed the asymmetric inner disk wall responsible for the high optical variability and lower $15-25$\,micron\ emission during the {\it Spitzer} time. The dust mass lost during this outburst is estimated to be comparable ($\sim 1/5$) to the upper limit of the total micron-sized dust mass in the inner disk of T~Cha now. Monitoring this system during possible future outbursts and more observations of its quiescent state will reveal if the inner disk can be replenished or will continue to be depleted and vanish.</description>

Abstract: The most prominent of the IRAS debris disk systems, $\alpha$ Lyrae (Vega), at a distance of 7.7 pc, has been observed by both the NIRCam and MIRI instruments on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This paper describes NIRCam coronagraphic observations which have achieved F444W contrast levels of 3$\times10^{-7}$ at 1\arcsec\ (7.7 au), 1$\times10^{-7}$ at 2\arcsec\ (15 au) and few $\times 10^{-8}$ beyond 5\arcsec\ (38 au), corresponding to masses of $&lt;$ 3, 2 and 0.5 MJup for a system age of 700 Myr. Two F444W objects are identified in the outer MIRI debris disk, around 48 au. One of these is detected by MIRI, appears to be extended and has a spectral energy distribution similar to those of distant extragalactic sources. The second one also appears extended in the NIRCam data suggestive of an extragalactic nature.The NIRCam limits within the inner disk (1\arcsec\ --10\arcsec) correspond to a model-dependent masses of 2$\sim$3 \mj. \citet{Su2024} argue that planets larger even 0.3 MJup would disrupt the smooth disk structure seen at MIRI wavelengths. Eight additional objects are found within 60\arcsec\ of Vega, but none has astrometric properties or colors consistent with planet candidates. These observations reach a level consistent with expected Jeans Mass limits. Deeper observations achieving contrast levels $&lt;10^{-8}$ outside of $\sim$4\arcsec\ and reaching masses below that of Saturn are possible, but may not reveal a large population of new objects.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Star-planet Interactions</title>

Abstract: Planets interact with their host stars through gravity, radiation and magnetic fields, and for those giant planets that orbit their stars within ~10 stellar radii (~0.1 AU for a sun-like star), star-planet interactions (SPI) are observable with a wide variety of photometric, spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric studies. At such close distances, the planet orbits within the sub-alfvenic radius of the star in which the transfer of energy and angular momentum between the two bodies is particularly efficient. The magnetic interactions appear as enhanced stellar activity modulated by the planet as it orbits the star rather than only by stellar rotation. Such observations allowed for the determination of the magnetic field strengths on the surfaces of four hot Jupiters. These vary between 20 G and 120 G, in line with scaling laws that connect the strength of the magnetic field to the internal heat flow in giant planets. These field strengths are informative for the study of the internal dynamics and atmospheric evolution of exoplanets. The nature of magnetic SPI is modeled to be strongly affected by both the stellar and planetary magnetic fields, possibly influencing the magnetic activity of both, as well as affecting the particle environment, the migration of the planet, and even the rotational evolution of the star. As phase-resolved observational techniques are applied to a large statistical sample of hot Jupiter systems, extensions to other tightly orbiting stellar systems, such as smaller planets close to M dwarfs become possible. In these systems, star-planet separations of tens of stellar radii begin to coincide with the radiative habitable zone where planetary magnetic fields are likely a necessary condition for surface habitability.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Near-Real Time Thermospheric Density Retrieval Methods from Precise Low Earth Orbit Spacecraft Ephemerides During Geomagnetic Storms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16805</link>

Abstract: Characterizing the density of the thermosphere during geomagnetic storms is critical for both thermosphere modelling efforts and satellite operations. Accurate near-real time density estimates can feed into data assimilation schemes and provide operators with an early warning system for storm-triggered drag increases. This study evaluates two methods for generating near-real time thermospheric density estimates: the Energy Dissipation Rate (EDR) method and the Precise Orbit Determination (POD)-accelerometry method.
  Using accelerometer-derived densities from the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment Follow-On (GRACE-FO) and Challenging Minisatellite Payload (CHAMP) spacecraft as truth over 45 geomagnetic storms, the POD accelerometry method was found to surpass EDR density retrieval as well as one commonly used atmospheric density model (DTM2000) in terms of mean absolute percentage error (by 113.30\% and 130.64\%, respectively). The POD accelerometry method is comparable, albeit slightly worse, than two other models: JB2008 (-8.74\%) and NRLMSISE-00 (-22.74\%). These results highlight the potential for near-real-time density inversion to rival models driven by post-processed indices, which outperform these same models in an operational setting, where they rely on forecasted or nowcasted indices.
  By applying the POD accelerometry method along the orbits of three LEO satellite orbits during 80 geomagnetic storms (2001--2024), this study illustrates the potential of POD accelerometry as a near-real-time resource for the thermosphere and satellite operations community. The accompanying codebase facilitates broader adoption of these techniques, advancing both storm-time modelling and operational response capabilities.</description>
