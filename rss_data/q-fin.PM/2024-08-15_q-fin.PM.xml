      <title>Portfolio and reinsurance optimization under unknown market price of risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the optimal investment-reinsurance problem for insurance company with partial information on the market price of the risk. Through the use of filtering techniques we convert the original optimization problem involving different filtrations, into an equivalent stochastic control problem under the observation filtration only, the so-called separated problem. The Markovian structure of the separated problem allows us to apply a classical approach to stochastic optimization based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and to provide explicit formulas for the value function and the optimal investment-reinsurance strategy. We finally discuss some comparisons between the optimal strategies pursued by a partially informed insurer and that followed by a fully informed insurer, and we evaluate the value of information using the idea of indifference pricing. These results are also supported by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Predicting the distributions of stock returns around the globe in the era of big data and learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for accurately predicting the full distribution of stock returns, given a comprehensive set of 194 stock characteristics and market variables. Such distributions, learned from rich data using a machine learning algorithm, are not constrained by restrictive model assumptions and allow the exploration of non-Gaussian, heavy-tailed data and their non-linear interactions. The method uses a two-stage quantile neural network combined with spline interpolation. The results show that the proposed approach outperforms alternative models in terms of out-of-sample losses. Furthermore, we show that the moments derived from such distributions can be useful as alternative empirical estimates in many cases, including mean estimation and forecasting. Finally, we examine the relationship between cross-sectional returns and several distributional characteristics. The results are robust to a wide range of US and international data.</description>

      <title>AI-Powered Energy Algorithmic Trading: Integrating Hidden Markov Models with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantitative finance, machine learning methods are essential for alpha generation. This study introduces a new approach that combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio optimization. During the COVID period (2019-2022), this dual-model approach achieved a 83% return with a Sharpe ratio of 0.77. It incorporates two risk models to enhance risk management, showing efficiency during volatile periods. The methodology was implemented on the QuantConnect platform, which was chosen for its robust framework and experimental reproducibility. The system, which predicts future price movements, includes a three-year warm-up to ensure proper algorithm function. It targets highly liquid, large-cap energy stocks to ensure stable and predictable performance while also considering broker payments. The dual-model alpha system utilizes log returns to select the optimal state based on the historical performance. It combines state predictions with neural network outputs, which are based on historical data, to generate trading signals. This study examined the architecture of the trading system, data pre-processing, training, and performance. The full code and backtesting data are available under the QuantConnect terms.</description>
