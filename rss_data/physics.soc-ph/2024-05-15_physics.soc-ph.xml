      <title>No evidence of systematic proximity ascertainment bias in early COVID-19 cases in Wuhan Reply to Weissman (2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a short text published as Letter to the Editor of the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series A, Weissman (2024) argues that the finding that early COVID-19 cases without an ascertained link to Wuhan's Huanan Seafood Wholesale market resided on average closer to the market than cases epidemiologically linked to it, reveals "major proximity ascertainment bias". Here we show that Weissman's conclusion is based on a flawed premise, and that there is no such "internal evidence" of major bias. The pattern can indeed be explained by places of infection not being limited to residential neighbourhoods, and by stochasticity -- i.e., without requiring any ascertainment bias.</description>

      <title>Community detection in bipartite signed networks is highly dependent on parameter choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making processes often involve voting. Human interactions with exogenous entities such as legislations or products can be effectively modeled as two-mode (bipartite) signed networks-where people can either vote positively, negatively, or abstain from voting on the entities. Detecting communities in such networks could help us understand underlying properties: for example ideological camps or consumer preferences. While community detection is an established practice separately for bipartite and signed networks, it remains largely unexplored in the case of bipartite signed networks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of community detection methods on bipartite signed networks using a synthetic benchmark and real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that when no communities are present in the data, these methods often recover spurious communities. When communities are present, the algorithms exhibit promising performance, although their performance is highly susceptible to parameter choice. This indicates that researchers using community detection methods in the context of bipartite signed networks should not take the communities found at face value: it is essential to assess the robustness of parameter choices or perform domain-specific external validation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the spatial segmentation of housing markets from online listings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The real estate market shows an inherent connection to space. Real estate agencies unevenly operate and specialize across space, price and type of properties, thereby segmenting the market into submarkets. We introduce here a methodology based on multipartite networks to detect the spatial segmentation emerging from data on housing online listings. Considering the spatial information of the listings, we build a bipartite network that connects agencies and spatial units. This bipartite network is projected into a network of spatial units, whose connections account for similarities in the agency ecosystem. We then apply clustering methods to this network to segment markets into spatially-coherent regions, which are found to be robust across different clustering detection algorithms, discretization of space and spatial scales, and across countries with case studies in France and Spain. This methodology addresses the long-standing issue of housing market segmentation, relevant in disciplines such as urban studies and spatial economics, and with implications for policymaking.</description>

      <title>Decomposing geographical and universal aspects of human mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by access to large volumes of detailed movement data, the study of human mobility has grown rapidly over the past decade. This body of work has argued that human mobility is scale-free, has proposed models to generate scale-free moving distance distribution, and explained how the scale-free distribution arises from aggregating displacements across scales. However, the field of human mobility has not explicitly addressed how mobility is structured by geographical constraints - such as the outlines of landmasses, lakes, rivers, the placement of buildings, roadways, and cities.
  Using unique datasets capturing millions of movements between precise locations, this paper shows how separating the effect of geography from mobility choices reveals a universal power law spanning five orders of magnitude (from 10 m to 1,000,000 m). We incorporate geography through the pair distribution function, a fundamental quantity from condensed matter physics that encapsulates the structure of locations on which mobility occurs. This distribution captures the constraints that geography places on human mobility across different length scales.
  Our description conclusively addresses debates between distance-based and opportunity-based perspectives on human mobility. By demonstrating how the spatial distribution of human settlements shapes human mobility, we provide a novel perspective that bridges the gap between these previously opposing ideas.</description>

      <title>Biased versus unbiased numerical methods for stochastic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.02902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate numerical methods are one of the most used strategies to extract information from many-interacting-agents systems. In particular, numerical approximations are of extended use to deal with epidemic, ecological and biological models, since unbiased methods like the Gillespie algorithm can become unpractical due to high CPU time usage required. However, the use of approximations has been debated and there is no clear consensus about whether unbiased methods or biased approach is the best option. In this work, we derive scaling relations for the errors in approximations based on binomial extractions. This finding allows us to build rules to compute the optimal values of both the discretization time and number of realizations needed to compute averages with the biased method with a target precision and minimum CPU-time usage. Furthermore, we also present another rule to discern whether the unbiased method or biased approach is more efficient. Ultimately, we will show that the choice of the method should depend on the desired precision for the estimation of averages.</description>

      <title>Valuing maintenance strategies for fusion plants as part of a future electricity grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scheduled maintenance is likely to be lengthy and therefore consequential for the economics of fusion power plants. The maintenance strategy that maximizes the economic value of a plant depends on internal factors such as the cost and durability of the replaceable components, the frequency and duration of the maintenance blocks, and the external factors of the electricity system in which the plant operates. This paper examines the value of fusion power plants with various maintenance properties in a decarbonized United States Eastern Interconnection circa 2050. Seasonal variations in electricity supply and demand mean that certain times of year, particularly spring to early summer, are best for scheduled maintenance. Seasonality has two important consequences. First, the value of a plant can be 15% higher than what one would naively expect if value were directly proportional to its availability. Second, in some cases, replacing fractions of a component in shorter maintenance blocks spread over multiple years is better than replacing it all at once during a longer outage, even through the overall availability of the plant is lower in the former scenario.</description>

      <title>A Galton Board Approximation Method for Estimating Pedestrian Walking Preferences within Crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Galton board approximation method to analyze the potential walking preferences of pedestrians. We employ the binomial distribution to estimate the walking preferences of pedestrians in dynamic crowds. Estimating the probability of the right-side preference $(p)$ based on observational data poses the challenge, as statistical measures such as means and variances often lead to divergent results. This paper aims to explore this issue.</description>

      <title>A method for characterizing disease emergence curves from paired pathogen detection and serology data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wildlife disease surveillance programs and research studies track infection and identify risk factors for wild populations, humans, and agriculture. Often, several types of samples are collected from individuals to provide more complete information about an animal's infection history. Methods that jointly analyze multiple data streams to study disease emergence and drivers of infection via epidemiological process models remain underdeveloped. Joint-analysis methods can more thoroughly analyze all available data, more precisely quantifying epidemic processes, outbreak status, and risks. We contribute a paired data modeling approach that analyzes multiple samples from individuals. We use "characterization maps" to link paired data to epidemiological processes through a hierarchical statistical observation model. Our approach can provide both Bayesian and frequentist estimates of epidemiological parameters and state. We motivate our approach through the need to use paired pathogen and antibody detection tests to estimate parameters and infection trajectories for the widely applicable susceptible, infectious, recovered (SIR) model. We contribute general formulas to link characterization maps to arbitrary process models and datasets and an extended SIR model that better accommodates paired data. We find via simulation that paired data can more efficiently estimate SIR parameters than unpaired data, requiring samples from 5-10 times fewer individuals. We then study SARS-CoV-2 in wild White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) from three counties in the United States. Estimates for average infectious times corroborate captive animal studies. Our methods use general statistical theory to let applications extend beyond the SIR model we consider, and to more complicated examples of paired data.</description>
