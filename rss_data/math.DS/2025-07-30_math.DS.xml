      <title>Undecidability of the block gluing classes of homshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A homshift is a $d$-dimensional shift of finite type which arises as the space of graph homomorphisms from the grid graph $\mathbb Z^d$ to a finite connected undirected graph $G$. While shifts of finite type are known to be mired by the swamp of undecidability, homshifts seem to be better behaved and there was hope that all the properties of homshifts are decidable. In this paper we build on the work by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha (arxiv:2211.04075) to show that finer mixing properties are undecidable for reasons completely different than the ones used to prove undecidability for general multidimensional shifts of finite type. Inspired by the work of Gao, Jackson, Krohne and Seward (arxiv:1803.03872) and elementary algebraic topology, we interpret the square cover introduced by Gangloff, Hellouin de Menibus and Oprocha topologically. Using this interpretation, we prove that it is undecidable whether a homshift is $\Theta(n)$-block gluing or not, by relating this problem to the one of finiteness for finitely presented groups.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of random Bernoulli convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21605v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate random Bernoulli convolutions, namely, probability measures given by the infinite convolution
  \[
  \mu_\omega = \mathop{\circledast}_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\delta_0 + \delta_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \ldots \lambda_{k-1} \lambda_k}}{2} \right),
  \] where $\omega=(\lambda_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables each following the uniform distribution on some fixed interval. We study the regularity of these measures and prove that when $\exp\mathbb{E}\left( \log \lambda_1\right)&gt;\frac{2}{\pi}, $ the Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}_\omega$ is an $L^{1}$ function almost surely. This in turn implies that the corresponding random self-similar set supporting $\mu_{\omega}$ has non-empty interior almost surely. This improves upon a previous bound due to Peres, Simon and Solomyak. Furthermore, under no assumptions on the value of $\exp \mathbb{E}(\log \lambda_1), $ we prove that $\widehat \mu_\omega$ will decay to zero at a polynomial rate almost surely.</description>

      <title>Some Generic Properties of Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given ergodic measure preserving transformation T of a standard measure space each finite labelled partition defines an ergodic stationary process. There is a complete metric on the space of partitions which is separable. Various generic properties of these processes will be given. For example: 1. The generic partition defines a process that is not Rosenblatt mixing. 2. If T is a K-automorphism that is not Bernoulli then the generic partition is also K but not Bernoulli. Extensions to the relative setting and to actions of amenable groups will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>On linearly ordered sets of chain components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21798v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the chain components arising from a dynamical system $(X,f)$, with $X$ a compact metric space, from the point of view of poset theory, considering both the case in which $f$ is a continuous map and the general case in which no regularity assumption is made.
  Our main result are that, if $f$ is continuous, we have that:
  - the chain components poset cannot be linearly and densely ordered;
  - every countable well-order with a maximum is the order type of the chain components poset of an interval map.
  If no regularity assumption is made, we have that:
  - there is a dynamical system on the interval whose chain components poset is countable and densely ordered;
  - any countable linearly ordered subset of the chain components poset must have a minimum element.</description>

      <title>The interplay of $\mu$-dichotomy, bounded growth, and spectral properties via growth rate comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of the dichotomy spectrum of nonautonomous linear systems under general growth rates. By introducing comparison criteria we clarify how $\mu$-dichotomy and $\mu$-bounded growth interact. We also study the evolution of the dichotomy spectrum under these comparisons, revealing that faster growth rates compress the spectrum, while slower growth rates expand it. Moreover, we introduce equivalence relations on the set of growth rates, which enable us to establish that, for any given system, there exists -- up to equivalence -- at most one growth rate under which both properties, bounded growth and dichotomy, hold. Finally, we show that these equivalence relations lead to a classification of dichotomy spectra. Our results are valid in both discrete and continuous time settings.</description>

      <title>Exponentially mixing flows with slow enhanced dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21305v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a passive scalar which is advected by an incompressible flow $u$ and has small molecular diffusivity $\kappa$. Previous results show that if $u$ is exponentially mixing and $C^1$, then the dissipation time is $O(|\log \kappa|^2)$. We produce a family of incompressible flows which are $C^0$ and exponentially mixing, uniformly in $\kappa$; however have a dissipation time of order $1/\kappa$ (i.e. exhibits no enhanced dissipation). We also estimate the dissipation time of mixing flows, and obtain improved bounds in terms of the mixing rate with explicit constants, and allow for a time inhomogeneous mixing rate which is typical for random constructions of mixing flows.</description>

      <title>Mean field limit for interacting systems on co-evolving networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interacting particle systems are in frequent use to model collective behaviour in various situations and applications. For many systems, the interaction between the agents is restricted to an underlying network structure and often, the latter also evolves in time with its dynamics coupled to the evolution of the particles. Due to their relevance for applications such systems on adaptive or co-evolutionary networks have received increasing interest in recent years. In particular, a fundamental question concerns the behaviour of the system in the infinite particle limit. In this work we provide a mean-field description for a general particle system which exhibits non-locality in time (memory). The result applies particularly to a large class of systems on co-evolving networks including non-linear weight dynamics.</description>

      <title>Green's function estimates for long-range quasi-periodic operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish quantitative Green's function estimates for a class of quasi-periodic (QP) operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with certain slowly decaying long-range hopping and analytic cosine type potentials. As applications, we prove the arithmetic spectral localization, and obtain upper bounds on quantum dynamics for all phase parameters. To deal with quantum dynamics estimates, we develop an approach employing separation property (rather than the sublinear bound) of resonant blocks in the regime of Green's function estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the adjoint path-kernel method for the parameter-gradient of SDEs, where the observable is averaged at a particular time or over the stationary measure. Its cost is almost independent of the number of parameters; it extends the conventional backpropagation method to cases with gradient explosion. It works for non-hyperbolic systems with multiplicative noise controlled by parameters. We derive a Monte-Carlo-type algorithm and demonstrate it on the 40-dimensional Lorenz 96 system.</description>

      <title>Excess-continuous prox-regular sweeping processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the Moreau's sweeping processes driven by a time dependent prox-regular set $C(t)$ which is continuous in time with respect to the asymmetric distance $e$ called the excess, defined by $e(A,B) := \sup_{x \in A} d(x,B)$ for every pair of sets $A$, $B$ in a Hilbert space. As observed by J.J. Moreau in his pioneering works, the excess provides the natural topological framework for sweeping process. Assuming a uniform interior cone condition for $C(t)$, we prove that the associated sweeping process has a unique solution, thereby improving the existing result on continuous prox-regular sweeping processes in two directions: indeed, in the previous literature $C(t)$ was supposed to be continuous in time with respect to the symmetric Hausdorff distance instead of the excess and also its boundary $\partial C(t)$ was required to be continuous in time, an assumption which we completely drop. Therefore our result allows to consider a much wider class of continuously moving constraints.</description>

Abstract: We establish character rigidity for all non-uniform higher-rank irreducible lattices in semisimple groups of characteristic other than 2. This implies stabilizer rigidity for probability measure preserving actions and rigidity of invariant random subgroups, confirming a conjecture of Stuck and Zimmer for non-uniform lattices in full generality.</description>

Abstract: We show a local rigidity result for the integrability of symplectic billiards. We prove that any domain which is close to an ellipse, and for which the symplectic billiard map is rationally integrable must be an ellipse as well. This is in spirit of the result of Avila, De Simoi, and Kaloshin for Birkhoff billiards.</description>

      <title>Linear Stability Analysis of Physics-Informed Random Projection Neural Networks for ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a linear stability analysis of physics-informed random projection neural networks (PI-RPNNs), for the numerical solution of {the initial value problem (IVP)} of (stiff) ODEs. We begin by proving that PI-RPNNs are uniform approximators of the solution to ODEs. We then provide a constructive proof demonstrating that PI-RPNNs offer consistent and asymptotically stable numerical schemes, thus convergent schemes. In particular, we prove that multi-collocation PI-RPNNs guarantee asymptotic stability. Our theoretical results are illustrated via numerical solutions of benchmark examples including indicative comparisons with the backward Euler method, the midpoint method, the trapezoidal rule, the 2-stage Gauss scheme, and the 2- and 3-stage Radau schemes.</description>

      <title>Attractors for weak and strong solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we obtain the existence of global attractors for the dynamical systems generated by weak solution of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with damping. We consider two cases, depending on the values of the parameters \b{eta},{\alpha} controlling the damping term and the viscosity {\mu}. First, for \b{eta} we define a multivalued dynamical systems and prove the existence of the global attractor as well. Second, for either \b{eta}&gt;3 or \b{eta}=3, 4{\alpha}{\mu}&gt;1 the weak solutions are unique and we prove that the global attractor for the corresponding semigroup is more regular. Also, we prove in this case that it is the global attractor for the semigroup generated by the strong solutions. Finally, some numerical simulations are performed.</description>
