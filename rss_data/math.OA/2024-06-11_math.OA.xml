      <title>On a question of Blecher, Pisier, Shlyakhtenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the failure of a matricial version of Grothendieck's theorem for operator spaces, thereby resolving a long-standing open question in the field. Moreover, by showing that such a counterexample can occur in the simplest context of commutative $C^*$-algebras, we address some other open questions in operator algebras. Our constructions, completely explicit and fairly simple, are inspired by some techniques in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Dilation distance and the stability of ergodic commutation relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and generalize the notion of dilation distance ${\rm d_{D}}(u,v)$ between unitary tuples and study its relation to the natural Haagerup-R{\o}rdam distance ${\rm d_{HR}}(u,v) = \inf\{\|\pi(u) - \rho(v)\|\}$, where the infimum is taken over all pairs of faithful representations $\pi \colon C^*(u) \to B(\mathcal{H})$, $\rho \colon C^*(v) \to B(\mathcal{H})$. We show that ${\rm d_{HR}}(u,v)\leq 10\operatorname{d_{rD}}(u,v)^{1/2}$, where ${\rm d_{rD}}(u,v)$ is a relaxed dilation distance, improving and extending earlier results. For an antisymmetric matrix $\Theta$, we show via a concrete dilation construction that a tuple of unitaries $u$ that almost commutes according to $\Theta$ (i.e., $\|u_\ell u_k - e^{i \theta_{k,\ell}} u_k u_\ell\|$ is small) can be nearly dilated to a tuple of unitaries $v$ that commutes according to $\Theta$ (i.e., $v_\ell v_k - e^{i \theta_{k,\ell}} v_k v_\ell = 0$). We show that the dilation can be "reversed" by a second application of the dilation construction, which leads to a rotated version of the original tuple. Thus, a gauge invariant almost $\Theta$-commuting unitary tuple can be approximated (in some faithful representation) by a $\Theta$-commuting unitary tuple. Moreover, when $\Theta$ is ergodic, a $\Theta$-commuting tuple is shown to be {\em almost} gauge invariant, and it follows from the results above that these can be approximated in norm by $\Theta$-commuting tuples. In particular, we obtain the following counterpart of Lin's theorem on almost commuting unitaries: if $q \in \mathbb{T}$ is {\em not} a root of unity, then for every $\varepsilon &gt;0$ there exists $\delta &gt; 0$ such that for every pair of unitaries $u_1,u_2 \in B(\mathcal{H})$ for which $\|u_1 u_2 - qu_2 u_1\| &lt; \delta$, there exists two $q$-commuting unitaries $v_1, v_2 \in B(\mathcal{H} \otimes \ell^2)$ such that $\|v_i - u_i \otimes 1\| &lt; \varepsilon$ ($i=1,2$).</description>

      <title>Absolute dilations of ucp self-adjoint Fourier multipliers: the non unimodular case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi$ be a normal semi-finite faithful weight on a von Neumann algebra $A$,let $(\sigma^\varphi_r)_{r\in{\mathbb R}}$ denote the modular automorphism group of $\varphi$, and let $T\colon A\to A$ be a linear map. We say that $T$ admits an absolute dilation if there exist another von Neumann algebra $M$ equipped with a normal semi-finite faithful weight $\psi$, a $w^*$-continuous, unital and weight-preserving $*$-homomorphism $J\colon A\to M$ such that $\sigma^\psi\circ J=J\circ \sigma^\varphi$, as well as a weight-preserving $*$-automorphism $U\colon M\to M$ such that $T^k={\mathbb E}_JU^kJ$ for all integer $k\geq 0$, where ${\mathbb E}_J\colon M\to A$ is the conditional expectation associated with $J$. Given any locally compact group $G$ and any real valued function $u\in C_b(G)$, we prove that if $u$ induces a unital completely positive Fourier multiplier $M_u\colon VN(G) \to VN(G)$, then $M_u$ admits an absolute dilation. Here $VN(G)$ is equiped with its Plangherel weight $\varphi_G$. This result had been settled by the first named author in the case when $G$ is unimodular so the salient point in this paper is that $G$ may be non unimodular, and hence $\varphi_G$ may not be a trace. The absolute dilation of $M_u$ implies that for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, the $L^p$-realization of $M_u$ can be dilated into an isometry acting on a non-commutative $L^p$-space. We further prove that if $u$ is valued in $[0,1]$, then the $L^p$-realization of $M_u$ is a Ritt operator with a bounded $H^\infty$-functional calculus.</description>

      <title>Operator-Valued Twisted Araki-Woods Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras. These are operator-valued versions of a class of second quantization algebras that includes $q$-Gaussian and $q$-Araki-Woods algebras and also generalize Shlyakhtenko's von Neumann algebras generated by operator-valued semicircular variables. We develop a disintegration theory that reduces the isomorphism type of operator-valued twisted Araki-Woods algebras over type I factors to the scalar-valued case. Moreover, these algebras come with a natural weight, and we characterize its modular theory. We also give sufficient criteria that guarantee that factoriality of these algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize supercyclic weighted composition operators on various function spaces. Moreover, we also characterize supercyclic adjoint of the weighted composition operator and supercyclic left multipliers acting on the space of compact operators.

      <title>Every locally compact group is the outer automorphism group of a II$_1$ factor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every locally compact second countable group $G$ arises as the outer automorphism group Out $M$ of a II$_1$ factor, which was so far only known for totally disconnected groups, compact groups and a few isolated examples. We obtain this result by proving that every locally compact second countable group is a centralizer group, a class of Polish groups that arise naturally in ergodic theory and that may all be realized as Out $M$.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Paszkiewicz's conjecture about a product of positive contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Paszkiewicz conjecture about a product of positive contractions asserts that given a decreasing sequence $T_1\ge T_2\ge \dots$ of positive contractions on a separable infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, the product $S_n=T_n\dots T_1$ converges strongly. Recently, the first named author verified the conjecture for certain classes of sequences. In this paper, we prove the Paszkiewicz conjecture in full generality. Moreover, we show that in some cases, a generalized version of the Paszkiewicz conjecture also holds.</description>
