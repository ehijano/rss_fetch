      <title>Unification of Finite Symmetries in Simulation of Many-body Systems on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental in the description and simulation of quantum systems. Leveraging symmetries in classical simulations of many-body quantum systems often results in an exponential overhead due to the exponentially growing size of some symmetry groups as the number of particles increases. Quantum computers hold the promise of achieving exponential speedup in simulating quantum many-body systems; however, a general method for utilizing symmetries in quantum simulations has not yet been established. In this work, we present a unified framework for incorporating symmetry groups into the simulation of many-body systems on quantum computers. The core of our approach lies in the development of efficient quantum circuits for symmetry-adapted projection onto irreducible representations of a group or pairs of commuting groups. We provide resource estimations for common groups, including the cyclic and permutation groups. Our algorithms demonstrate the capability to prepare coherent superpositions of symmetry-adapted states and to perform quantum evolution across a wide range of models in condensed matter physics and ab initio electronic structure in quantum chemistry. We execute a symmetry-adapted quantum subroutine for small molecules in first quantization on noisy hardware, and demonstrate the emulation of symmetry-adapted quantum phase estimation for preparing coherent superpositions of quantum states in various irreducible representations. In addition, we present a discussion of major open problems regarding the use of symmetries in digital quantum simulations of many-body systems, paving the way for future systematic investigations into leveraging symmetries for practical quantum advantage. The broad applicability and the efficiency of the proposed symmetry-adapted subroutine holds the promise for exponential speedup in quantum simulation of many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Routing Protocols for Reconfigurable Atom Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom arrays have emerged as a promising platform for both analog and digital quantum processing. Recently, devices capable of reconfiguring arrays during quantum processes have enabled new applications for these systems. Atom reconfiguration, or routing, is the core mechanism for programming circuits; optimizing this routing can increase processing speeds, reduce decoherence, and enable efficient implementations of highly non-local connections. In this work, we investigate routing models applicable to state-of-the-art neutral atom systems. With routing steps that can operate on multiple atoms in parallel, we prove that current designs require $\Omega(\sqrt N \log N)$ steps to perform certain permutations on 2D arrays with $N$ atoms and provide a protocol that achieves routing in $\mathcal O(\sqrt N \log N)$ steps for any permutation. We also propose a simple experimental upgrade and show that it would reduce the routing cost to $\Theta(\log N)$ steps.</description>

      <title>Fast entangling gates for Rydberg atoms via resonant dipole-dipole interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of digital neutral-atom quantum computers relies on the development of fast and robust protocols for high-fidelity quantum operations. In this work, we introduce a novel scheme for entangling gates using four atomic levels per atom: a ground state qubit and two Rydberg states. A laser field couples the qubit to one of the two Rydberg states, while a microwave field coupling the two Rydberg states enables a resonant dipole-dipole interaction between different atoms. We show that this interaction can mediate controlled-Z gates that are faster and less sensitive to Rydberg decay than state-of-the-art Rydberg gates based on van der Waals interactions. Moreover, we systematically stabilize our protocol against interatomic distance fluctuations and analyze its performance in realistic setups with rubidium or cesium atoms. Our results open up new avenues to the use of dipolar interactions for universal quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Efficiency of optimal control for noisy spin qubits in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence is a major challenge for quantum technologies. A way to mitigate its negative impact is by employing quantum optimal control. The decoherence dynamics varies significantly based on the characteristics of the surrounding environment of qubits, consequently affecting the outcome of the control optimization. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the shape of a spin inversion control pulse on the correlation time of the environment noise. Furthermore, we analyze the effects of constraints and optimization options on the optimization outcome and identify a set of strategies that improve the optimization performance. Finally, we present an experimental realization of the numerically-optimized pulses validating the optimization feasibility. Our work serves as a generic yet essential guide to implementing optimal control in the presence of realistic noise, e.g., in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum computing Feynman diagrams in hybrid qubit-oscillator devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that recent experiments in hybrid qubit-oscillator devices that measure the phase-space characteristic function of the oscillator via the qubit can be seen through the lens of functional calculus and path integrals, drawing a clear analogy with the generating functional of a quantum field theory. This connection suggests an expansion of the characteristic function in terms of Feynman diagrams, exposing the role of the real-time bosonic propagator, and identifying the external source functions with certain time-dependent couplings that can be controlled experimentally. By applying maximum-likelihood techniques, we show that the ``measurement'' of these Feynman diagrams can be reformulated as a problem of multi-parameter point estimation that takes as input a set of Ramsey-type measurements of the qubit. By numerical simulations that consider leading imperfections in trapped-ion devices, we identify the optimal regimes in which Feynman diagrams could be reconstructed from measured data with low systematic and stochastic errors. We discuss how these ideas can be generalized to finite temperatures via the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, contributing to a bottom-up approach to probe quantum simulators of lattice field theories by systematically increasing the qubit-oscillator number.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Complexity of Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study computational problems related to the Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ in the real space under the condition that (i) the potential function $V$ is smooth and has its value and derivative bounded within some polynomial of $n$ and (ii) $V$ only consists of $O(1)$-body interactions. We prove that (i) simulating the dynamics generated by the Schr\"odinger operator implements universal quantum computation, i.e., it is BQP-hard, and (ii) estimating the ground energy of the Schr\"odinger operator is as hard as estimating that of local Hamiltonians with no sign problem (a.k.a. stoquastic Hamiltonians), i.e., it is StoqMA-complete. This result is particularly intriguing because the ground energy problem for general bosonic Hamiltonians is known to be QMA-hard and it is widely believed that $\texttt{StoqMA}\varsubsetneq \texttt{QMA}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Imaging and Metrology with Undetected squeezed Photons: Noise Canceling and Noise Based Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work a quantum imaging setup based on undetected squeezed photons is employed for metrological applications such as sensitive phase measurement and quantum imaging. In spite of the traditional quantum imaging with undetected photons, introduced by A. Zeilinger et. al, the proposed setup is equipped by a homodyne detection and also the brightness of the quantum light is enhanced by an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). Introducing OPO may be diminish the validity of the low gain approximation, so a theoretical approach beyond this approximation is introduced. Due to the resource of squeezing, the results reveal the higher amount of signal to noise ratio, as a measure of image quality and phase-measurement accuracy. Accordingly, an imaging protocol is introduced to suppress the background noises, effectively. Interestingly, This protocol provides a way to extract the image information which is encoded in the quantum fluctuation (noise). Therefore, non-disruptive imaging is achievable, which is noteworthy subject in the field of bio-imaging of sensitive and low damage threshold living cells.</description>

      <title>How to Delete Without a Trace: Certified Deniability in a Quantum World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Is it possible to comprehensively destroy a piece of quantum information, so that nothing is left behind except the memory of whether one had it at one point? For example, various works, most recently Morimae, Poremba, and Yamakawa (TQC 2024), show how to construct a signature scheme with certified deletion where a user who deletes a signature on m cannot later produce a signature for m. However, in all of the existing schemes, even after deletion the user is still able keep irrefutable evidence that m was signed, and thus they do not fully capture the spirit of deletion.
  In this work, we initiate the study of certified deniability in order to obtain a more comprehensive notion of deletion. Certified deniability uses a simulation-based security definition, ensuring that any information the user has kept after deletion could have been learned without being given the deleteable object to begin with; meaning that deletion leaves no trace behind! We define and construct two non-interactive primitives that satisfy certified deniability in the quantum random oracle model: signatures and non-interactive zero-knowledge arguments (NIZKs). As a consequence, for example, it is not possible to delete a signature/NIZK and later provide convincing evidence that it used to exist. Notably, our results utilize uniquely quantum phenomena to bypass the celebrated result of Pass (CRYPTO, 2003) showing that deniable NIZKs are impossible even in the random oracle model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed Limit Time in two-qubit system by Dynamical Decoupling Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state change can not occurs instantly, but the speed of quantum evolution is limited to an upper bound value, called quantum speed limit (QSL). Engineering QSL is an important task for quantum information and computation science and technologies. This paper devotes to engineering QSL and quantum correlation in simple two-qubit system suffering dephasing via Periodic Dynamical Decoupling (PDD) method in both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamical regimes. The results show that when decoupling pulses are applied to both qubits this method removes all undesirable effects of the dephasing process, completely. Applying the PDD on only one of the qubits also works but with lower efficiency. Additionally, ultra-high speedup of the quantum processes become possible during the pulse application period, for enough large number of pulses. The results is useful for high speed quantum gate implementation application.</description>

      <title>Long optical coherence times and coherent rare earth-magnon coupling in a rare earth doped anti-ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth ions are characterised by transitions with very narrow linewidths even in solid state crystals. Exceedingly long coherence times have been shown on both spin and optical transitions of rare-earth-ion doped crystals. A key factor, and generally the limitation, for such coherence times, is the effects of electronic and nuclear spins in the host crystal. Despite the attractive prospect, a low-strain, spin-free host crystal for rare-earth-ion dopants has not yet been demonstrated. The dopants experience the lowest strain when they substitute for another rare earth (including yttrium). However every stable isotope of the trivalent rare earth ions has either an electron spin, an nuclear spin, or both. The long optical coherence times reported here with erbium dopants in antiferromagnetically ordered gadolinium vanandate suggest an alternative method to achieve the quiet magnetic environment needed for long coherence times: use a magnetic host fully concentrated in electron spins and operate at temperatures low enough for these spins to be ordered. We also observe avoided crossings in the optical spectra, caused by strong coupling between the erbium ions and gadolinium magnons in the host crystal. This suggests the exciting prospect of microwave to optical quantum transduction using the rare-earth ions in these materials mediated by magnons of the host spins.</description>

      <title>Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in an optomechanical ring cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as a core resource for quantum information technologies, including applications in quantum cryptography, quantum metrology, and quantum communication. In this study, we give a unifying description of the stationary bipartite and tripartite entanglement in a coupled optomechanical ring cavity comprising photon and phonon modes. We numerically analyze the stationary entanglement between the optical mode and each mechanical mode, as well as between the two mechanical modes, using the logarithmic negativity. Our results demonstrate that mechanical entanglement between the two mechanical modes is highly dependent on the optical normalized detuning and the mechanical coupling strength, with entanglement maximized within specific detuning intervals and increased coupling broadening the effective range. Furthermore, we study the entanglement's sensitivity to temperature, noting that higher coupling strengths can sustain entanglement at elevated temperatures. The study also reveals that the entanglement between the mechanical mode and the optical mode is enhanced with increasing laser power, but is similarly susceptible to thermal noise. Additionally, we explore tripartite entanglement through the minimum residual contangle, highlighting its dependence on detuning, temperature, and laser power. Our findings underscore the importance of parameter control in optimizing entanglement for quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Out-of-Time-Order Correlation function measures transport properties of dynamical systems. They are ubiquitously used to measure quantum mechanical quantities, such as scrambling times, criticality in phase transitions, and detect onset of thermalisation. We characterise the computational complexity of estimating OTOCs over all eigenstates and show it is Complete for the One Clean Qubit model (DQC1). We then generalise our setup to establish DQC1-Completeness of N-time Correlation functions over all eigenstates. Building on previous results, the DQC1-Completeness of OTOCs and N-time Correlation functions then allows us to highlight a dichotomy between query complexity and circuit complexity of estimating correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Phantom Edges in the Problem Hamiltonian: A Method for Increasing Performance and Graph Visibility for QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a variational quantum algorithm designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems. However, a key limitation of QAOA is that it is a "local algorithm," meaning it can only optimize over local properties of the graph for finite circuit depths. In this work, we present a new QAOA ansatz that introduces only one additional parameter to the standard ansatz, regardless of system size, allowing QAOA to "see" more of the graph at a given depth $p$. We achieve this by modifying the target graph to include additional $\alpha$-weighted edges, with $\alpha$ serving as a tunable parameter. This modified graph is then used to construct the phase operator and allows QAOA to explore a wider range of the graph's features for a smaller $p$. We derive a general formula for our new ansatz at $p=1$ and analytically show an improvement in the approximation ratio for cycle graphs. We also provide numerical experiments that demonstrate significant improvements in the approximation ratio for the Max-Cut problem over the standard QAOA ansatz for $p=1$ and $p=2$ on random regular graphs up to 16 nodes.</description>

      <title>Traceable random numbers from a nonlocal quantum advantage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unpredictability of random numbers is fundamental to both digital security and applications that fairly distribute resources. However, existing random number generators have limitations-the generation processes cannot be fully traced, audited, and certified to be unpredictable. The algorithmic steps used in pseudorandom number generators are auditable, but they cannot guarantee that their outputs were a priori unpredictable given knowledge of the initial seed. Device-independent quantum random number generators can ensure that the source of randomness was unknown beforehand, but the steps used to extract the randomness are vulnerable to tampering. Here, for the first time, we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol is at the heart of a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7434 out of 7454 attempts -- a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error times actual success probability bounded by $2^{-64}$. The generation of certifiable and traceable randomness represents one of the first public services that operates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the eigenfunctions of the classical Liouville operator and investigate the conditions they must obey to be separable as a product state. We point out that the conditions for separability are equivalent to requirements of Liouville's integrability theorem, this is, the eigenfunctions are separable if and only if the system is integrable. On the other hand, if the classical system is not integrable, then the eigenfunctions are entangled in all canonical coordinates. This results in a link between the classical notions of chaos and integrability with mathematical concepts that are usually restricted to quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Noise Transfer Approach to GKP Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The choice between the Schroedinger and Heisenberg pictures can significantly impact the computational resources needed to solve a problem, even though they are equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics. Here we present a method for analysing Bosonic quantum circuits based on the Heisenberg picture that allows, under certain conditions, a useful factoring of the evolution into signal and noise contributions, in a similar way as can be done with classical communication systems. We provide examples which suggest this approach may be particular useful in analysing quantum computing systems based on the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits.</description>

      <title>Experimental realization of qubit-state-controlled directional edge states in waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally realise the theoretical proposal for in-situ tunable photonic edge states emerging from qubits coupled to a waveguide with a photonic bandgap. These edge states are directional, exhibiting theoretically zero population in the opposite direction. Our experiment implements a tunable Rice-Mele waveguide configuration, where the directionality of edge states is controlled in-situ by varying the qubit energy. The Rice-Mele waveguide is constructed using lumped resonators coupled to a standard Xmon qubit. We demonstrate the existence of these edge states both actively, via waveguide transmission, and passively, through qubit emission via an edge state. We estimate a 99.4% fidelity in the directionality, constrained by our measurement noise floor. These results hold significant promise for the development of long-range qubit couplers with effectively zero crosstalk.</description>

      <title>QSRA: A QPU Scheduling and Resource Allocation Approach for Cloud-Based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cloud platforms, which rely on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, face significant challenges in efficiently managing quantum programs. This paper proposes a QPU Scheduling and Resource Allocation (QSRA) approach to address these challenges. QSRA enhances qubit utilization and reduces turnaround time by adapting CPU scheduling techniques to Quantum Processing Units (QPUs). It incorporates a subroutine for qubit allocation that takes into account qubit quality and connectivity, while also merging multiple quantum programs to further optimize qubit usage. Our evaluation of QSRA against existing methods demonstrates its effectiveness in improving both qubit utilization and turnaround time.</description>

      <title>Biased Degenerate Ground-State Sampling of Small Ising Models with Converged QAOA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz, a generalization of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), is a quantum algorithm used for approximately solving combinatorial optimization problems. QAOA typically uses the Transverse field mixer as the driving Hamiltonian. One of the interesting properties of the Transverse-field driving Hamiltonian is that it results in non-uniform sampling of degenerate ground states of optimization problems. In this study we numerically examine the fair sampling properties transverse field mixer QAOA, and Grover Mixer QAOA (GM-QAOA) which provides theoretical guarantees of fair sampling of degenerate optimal solutions, up to large enough p such that the mean expectation value converges to an optimal approximation ratio of 1. This comparison is performed with high quality heuristically computed, but not necessarily optimal, QAOA angles which give strictly monotonically improving solution quality as p increases. These angles are computed using the Julia based numerical simulation software JuliQAOA. Fair sampling of degenerate ground-states is quantified using Shannon entropy of the ground-state amplitudes distribution. The fair sampling properties are reported on several quantum signature Hamiltonians from previous quantum annealing fair sampling studies. Small random fully connected spin glasses are shown which exhibit exponential suppression of some degenerate ground-states with transverse field mixer QAOA. The transverse field mixer QAOA simulations show that some problem instances clearly saturate the Shannon entropy of 0 with a maximally biased distribution that occurs when the learning converges to an approximation ratio of 1 while other problem instances never deviate from a maximum Shannon entropy (uniform distribution) at any p step.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an approach for approximate real-time evolution of quantum systems using Tensor Renormalization Group (TRG) methods originally developed for imaginary time. We use Higher- Order TRG (HOTRG) to generate a coarse-grained time evolution operator for a 1+1D Transverse Ising Model with a longitudinal field. We show that it is effective and efficient in evolving Gaussian wave packets for one and two particles in the disordered phase. Near criticality behavior is more challenging in real-time. We compare our algorithm with local simulators for universal quantum computers and discuss possible benchmarking in the near future.</description>

      <title>Dual axis atomic magnetometer and gyroscope enabled by nuclear spin perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali-noble-gas comagnetometers have become an essential tool for tests of fundamental physics and offer a compact platform for precision gyroscopy. They are, however, limited by technical noise at low frequencies, commonly due to their limited suppression of magnetic noise. Here we investigate a new method for co-magnetometry between a single noble gas and alkali species. While similar to well-known devices using self-compensation, our scheme introduces magnetic pulses that controllably perturb the noble gas and pulsed optical pumping to polarise the alkali atoms. These applied pulses allow our scheme to measure, rather than just suppress, the effect of magnetic noise thereby offering reduced cross-talk. We show numerically that our scheme retrieves four signals (rotations and magnetic fields on two transverse axes) with similar sensitivity to a single axis device. We also present a proof-of-principle experiment based on a 87Rb-129Xe cell. Our data shows a low magnetic-rotation cross-talk of $0.2 \pm 0.1\mu$Hz$/$pT, which is already on par with the most sensitive devices relying on self-compensation.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking and Entanglement Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When interacting with an environment, the entanglement within quantum many-body systems is rapidly transferred to the entanglement between the system and the bath. For systems with a large local Hilbert space dimension, this leads to a first-order entanglement transition for the reduced density matrix of the system. On the other hand, recent studies have introduced a new paradigm for classifying density matrices, with particular focus on scenarios where a strongly symmetric density matrix undergoes spontaneous symmetry breaking to a weak symmetry phase. This is typically characterized by a finite R\'enyi-2 correlator or a finite Wightman correlator. In this work, we study the entanglement transition from the perspective of strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, using solvable complex Brownian SYK models. We perform analytical calculations for both the early-time and late-time saddles. The results show that while the R\'enyi-2 correlator indicates a transition from symmetric to symmetry-broken phase, the Wightman correlator becomes finite even in the early-time saddle due to the single-replica limit, demonstrating that the first-order transition occurs between a near-symmetric phase and a deeply symmetry-broken phase in the sense of Wightman correlator. Our results provide a novel viewpoint on the entanglement transition under symmetry constraints and can be readily generalized to systems with repeated measurements.</description>

      <title>Entanglement measurement based on convex hull properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05389v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a unique correlation phenomenon in quantum mechanics, and the measurement of quantum entanglement plays an important role in quantum computing and quantum communication. Many mainstream entanglement criteria and measurement methods currently known have shortcomings in certain aspects, such as not being sufficient or necessary conditions for entanglement, or only being effective in simple cases such as 2-qubits or pure states. In this work, we will propose a scheme for measuring quantum entanglement, which starts with treating the set of quantum separable states as a convex hull of quantum separable pure states, and analyzes the properties of the convex hull to obtain a new form of entanglement measurement. Although a large amount of data is required in the measurement process, this method is not only applicable to 2-qubit quantum states, but also a entanglement measurement method that can be applied to any dimension and any fragment. We will provide several examples to compare their results with other entanglement metrics and entanglement determination methods to verify their feasibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twists are defects that are used to encode and process quantum information in topological codes like surface and color codes. Color codes can host three basic types of twists viz., charge-permuting, color-permuting and domino twists. In this paper, we study domino twists from the viewpoint of computation. Specifically, we give a systematic construction for domino twists in qubit color codes. We also present protocols for measurement of logical qubits. Finally, we show that all Clifford gates can be implemented by braiding twists.</description>

      <title>Theory and Experimental Demonstration of Wigner Tomography of Unknown Unitary Quantum Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tomography of unknown unitary quantum processes within the framework of a finite-dimensional Wigner-type representation. This representation provides a rich visualization of quantum operators by depicting them as shapes assembled as a linear combination of spherical harmonics. These shapes can be experimentally tomographed using a scanning-based phase-space tomography approach. However, so far, this approach was limited to $\textit{known}$ target processes and only provided information about the controlled version of the process rather than the process itself. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a general protocol to extend Wigner tomography to $\textit{unknown}$ unitary processes. This new method enables experimental tomography by combining a set of experiments with classical post-processing algorithms introduced herein to reconstruct the unknown process. We also demonstrate the tomography approach experimentally on IBM quantum devices and present the specific calibration circuits required for quantifying undesired errors in the measurement outcomes of these demonstrations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting active users in a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network poses a significant challenge for 5G/6G applications. Traditional algorithms tackling this task, relying on classical processors, have to make a compromise between performance and complexity. However, a quantum computing based strategy called quantum annealing (QA) can mitigate this trade-off. In this paper, we first propose a mapping between the AUD searching problem and the identification of the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. Then, we compare the execution times of our QA approach for several code domain multiple access (CDMA) scenarios. We evaluate the impact of the cross-correlation properties of the chosen codes in a NOMA network for detecting the active user's set.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the concept of noncommuting common causes; refute two objections raised against them, the triviality objection and the lack of causal explanatory force; and explore how their existence modifies the EPR argument. More specifically, we show that 1) product states screening off all quantum correlations do not compromise noncommuting common causal explanations; 2) noncommuting common causes can satisfy the law of total probability; 3) perfect correlations can have indeterministic noncommuting common causes; and, as a combination of the above claims, 4) perfect correlations can have noncommuting common causes which are both nontrivial and satisfy the law of total probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise control and manipulation of neutral atoms are essential for quantum technologies but largely dependent on conventional bulky optical setups. Here, we demonstrate a multifunctional metalens that integrates an achromatic lens with large numerical aperture, a quarter-wave plate, and a polarizer for trapping and characterizing single Rubidium atoms. The metalens simultaneously focuses a trapping beam at 852\,nm and collects single-photon fluorescence at 780\,nm. We observe a strong dependence of the trapping lifetime on an external bias magnetic field, suggests a complex interplay between the circularly polarized trapping light and the atom's internal states. Our work showcases the potential of metasurfaces in realizing compact and integrated quantum systems based on cold atoms, opening up new possibilities for studying quantum control and manipulation at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Quantum magnetometry of transient signals with a time resolution of 1.1 nanoseconds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum magnetometers based on spin defects in solids enable sensitive imaging of various magnetic phenomena, such as ferro- and antiferromagnetism, superconductivity, and current-induced fields. Existing protocols primarily focus on static fields or narrow-band dynamical signals, and are optimized for high sensitivity rather than fast time resolution. Here, we report detection of fast signal transients, providing a perspective for investigating the rich dynamics of magnetic systems. We experimentally demonstrate our technique using a single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometer at room temperature, reaching a best-effort time resolution of 1.1 ns, an instantaneous bandwidth of 0.9 GHz, and a time-of-flight precision better than 20 ps. The time resolution can be extended to the picosecond range by use of on-chip waveguides. At these speeds, NV quantum magnetometers will become competitive with time-resolved synchrotron X-ray techniques. Looking forward, adding fast temporal resolution to the spatial imaging capability further promotes single-spin probes as powerful research tools in spintronics, mesoscopic physics, and nanoscale device metrology.</description>

      <title>Quantum processes as thermodynamic resources: the role of non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics studies how quantum systems and operations may be exploited as sources of work to perform useful thermodynamic tasks. In real-world conditions, the evolution of open quantum systems typically displays memory effects, resulting in a non-Markovian dynamics. The associated information backflow has been observed to provide advantage in certain thermodynamic tasks. However, a general operational connection between non-Markovianity and thermodynamics in the quantum regime has remained elusive. Here, we analyze the role of non-Markovianity in the central task of extracting work via thermal operations from general multitime quantum processes, as described by process tensors. By defining a hierarchy of four classes of extraction protocols, expressed as quantum combs, we reveal three different physical mechanisms (work investment, multitime correlations, and system-environment correlations) through which non-Markovianity increases the work distillable from the process. The advantages arising from these mechanisms are linked precisely to a quantifier of the non-Markovianity of the process. These results show in very general terms how non-Markovianity of any given quantum process is a fundamental resource that unlocks an enhanced performance in thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Wigner entropy conjecture and the interference formula in quantum phase space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner-positive quantum states have the peculiarity to admit a Wigner function that is a genuine probability distribution over phase space. The Shannon differential entropy of the Wigner function of such states - called Wigner entropy for brevity - emerges as a fundamental information-theoretic measure in phase space and is subject to a conjectured lower bound, reflecting the uncertainty principle. In this work, we prove that this Wigner entropy conjecture holds true for a broad class of Wigner-positive states known as beam-splitter states, which are obtained by evolving a separable state through a balanced beam splitter and then discarding one mode. Our proof relies on known bounds on the $p$-norms of cross-Wigner functions and on the interference formula, which relates the convolution of Wigner functions to the squared modulus of a cross-Wigner function. Originally discussed in the context of signal analysis, the interference formula is not commonly used in quantum optics although it unveils a strong symmetry exhibited by Wigner functions of pure states. We provide here a simple proof of the formula and highlight some of its implications. Finally, we prove an extended conjecture on the Wigner-R\'enyi entropy of beam-splitter states, albeit in a restricted range for the R\'enyi parameter $\alpha \geq 1/2$.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical gravity phenomenology under the causal-conditional quantum measurement prescription II: Heisenberg picture and apparent optical entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of quantum states influenced by semiclassical gravity is distinct from that in quantum gravity theory due to the presence of a state-dependent gravitational potential. This state-dependent potential introduces nonlinearity into the state evolution, of which the theory is named Schroedinger-Newton (SN) theory. The formalism for understanding the continuous quantum measurement process on the quantum state in the context of semiclassical gravity theory has been previously discussed using the Schr\"odinger picture in Paper I [1]. In this work, an equivalent formalism using the Heisenberg picture is developed and applied to the analysis of two optomechanical experiment protocols that targeted testing the quantum nature of gravity. This Heisenberg picture formalism of the SN theory has the advantage of helping the investigation of the covariance matrices of the outgoing light fields in these protocols and further the entanglement features. We found that the classical gravity between the quantum trajectories of two mirrors under continuous quantum measurement in the SN theory can induce an apparent entanglement of the outgoing light field (though there is no quantum entanglement of the mirrors), which could serve as a false alarm for those experiments designed for probing the quantum gravity induced entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a mesoscopic theory of the Josephson junction from non-relativistic scalar electrodynamics. Our theory reproduces the Josephson relations with the canonical current phase relation acquiring a weak second harmonic term, and it improves the standard lumped-element descriptions employed in circuit quantum electrodynamics by providing spatial resolution of the superconducting order parameter and electromagnetic field. By providing an ab initio derivation of the charge qubit Hamiltonian that relates traditionally free qubit parameters to geometric and material properties, we progress toward the quantum engineering of superconducting circuits at the subnanometer scale.</description>

      <title>Dynamically Enhanced Two-Photon Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel quantum control protocol utilizing two-photon processes with trigonometric pulse modulation is developed, enabling the intermediate state population's dynamic elimination (DE). The proposed DE technique excels at single-photon resonance in contrast to the well-known adiabatic elimination (AE) regime, which requires large single-photon detuning and strong pulses. The DE approach outperforms AE in efficiency and exhibits enhanced resilience to one-photon detuning since the key control parameter, the effective two-photon Rabi frequency, inversely proportional to the modulation frequency, does not depend on the one-photon detuning. The comprehensive analysis of population transfer and Ramsey interferometry demonstrates the protocol's superiority, achieving enhanced signal-to-noise ratios and higher fidelities with respect to existing two-photon methods.</description>

      <title>Exploring Topological Boundary Effects through Quantum Trajectories in Dissipative SSH Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the topological properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model under dissipative dynamics using the quantum trajectory approach. Our study explores the preservation or breakdown of topological edge states, particularly focusing on the effects of symmetry-preserving and symmetry-breaking dissipations. We employ the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE) as a marker for detecting topological phases in the system, which is subjected to Lindblad dynamics. The analysis reveals that, while dissipation in the bulk minimally affects the system's topological features, dissipation at the boundary leads to the destabilization of the edge modes, independently of the symmetry properties of the dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05703v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schmidt decomposition is a powerful tool in quantum information. While Schmidt decomposition is universal for bipartite states, its not for multipartite states. In this article, we review properties of bipartite Schmidt decompositions and study which of them extend to multipartite states. In particular, Schmidt number (the number of non-zero terms in Schmidt decomposition) define an equivalence class using separable unitary transforms. We show that it is NP-complete to partition a multipartite state that attains the highest Schmidt number. In addition, we observe that purifications of a density matrix of a composite system preserves Schmidt decomposability.</description>

      <title>Quantum hyperspins: Highly nonclassical collective behavior in quantum optical parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the emergence of a highly non-classical collective behavior in quantum parametric oscillators, which we name quantum hyperspin, induced by a tailored nonlinear interaction. This is the second quantized version of classical multidimensional spherical spins, as XY spins in two dimensions, and Heisenberg spins in three dimensions. In the phase space, the quantum hyperspins are represented as spherical shells whose radius scales with the number of particles in a way such that it cannot be factorized even in the limit of large particle number. We show that the nonlinearly coupled quantum oscillators form a high-dimensional entangled state that is surprisingly robust with respect to the coupling with the environment. Such a behavior results from a properly engineered reservoir. Networks of entangled quantum hyperspins are a new approach to quantum simulations for applications in computing, Ising machines, and high-energy physics models. We analyze from first principles through ab initio numerical simulations the properties of quantum hyperspins, including the interplay of entanglement and coupling frustration.</description>

      <title>Unstructured Adiabatic Quantum Optimization: Optimality with Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the circuit model of quantum computing, amplitude amplification techniques can be used to find solutions to NP-hard problems defined on $n$-bits in time $\text{poly}(n) 2^{n/2}$. In this work, we investigate whether such general statements can be made for adiabatic quantum optimization, as provable results regarding its performance are mostly unknown. Although a lower bound of $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ has existed in such a setting for over a decade, a purely adiabatic algorithm with this running time has been absent. We show that adiabatic quantum optimization using an unstructured search approach results in a running time that matches this lower bound (up to a polylogarithmic factor) for a broad class of classical local spin Hamiltonians. For this, it is necessary to bound the spectral gap throughout the adiabatic evolution and compute beforehand the position of the avoided crossing with sufficient precision so as to adapt the adiabatic schedule accordingly. However, we show that the position of the avoided crossing is approximately given by a quantity that depends on the degeneracies and inverse gaps of the problem Hamiltonian and is NP-hard to compute even within a low additive precision. Furthermore, computing it exactly (or nearly exactly) is \#P-hard. Our work indicates a possible limitation of adiabatic quantum optimization algorithms, leaving open the question of whether provable Grover-like speed-ups can be obtained for any optimization problem using this approach.</description>

      <title>AI-assisted experimental measures of entanglement and Bell's nonlocality without state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring complex properties in quantum systems, such as various measures of entanglement and Bell nonlocality, is challenging. Traditional methods require a full reconstruction of the density matrix of a given system. An alternative strategy reduces information by using multiple system copies and joint measurements. However, this approach has been considered so far impractical due to difficulties in preparing and controlling multiple quantum-correlated systems and the amplification of experimental noise. Despite these challenges, we have successfully measured two--qubit quantum correlations of Horodecki's and Werner's states using a multicopy approach. We report on experiments with transmon qubits using IBMQ quantum processors to quantify the violation of Bell's inequality and the negativity of a two--qubit entangled state. We compared these results with those from the standard tomography-based approach and developed a maximum likelihood method to reduce the noise. We trained artificial neural networks (ANNs) to estimate entanglement and nonlocality measures from the top five experimental configurations for Werner's and Horodecki's states. The ANN output, based on a reduced set of projections, aligns with expected values and enhances noise robustness. This could simplify and improve the error-robustness of multicopy measurements without complex nonlinear equation analysis. This approach represents a significant advancement in AI-assisted measurements of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic parameterized quantum circuits: expressive and barren-plateau free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical optimization of parameterized quantum circuits is a widely studied methodology for the preparation of complex quantum states, as well as the solution of machine learning and optimization problems. However, it is well known that many proposed parameterized quantum circuit architectures suffer from drawbacks which limit their utility, such as the hardness of optimization due to their classical simulability or a problem known as "barren plateaus". We propose and study a class of dynamic parameterized quantum circuit architectures. These are parameterized circuits containing intermediate measurements and feedforward operations. In particular, we show that these architectures: 1. Provably do not suffer from barren plateaus. 2. Are expressive enough to describe arbitrarily deep unitary quantum circuits. 3. Are competitive with state of the art methods for the preparation of ground states and facilitate the representation of nontrivial thermal states. These features make the proposed architectures promising candidates for a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>A nonstabilizerness monotone from stabilizerness asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonstabilizerness monotone which we name basis-minimised stabilizerness asymmetry (BMSA). It is based on the notion of $G$-asymmetry, a measure of how much a certain state deviates from being symmetric with respect to a symmetry group $G$. For pure states, we show that the BMSA is a strong monotone for magic-state resource theory, while it can be extended to mixed states via the convex roof construction. We discuss its relation with other magic monotones, first showing that the BMSA coincides with the recently introduced basis-minimized measurement entropy, thereby establishing the strong monotonicity of the latter. Next, we provide inequalities between the BMSA and other nonstabilizerness measures known in the literature. Finally, we present numerical methods to compute the BMSA, highlighting its advantages and drawbacks compared to other nonstabilizerness measures in the context of pure many-body quantum states. We also discuss the importance of additivity and strong monotonicity for measures of nonstabilizerness in many-body physics, motivating the search for additional computable nonstabilizerness monotones.</description>

      <title>Phases of decodability in the surface code with unitary errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maximum likelihood (ML) decoder in the two-dimensional surface code with generic unitary errors is governed by a statistical mechanics model with complex weights, which can be simulated via (1+1)D transfer matrix contraction. Information loss with an increasing error rate manifests as a ferromagnetic-to-paramagnetic transition in the contraction dynamics. In this work, we establish entanglement as a separate obstruction to decoding; it can undergo a transition from area- to volume-law scaling in the transfer matrix contraction with increasing unitary error rate. In particular, the volume-law entanglement can coexist with ferromagnetic order, giving rise to a phase in which the encoded information is retained yet is effectively undecodable. We numerically simulate the ML decoding in the surface code subject to both single- and two-qubit Pauli-X rotations and obtain a phase diagram that contains a ferromagnetic area-law, a paramagnetic volume-law, and a potential ferromagnetic volume-law phase. We further show that, starting from the paramagnetic volume-law phase, tilting the single-qubit rotation away from the X-axis couples the stat-mech models for X and Z errors and can lead to a ferromagnetic volume-law phase in which, although Z errors remain correctable, the encoded classical information is hard to recover. To perform numerical simulations, we develop an algorithm for syndrome sampling based on the isometric tensor network representation of the surface code.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Quantum Natural Language Processing: A Novel Framework for using Quantum Methods to Analyse Real Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in quantum computing across various domains, research on applying quantum approaches to language compositionality - such as modeling linguistic structures and interactions - remains limited. This gap extends to the integration of quantum language data with real-world data from sources like images, video, and audio. This thesis explores how quantum computational methods can enhance the compositional modeling of language through multimodal data integration. Specifically, it advances Multimodal Quantum Natural Language Processing (MQNLP) by applying the Lambeq toolkit to conduct a comparative analysis of four compositional models and evaluate their influence on image-text classification tasks. Results indicate that syntax-based models, particularly DisCoCat and TreeReader, excel in effectively capturing grammatical structures, while bag-of-words and sequential models struggle due to limited syntactic awareness. These findings underscore the potential of quantum methods to enhance language modeling and drive breakthroughs as quantum technology evolves.</description>

      <title>Exploring entanglement and spectral split correlations in three-flavor collective neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In environments with prodigious numbers of neutrinos, such as core-collapse supernovae, neutron star mergers, or the early universe, neutrino-neutrino interactions are dynamically significant. They can dominate neutrino flavor evolution and force it to be nonlinear, causing collective neutrino oscillations. Such collective oscillations have been studied numerically, for systems with up to millions of neutrinos, using mean-field or one-particle effective approximations. However, such a system of interacting neutrinos is a quantum many-body system, wherein quantum correlations could play a significant in the flavor evolution-thereby motivating the exploration of many-body treatments which follow the time evolution of these correlations. In many-body flavor evolution calculations with two neutrino flavors, the emergence of spectral splits in the neutrino energy distributions has been found to be correlated with the degree of quantum entanglement across the spectrum. In this work, for the first time, we investigate the emergence of spectral-splits in the three-flavor many-body collective neutrino oscillations. We find that the emergence of spectral splits resembles the number and location found in the mean-field approximation but not in the width. Moreover, unlike in the two-flavor many-body calculations, we find that additional degrees of freedom make it more difficult to establish a correlation between the location of the spectral splits and the degree of quantum entanglement across the neutrino energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. Existing methods to generate tweezer arrays mostly rely on active beam-shaping devices, such as acousto-optic deflectors or liquid-crystal spatial light modulators. However, these approaches have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two-dimensional arrays with more than 250 tweezer traps, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or exceeding existing approaches. Owing to sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, holographic metasurfaces open a path towards optical tweezer arrays with &gt;100,000 traps.</description>

      <title>An atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer-based acceleration sensor for microgravity environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of an atomic Fabry-Perot interferometer (FPI) with a pulsed non-interacting Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) source as a space-based acceleration sensor. We derive an analytic approximation for the device's transmission under a uniform acceleration, which we use to compute the device's attainable acceleration sensitivity using the classical Fisher information. In the ideal case of a high-finesse FPI and an infinitely narrow momentum width atomic source, we find that when the total length of the device is constrained to small values, the atomic FPI can achieve greater acceleration sensitivity than a Mach-Zender (MZ) interferometer of equivalent total device length. Under the more realistic case of a finite momentum width atomic source, We identify the ideal cavity length that gives the best sensitivity. Although the MZ interferometer now offers enhanced sensitivity within currently-achievable experimental parameter regimes, our analysis demonstrates that the atomic FPI holds potential as a promising alternative in the future, provided that narrow momentum width atomic sources can be engineered.</description>

      <title>Quantum Rewinding for IOP-Based Succinct Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the post-quantum security of succinct interactive arguments constructed from interactive oracle proofs (IOPs) and vector commitment schemes. We prove that an interactive variant of the BCS transformation is secure in the standard model against quantum adversaries when the vector commitment scheme is collapsing. Our proof builds on and extends prior work on the post-quantum security of Kilians succinct interactive argument, which is instead based on probabilistically checkable proofs (PCPs). We introduce a new quantum rewinding strategy that works across any number of rounds. As a consequence of our results, we obtain standard-model post-quantum secure succinct arguments with the best asymptotic complexity known.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional quantum dynamics with explicitly correlated Gaussian wave packets using Rothe's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous publication [J. Chem. Phys., 161, 044105 (2024)], it has been shown that Rothe's method can be used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation (TDSE) for the hydrogen atom in a strong laser field using time-dependent Gaussian wave packets. Here, we generalize these results, showing that Rothe's method can propagate arbitrary numbers of thawed, complex-valued, explicitly correlated Gaussian functions (ECGs) with dense correlation matrices for systems with varying dimensionality. We consider the multidimensional Henon-Heiles potential, and show that the dynamics can be quantitatively reproduced using only 30 Gaussians in 2D, and that accurate spectra can be obtained using 20 Gaussians in 2D and 30 to 40 Gaussians in 3D and 4D. Thus, the relevant multidimensional dynamics can be described at high quality using only a small number of ECGs that give a very compact representation of the wave function. This efficient representation, along with the demonstrated ability of Rothe's method to propagate Gaussian wave packets in strong fields and ECGs in complex potentials, paves the way for accurate molecular dynamics calculations beyond the Born-Oppenheimer approximation in strong fields.</description>

      <title>Giant Rabi frequencies between qubit and excited hole states in silicon quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holes in Si quantum dots are being investigated for the implementation of electrically addressable spin qubits. In this perspective, the attention has been focused on the electric-field induced transitions between the eigenstates belonging to the ground doublet. Here we theoretically extend the analysis to the first excited doublet. We show that - in a prototypical quantum dot structure - transitions involving the lowest excited states display Rabi frequencies that are several orders of magnitude larger than those occurring in the ground doublet. A clear relation with the symmetries of the eigenstates emerges, and a wide tunability of the Rabi frequencies by means of the applied bias. Possible implications for multilevel manipulation schemes and for multi-hole qubit encodings can be envisioned.</description>

      <title>State transfer in discrete-time quantum walks via projected transition matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider state transfer in quantum walks by using combinatorial methods. We generalize perfect state transfer in two-reflection discrete-time quantum walks to a notion that we call peak state transfer; we define peak state transfer as the highest state transfer that could be achieved between an initial and a target state under unitary evolution, even when perfect state transfer is unattainable. We give a characterization of peak state transfer that is easy to apply and that allows us to fully characterize peak state transfer in the arc-reversal (Grover) walk on various families of graphs, including strongly regular graphs and incidence graphs of block designs (starting at a point). In addition, we provide many examples of peak state transfer, including an infinite family where the amount of peak state transfer goes to $1$ as the number of vertices grows. We further demonstrate that peak state transfer properties extend to infinite families of graphs generated by vertex blow-ups, and we characterize periodicity in the vertex-face walk on toroidal grids. In our analysis, we make extensive use of the spectral decomposition of a matrix that is obtained by projecting the transition matrix down onto a subspace. Though we are motivated by a problem in quantum computing, we identify several open problems that are purely combinatorial, arising from the spectral conditions required for peak state transfer in discrete-time quantum walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the cancellation of ultraviolet and infrared singularities in perturbative quantum field theory is of central importance for the development and automation of various theoretical tools that make accurate predictions for observables at high-energy colliders. The loop-tree duality aims to find an efficient solution by treating loop and tree-level contributions under the same foot to achieve a local cancellation of singularities at the integrand level, and thus avoiding dimensional regularisation. In this talk, we exploit the causal properties of vacuum amplitudes in the loop-tree duality representation to present different applications to physical processes at higher orders.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the confinement string in (2 + 1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics with a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact lattice Quantum Electrodynamics is a complex quantum field theory with dynamical gauge and matter fields and it has similarities with Quantum Chromodynamics, in particular asymptotic freedom and confinement. We consider a (2+1)-dimensional lattice discretization of Quantum Electrodynamics with the inclusion of dynamical fermionic matter. We define a suitable quantum algorithm to measure the static potential as a function of the distance between two charges on the lattice and we use a variational quantum calculation to explore the Coulomb, confinement and string breaking regimes. A symmetry-preserving and resource-efficient variational quantum circuit is employed to prepare the ground state of the theory at various values of the coupling constant, corresponding to different physical distances, allowing the accurate extraction of the static potential from a quantum computer. We demonstrate that results from quantum experiments on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion device and emulator, with full connectivity between qubits, agree with classical noiseless simulations using circuits with 10 and 24 qubits. Moreover, we visualize the electric field flux configurations that mostly contribute in the wave-function of the quantum ground state in the different regimes of the potential, thus giving insights into the mechanisms of confinement and string breaking. These results are a promising step forward in the grand challenge of solving higher dimensional lattice gauge theory problems with quantum computing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Telecom wavelength quantum dots interfaced with silicon-nitride circuits via photonic wire bonding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits find ubiquitous use in various technologies, from communication, to computing and sensing, and therefore play a crucial role in the quantum technology counterparts. Several systems are currently under investigation, each showing distinct advantages and drawbacks. For this reason, efforts are made to effectively combine different platforms in order to benefit from their respective strengths. In this work, 3D laser written photonic wire bonds are employed to interface triggered sources of quantum light, based on semiconductor quantum dots embedded into etched microlenses, with low-loss silicon-nitride photonics. Single photons at telecom wavelengths are generated by the In(Ga)As quantum dots which are then funneled into a silicon-nitride chip containing single-mode waveguides and beamsplitters. The second-order correlation function of g(2)(0) = 0.11+/-0.02, measured via the on-chip beamsplitter, clearly demonstrates the transfer of single photons into the silicon-nitride platform. The photonic wire bonds funnel on average 28.6+/-8.8% of the bare microlens emission (NA = 0.6) into the silicon-nitride-based photonic integrated circuit even at cryogenic temperatures. This opens the route for the effective future up-scaling of circuitry complexity based on the use of multiple different platforms.</description>

      <title>Accurate Unsupervised Photon Counting from Transition Edge Sensor Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare methods for signal classification applied to voltage traces from transition edge sensors (TES) which are photon-number resolving detectors fundamental for accessing quantum advantages in information processing, communication and metrology. We quantify the impact of numerical analysis on the distinction of such signals. Furthermore, we explore dimensionality reduction techniques to create interpretable and precise photon number embeddings. We demonstrate that the preservation of local data structures of some nonlinear methods is an accurate way to achieve unsupervised classification of TES traces. We do so by considering a confidence metric that quantifies the overlap of the photon number clusters inside a latent space. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for our dataset previous methods such as the signal's area and principal component analysis can resolve up to 16 photons with confidence above $90\%$ while nonlinear techniques can resolve up to 21 with the same confidence threshold. Also, we showcase implementations of neural networks to leverage information within local structures, aiming to increase confidence in assigning photon numbers. Finally, we demonstrate the advantage of some nonlinear methods to detect and remove outlier signals.</description>

      <title>A spin-optomechanical quantum interface enabled by an ultrasmall mechanical and optical mode volume cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a coherent mechanical interface between defect centers in diamond and telecom optical modes. Combining recent developments in spin-mechanical devices and optomechanical crystals, we introduce a 1D diamond nanobeam with embedded mechanical and electric field concentrator with mechanical and optical mode volumes $V_\mathrm{mech}/\Lambda_\mathrm{p}^3\sim 10^{-5}$ and $V_\mathrm{opt}/\lambda^3\sim 10^{-3} $, respectively. By placing a Group IV vacancy in the concentrator we demonstrate exquisitely high spin-mechanical coupling rates approaching 40 MHz, while retaining high acousto-optical couplings. We theoretically show that such a device, used in an entanglement heralding scheme, can provide high-fidelity Bell pairs between quantum repeaters. Using the mechanical interface as an intermediary between the optical and spin subsystems, we are able to directly use telecom optics, bypassing the native wavelength requirements of the spin. As the spin is never optically excited or addressed, we do not suffer from spectral diffusion and can operate at higher temperatures (up to 40 K), limited only by thermal losses. We estimate that based on these metrics, optomechanical devices with high spin-mechanical coupling will be a useful architecture for near-term quantum repeaters.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics for two-level systems with time-dependent driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.03342v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation can only be exactly solvable in very rare cases, even for two-level quantum systems. Therefore, finding exact quantum dynamics under time-dependent Hamiltonian is not only of fundamental importance in quantum physics but also can facilitate active quantum manipulations for quantum information processing. Here, we present a method which could generate a near infinite number of analytical-assisted solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for a qubit with time-dependent driving. This analytical-assisted solution has free parameters with only boundary restrictions, and thus can find many applications in precise quantum manipulations. Due to the general form of the time-dependent Hamiltonian in our scheme, it can be readily implemented in various experimental setups of qubits. Therefore, our scheme provides new solutions for Schr\"{o}dinger equation, thus provides an alternative and analytical-based routine for precise control over qubits.</description>

Abstract: By reformulating Wang tiles with tensors, we propose a natural generalization to the probabilistic and quantum setting. In this new framework, we introduce notions of tilings and periodicity directly extending their classical counterparts. In the one dimensional case, we recover the decidability of the generalized domino problem by linking it to the trace characterization of nilpotent matrices. In the two-dimensional case, we provide extension of weak and strong aperiodicity respectively and show the equivalence of those generalized notions, extending the well known equivalence in the classical case. We also exhibit a quantum tile set being aperiodic while its underlying classical tile set is not, proving that quantum interference can suppress periodic patterns and paving the way to the investigation of a new kind of aperiodicity. Finally, we highlight the many new research directions opened by this generalization of Wang tiles, related to (quantum) cellular automata, condensed matter physics, symbolic dynamics and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09911v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers can be used to calculate the electronic structure and estimate the ground state energy of many-electron molecular systems. In the present study, we implement the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, as a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to calculate the ground state energy of the molecules such as H3+, OH-, HF and BH3 in which the number of qubits has an increasing trend. We use the parity transformation for Fermion to qubit encoding and the Unitary Coupled Cluster for Single and Double excitations (UCCSD) to construct an ansatz. We compare our quantum simulation results with the computational chemistry approaches including Full Configuration Interaction (FCI), as benchmark energy and Unrestricted Hartree-Fock (UHF), as a common computational method. Our results show that there is a good agreement between molecular ground state energy obtained from VQE and FCI. Moreover, the accuracy of the ground state energies obtained from VQE in our work is higher than the previously reported values. This work aims to benchmark the VQE algorithm to calculate the electronic ground state energy for a new set of molecules that can be good candidates for molecular simulation on a real quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum re-uploading models have been extensively investigated as a form of machine learning within the context of variational quantum algorithms. Their trainability and expressivity are not yet fully understood and are critical to their performance. In this work, we address trainability through the lens of the magnitude of the gradients of the cost function. We prove bounds for the differences between gradients of the better-studied data-less parameterized quantum circuits and re-uploading models. We coin the concept of {\sl absorption witness} to quantify such difference. For the expressivity, we prove that quantum re-uploading models output functions with vanishing high-frequency components and upper-bounded derivatives with respect to data. As a consequence, such functions present limited sensitivity to fine details, which protects against overfitting. We performed numerical experiments extending the theoretical results to more relaxed and realistic conditions. Overall, future designs of quantum re-uploading models will benefit from the strengthened knowledge delivered by the uncovering of absorption witnesses and vanishing high frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08459v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry, which serves as a diagnostic tool for symmetry breaking and a proxy for thermalization, has recently been proposed and studied in the context of symmetry restoration for quantum many-body systems undergoing a quench. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry restoration in various symmetric random quantum circuits, particularly focusing on the U(1) symmetry case. In contrast to non-symmetric random circuits where the U(1) symmetry of a small subsystem can always be restored at late times, we reveal that symmetry restoration can fail in U(1)-symmetric circuits for certain weak symmetry-broken initial states in finite-size systems. In the early-time dynamics, we observe an intriguing quantum Mpemba effect implying that symmetry is restored faster when the initial state is more asymmetric. Furthermore, we also investigate the entanglement asymmetry dynamics for SU(2) and $Z_{2}$ symmetric circuits and identify the presence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect for the corresponding symmetries, respectively.

      <description>arXiv:2406.16585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an infinite-range interacting quantum spin-1/2 model, undergoing periodic kicking and dissipatively coupled with an environment. In the thermodynamic limit, it is described by classical mean-field equations that can show regular and chaotic regimes. At finite size, we describe the system dynamics using stochastic quantum trajectories. We find that the asymptotic nonstabilizerness (alias the magic, a measure of quantum complexity), averaged over trajectories, mirrors to some extent the classical chaotic behavior, while the entanglement entropy has no relation with chaos in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective phenomena arise from interactions within complex systems, leading to behaviors absent in individual components. Observing quantum collective phenomena with macroscopic mechanical oscillators has been impeded by the stringent requirement that oscillators be identical. Here, we demonstrate the quantum regime for collective motion of $N=6$ mechanical oscillators, a hexamer, in a superconducting circuit optomechanical platform. By increasing the optomechanical couplings, the system transitions from individual to collective motion, characterized by a $\sqrt{N}$ enhancement of cavity-collective mode coupling, akin to super-radiance of atomic ensembles. Using sideband cooling, we prepare the collective mode in the quantum ground state and measure its quantum sideband asymmetry, with zero-point motion distributed across distant oscillators. This regime of optomechanics opens avenues for studying multi-partite entanglement, with potential advances in quantum metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Process tensors are quantum combs describing the evolution of open quantum systems through multiple steps of a quantum dynamics. While there is more than one way to measure how different two processes are, special care must be taken to ensure quantifiers obey physically desirable conditions such as data processing inequalities. Here, we analyze two classes of distinguishability measures commonly used in general applications of quantum combs. We show that the first class, called Choi divergences, does not satisfy an important data processing inequality, while the second one, which we call generalized divergences, does. We also extend to quantum combs some other relevant results of generalized divergences of quantum channels. Finally, given the properties we proved, we argue that generalized divergences may be more adequate than Choi divergences for distinguishing quantum combs in most of their applications. Particularly, this is crucial for defining monotones for resource theories whose states have a comb structure, such as resource theories of quantum processes and resource theories of quantum strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work we have proposed a construction of quantum-like bits that could endow a large, complex classical system, for example of oscillators, with quantum-like function that is not compromised by decoherence. In the present paper we investigate further this platform of quantum-like states. Firstly, we discuss a general protocol on how to construct synchronizing networks that allow for emergent states. We then study how gates can be implemented on those states. This suggests the possibility of quantum-like computing on specially-constructed classical networks. Finally, we define a notion of measurement that allows for non-Kolmogorov interference, a feature that separates our model from a classical probabilistic system. This paper aims to explore the mathematical structure of quantum-like resources, and shows how arbitrary gates can be implemented by manipulating emergent states in those systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a tensor network designed to faithfully simulate the AdS/CFT correspondence, akin to the multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), following hyper-invariant tensor network. The proposed construction integrates bulk indices within the network architecture to uphold the key features of the HaPPY code, including complementary recovery. This framework accurately reproduces the boundary conformal field theory's (CFT) two- and three-point correlation functions, while considering the image of any bulk operator. Furthermore, we provide an explicit methodology for calculating the correlation functions in an efficient manner. Our findings highlight the physical aspects of the relation between bulk and boundary within the tensor network models, contributing to the understanding and simulation of holographic principles in quantum information.</description>

      <title>Riemannian-geometric generalizations of quantum fidelities and Bures-Wasserstein distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of fidelities, termed generalized fidelity, which are based on the Riemannian geometry of the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. We show that this family of fidelities generalizes standard quantum fidelities such as Uhlmann-, Holevo-, and Matsumoto-fidelity and demonstrate that it satisfies analogous celebrated properties. The generalized fidelity naturally arises from a generalized Bures distance, the natural distance obtained by linearizing the Bures-Wasserstein manifold. We prove various invariance and covariance properties of generalized fidelity as the point of linearization moves along geodesic-related paths. We also provide a Block-matrix characterization and prove an Uhlmann-like theorem, as well as provide further extensions to the multivariate setting and to quantum R\'enyi divergences, generalizing Petz-, Sandwich-, Reverse sandwich-, and Geometric-R\'enyi divergences of order $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Of gyrators and anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years there have emerged various ideas to create and control topological excitations in superconducting devices. Notably, nontrivial Chern bands were predicted to exist in conventional multiterminal Josephson junctions, but the Chern number is yet to be experimentally verified, and the pathway towards feasible quantum hardware applications is unclear. Here we show how generic multiterminal circuits can be expressed as gyrator networks with quantized gyration conductance, giving rise to anyonic excitations carrying $q/p$ fractional fluxes ($q,p$ integer), measurable via a fractional Aharonov-Casher phase. The magnitude of interactions between the anyons depends on the flatness of the topological bands, prompting us to investigate circuit-specific band-engineering techniques. Circular scattering in three-terminal quantum dot chains gives rise to a flat topological ground state, where disorder mitigates Chern number fluctuations and the quasiparticle continuum provides a work-around for known limitations to create nontrivial flat bands. Further band-engineering strategies are presented where the superconducting phase is scrambled either via parallelization or dissipative phase transitions. We provide concepts for error correction protocols, and quantum simulations of interacting fermionic (or generally anyonic) many-body systems -- notably, introducing the possibility to mimic fractional quantum Hall physics or to implement local fermionic models that explicitly break the Wigner superselection rule. The latter indicates that a full understanding of multiterminal circuits will require grappling with a virtually unexplored class of parity-breaking quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>Low-degree approximation of QAC$^0$ circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QAC$^0$ is the class of constant-depth quantum circuits with polynomially many ancillary qubits, where Toffoli gates on arbitrarily many qubits are allowed. In this work, we show that the parity function cannot be computed in QAC$^0$, resolving a long-standing open problem in quantum circuit complexity more than twenty years old. As a result, this proves ${\rm QAC}^0 \subsetneqq {\rm QAC}_{\rm wf}^0$. We also show that any QAC circuit of depth $d$ that approximately computes parity on $n$ bits requires $2^{\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/d})}$ ancillary qubits, which is close to tight. This implies a similar lower bound on approximately preparing cat states using QAC circuits. Finally, we prove a quantum analog of the Linial-Mansour-Nisan theorem for QAC$^0$. This implies that, for any QAC$^0$ circuit $U$ with $a={\rm poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits, and for any $x\in\{0,1\}^n$, the correlation between $Q(x)$ and the parity function is bounded by ${1}/{2} + 2^{-\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{1/d})}$, where $Q(x)$ denotes the output of measuring the output qubit of $U|x,0^a\rangle$. All the above consequences rely on the following technical result. If $U$ is a QAC$^0$ circuit with $a={\rm poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits, then there is a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ of bounded polynomials of degree polylog$(n)$ such that with high probability, a random polynomial from $\mathcal{D}$ approximates the function $\langle x,0^a| U^\dag Z_{n+1} U |x,0^a\rangle$ for a large fraction of $x\in \{0,1\}^n$. This result is analogous to the Razborov-Smolensky result on the approximation of AC$^0$ circuits by random low-degree polynomials.</description>

      <title>Practical hybrid PQC-QKD protocols with enhanced security and performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01086v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resistance is vital for emerging cryptographic systems as quantum technologies continue to advance towards large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. Resistance may be offered by quantum key distribution (QKD), which provides information-theoretic security using quantum states of photons, but may be limited by transmission loss at long distances. An alternative approach uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks, so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks. Our hybrid approach paves the way for joint quantum-classical communication networks, which leverage the advantages of both QKD and PQC and can be tailored to the requirements of various practical networks.</description>

Abstract: Solving linear systems of equations plays a fundamental role in numerous computational problems from different fields of science. The widespread use of numerical methods to solve these systems motivates investigating the feasibility of solving linear systems problems using quantum computers. In this work, we provide a survey of the main advances in quantum linear systems algorithms, together with some applications. We summarize and analyze the main ideas behind some of the algorithms for the quantum linear systems problem in the literature. The analysis begins by examining the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) solver. We note its limitations and reliance on computationally expensive quantum methods, then highlight subsequent research efforts which aimed to address these limitations and optimize runtime efficiency and precision via various paradigms. We focus in particular on the post-HHL enhancements which have paved the way towards optimal lower bounds with respect to error tolerance and condition number. By doing so, we propose a taxonomy that categorizes these studies. Furthermore, by contextualizing these developments within the broader landscape of quantum computing, we explore the foundational work that have inspired and informed their development, as well as subsequent refinements. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of these algorithms in differential equations, quantum machine learning, and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Error Interference in Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding algorithmic error accumulation in quantum simulation is crucial due to its fundamental significance and practical applications in simulating quantum many-body system dynamics. Conventional theories typically apply the triangle inequality to provide an upper bound for the error. However, these often yield overly conservative and inaccurate estimates as they neglect error interference -- a phenomenon where errors in different segments can destructively interfere. Here, we introduce a novel method that directly estimates the long-time algorithmic errors with multiple segments, thereby establishing a comprehensive framework for characterizing algorithmic error interference. We identify the sufficient and necessary condition for strict error interference and introduce the concept of approximate error interference, which is more broadly applicable to scenarios such as power-law interaction models, the Fermi-Hubbard model, and higher-order Trotter formulas. Our work demonstrates significant improvements over prior ones and opens new avenues for error analysis in quantum simulation, offering potential advancements in both theoretical algorithm design and experimental implementation of Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>Semantic Security with Infinite Dimensional Quantum Eavesdropping Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new proof method for direct coding theorems for wiretap channels where the eavesdropper has access to a quantum version of the transmitted signal on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the legitimate parties communicate through a classical channel or a classical input, quantum output (cq) channel. The transmitter input can be subject to an additive cost constraint, which specializes to the case of an average energy constraint. This method yields errors that decay exponentially with increasing block lengths. Moreover, it provides a guarantee of a quantum version of semantic security, which is an established concept in classical cryptography and physical layer security. Therefore, it complements existing works which either do not prove the exponential error decay or use weaker notions of security. The main part of this proof method is a direct coding result on channel resolvability which states that there is only a doubly exponentially small probability that a standard random codebook does not solve the channel resolvability problem for the cq channel. Semantic security has strong operational implications meaning essentially that the eavesdropper cannot use its quantum observation to gather any meaningful information about the transmitted signal. We also discuss the connections between semantic security and various other established notions of secrecy.</description>

      <title>Typical Macroscopic Long-Time Behavior for Random Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a closed macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi_t$ evolving unitarily and take for granted that different macro states correspond to mutually orthogonal subspaces $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (macro spaces) of Hilbert space, each of which has large dimension. We extend previous work on the question what the evolution of $\psi_t$ looks like macroscopically, specifically on how much of $\psi_t$ lies in each $\mathcal{H}_\nu$. Previous bounds concerned the \emph{absolute} error for typical $\psi_0$ and/or $t$ and are valid for arbitrary Hamiltonians $H$; now, we provide bounds on the \emph{relative} error, which means much tighter bounds, with probability close to 1 by modeling $H$ as a random matrix, more precisely as a random band matrix (i.e., where only entries near the main diagonal are significantly nonzero) in a basis aligned with the macro spaces. We exploit particularly that the eigenvectors of $H$ are delocalized in this basis. Our main mathematical results confirm the two phenomena of generalized normal typicality (a type of long-time behavior) and dynamical typicality (a type of similarity within the ensemble of $\psi_0$ from an initial macro space). They are based on an extension we prove of a no-gaps delocalization result for random matrices by Rudelson and Vershynin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the Wigner transformation and asymptotic analysis to systematically derive the semi-classical model for the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in arbitrary spatial dimensions, with any periodic structure. Our particular emphasis lies in addressing the \textit{diabatic} effect, i.e., the impact of Bloch band crossings. We consider both deterministic and random scenarios. In the former case, we derive a coupled Liouville system, revealing lower-order interactions among different Bloch bands. In the latter case, a coupled system of radiative transport equations emerges, with the scattering cross-section induced by the random inhomogeneities. As a specific application, we deduce the effective dynamics of a wave packet in graphene with randomness.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of any order in a generalized Hatano-Nelson model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are truly non-Hermitian (NH) degeneracies where matrices become defective. The order of such an EP is given by the number of coalescing eigenvectors. On the one hand, most work focuses on studying $N$th-order EPs in $(N\leq4)$-dimensional NH Bloch Hamiltonians. On the other hand, some works have remarked on the existence of EPs of orders scaling with systems size in models exhibiting the NH skin effect. In this work, we introduce a new type of EP and provide a recipe on how to realize EPs of arbitrary order not scaling with system size. We introduce a generalized version of the paradigmatic Hatano-Nelson model with longer-range hoppings. The EPs existing in this system show remarkable physical features: Their associated eigenstates have support on a subset of sites and exhibit the NH skin effect, which can be tuned to localize on the opposite end of the chain compared to all remaining states. Furthermore, the EPs are robust against generic perturbations in the hopping strengths as well as against a specific form of on-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Highly spin-polarized molecules via collisional microwave pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general technique to produce cold spin-polarized molecules, in which rotationally excited states are first populated by coherent microwave excitation, and then allowed to spin-flip and relax via collisional quenching, which populates a single final spin state. We illustrate the high selectivity of the technique for $^{13}$C$^{16}$O molecules immersed in a cold buffer gas of helium atoms, achieving a high degree ($\geq$95\%) of nuclear spin polarization at 1 K.</description>

      <title>Security Attacks Abusing Pulse-level Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work presents the first thorough exploration of the attacks on the interface between gate-level and pulse-level quantum circuits and pulse-level quantum circuits themselves. Typically, quantum circuits and programs that execute on quantum computers, are defined using gate-level primitives. However, to improve the expressivity of quantum circuits and to allow better optimization, pulse-level circuits are now often used. The attacks presented in this work leverage the inconsistency between the gate-level description of the custom gate, and the actual, low-level pulse implementation of this gate. By manipulating the custom gate specification, this work proposes numerous attacks: qubit plunder, qubit block, qubit reorder, timing mismatch, frequency mismatch, phase mismatch, and waveform mismatch. This work demonstrates these attacks on the real quantum computer and simulator, and shows that most current software development kits are vulnerable to these new types of attacks. In the end, this work proposes a defense framework. The exploration of security and privacy issues of the rising pulse-level quantum circuits provides insight into the future development of secure quantum software development kits and quantum computer systems.</description>

      <title>Topological p-wave Superconductors with Disorder and Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>

      <title>Role of momentum in the generator-coordinate method applied to barrier penetration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear fission at barrier-top energies is conventionally modeled by a one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation applied to internal fission channels, but that treatment is hard to justify in the configuration-interaction approach to nuclear Hamiltonians. Here we show that inclusion of states of finite momentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the range of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the Schr\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the barrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method, which may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>A High-Performance List Decoding Algorithm for Surface Codes with Erroneous Syndrome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) are necessary for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Surface codes are a class of topological QECCs that have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional error-correcting capabilities and easy implementation. In the decoding process of surface codes, the syndromes are crucial for error correction, however, they are not always correctly measured. Most of the existing decoding algorithms for surface codes need extra measurements to correct syndromes with errors, which implies a potential increase in inference complexity and decoding latency. In this paper, we propose a high-performance list decoding algorithm for surface codes with erroneous syndromes, where syndrome soft information is incorporated in the decoding, allowing qubits and syndrome to be recovered without needing extra measurements. Precisely, we first use belief propagation (BP) decoding for pre-processing with syndrome soft information, followed by ordered statistics decoding (OSD) for post-processing to list and recover both qubits and syndromes. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm efficiently recovers erroneous syndromes and significantly improves the decoding performance of surface codes with erroneous syndromes compared to minimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM), BP and original BP-OSD algorithms.</description>

      <title>Towards a complete classification of holographic entropy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic method to find all holographic entropy inequalities and prove the completeness of our method. We use a triality between holographic entropy inequalities, contraction maps and partial cubes. More specifically, the validity of a holographic entropy inequality is implied by the existence of a contraction map, which we prove to be equivalent to finding an isometric embedding of a contracted graph. Thus, by virtue of the completeness of the contraction map proof method, the problem of finding all holographic entropy inequalities is equivalent to the problem of finding all contraction maps, which we translate to a problem of finding all image graph partial cubes. We give an algorithmic solution to this problem and characterize the complexity of our method. We also demonstrate interesting by-products, most notably, a procedure to generate candidate quantum entropy inequalities.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in dual unitary quantum circuits with impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bipartite entanglement entropy is one of the most useful characterizations of universal properties in a many-body quantum system. Far from equilibrium, there exist two highly effective theories describing its dynamics -- the quasiparticle and membrane pictures. In this work we investigate entanglement dynamics, and these two complementary approaches, in a quantum circuit model perturbed by an impurity. In particular, we consider a dual unitary quantum circuit containing a spatially fixed, non-dual-unitary impurity gate, allowing for differing local Hilbert space dimensions to either side. We compute the entanglement entropy for both a semi-infinite and a finite subsystem within a finite distance of the impurity, comparing exact results to predictions of the effective theories. We find that for a semi-infinite subsystem, both theories agree with each other and the exact calculation. For a finite subsystem, however, both theories qualitatively differ, with the quasiparticle picture predicting a non-monotonic growth in contrast to the membrane picture. We show that such non-monotonic behavior can arise even in random chaotic circuits, pointing to a hitherto unknown shortcoming of the membrane picture in describing such systems.</description>

      <title>Finite Temperature Casimir Effect of Scalar Field: Revisit and New Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For both the one-dimensional and three-dimensional scalar fields at finite temperature, we find the analytic expressions of Gibbs free energy, Casimir force, and Casimir entropy. These results show that the widely used low-temperature approximation of thermal correction of Casimir force, $\pi{T}e^{-\pi{v}\hbar/aT}/2a^3$, have large errors with the exact solution. Here $T$, $v$ and $a$ represent the finite temperature, the velocity of scalar field, and the distance between the two boundaries of the fields, respectively. $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck's constant. For three-dimensional scalar field, we find the leading order thermal correction of Gibbs free energy density, $F(a,T)=3\zeta(7/2)aT^4/8\pi^{3/2}(v\hbar)^3$, where $\zeta(.)$ represents the Riemann $\zeta$ function. This thermal correction can not be cancelled by the blackbody radiation density, $\pi^2{a}T^4/90(v\hbar)^3$.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Programs, Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security.
  In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.</description>
