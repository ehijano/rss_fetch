      <title>Ab initio study of highly charged ion-induced Coulomb explosion imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of ion-induced Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) of pyridazine molecules driven by energetic C$^{5+}$ projectiles, using time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) with Ehrenfest nuclear dynamics. By systematically varying the projectile's impact point and orientation relative to the molecular plane, we compare orthogonal and in-plane trajectories and quantify their effects on fragment momenta, electron-density response, and atom-resolved ionization. Newton plots and time-resolved density snapshots show that trajectories avoiding direct atomic collisions yield the most faithful structural reconstructions, whereas direct impacts impart large, highly localized momenta that distort the recovered geometry. Planar trajectories generate substantially greater ionization and broader momentum distributions than orthogonal ones due to deeper traversal through the molecular electron cloud. Quantitative analysis of electron removal at 10~fs confirms that projectile proximity and orientation strongly modulate both local and global ionization. These findings clarify how impact geometry governs the fidelity of ion-induced CEI structural recovery and help explain the variability and noise observed in experimental CEI measurements. More broadly, the results highlight both the strengths and the intrinsic limitations of ion-induced CEI and identify key considerations for interpreting experiments.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for smell: Ordinal odor strength prediction of molecular perfumery components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting olfactory perception directly from molecular structure is central to fragrance design that plays a role in a wide range of industries, such as perfumery, food and beverage, and health care. Among olfactory attributes, odor strength is a key factor in shaping odor perception, but its modeling has been impeded by scarce and fragmented intensity data. In this work, we introduce an ordinal odor strength data set of over 2,000 molecules by integrating two different public sources, mapping structures to odorless, low, medium, and high categories. Across several molecular encodings and supervised learning algorithms we compared different prediction strategies. Dimensionality reduction and SHAP analysis identifies molecular size, polarity, ring features, and branching as primary drivers, consistent with mass-transport constraints on volatility, sorption, and receptor access. This scalable ordinal framework enables reliable odor-strength estimation for novel molecules and provides a foundation for in silico fragrance design.</description>

      <title>Effect of the Gradient of the Spin-Polarization in Density Functional Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The construction of non-empirical density functional approximations is typically guided by the satisfaction of exact constraints. An important constraint is the recovery of the gradient expansion for slowly varying electron densities. In prior constructions of semilocal density functional approximations, the $\nabla \zeta$-dependent terms in the gradient expansion of the correlation have been dropped, where $\zeta$ is the relative spin polarization. We propose a scheme by which such terms can be reintroduced into already constructed functionals without significantly affecting other constraints and norms. We implement this scheme on the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional to construct a $\nabla \zeta$-corrected version of SCAN. The resulting functional is shown to provide improvements in transition-metal atoms and molecules without significantly affecting SCAN's accurate description of $sp$-systems. For the binding energy curve of the chromium dimer Cr$_2$, the SCAN underbinding is fully corected at large bond lengths and reduced at short bond lengths.</description>

      <title>Numerical Algebraic Geometry for Energy Computations on Tensor Train Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study energy minimization problems in quantum chemistry through the lens of computational algebraic geometry. We focus on minimizing the Rayleigh quotient of a Hamiltonian over a tensor train variety. The complex critical points of this problem approximate eigenstates of the quantum system, with the global minimum approximating the ground state. We call the number of critical points the Rayleigh-Ritz degree.
  After introducing tensor train varieties, we identify instances when they are Segre products of projective spaces. We also report what we know about the defining ideals of tensor trains. We present a birational parametrization of them from products of Grassmannians. Along the way, we study the Rayleigh-Ritz degree, and we introduce the Rayleigh-Ritz discriminant, which describes Hamiltonians that lead to deficient number of critical points. We use homotopy continuation to compute all critical points of this optimization problem over various tensor train and determinantal varieties. Finally, we use these results to benchmark state-of-the-art methods, the Alternating Linear Scheme and Density Matrix Renormalization Group.</description>

      <title>Practical protein-pocket hydration-site prediction for drug discovery on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demonstrating the practical utility of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware for recurrent tasks in Computer-Aided Drug Discovery is of paramount importance. We tackle this challenge by performing three-dimensional protein pockets hydration-site prediction on a quantum computer. Formulating the water placement problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), we use a hybrid approach coupling a classical three-dimensional reference-interaction site model (3D-RISM) to an efficient quantum optimization solver, to run various hardware experiments up to 123 qubits. Matching the precision of classical approaches, our results reproduced experimental predictions on real-life protein-ligand complexes. Furthermore, through a detailed resource estimation analysis, we show that accuracy can be systematically improved with increasing number of qubits, indicating that full quantum utility is in reach. Finally, we provide evidence that advantageous situations could be found for systems where classical optimization struggles to provide optimal solutions. The method has potential for assisting simulations of protein-ligand complexes for drug lead optimization and setup of docking calculations.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. II. Screening-ranged expansion of electrostatic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works \cite{supplem_pre,supplem_pre_math,supplem_prl}, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. III. Spectral analysis of the associated Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works~\cite{supplem_prl,supplem_pre,supplem_pre_force}.</description>

      <title>Commissioning of an experiment for thermodynamic and spectroscopic studies of hydrogen isotopologues at cryogenic conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study thermodynamic properties and dynamic phase space behavior of hydrogen isotopologues (Q$_2$) at cryogenic temperatures and at high density, the Tritium Absorption InfraRed Spectroscopy 2 (T$_2$ApIR) experiment has been set up and commissioned at Tritium Laboratory Karlsruhe (TLK). In the frame of the experiment, Q$_2$ behavior in different phases, ortho/para states, temperatures (10 K - 300 K) and pressures (up to 2.5 bar a) will be investigated with optical methods, infrared and Raman spectroscopy. The facility consists of a fully tritium compatible cryostat, which includes an optical cell, ortho/para converter and windows for optical and spectroscopic studies. The cryostat can be cooled below the H$_2$ triple point by a two-stage cryocooler and contains openings in the cryogenic shielding for the optical access. The challenge of combining these scientific requirements in a design with high amounts of tritium (14 g), in a limited space, all while maintaining the TLK safety philosophy was solved by the presented design. The experiment is ready to be fully integrated into the TLK closed loop tritium infrastructure. This contribution reports a comprehensive overview of the commissioning phase of the experimental facility and the results of the first commissioning experiments, including cryogenic performance tests, commissioning experiments with non-radioactive gases, and tests of the analytical instruments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of machine learning coarse-grained potentials in molecular dynamics, many propagators require that the effective Hamiltonian is quadratic in momentum, thus limiting the family of coarse-graining functions. In this paper, we derive a general family of coarse-graining embedding functions for which Langevin dynamics samples correctly. These equations have significant implications for molecular simulations and pave the way for Langevin dynamics on non-geometric coarse-graining representations, such as those provided by principal components of component analysis or latent embeddings of molecules obtained from neural networks.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>

      <title>ExPUFFIN: Thermodynamic Consistent Viscosity Prediction in an Extended Path-Unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of liquid viscosity is essential for process design and simulation, yet remains challenging for novel molecules. Conventional group-contribution models struggle with isomer discrimination, large molecules, and parameter availability, while purely data-driven graph neural networks (GNNs) demand large datasets and offer limited interpretability. Even when feasible to be applied, purely data-driven models lack thermodynamic consistency in their predictions and are not a reliable solution. This work introduces ExPUFFIN, an extended version of the Path-unifying Feed-Forward Interfaced Network, consisting of a hybrid GNN-based framework that directly predicts temperature-dependent viscosities of pure hydrocarbons from molecular graphs, while enforcing mechanistic inductive biases in the output layer to ensure thermodynamic consistency. Molecular information is given as graph structures, encoded as a graph convolutional network, and mapped to an inductive bias neuron based on two thermophysical correlations: a three-parameter Andrade-type equation and a four-parameter empirical viscosity-temperature relation. The accuracy of these models is compared with a solely data-driven prediction. The Andrade-based ExPUFFIN variant reduces RMSE compared to the purely data-driven baseline of 37 percent and yields smooth, physically consistent interpolation and extrapolation of viscosity-temperature curves, properties that are not observed in purely data-driven models. The empirical ExPUFFIN model provides comparable accuracy while retaining robust trends. Overall, embedding physics-based structure in GNN outputs improves accuracy, robustness, and transferability, enabling reliable viscosity predictions for complex hydrocarbon molecules. The approach is readily extendable to other properties and significantly broader chemical domains.</description>

      <title>Mapping Still Matters: Coarse-Graining with Machine Learning Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.07692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling enables molecular simulations to reach time and length scales inaccessible to fully atomistic methods. For classical CG models, the choice of mapping, that is, how atoms are grouped into CG sites, is a major determinant of accuracy and transferability. At the same time, the emergence of machine learning potentials (MLPs) offers new opportunities to build CG models that can in principle learn the true potential of the mean force for any mapping. In this work, we systematically investigate how the choice of mapping influences the representations learned by equivariant MLPs by studying liquid hexane, amino acids, and polyalanine. We find that when the length scales of bonded and nonbonded interactions overlap, unphysical bond permutations can occur. We also demonstrate that correctly encoding species and maintaining stereochemistry are crucial, as neglecting either introduces unphysical symmetries. Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting CG mappings compatible with modern architectures and guide the development of transferable CG models.</description>

      <title>Universal criterion for selective outcomes under stochastic resetting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Resetting plays a pivotal role in optimizing the completion time of complex first passage processes with single or multiple outcomes/exit possibilities. While it is well established that the coefficient of variation -- a statistical dispersion defined as a ratio of the fluctuations over the mean of the first passage time -- must be larger than unity for resetting to be beneficial for any outcome averaged over all the possibilities, the same can not be said while conditioned on a particular outcome. The purpose of this letter is to derive a universal condition which reveals that two statistical metric -- the mean and coefficient of variation of the conditional times -- come together to determine when resetting can expedite the completion of a selective outcome, and furthermore can govern the biasing between preferential and non-preferential outcomes. The universality of this result is demonstrated for a one dimensional diffusion process subjected to resetting with two absorbing boundaries.</description>

Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the closed-shell singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90{\deg} in one circulation is consistent with a half-M\"obius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-M\"obius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.</description>
