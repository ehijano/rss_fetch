      <title>On the Hull-White model with volatility smile for Valuation Adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine Diffusion dynamics are frequently used for Valuation Adjustments (xVA) calculations due to their analytic tractability. However, these models cannot capture the market-implied skew and smile, which are relevant when computing xVA metrics. Hence, additional degrees of freedom are required to capture these market features. In this paper, we address this through an SDE with state-dependent coefficients. The SDE is consistent with the convex combination of a finite number of different AD dynamics. We combine Hull-White one-factor models where one model parameter is varied. We use the Randomized AD (RAnD) technique to parameterize the combination of dynamics. We refer to our SDE with state-dependent coefficients and the RAnD parametrization of the original models as the rHW model. The rHW model allows for efficient semi-analytic calibration to European swaptions through the analytic tractability of the Hull-White dynamics. We use a regression-based Monte-Carlo simulation to calculate exposures. In this setting, we demonstrate the significant effect of skew and smile on exposures and xVAs of linear and early-exercise interest rate derivatives.</description>

      <title>Construction of a Japanese Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent development of large language models (LLMs), models that focus on certain domains and languages have been discussed for their necessity. There is also a growing need for benchmarks to evaluate the performance of current LLMs in each domain. Therefore, in this study, we constructed a benchmark comprising multiple tasks specific to the Japanese and financial domains and performed benchmark measurements on some models. Consequently, we confirmed that GPT-4 is currently outstanding, and that the constructed benchmarks function effectively. According to our analysis, our benchmark can differentiate benchmark scores among models in all performance ranges by combining tasks with different difficulties.</description>

      <title>Robust Utility Optimization via a GAN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust utility optimization enables an investor to deal with market uncertainty in a structured way, with the goal of maximizing the worst-case outcome. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN) approach to (approximately) solve robust utility optimization problems in general and realistic settings. In particular, we model both the investor and the market by neural networks (NN) and train them in a mini-max zero-sum game. This approach is applicable for any continuous utility function and in realistic market settings with trading costs, where only observable information of the market can be used. A large empirical study shows the versatile usability of our method. Whenever an optimal reference strategy is available, our method performs on par with it and in the (many) settings without known optimal strategy, our method outperforms all other reference strategies. Moreover, we can conclude from our study that the trained path-dependent strategies do not outperform Markovian ones. Lastly, we uncover that our generative approach for learning optimal, (non-) robust investments under trading costs generates universally applicable alternatives to well known asymptotic strategies of idealized settings.</description>

      <title>Can a GPT4-Powered AI Agent Be a Good Enough Performance Attribution Analyst?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Performance attribution analysis, defined as the process of explaining the drivers of the excess performance of an investment portfolio against a benchmark, stands as a significant feature of portfolio management and plays a crucial role in the investment decision-making process, particularly within the fund management industry. Rooted in a solid financial and mathematical framework, the importance and methodologies of this analytical technique are extensively documented across numerous academic research papers and books. The integration of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents marks a groundbreaking development in this field. These agents are designed to automate and enhance the performance attribution analysis by accurately calculating and analyzing portfolio performances against benchmarks. In this study, we introduce the application of an AI Agent for a variety of essential performance attribution tasks, including the analysis of performance drivers and utilizing LLMs as calculation engine for multi-level attribution analysis and question-answering (QA) tasks. Leveraging advanced prompt engineering techniques such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Plan and Solve (PS), and employing a standard agent framework from LangChain, the research achieves promising results: it achieves accuracy rates exceeding 93% in analyzing performance drivers, attains 100% in multi-level attribution calculations, and surpasses 84% accuracy in QA exercises that simulate official examination standards. These findings affirm the impactful role of AI agents, prompt engineering and evaluation in advancing portfolio management processes, highlighting a significant development in the practical application and evaluation of Generative AI technologies within the domain.</description>
