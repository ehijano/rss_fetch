      <title>Hyb-Adam-UM: hybrid ultrametric-aware mtDNA phylogeny reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: mtDNA distance matrices are standard inputs for distance-based phylogeny, but computing all pairwise alignments is costly. Missing entries can degrade inferred topology and branch lengths, and generic matrix-completion methods may disrupt tree-like (ultrametric) structure.
  Results: We propose Hyb-Adam-UM, which starts from an alignment-limited Needleman-Wunsch distance backbone and completes the matrix by minimizing a robust triplet ultrametric-violation functional. An Adam-style finite-difference optimizer updates only missing entries while enforcing symmetry, non-negativity, and a zero diagonal. From one complete reference matrix, we generate 20 masked instances at 30%, 50%, 65%, and 85% missingness. Hyb-Adam-UM consistently reduces ultrametric violations and achieves competitive reconstruction error, with improved topological accuracy and branch-length agreement relative to MW*/NJ* projection baselines (which exactly preserve observed distances) and Soft-Impute; gains are most pronounced at 85% missingness.

      <title>LinkedNN: a neural model of linkage disequilibrium decay for recent effective population size inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Summary: A bioinformatics tool is presented for estimating recent effective population size by using a neural network to automatically compute linkage disequilibrium-related features as a function of genomic distance between polymorphisms. The new method outperforms existing deep learning and summary statistic-based approaches using relatively few sequenced individuals and variant sites, making it particularly valuable for molecular ecology applications with sparse, unphased data. Availability and implementation: The program is available as an easily installable Python package with documentation here: https://pypi.org/project/linkedNN/. The open source code is available from: https://github.com/the-smith-lab/LinkedNN.</description>

      <title>Life Finds A Way: Emergence of Cooperative Structures in Adaptive Threshold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13253v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been a long debate on how new levels of organization have evolved. It might seem unlikely, as cooperation must prevail over competition. One well-studied example is the emergence of autocatalytic sets, which seem to be a prerequisite for the evolution of life. Using a simple model, we investigate how varying bias toward cooperation versus antagonism shapes network dynamics, revealing that higher-order organization emerges even amid pervasive antagonistic interactions. In general, we observe that a quantitative increase in the number of elements in a system leads to a qualitative transition.
  We present a random threshold-directed network model that integrates node-specific traits with dynamic edge formation and node removal, simulating arbitrary levels of cooperation and competition. In our framework, intrinsic node values determine directed links through various threshold rules. Our model generates a multi-digraph with signed edges (reflecting support/antagonism, labeled ``help''/``harm''), which ultimately yields two parallel yet interdependent threshold graphs. Incorporating temporal growth and node turnover in our approach allows exploration of the evolution, adaptation, and potential collapse of communities and reveals regime changes in both connectivity and resilience.
  Our findings extend classical random threshold and Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi models, offering new insights into adaptive systems in biological and economic contexts, with emphasis on the application to Collective Affordance Sets. This framework should also be useful for making predictions that will be tested by ongoing experiments of microbial communities in soil.</description>

      <title>Environment heterogeneity creates fast amplifiers of natural selection in graph-structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex spatial structure, with partially isolated subpopulations, and environment heterogeneity, such as gradients in nutrients, oxygen, and drugs, both shape the evolution of natural populations. We investigate the impact of environment heterogeneity on mutant fixation in spatially structured populations with demes on the nodes of a graph. When migrations between demes are frequent, we find that environment heterogeneity can amplify natural selection and simultaneously accelerate mutant fixation and extinction, thereby fostering the quick fixation of beneficial mutants. We demonstrate this effect in the star graph, and more strongly in the line graph. We show that amplification requires mutants to have a stronger fitness advantage in demes with stronger migration outflow, and that this condition allows amplification in more general graphs. As a baseline, we consider circulation graphs, where migration inflow and outflow are equal in each deme. In this case, environment heterogeneity has no impact to first order, but increases the fixation probability of beneficial mutants to second order. Finally, when migrations between demes are rare, we show that environment heterogeneity can also foster amplification of selection, by allowing demes with sufficient mutant advantage to become refugia for mutants.</description>

      <title>Far-reaching consequences of trait preferences for animal social network structure and function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08107v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social network structures play an important role in the lives of animals by affecting individual fitness and the spread of disease and information. Nevertheless, we still lack a good understanding of how these structures emerge from the behavior of individuals. Generative network models provide a powerful approach that can help close this gap. Empirical research has shown that trait-based social preferences (preferences for social partners with certain trait values, such as sex, body size, relatedness etc.) play a key role in the formation of social networks across species. Currently, however, we lack a good understanding of how such preferences affect network properties. In this study: 1) we develop a general and flexible generative network model that can create artificial (simulated) networks where social connection is affected by trait-based social preferences; 2) we use this model to investigate how different trait-based social preferences affect social network structure and function. We find that the preferences can affect the efficiency of the networks in terms of transmitting disease and information, and their robustness against fragmentation when individuals disappear, with the effects often - but not always - going in the direction of slower transmission and lower robustness. Furthermore, the extent and form of the effects depend on both the type of preference and the type of trait it is used with. The findings lead to new insights about the potential mechanisms driving the structural diversity of animal social networks, the importance of trait value distributions for social structure, the degree distributions of social networks, and the detectability of trait effects from network data. Overall, the study shows that trait-based social preferences can have far-reaching consequences for populations.</description>
