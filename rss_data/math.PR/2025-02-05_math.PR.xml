      <title>Uniform attraction and exit problems for stochastic damped wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a class of wave equations with constant damping and polynomial nonlinearities that are perturbed by small, multiplicative, space-time white noise. The equations are defined on a one-dimensional bounded interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions, continuous initial position and distributional initial velocity. In the first part of this work, we study the corresponding deterministic dynamics and prove that certain neighborhoods of asymptotically stable equilibria are uniformly attracting in the topology of uniform convergence. Then, we consider exit problems for local solutions of the stochastic damped wave equations from bounded domains $D$ of uniform attraction. Using tools from large deviations along with novel controllability results, we obtain logarithmic asymptotics for exit times and exit places, in the vanishing noise limit, that are expressed in terms of the corresponding quasipotential. In doing so, we develop arguments that take into account the lack of both smoothing and exact controllability that are inherent to the problem at hand. Moreover, our exit time results provide asymptotic lower bounds for the mean explosion time of local solutions. We introduce a novel notion of "regular" boundary points allowing to avoid the question of boundary smoothness in infinite dimensions and leading to the proof of a large deviations lower bound for the exit place. We illustrate this notion by providing explicit examples for different classes of domains $D$. Conditions under which lower and upper bounds for exit time and exit place logarithmic asymptotic hold, are also presented. In addition, we obtain deterministic stability results for linear damped wave equations that are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A new stochastic SIS-type modelling framework for analysing epidemic dynamics in continuous space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic epidemiological model defined in a continuous space of arbitrary dimension, based on SIS dynamics implemented in a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot (SLFV) process. The model can be described by as little as three parameters, and is dual to a spatial branching process with competition linked to genealogies of infected individuals. Therefore, it is a possible modelling framework to develop computationally tractable inference tools for epidemics in a continuous space using demographic and genetic data.
  We provide mathematical constructions of the process based on well-posed martingale problems as well as driving space-time Poisson point processes. With these devices and the duality relation in hand, we unveil some of the drivers of the transition between extinction and survival of the epidemic. In particular, we show that extinction is in large parts independent of the initial condition, and identify a strong candidate for the reproduction number $R_0$ of the epidemic in such a model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm the conjecture posed by Gu{\'e}don, Hinrichs, Litvak, and Prochno in 2017 that $\mathbb{E}\|(a_{ij}g_{ij})_{i\le m, j\le n}\colon \ell_p^n \to \ell_q^m\|$ is comparable, up to constants depending only on $p$ and $q$, to \[ \max_i \|(a_{ij})_j\|_{p^*} +\max_j \|(a_{ij})_i\|_{q} +\mathbb{E} \max_{i,j} |a_{ij}g_{ij}| \] provided that $1\le p&lt;2&lt;q$ or $4/3&lt;p\le 2 \le q&lt; 4$. In the remaining cases, when $p=2$ and $q\ge 4$ or $1\le p\le 4/3$ and $q=2$, we prove it up to a factor of order $\log\log(mn)$.</description>

      <title>On Concentration Inequality of the Laplacian Matrix of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the concentration properties of the spectral norm of the normalized Laplacian matrix for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs. First, We achieve the optimal bound that can be attained in the further question posed by Le et al. [24] for the regularized Laplacian matrix. Beyond that, we also establish a uniform concentration inequality for the spectral norm of the Laplacian matrix in the homogeneous case, relying on a key tool: the uniform concentration property of degrees, which may be of independent interest. Additionally, we prove that after normalizing the eigenvector corresponding to the largest eigenvalue, the spectral norm of the Laplacian matrix concentrates around 1, which may be useful in special cases.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence with error estimates for a stochastic compartmental model of electrophysiology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis, alongside simulation studies, of a spatially extended stochastic electrophysiology model, the Hodgkin-Huxley model of the squid giant axon being a classical example. Although most studies in electrophysiology do not account for stochasticity, it is well known that ion channels regulating membrane voltage open and close randomly due to thermal fluctuations. We introduce a spatially extended compartmental model in which this stochastic behavior is captured through a piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP). Space is discretized into n compartments each of which has at most one ion channel. We also devise a numerical method to simulate this stochastic model and illustrate the numerical method by simulation studies. We show that a classical system of partial differential equations (PDEs) approximates the stochastic system as $n \to \infty$. Unlike existing results, which focus on weak convergence or convergence in probability, we establish an almost sure convergence result with a precise error bound of order $n^{1/3}$. Our findings broaden the current understanding of stochastic effects in spatially structured neuronal models and have potential applications in studying random ion channel configurations in neurobiology. Additionally, our proof leverages ideas from homogenization theory in PDEs and can potentially be applied to other PDMPs or accommodate other ion channel distributions with random spacing or defects.</description>

      <title>A weak convergence approach to large deviations for stochastic approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of stochastic approximations form the theoretical foundation for studying convergence properties of many popular recursive learning algorithms in statistics, machine learning and statistical physics. Large deviations for stochastic approximations provide asymptotic estimates of the probability that the learning algorithm deviates from its expected path, given by a limit ODE, and the large deviation rate function gives insights to the most likely way that such deviations occur.
  In this paper we prove a large deviation principle for general stochastic approximations with state-dependent Markovian noise and decreasing step size. Using the weak convergence approach to large deviations, we generalize previous results for stochastic approximations and identify the appropriate scaling sequence for the large deviation principle. We also give a new representation for the rate function, in which the rate function is expressed as an action functional involving the family of Markov transition kernels. Examples of learning algorithms that are covered by the large deviation principle include stochastic gradient descent, persistent contrastive divergence and the Wang-Landau algorithm.</description>

      <title>Criticality conditions in the Derrida-Retaux model with a random number of terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article considers the Derrida-Retaux model with a random number of terms, i.e. a sequence of integer random variables defined by the relations $ X_{n + 1} = (X_n^{(1)} + X_n^{(2)} + ... + X_n^{(N_n)} - a)^{+}$, $n\ge 0$, where $X_n^{j}$ are independent copies of $X_n$, the values of $N_j$ are independent and identically distributed, $a$ is a positive integer. The energy in the model is defined as $Q:=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty} \frac{\mathbb{E}(X_{n})}{(\mathbb{E}N_1)^{n}}$. We present sufficient conditions (in terms of distributions of $X_0$ and $N_1$) for subcritical ($Q=0$) and supercritical ($Q&gt;0$) regimes of model behavior.</description>

      <title>Energy field of critical Ising model and examples of singular fields in QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to prove singularity of three natural fields in QFT with respect to their natural base measure. The fields we consider are the following ones:
  (1) The near-critical limit of the $2d$ Ising model (in the $\beta$-direction) is locally singular w.r.t the critical scaling limit of $2d$ Ising. (N.B. In the $h$-direction it is not locally singular).
  (2) The $2d$ Hierarchical Sine-Gordon field is singular w.r.t the $2d$ hierarchical Gaussian Free Field for all $\beta\in[\beta_{L^2}, \beta_{BKT})$.
  (3) The Hierarchical $\Phi^4_3$ field is singular w.r.t the $3d$ hierarchical GFF.
  Item (1) gives the first strong indication that the energy field of critical $2d$ Ising model does not exist as a random Schwarz distribution on the plane. Item (2) has been proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $2d$ Sine-Gordon sufficiently far from the BKT point in [GM24] while item (3) is proved to be singular for the non-hierarchical $3d$ $\Phi^4_3$ field in [BG21, OOT21, HKN24].
  We believe our way to detect a singular behaviour at all scales is very much down to earth and may be applicable in all settings where one has a good enough control on the so-called effective potentials.</description>

      <title>Weighted-amenability and percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automorphism group of a transitive graph defines a weight function on the vertices through the Haar modulus. Benjamini, Lyons, Peres, and Schramm introduced the notion of weighted-amenability for a transitive graph, which is equivalent to the amenability of its automorphism group. We prove that this property is equivalent to level-amenability, that is, the property that the collection of vertices of weights in a given finite set always induces an amenable graph. We then use this to prove a version of Hutchcroft's conjecture about $p_h&lt;p_u$, relaxed \`a la Pak-Smirnova-Nagnibeda, where $p_h$ is the critical probability for the regime where clusters of infinite total weight arise, and $p_u$ is the uniqueness threshold. Further characterizations are given in terms of the spectral radius and invariant spanning forests. One consequence is the continuity of the phase transition at $p_h$ for weighted-nonamenable graphs.</description>

      <title>A new proof of superadditivity and of the density conjecture for Activated Random Walks on the line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In two recent works, Hoffman, Johnson and Junge proved the density conjecture, the hockey stick conjecture and the ball conjecture for Activated Random Walks in dimension 1, showing an equality between several different definitions of the critical density of the model. This establishes a kind of self-organized criticality, that was originally predicted for the Abelian Sandpile Model. The proof of Hoffman, Johnson and Junge uses a comparison with a percolation process, which exhibits a superadditivity property. In the present note, we revisit their argument by providing a new proof of superadditivity directly for Activated Random Walks, without relying on a percolation process. The proof relies on a simple comparison between the stabilization of two neighbouring segments and that of their union. We then explain how this superaddivity property implies the three mentioned conjectures. Yet, so far it does not seem that this approach yields as much information as does the percolation technology developed by Hoffman, Johnson and Junge, which yields an exponential concentration bound on the stationary density, whereas the superadditivity property alone only ensures an exponential bound on the lower tail.</description>

      <title>Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Processes for Within and Across Group Sharing of Latent Features-With Indications for Microbiome Species Sampling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a comprehensive Bayesian posterior analysis of what we term Poisson Hierarchical Indian Buffet Processes, designed for complex random sparse count species sampling models that allow for the sharing of information across and within groups. This analysis covers a potentially infinite number of species and unknown parameters, which, within a Bayesian machine learning context, we are able to learn from as more information is sampled. To achieve our refined results, we employ a range of methodologies drawn from Bayesian latent feature models, random occupancy models, and excursion theory. Despite this complexity, our goal is to make our findings accessible to practitioners, including those who may not be familiar with these areas. To facilitate understanding, we adopt a pseudo-expository style that emphasizes clarity and practical utility. We aim to express our findings in a language that resonates with experts in microbiome and ecological studies, addressing gaps in modeling capabilities while acknowledging that we are not experts ourselves in these fields. This approach encourages the use of our models as basic components of more sophisticated frameworks employed by domain experts, embodying the spirit of the seminal work on the Dirichlet Process. Ultimately, our refined posterior analysis not only yields tractable computational procedures but also enables practical statistical implementation and provides a clear mapping to relevant quantities in microbiome analysis.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Covariance Shrinkage for Hotelling's $T^2$ in High Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the problem of comparing the means of a single observation and a reference sample in the presence of a common data covariance matrix, where the data dimension $p$ grows linearly with the number of samples $n$ and $p/n$ converges to a number between 0 and 1. The approach we take is to replace the sample covariance matrix with a nonlinear shrinkage estimator -- i.e., a matrix with the same eigenvectors -- in Hotelling's $T^2$ test. Current approaches of this sort typically assume that the data covariance matrix has a condition number or spiked rank that increases slowly with dimension. However, this assumption is ill-suited to data sets containing many strongly correlated background covariates, as often found in finance, genetics, and remote sensing. To address this problem we construct, using variational methods and new local random-matrix laws, a nonlinear covariance shrinkage method tailored to optimize detection performance across a broad range of spiked ranks and condition numbers. We then demonstrate, via both simulated and real-world data, that our method outperforms existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Separated determinantal point processes and generalized Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study conditions so that the determinantal point process $\Lambda_\phi$ associated to a generalized Fock space defined by a doubling subharmonic weight $\phi$ is almost surely a separated sequence in $\mathbb C$. Under a natural assumption on $\phi$, we provide a characterization of such processes. Additionally, we emphasize the role of intrinsic repulsion in determinantal processes by comparing $\Lambda_\phi$ with the Poisson process of the same first intensity. As an application, we show that the determinantal process $\Lambda_\alpha$ associated to the canonical weight $\phi_\alpha(z)=|z|^\alpha$, $\alpha&gt;0$, is almost surely separated if and only if $\alpha&lt;4/3$. In contrast, the Poisson process $\Lambda_\alpha^P$ having the same first intensity as $\Lambda_\alpha$ is almost surely separated if and only if $\alpha&lt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the operator $D^+_VD^-_W:=\Delta_{W,V}$ on the one-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}$. Here, $W$ and $V$ are functions inducing (possibly atomic) positive Borel measures on $\mathbb{T}$, and the derivatives are generalized lateral derivatives. For the first time in this work, the space of test functions $C^{\infty}_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ emerges as the natural regularity space for solutions of the eigenproblem associated with $\Delta_{W,V}$. Moreover, these spaces are essential for characterizing the energetic space $H_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ as a Sobolev-type space. By observing that the Sobolev-type spaces $H_{W,V}(\mathbb{T})$ with additional Dirichlet conditions are reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, we introduce the so-called $W$-Brownian bridges as mean-zero Gaussian processes with associated Cameron-Martin spaces derived from these spaces. This framework allows us to introduce $W$-Brownian motion as a Feller process with a two-parameter semigroup and c\`adl\`ag sample paths, whose jumps are subordinated to the jumps of $W$. We establish a deep connection between $W$-Brownian motion and these Sobolev-type spaces through their associated Cameron-Martin spaces. Finally, as applications of the developed theory, we demonstrate the existence and uniqueness of related deterministic and stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper serves as a user guide to sampling strategies for sliced optimal transport. We provide reminders and additional regularity results on the Sliced Wasserstein distance. We detail the construction methods, generation time complexity, theoretical guarantees, and conditions for each strategy. Additionally, we provide insights into their suitability for sliced optimal transport in theory. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data offer a representative comparison of the strategies, culminating in practical recommendations for their best usage.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal control problems with measurable coefficients via $L^p$-viscosity solutions and applications to optimal advertising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider fully non-linear stochastic optimal control problems in infinite horizon with measurable coefficients and uniformly elliptic diffusion. Using the theory of $L^p$-viscosity solutions, we show existence of an $L^p$-viscosity solution $v\in W_{\rm loc}^{2,p}$ of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which, in turn, is also a strong solution (i.e. it satisfies the HJB equation pointwise a.e.). We are then led to prove verification theorems, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality. These results allow us to construct optimal feedback controls. We use the theory developed to solve a stochastic optimal control problem arising in economics within the context of optimal advertising.</description>

Abstract: There is strong evidence for the conjecture that the $\lambda \phi^4$ QFT- model on 4-dimensional non-commutative Moyal space can be non-perturbatively constructed. As preparation, in this paper we construct the 2-dimensional case with the method of stochastic quantization. We show the local well-posedness and global well-posedness of the stochastic quantization equation, leading to a construction of the Moyal $\lambda \phi^4_2$ measure for any non-negative coupling constant $\lambda$.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores a predictive game in which a Forecaster announces odds based on a time-homogeneous Markov kernel, establishing a game-theoretic law of large numbers for the relative frequencies of occurrences of all finite strings. A key feature of our proof is a betting strategy built on a universal coding scheme, inspired by the martingale convergence theorem and algorithmic randomness theory, without relying on a diversified betting approach that involves countably many operating accounts. We apply these insights to thermodynamics, offering a game-theoretic perspective on Le\'o Szil\'ard's thought experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build a double theory capturing the idea of nondeterministic behaviours and trajectories. Following Jaz Myers' Double Categorical Systems Theory, we construct a monoidal double category of systems and interfaces, which then yields (co)representable behaviours. We use conditional products in Markov categories to get compositional trajectories and behaviours, and represent nondeterministic systems and lenses using parametric deterministic maps. The resulting theory can also represent imprecise probability via naming Knightian choices, \emph{\`a la} Liell-Cock and Staton.</description>

      <title>Tail bounds for the Dyson series of random Schr\"odinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ and $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\geq 2$ with random potentials of strength $\lambda$. Our main result gives tail bounds for the terms of the Dyson series that are effective at time scales on the order of $\lambda^{-2+\varepsilon}$. As corollaries, we obtain estimates on the frequency localization and spatial delocalization of approximate eigenfunctions in the spirit of works by Schlag-Shubin-Wolff and T. Chen. These estimates also apply to Floquet states associated to time-periodic potentials. Our proof is elementary in that we use neither sophisticated harmonic analysis nor diagrammatic arguments. Instead, we use only the noncommutative Khintchine inequality from random matrix theory combined with pointwise dispersive estimates for the free Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>The Brown measure of a sum of two free nonselfadjoint random variables, one of which is R-diagonal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose that $X_{1}$ and $X_{2}$ are two $*$-free (generally unbounded) random variables with Brown measures $\mu_{X_{1}}$ and $\mu_{X_{2}}$, respectively. Using properties of classical free additive convolutions, we develop a method for calculating $\mu_{X_{1}+X_{2}}$when $X_{2}$ is $R$-diagonal. This method determines a density relative to Lebesgue measure on an open set whose closure contains the support of $\mu_{X_{1}+X_{2}}$. Effective calculations are possible in important cases. Biane and Lehner were the first to make significant progress on the problem we consider, even in some cases in which neither $X_{1}$ nor $X_{2}$ is $R$-diagonal. Our examples overlap with theirs, but we emphasize the use of subordination functions. When $X_{2}$ is circular, $\mu_{X_{1}+X_{2}}$ was studied earlier using two different approaches, one involving Hamilton-Jacobi equations, and another using standard free probability techniques. Our work extends the second approach.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Expansions of the Limit Laws of Gaussian and Laguerre (Wishart) Ensembles at the Soft Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07628v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large-matrix limit laws of the rescaled largest eigenvalue of the orthogonal, unitary, and symplectic $n$-dimensional Gaussian ensembles -- and of the corresponding Laguerre ensembles (Wishart distributions) for various regimes of the parameter $\alpha$ (degrees of freedom $p$) -- are known to be the Tracy-Widom distributions $F_\beta$ ($\beta=1,2,4$). We establish (paying particular attention to large or small ratios $p/n$) that, with careful choices of the rescaling constants and of the expansion parameter $h$, the limit laws embed into asymptotic expansions in powers of $h$, where $h \asymp n^{-2/3}$ resp. $h \asymp (n\,\wedge\,p)^{-2/3}$. We find explicit analytic expressions of the first few expansion terms as linear combinations of higher-order derivatives of the limit law $F_\beta$ with rational polynomial coefficients. The parametrizations are fine-tuned so that the expansion coefficients in the Gaussian cases are, for given $n$, the limits $p\to\infty$ of those of the Laguerre cases. Whereas the results for $\beta=2$ are presented with proof, the discussion of the cases $\beta=1,4$ is based on some hypotheses, focusing on the algebraic aspects of actually computing the polynomial coefficients. For the purposes of illustration and validation, the various results are checked against simulation data with large sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Generators of measure-valued jump diffusions and convergence rate of diffusive mean-field models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09534v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper has two objectives: proving that the rate of convergence in distribution for mean-field models in CLT regime is $N^{-1/2}$, and obtaining explicit expressions for the infinitesimal generators of two types of measure-valued Markov processes (conditional law of McKean-Vlasov processes, and empirical measures of McKean-Vlasov systems). The proof of the convergence of mean-field system requires the second result about the generators, and both results need to study a notion of differentiability of measure-variable functions know as linear differentiability. Due to the particular framework that is studied, many technical difficulties arise compared to the existing literature. Two of the main problems are the following ones: the CLT regime implies that the limit measure-valued processes are not deterministic, and the empirical measure processes related to McKean-Vlasov equations with jumps are necessarily discontinuous. Both properties make the expressions of the generators more complicated than what is usually considered.</description>

Abstract: We present a simpler proof of the existence of equilibria for a class of mean field games with common noise, where players interact through the conditional law given the current value of the common noise rather than its entire path. By extending a compactness criterion for Malliavin-differentiable random variables to processes, we establish existence of strong equilibria, where the conditional law and optimal control are adapted to the common noise filtration and defined on the original probability space. Notably, our approach only requires measurability of the drift and cost functionals with respect to the state variable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic processes with long memories, known as long memory processes, are ubiquitous in various science and engineering problems. Superposing Markovian stochastic processes generates a non-Markovian long memory process serving as powerful tools in several research fields, including physics, mathematical economics, and environmental engineering. We formulate two novel mathematical models of long memory process based on a superposition of interacting processes driven by jumps. The mutual excitation among the processes to be superposed is assumed to be of the mean field or aggregation form, where the former yields a more analytically tractable model. The statistics of the proposed long memory processes are investigated using their moment-generating function, autocorrelation, and associated generalized Riccati equations. Finally, the proposed models are applied to time series data of migrating fish counts at river observation points. The results of this study suggest that an exponential memory or a long memory model is insufficient; however, a unified method that can cover both is necessary to analyze fish migration, and our model is exactly the case.</description>

      <title>Singular stochastic control problems motivated by the optimal sustainable exploitation of an ecosystem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.05576v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the explicit solutions to singular stochastic control problems of the monotone follower type with (a) an expected discounted criterion, (b) an expected ergodic criterion and (c) a pathwise ergodic criterion. These problems have been motivated by the optimal sustainable exploitation of an ecosystem, such as a natural fishery. Under general assumptions on the diffusion coefficients, the discounting rate function, the running payoff function and the marginal profit of control action, we show that the optimal strategies are of a threshold type. We solve the three problems by first constructing suitable solutions to their associated HJB equations, which take the form of quasi-variational inequalities with gradient constraints. In the cases of the ergodic control problems, we also use a suitable new variational argument. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the solution of the discounted control problem to the one of the ergodic control problems as the discounting rate function tends to 0 in an Abelian sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random measures provide flexible parameters for Bayesian nonparametric models. Given two different priors for a random measure, we develop a natural framework to investigate the rate at which the corresponding posteriors merge, as the sample size increases. We define a new distance between the laws of random measures that is built as a Wasserstein distance on the ground space of unbalanced measures, endowed with the bounded Lipschitz metric. We develop tight analytical bounds for its specification to completely random measures, including the special case of Poisson and gamma random measures. The bounds are interpreted in terms of an adapted extended Wasserstein distance between the L\'evy measures and are used to investigate the merging between the posteriors of normalized gamma and generalized gamma priors. After a careful study on the identifiability of the law of the random measure, interesting asymptotic and finite-sample insights are derived without putting \emph{any} assumption on the true data generating process.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a dynamic Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph in which edges, according to an alternating renewal process, change from present to absent and vice versa. The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions while only observing the aggregate number of edges. This inverse problem is dealt with, in a parametric context, by setting up an estimator based on the method of moments. We provide conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and we point out how the corresponding covariance matrix can be identified. It is also demonstrated how to adapt the estimation procedure if alternative subgraph counts are observed, such as the number of wedges or triangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Max-stability is the property that taking a maximum between two inputs results in a maximum between two outputs. We study max-stability with respect to first-order stochastic dominance, the most fundamental notion of stochastic dominance in decision theory. Under two additional standard axioms of nondegeneracy and lower semicontinuity, we establish a representation theorem for functionals satisfying max-stability, which turns out to be represented by the supremum of a bivariate function. A parallel characterization result for min-stability, that is, with the maximum replaced by the minimum in max-stability, is also established. By combining both max-stability and min-stability, we obtain a new characterization for a class of functionals, called the Lambda-quantiles, that appear in finance and political science.</description>

      <title>Relating Misfit to Gain in Weak-to-Strong Generalization Beyond the Squared Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paradigm of weak-to-strong generalization constitutes the training of a strong AI model on data labeled by a weak AI model, with the goal that the strong model nevertheless outperforms its weak supervisor on the target task of interest. For the setting of real-valued regression with the squared loss, recent work quantitatively characterizes the gain in performance of the strong model over the weak model in terms of the misfit between the strong and weak model. We generalize such a characterization to learning tasks whose loss functions correspond to arbitrary Bregman divergences when the strong class is convex. This extends the misfit-based characterization of performance gain in weak-to-strong generalization to classification tasks, as the cross-entropy loss can be expressed in terms of a Bregman divergence. In most practical scenarios, however, the strong model class may not be convex. We therefore weaken this assumption and study weak-to-strong generalization for convex combinations of $k$ strong models in the strong class, in the concrete setting of classification. This allows us to obtain a similar misfit-based characterization of performance gain, upto an additional error term that vanishes as $k$ gets large. Our theoretical findings are supported by thorough experiments on synthetic as well as real-world datasets.</description>
