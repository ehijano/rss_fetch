      <title>Quantification of Electrolyte Degradation in Lithium-ion Batteries with Neutron Imaging Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-destructive characterization of lithium-ion batteries provides critical insights for optimizing performance and lifespan while preserving structural integrity. Optimizing electrolyte design in commercial LIBs requires consideration of composition, electrolyte-to-capacity ratio, spatial distribution, and associated degradation pathways. However, existing non-destructive methods for studying electrolyte infiltration, distribution, and degradation in LIBs lack the spatiotemporal resolution required for precise observation and quantification of the electrolyte. In this study, we employ neutron imaging with sufficient spatial resolution ~150 um and large field of view 20x20 cm2 to quantitatively resolve the electrolyte inventory and distribution within LiFePO4/graphite pouch cells under high-temperature accelerated aging. Quantitative standard curves based on neutron transmission attenuation reveal a clear electrolyte dry-out threshold at 3.18 g Ah-1 and the two stages evolutions of EI during cell aging were quantified. By integrating non-destructive electrochemical diagnostics, accelerated graphite material loss and liquid phase Li+ diffusion degradation is observed during pore-drying. Further analysis, including operando cyclic aging, reveals that the neutron transmission below the saturation reference is due to the enrichment of hydrogen nuclei within the solid-electrolyte interphase. Assumed pore-drying does not occur, the SEI signal of the electrodes can be quantitatively decoupled during ageing. Combined analyses with NI, TOF-SIMS, and SEM reveal that high EI cells exhibit uniform SEI growth and reduced degradation, while low EI cells show uneven SEI formation, accelerating capacity loss. This study unveils a dynamic electrolyte infiltration-consumption-dry-out process in LIBs, offering non-destructive and quantitative insights to guide sustainable and durable battery development.</description>

      <title>Engineering Nonporous Polymer Hybrids with Suppressed Heat Conduction and Enhanced Flame Retardancy via Molecular and Filler Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a new strategy for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in nonporous polymer/organic filler hybrids by suppressing heat capacity through tailored atomic vibrations to enhance thermal insulation. Unlike conventional polymer/inorganic filler hybrids, these hybrids exhibit interfacial thermal resistance one to three orders of magnitude lower. Combined experiments and simulations uncover thermal transport mechanisms. These hybrids demonstrate enhanced flame retardancy. Please see the abstract in the attached PDF.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of Fluid Transport in Low Temperature Water Electrolyzers and Fuel Cells: Emerging Technologies and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low temperature water electrolyzers (LTWEs) and low temperature hydrogen fuel cells (LTFCs) present a promising technological strategy for the productions and usages of green hydrogen energy towards a net-zero world. However, the interactions of gas/liquid (fluid) transport and the intrinsic reaction kinetics in LTWEs/LTFCs present one of the key hurdles hindering high production rate and high energy conversion efficiency. Addressing these limitations requires analytical tools that are capable of resolving fluid transport across the heterogeneous, multiscale structures of operating LTWE and LTFC systems. This review provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in measurement technologies for investigating fluid transport. We first outline the technical requirements of such analytical systems, and assess the capabilities and limitations of established optical, X-rays and neutrons based imaging systems. We emphasis on emerging strategies that utilize integrated miniaturized sensors, ultrasound, and other alternative physical principles to achieve operando, high-resolution, and scalable measurements towards applications at device and system levels. Finally, we outline future directions in this highly interdisciplinary field, emphasizing the importance of next-generation sensing concepts to overcome the fluid transport hurdle, towards accelerating the deployment of green hydrogen technologies.</description>

      <title>Advanced creep modelling for polymers: A variable-order fractional calculus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-based plastics exhibit time-dependent deformation under constant stress, known as creep, which can lead to rupture or static fatigue. A common misconception is that materials under tolerable static loads remain unaffected over time. Accurate long-term deformation predictions require experimental creep data, but conventional models based on simple rheological elements like springs and dampers often fall short, lacking the flexibility to capture the power-law behaviour intrinsic to creep processes. The springpot, a fractional calculus-based element, has been used to provide a power-law relationship; however, its fixed-order nature limits its accuracy, particularly when the deformation rate evolves over time. This article introduces a variable-order (VO) springpot model that dynamically adapts to the evolving viscoelastic properties of polymeric materials during creep, capturing changes between glassy, transition and rubbery phases. Model parameters are calibrated using a robust procedure for model identification based on the cross-entropy (CE) method, resulting in physically consistent and accurate predictions. This advanced modelling framework not only overcomes the limitations of the fixed-order models but also establishes a foundation for applying VO mechanics to other viscoelastic materials, providing a valuable tool for predicting long-term material performance in structural applications.</description>

      <title>Ideal Optical Antimatter using Passive Lossy Materials under Complex Frequency Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original concept of left-handed material has inspired the possibility of optical antimatter, where the effect of light propagation through a medium can be completely cancelled by its complementary medium. Despite recent progress in the development of negative-index metamaterials, losses continue to be a significant barrier to realizing optical antimatter. In this work, we show that passive, lossy materials can be used to realize optical antimatter when illuminated by light at a complex frequency. We further establish that one can engineer arbitrary complex-valued permittivity and permeability in such materials. Strikingly, we show that materials with a positive index at real frequencies can act as negative-index materials under complex frequency excitation. Using our approach, we numerically demonstrate the optical antimatter functionality, as well as double focusing by an ideal perfect lens and superscattering. Our work demonstrates the power of temporally structured light in unlocking the promising opportunities of complementary media, which have until now been inhibited by material loss.</description>

      <title>Towards fully predictive gyrokinetic full-f simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing economical magnetic confinement fusion power plants motivates computational tools that can estimate plasma behavior from engineering parameters without direct reliance on experimental measurement of the plasma profiles. In this work, we present full-$f$ global gyrokinetic (GK) turbulence simulations of edge and scrape-off layer turbulence in tokamaks that use only magnetic geometry, heating power, and particle inventory as inputs. Unlike many modeling approaches that employ free parameters fitted to experimental data, raising uncertainties when extrapolating to reactor scales, his approach directly simulates turbulence and resulting profiles through GK without such empirical adjustments. This is achieved via an adaptive sourcing algorithm in Gkeyll that strictly controls energy injection and emulates particle sourcing due to neutral recycling. We show that the simulated kinetic profiles compare reasonably well with Thomson scattering and Langmuir probe data for Tokamak \`{a} Configuration Variable (TCV) discharge #65125, and that the simulations reproduce characteristic features such as blob transport and self-organized electric fields. Applying the same framework to study triangularity effects suggests mechanisms contributing to the improved confinement reported for negative triangularity (NT). Simulations of TCV discharges #65125 and #65130 indicate that NT increases the $E \times B$ flow shear (by about 20% in these cases), which correlates with reduced turbulent losses and a modest change in the distribution of power exhaust to the vessel wall. While the physical models contain approximations that can be refined in future work, the predictive capability demonstrated here, evolving multiple profile relaxation times with kinetic electron and ion models in hundreds of GPU hours, indicates the feasibility of using Gkeyll to support design studies of fusion devices.</description>

      <title>Metalorganic Chemical Vapor Deposition of AlScN Thin Films and AlScN/AlN/GaN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AlScN thin films were grown via metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD), showing controllable incorporation of scandium (Sc) into the AlN lattices. Systematic variation of growth parameters demonstrated an obvious influence on Sc incorporation, with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicating Sc composition up to $\sim$13\% when (MCp)$_2$ScCl was used as the precursor. AlScN/AlN/GaN heterostructures grown on GaN templates exhibited the formation of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) channel at the AlScN/AlN--GaN interface, confirming their potential use in high electron mobility transistor (HEMT) device technologies. Variation in AlScN/AlN barrier thickness within the heterostructures showed that thicker barriers yield higher sheet charge densities from both Hall and capacitance-voltage (C--V) measurements. With an AlScN/AlN barrier thickness of $\sim$30~nm, a sheet charge density of $5.22\times10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$ was extracted from C--V. High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) further confirmed Sc incorporation and revealed the wurtzite crystalline structure of the films and heterostructures. These results establish MOCVD growth of AlScN as a promising and compatible material for advancing III-nitride heterostructures in high-performance electronics and potentially ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Single chip 1 Tb/s optical transmitter with inverse designed input and output couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical interconnects are essential for data centers and AI systems. Given the limited energy production, ultra-low energy and dense optical interconnects are required to support the exponential growth of AI systems. Here we report the demonstration of a monolithically integrated optical transmitter where use of power efficient architecture and devices such as capacitive tuning of optical structures at zero static power consumption and efficient and wideband inverse designed grating couplers enable implementation of a 32-channel transmitter chip based on wavelength-division multiplexing achieving a record modulation energy efficiency of 32 fJ/b at 5 Gb/s/channel and 106 fJ/b at 32 Gb/s/channel, which includes the tuning of optical devices. Furthermore, a bit-error-rate of 1E-12 was achieved, while all channels are simultaneously operating with an aggregate data-rate of 1.024 Tb/s. The system utilizes 16 carrier wavelengths in the optical C band. The pseudo-random-bit-streams are electrically generated on-chip and used to drive individually wavelength-stabilized 2-section p-n-capacitive micro-ring modulators using integrated energy-efficient high-swing electrical drivers. The low-loss inverse designed grating couplers have -1-dB bandwidth of 25 nm. The chip concurrently achieves the highest aggregate data-rate, the highest energy efficiency and the highest bandwidth density for a multi-channel high date-rate optical transmitter chip reported to date.</description>

      <title>Kinetic modelling of the CO2 capture and utilisation on NiRu-Ca/Al dual function material via parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed, open-source kinetic modelling computational framework for CO2 capture and utilisation using a newly formulated dual-function material (DFM) comprising 15 wt% Ni, 1 wt% Ru, and 10 wt% CaO supported on spherical alumina. A finite difference reactor model was developed to simulate the cyclic adsorption, purge, and hydrogenation stages. The model incorporates experimentally-derived rate expressions, accounts for system delay via a second-order response function, and was fitted to time-resolved concentration laboratory data using Bayesian optimisation. A combined parameter estimation strategy was employed to ensure mass continuity across stages and improve the robustness of purge kinetics. The kinetic parameters extracted reveal that carbonate decomposition, not methanation, is the rate-limiting step during hydrogenation. Temperature-dependent simulations confirm a trade-off between reaction kinetics and CO2 storage capacity, with methane yield maximised at 300C when compared with the other temperature sets. By offering transparent methodology and reproducible code, this work provides a robust platform for researchers and practitioners to study, validate, and optimise DFM systems.</description>

      <title>Two-stream network-driven vision-based tactile sensor for object feature extraction and fusion perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize objects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems. This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied perception applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</description>
