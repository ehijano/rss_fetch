      <title>Kolmogorov turbulence in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated turbulence in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) using a minimally destructive, impurity injection technique analogous to particle image velocimetry in conventional fluids. Our approach transfers small regions of the BEC into a different hyperfine state, and tracks their displacement ultimately yielding the velocity field. This allows us to quantify turbulence in the same way as conventional in fluid dynamics in terms of velocity-velocity correlation functions called velocity structure functions that obey a Kolmogorov scaling law. Furthermore the velocity increments show a clear fat-tail non-Gaussian distribution that results from intermittency corrections to the initial "K41" Kolmogorov theory. Our observations are fully consistent with the later "KO62" description. These results are validated by a 2D dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii simulation.</description>

      <title>Short wavelength limit of the dynamic Matsubara local field correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the short wavelength limit of the dynamic Matsubara local field correction $\widetilde{G}(\mathbf{q},z_l)$ of the uniform electron gas based on direct \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results over an unprecedented range of wavenumbers, $q\lesssim20q_\textnormal{F}$, where $q_\textnormal{F}$ is the Fermi wavenumber. We find excellent agreement with the analytically derived asymptotic limit by Hou \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~B}~\textbf{106}, L081126 (2022)] for the static local field correction and empirically confirm the independence of the short wavelength limit with respect to the Matsubara frequency $z_l$. In the warm dense matter regime, we find that the onset of the quantum tail in the static local field correction closely coincides with the onset of the algebraic tail in the momentum distribution function and the corresponding empirical criterion reported by Hunger \emph{et al.}~[\textit{Phys.~Rev.~E} \textbf{103}, 053204 (2021)]. In the strongly coupled electron liquid regime, our calculations reveal a more complicated non-monotonic convergence towards the $q\to\infty$ limit that is shaped by the spatial structure in the system. We expect our results to be of broad interest for a number of fields including the study of matter under extreme conditions, the development of improved dielectric theories, and the construction of advanced exchange--correlation functionals for thermal density functional theory.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Witness for Indistinguishable Electrons using Solid-State Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing entanglement in quantum materials is crucial for advancing next-generation quantum technologies. Despite recent strides in witnessing entanglement in magnetic materials with distinguishable spin modes, quantifying entanglement in systems formed by indistinguishable electrons remains a formidable challenge. To solve this problem, we introduce a method to extract various four-fermion correlations by analyzing the nonlinearity in resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra. These correlations constitute the primary components of the cumulant two-particle reduced density matrix (RDM). We further derive bounds for its eigenvalues and demonstrate the linear scaling with fermionic entanglement depth, providing a reliable witness for entanglement. Using the material-relevant strongly correlated models as examples, we show how this this entanglement witness can efficiently quantify multipartite entanglement across different phase regions, highlighting its advantage over quantum Fisher information (QFI).</description>

      <title>Regeneration of Spin Wave in Atomic Vapor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventionally, atomic vapor is perceived as a non-living system governed by the principles of thermodynamics and statistical physics. However, the demarcation line between life and non-life appears to be less distinct than previously thought. In a study of amplifying spin waves, we observe a phenomenon reminiscent of life: The atomic spin wave stored in atomic vapor has a capability of absorbing energy from an external light source, and exhibits behaviors akin to active regeneration. We demonstrate that this regeneration significantly enhances the lifetime and retrieval efficiency of the spin wave, while concurrently the noise is effectively suppressed. Our results suggest that the regeneration mechanism holds promise for mitigating the pronounced decoherence typically encountered in spin waves carried by room-temperature media, therefore offering potential applications in the realms of quantum information and precision measurements at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Instability of the engineered dark state in two-band fermions under number-conserving dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlated quantum many-body states can be created and controlled by the dissipative protocols. Among these, particle number-conserving protocols are particularly appealing due to their ability to stabilize topologically nontrivial phases. Is there any fundamental limitation to their performance? We address this question by examining a general class of models involving a two-band fermion system subjected to dissipation designed to transfer fermions from the upper band to the lower band. By construction, these models have a guaranteed steady state -- a dark state -- with a completely filled lower band and an empty upper band. In the limit of weak dissipation, we derive equations governing the dynamics of the fermion densities over long length and time scales. These equations belong to the Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov reaction-diffusion universality class. Our analysis reveals that the engineered dark state is generically unstable, giving way to a new steady state with a finite density of particles in the upper band. Our results suggest that number-conserving dissipative protocols may not be a reliable universal tool for stabilizing dark states.</description>

      <title>Hidden curved spaces in Bosonic Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum matter in curved spaces exhibits remarkable properties unattainable in flat spaces. To access curved spaces in laboratories, the conventional wisdom is that physical distortions need to be implemented into a system. In contrast to this belief, here, we show that two hyperbolic surfaces readily exist in bosonic Kitaev model in the absence of any physical distortions and give rise to a range of intriguing phenomena, such as chiral quantum transport or chiral reaction-diffusion. A finite chemical potential couples these two hyperbolic surfaces, delivering a quantum sensor whose sensitivity grows exponentially with the size of the system. Our results provide experimentalists with an unprecedented opportunity to explore intriguing quantum phenomena in curve spaces without distortion or access non-Hermitian phenomena without dissipation. Our work also suggests a new class of quantum sensors in which geometry amplifies small signals.</description>
