      <title>Probing Thin Winds in Massive OB Stars of the SMC with JWST/NIRSPEC Br-alpha Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss is a key physical process in the evolution of massive stars, the impact of which propagates into galactic evolution, population synthesis models, the interpretation of high-redshift galaxies, and explosive events such as supernovae. However, there are currently substantial uncertainties in the low-metallicity, low-luminosity thin wind regime where classical diagnostics (H-alpha and ultraviolet, UV, P Cygni profiles) yield wind momenta that are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude below prescriptions implemented by default in most evolutionary models. Here, we present spectra of the mass-loss diagnostic line Br-alpha in 15 OB-type stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud obtained using the Near Infrared Spectrograph on the James Webb Space Telescope. The line profile morphology, recovered by virtue of the outstanding signal-to-noise ratio of the data and the avoidance of regions with nebular emission, is consistent with predictions based on previous mass-loss rate estimates from optical and UV spectroscopy. Moreover, an initial spectroscopic analysis of sources covering the thin wind regime confirms the low mass-loss rates, indicates a change of slope in the wind-momentum-luminosity relation in this regime with respect to high-luminosity objects, and strengthens the abovementioned discrepancies with commonly used wind-momentum prescriptions.</description>

      <title>Double-faced white dwarfs and the magnetic inhibition of convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About one in five white dwarfs undergoes spectral evolution from a helium atmosphere to hydrogen and then back to helium. These short-lived hydrogen envelopes - the result of residual hydrogen diffusion - are eventually destroyed by either hydrogen or helium convection. An emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs seems to catch this process in the act, with varying amounts of hydrogen across regions of the stellar surface. Here, we quantitatively test the hypothesis that these inhomogeneities are the result of the magnetic inhibition of convection. We compute the critical magnetic field $B_{\rm crit}(M,T_{\rm eff})\sim\sqrt{8\pi P}$ required to inhibit convection in both hydrogen and helium for $0.6-1.2\,M_\odot$ white dwarfs, where $P$ is the pressure at the base of the convection zone. When incorporating the magnetic field consistently into the stellar structure even at high pressures $P&gt;B^2/(8\pi)$, we find that most of the measured magnetic fields $B$ of observed double-faced white dwarfs satisfy $B_{\rm crit}^{\rm H}\lesssim B\lesssim B_{\rm crit}^{\rm He}$, such that the magnetic inhibition of either hydrogen or helium convection could potentially explain the observations. Specifically, order of unity variations in the magnetic field's strength or orientation across the surface could account for the double-faced nature of these stars.</description>

      <title>Tracing stellar rotation in young massive LMC clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of stellar rotation along the main sequences of NGC 1866 and NGC 1856, two young (~200-300 Myr) massive clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud, using MUSE integral field spectroscopy. Differences in stellar rotation have been proposed as an explanation for the extended main sequence turn-offs and split main sequences in these clusters. In agreement with this idea, we find strong links between the photometric colours of the cluster stars and their projected rotation velocities, Vsini. While stars blueward of the split main sequences are characterized by a range of relatively low spins, those with redder colours are fast rotators. Following a statistical correction for inclination, we measure mean equatorial velocities for the red main-sequence stars in both clusters of V_eq=300 km/s, corresponding to 70-80% of the critical values predicted for such stars by current stellar models. We discuss these findings in the context of the different scenarios proposed to explain the stellar rotation distributions of young massive clusters. We further investigate whether the high rotation rates provide a natural explanation for the high fractions of Be stars we observe in both clusters, peaking at &gt;~50% at the turn-off. We argue that if ~85% of the critical rotation rate is high enough to trigger the formation of a decretion disk, most upper main sequence stars in the clusters are expected to become Be stars before leaving the main sequence.</description>

      <title>Solar Vortices as Conduits for Magnetoacoustic Waves: Multi-Layer Coupling and Their Role in Atmospheric Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun's atmosphere hosts swirling plasma structures, known as solar vortices, which have long been thought to channel wave energy into higher layers. Until now, no direct observations have confirmed their role in the heating of the atmosphere. Here, we present the first direct evidence that solar vortices act as structured waveguides, carrying magnetoacoustic modes (waves that behave like sound waves but travel through magnetized plasma) that leave clear wave-heating signatures. By mapping vortex regions at multiple heights and analysing the waves they contain, we show that magnetoacoustic waves efficiently transfer energy, offset losses from radiation, and dominate energy transport in the lower chromosphere. These results challenge the long-standing assumption that vortices primarily support twisting disturbances traveling along magnetic field lines (Alfven waves), revealing instead that magnetoacoustic modes play the leading role in the lower atmosphere. This redefines the role of vortices in magnetized plasmas and has broader implications for wave-plasma interactions in regions of strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Double White Dwarf Binaries in SDSS-V DR19 : A catalog of DA white dwarf binaries and constraints on the binary population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-V) includes the first large-scale spectroscopic survey of white dwarfs (WDs) in the era of Gaia parallaxes. SDSS-V collects multiple exposures per target, making it ideal for binary detection. We present a search for hydrogen atmosphere (DA) double white dwarf (DWD) binaries in this rich dataset. We quantify radial velocity variations between sub-exposures to identify binary candidates, and also measure the orbital period for a subset of DWD binary candidates. We find 63 DWD binary candidates, of which 43 are new discoveries, and we provide tentative periods for 10 binary systems. Using these measurements, we place constraints on the binary fraction of the Galactic WD population with $&lt; 0.4$ AU separations $f_{\mathrm{bin,0.4}} = 9\%$, and the power-law index of the initial separation distribution $\alpha = -0.62$. Using the simulated binary population, we estimate that $\leq 10$ super-Chandrasekhar binaries that merge within a Hubble time are expected in our sample. We predict that $\leq 5$ systems in our sample should be detectable via gravitational waves by LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna), one of which has already been identified as a LISA verification source. We also estimate a total of about 10,000 - 20,000 LISA-detectable DWD binaries in the galaxy. Our catalog of WD+WD binary candidates in SDSS-V is now public, and promises to uncover a large number of exciting DWD systems.</description>

      <title>The Role of Far-side Magnetic Structures in Modeling 2024 Solar Eclipse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The corona is a crucial region that connects the solar surface to the solar wind and serves as the primary site of solar activity. The 2024 total solar eclipse (TSE) provides a unique opportunity to investigate the large-scale coronal structure. Combined with TSE observations, we study the impact of the magnetic structure of the far-side active region, located in the eastern hemisphere of the Sun that has not yet rotated into the Earth Field-of-View (FoV), on a global Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation. To address the limitation of single-view measurements in the routine synoptic map, we correct the magnetic field in the far-side region by incorporating full-disk magnetograms measured several days after the TSE, allowing us to capture the temporal evolution of the photospheric magnetic field in near real-time. Simulation results demonstrate that the local magnetic field in the far-side active region can significantly influence the global coronal structure by altering the position of the heliospheric current sheet (HCS), and further affect the global distribution of plasma parameters, even in polar regions. A comparison of the simulation results with white-light (WL) TSE + LASCO C2 observations and in situ measurements by the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) reveals that the composite synoptic map improves the accuracy of coronal modeling. This work provides robust support for advancing our understanding of coronal evolution, as well as deepens the link between the photosphere and large-scale coronal structure. Furthermore, it establishes a theoretical foundation for the future development of multi-view, stereoscopic measurements of the photospheric magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Lithium Abundances of Main-Sequence Stars in the Old Open Cluster NGC 188: Probes of Stellar Evolution Beyond the Solar Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present lithium abundances for 119 main-sequence stars in the 6.3 Gyr open cluster NGC 188, using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise ratio spectra from WIYN/Hydra. We observe the stars over multiple nights and measure radial velocities for each night, which we combine with Gaia proper motions to identify multiplicity and cluster membership. We identify 95 single members, 14 binary members, 9 members with uncertain multiplicity, and 1 single likely member. We determine effective temperatures using empirical color-temperature relations, surface gravities from isochrones, and microturbulence from empirical relations for main-sequence stars. Our sample includes G and K dwarfs with temperatures between 6000 and 5300 K, which expands significantly on earlier observations. We find that lithium abundances in NGC 188 are lower than predictions from standard stellar evolution theory. As expected, stars in NGC 188 are more lithium-depleted than those in the younger Hyades and Praesepe clusters (650 Myr). However, their abundances are higher, or at least comparable, to those in the slightly younger cluster M67 (4.5 Gyr), challenging the idea that older stars have lower lithium than younger ones. Lithium depletion may depend on factors beyond age and mass.</description>

      <title>J-VAR: Analysis of RR Lyrae light curves in seven optical bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. RR Lyrae stars are key distance indicators and tracers of old stellar populations in the Milky Way and its satellites. Accurate period and amplitude measurements are essential for constraining stellar evolution and mapping Galactic structure. The Javalambre VARiability (J-VAR) survey provides valuable time-series data across seven optical bands, including gri and four medium and narrow bands. Aims. Our goal is to construct and analyze light curves for RR Lyrae stars identified in the first data release (DR1) of the J-VAR survey using the Gaia DR3 variable stars catalog as a reference. Methods. The light curves of 315 RR Lyrae were analyzed by fitting templates from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) multiband template library. The periods and amplitudes for the seven bands in J-VAR were independently obtained from the best-fitted templates. Results. The J-VAR periods show strong agreement with Gaia DR3 values, which confirms the reliability of the applied methodology. The Bailey diagram for each J-VAR filter reveals the expected trend for RRab and RRc stars, with larger pulsation amplitudes at bluer wavelengths. After normalizing by the r-band amplitude, an exponential trend is found, with the bluer J-VAR filter centered at 395 nm having twice the amplitude of the reddest J-VAR passband at 861 nm. The normalized amplitudes of the RR Lyrae stars from Gaia and the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) are consistent with the J-VAR trend. Finally, the SDSS templates derived from broadbands also provide a proper description for the medium and narrow band light curves. Conclusions. The J-VAR RR Lyrae catalog offers reliable pulsation parameters and light curves in seven optical filters, allowing the systematic study of amplitude trends from 395 to 860 nm and offering a unique benchmark for theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Observations of the fluctuations in Interplanetary Magnetic Field around L1 point during the solar transient events of 2024 with MAG payload onboard Aditya-L1 spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MAG payload onboard India's first solar mission, Aditya-L1, is a dual-senssor fluxgate magnetometer designed to measure th interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) while operating in a halo orbit around the first Sun-Earth Lagrangian point (l1). Since becoming operational in January 2024, MAG has continuously recorded local magnetic field data and has captured several solar transient events over the past one year. During these events, the IMF, typically around 5 nT, exhibited significant enhancements in magnitude. This study focuses on three such solar events observed in March, May, and October 2024. Analysis of the magnetic field power spectra during these events reveals fluctuations consistent with Kolmogorov type turbulence, characterized by a spectral slope close to -5/3. To emphasize changes in spectral behavior, the event-day spectra are compared with those from a day when the quiet solar wind conditions prevail. A marked contrast is observed: while the quiet periods exhibit anisotropic turbulence, the extreme events display quasi-isotropic behavior, with spectral slopes closely following the Kolmogorov spectrum across all three IMF components. The results, including detailed variations in spectral slope and turbulence characteristics, are presented and discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Atmospheres and Circumstellar Interaction in J1901+1458: Revisiting the Most Compact White Dwarf Merger Remnant in the light of new UV and X-ray data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double degenerate white dwarf (WD) mergers can exhibit extreme magnetic fields exceeding $10^{8}$ G and rapid rotation, but their spectral-energy distributions and high-energy emission mechanisms remain poorly characterised. ZTF J1901+1458 stands out as the most compact and strongly magnetised object discovered in this class to date. Recent Chandra observations have revealed that the white dwarf is also a source of soft X-ray emission, inconsistent with a photospheric origin. We analyse new phase resolved UV spectroscopy from the HST combined with optical and near-infrared photometry and spectroscopy, with newly developed magnetic atmosphere models to determine its effective temperature, radius, mass, average surface magnetic field strength, and cooling age. Our results demonstrate that the spectral break at $\approx$3000 {\AA}, observed in several highly magnetised WDs, is well-reproduced by our new models, which take into account the effect of magnetic opacities on the structure of the atmosphere. Our best-fit parameters for the WD yield an effective temperature ($T_{\rm{eff}}=28,015\pm 20$ K) and larger radius ($2630\pm10$ km) than previously reported. Furthermore, the near-infrared data exclude the presence of a stellar or brown dwarf companion hotter than $\approx$700 K. We also jointly analyse the previously published Chandra data and new XMM-Newton X-ray spectra. The faint X-ray emission, $L_X =(1.3\pm0.2)\times10^{27}$ erg/s is very soft and highly pulsed on the rotation period of the WD. We suggest that the X-rays are powered by accretion or via the interaction of the WD magnetosphere with CSM. If the rapidly rotating magnetic field could power a weak wind along open field lines, material could be extracted directly from the surface of the WD. Alternatively, accretion of fallback material from the merger or the tidal disruption of a planetary body are possible sources of CSM.</description>

      <title>CoSEE-Cat: A Comprehensive Solar Energetic Electron event Catalogue obtained from combined in situ and remote-sensing observations from Solar Orbiter -- Catalogue description and first statistical results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (abridged) The acceleration of particles at the Sun and their propagation through interplanetary space are key topics in heliophysics. Specifically, solar energetic electrons (SEEs) measured in situ can be linked to solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which can be observed remotely in radio, optical, UV and X-rays. Solar Orbiter, equipped with a wide range of remote-sensing and in situ detectors, provides an excellent opportunity to investigate SEEs and their solar origin from the inner heliosphere. The Comprehensive Solar Energetic Electron event Catalogue (CoSEE-Cat) provides details for all SEE events measured in situ by Solar Orbiter, as well as associated flares, CMEs, and radio bursts. The catalogue contains key parameters of the SEEs, as derived from the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), complemented with basic parameters of associated X-ray flares provided by STIX, information on eruptive phenomena seen by EUI, characteristics of type III radio bursts observed by RPW, and indications of CME observed by Metis and SoloHI. The conditions in interplanetary space were characterised using SWA and MAG measurements. Finally, data-driven modelling with the Magnetic Connectivity Tool provided an independent estimate of the solar source position of the SEEs. The first data release contains 303 SEE events observed from November 2020 until the end of 2022. In this paper, we describe the catalogue and provide a first statistical analysis. Preliminary results support the flare-related origin of events with an impulsive ion composition and the association of gradual events with extended structures such as CME-driven shocks or erupting flux ropes. We also show that the commonly observed delays of the solar release times of the SEEs relative to the associated X-ray flares and type III radio bursts are at least partially due to propagation effects.</description>

      <title>Stellar-activity analysis of the nearby M dwarf GJ 526. Multi-dimensional Gaussian-process modelling of RV, FWHM and S-index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarfs are the most abundant stars in the Galaxy, and their low masses make them natural favourites for exoplanet radial-velocity (RV) searches. Nevertheless, these stars often demonstrate strong stellar activity that is yet to be fully understood. We use high-precision ESPRESSO, HIRES, and HARPS spectroscopy to perform a stellar-activity analysis on the nearby early M dwarf GJ 526 ($d=5.4$ pc). We carry out joint modelling of: (i) stellar rotation in RV, FWHM, and Mount Wilson S-index through Gaussian processes, (ii) long-term trends in these three physical quantities, (iii) RV planetary signals. We constrain the stellar-rotation period to $P_\text{rot}=48.7\pm 0.3$ d, and discover a weak sinusoidal signature in RV, FWHM and S-index of period $P_\text{cyc}=1680^{+50}_{-40}$ d. We propose phase-space trajectories between RV and activity indicators as a novel means to visualise and interpret stellar activity. Current evidence does not support planetary companions of GJ 526.</description>

      <title>Search for Past Stellar Encounters and the Origin of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity. To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.</description>

      <title>Elemental and Isotopic Yields from T Coronae Borealis: Predictions and Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: T Coronae Borealis (T CrB) is a symbiotic recurrent nova system expected to undergo its next outburst within the next two years. Recent hydrodynamic simulations have predicted the nucleosynthetic yields for both carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) white-dwarf models, but without accounting for thermonuclear reaction-rate uncertainties. We perform detailed Monte Carlo post-processing nucleosynthesis calculations based on updated thermonuclear reaction rates and uncertainties from the 2025 evaluation. We quantify the resulting abundance uncertainties and identify the key nuclear reactions that dominate them. Our results show that both the CO and ONe nova models robustly produce characteristic CNO isotopes. More pronounced abundance differences emerge for elements with A $\ge$ 20. Sulfur is the most robust observational discriminator between the CO and ONe nova models, with a model-to-model difference of a factor of $\approx$30 and minimal sensitivity to reaction rate uncertainties. Neon, silicon, and phosphorus exhibit even larger abundance differences (factors of $\approx$150-250), providing strong diagnostic potential. While their predicted yields are subject to larger uncertainties, these remain smaller than the model-to-model differences, allowing these elements to serve as useful, though less precise, tracers of white-dwarf composition. Chlorine, argon, and potassium also differ between models, but the 1$\sigma$-abundance ranges for the CO and ONe models overlap, reducing their present usefulness as composition tracers. We find that only nine nuclear reactions dominate the abundance uncertainties of the most diagnostically important isotopes, and their influence is largely independent of the underlying white-dwarf composition. These results provide guidance for future experimental efforts and for interpreting ejecta compositions in the next eruption of T CrB.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen-deficient binary stars with magnetic braking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-deficient binary stars comprise one star which has been stripped of its hydrogen through mass transfer to a binary companion. Observations show that the companion is able to accrete several solar masses without spinning up to critical rotation, and so there must be a mechanism to drain spin angular momentum from the accretor. We test magnetically coupled winds and magnetic star-disc coupling as possible mechanisms and find that, while the disc coupling is negligible, the winds are sufficient to allow the accretor to gain mass without spinning up to critical rotation. However, in order to fully replicate observations, time-dependent scalings of the dynamo-generated magnetic field are needed.</description>

      <title>Is the composition of the Solar atmosphere unusual, and if so, why? Possible interpretations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing discussion about the atomic chemical composition of the Sun is commented on. The main focus in this review is on the deviation of the solar composition from that of most other solar-type stars in that its ratio of volatiles (like the elements C, N, O, S, P and Zn) to the refractories (most metals, like Ba, Ca, Ti, Y, Al, Sc and Zr) tends to be higher in the Sun by 10 to 20%. What does this tell about the formation and evolution of the Solar System? Scenarios in terms of galactic evolution, formation of the pre-solar nebula, of the evolution of the protoplanetary disk, of the engulfing of planets, and of other processes within the Solar System are considered, as well as the evolution of binary stars with similarly different chemical composition. Finally, implications, if any, on the habitability of the Solar System are commented on.</description>

      <title>Crowning the Queen: Membership, Age, Rotation, and Activity for the Open Cluster Coma Berenices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being only 85 pc away, the open cluster Coma Berenices (Coma Ber) has not been extensively studied. This is due in part to its sparseness and low proper motion, which together made Coma Ber's membership challenging to establish. Gaia data for $\approx$400 previously cataloged candidate cluster stars allowed us to identify $\approx$300 as members. With [Fe/H] measurements for nine members, we found that Coma Ber has a solar metallicity, and then fit isochrones to its color--magnitude diagram to determine that it is 675$\pm$100 Myr old. With photometry obtained by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we measured rotation periods for 137 of Coma Ber's low-mass stars, increasing the sample of members with measured periods by a factor of six, and extending the rotational census for the cluster from its late F stars through to its fully convective M dwarfs. By measuring the equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ line for $\approx$250 stars and collecting X-ray detections for $\approx$100 ($\approx$85% and $\approx$33% of the cluster's members, respectively), we characterized magnetic activity in Coma Ber and examined the dependence of chromospheric and of coronal activity on rotation in these stars. Despite having a metallicity that is 0.2 dex below that of their coeval cousins in Praesepe and the Hyades, low-mass stars in Coma Ber seem to follow a similar rotation--activity relation. In detail, however, there are differences that may provide further insight into the impact of metallicity on this still poorly understood relation.</description>

      <title>Gas in Globular Clusters I: Gas Retention and Its Possible Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) host complex stellar populations whose chemical signatures imply early retention and reprocessing of stellar ejecta, yet direct evidence for intracluster gas is lacking. Here we present a unified theoretical framework for the accumulation, fate, and eventual removal of gas released by evolved stars in young GCs, and their implications for the production of multiple stellar populations. Using MIST stellar evolution tracks, we show that low-velocity (&lt; 20 km/s) AGB winds, each released over 10^4 yr, are gravitationally retained in &gt;10^5 MSun clusters. In addition, AGB winds in such clusters collide with each other and the previously retained winds, triggering a rapid `switch' to efficient gas retention. Expected gas retention fractions, mapped across cluster initial mass and size, agree well with the observed second population fractions in Milky Way GCs. We then show that the accumulated gas cannot form new stars because protostellar cores are disrupted by encounters with pre-existing stars over 1 - 10 kyr. Instead, the gas is accreted onto pre-existing main-sequence stars and compact objects. Bondi-Hoyle accretion and time-dependent core-halo models indicate that both white dwarfs and neutron stars can grow and collapse within a few 100 Myr, and that lower-mass main-sequence stars can be `rejuvenated' into the 4 - 6 MSun range required to reproduce key abundance patterns. Therefore, in our model, the multiple populations will be found in sufficiently massive clusters, with the second-population stars being formed from the inner subset of first-population stars that accreted large fractions of their mass from the AGB-processed retained gas. Finally, we argue that a combination of feedback processes will clear the gas by 10^9 yr, thus reproducing the gas-poor conditions observed for present-day clusters.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolution of Quasi-Hierarchical Triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the gravitational dynamics of quasi-hierarchical triple systems, where the outer orbital period is significantly longer than the inner one, but the outer orbit is extremely eccentric, rendering the time at pericentre comparable to the inner period. Such systems are not amenable to the standard techniques of perturbation theory and orbit-averaging. Modelling the evolution of these triples as a sequence of impulses at the outer pericentre, we show that such triples lend themselves to a description as a correlated random walk of the inner binary's eccentricity and angular-momentum vector, going beyond the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism. The outer orbit is seen to excite the inner eccentricity arbitrarily close to unity, eventually. These quasi-hierarchical triples constitute, therefore, a natural mechanism for creating highly eccentric binaries. We discuss applications for gravitational-wave mergers engendered by this process, and show that for a large portion of the parameter space, the time-to-coalescence is significantly reduced.</description>

      <title>A Diagnostic Kit for Optical Emission Lines Shaped by Accretion Disc Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blueshifted absorption is the classic spectroscopic signature of an accretion disc wind in X-ray binaries and cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, outflows can also create pure emission lines, especially at optical wavelengths. Therefore, developing other outflow diagnostics for these types of lines is worthwhile. With this in mind, we construct a systematic grid of 3645 synthetic wind-formed H-alpha line profiles for CVs with the radiative transfer code SIROCCO. Our grid yields a variety of line shapes: symmetric, asymmetric, single- to quadruple-peaked, and even P-Cygni profiles. About 20% of these lines -- our `Gold' sample -- have strengths and widths consistent with observations. We use this grid to test a recently proposed method for identifying wind-formed emission lines based on deviations in the wing profile shape: the `excess equivalent width diagnostic diagram'. We find that our `Gold' sample can preferentially populate the suggested `wind regions' of this diagram. However, the method is highly sensitive to the adopted definition of the line profile `wing'. Hence, we propose a refined definition based on the full-width at half maximum to improve the interpretability of the diagnostic diagram. Furthermore, we define an approximate scaling relation for the strengths of wind-formed CV emission lines in terms of the outflow parameters. This relation provides a fast way to assess whether -- and what kind of -- outflow can produce an observed emission line. All our wind-based models are open-source and we provide an easy-to-use web-based tool to browse our full set of H-alpha spectral profiles.</description>

      <title>EdgeAttNet: Towards Barb-Aware Filament Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster inference performance suitable for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>A second low-mass planet orbiting the nearby M-dwarf GJ 536</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GJ 536 is a low-mass star, located 10 pc away from the Sun, that hosts a low-mass planet orbiting with a period of 8.71 days. Based on an analysis of the radial velocity (RV) time series obtained from the available data of the spectrographs HARPS, HARPS-N, CARMENES and HIRES, we announce the discovery of a second low-mass planet orbiting the star. We performed a RV global analysis on RV, spectroscopic activity indicators, and ASAS photometry, within the multidimensional Gaussian process framework, updated the parameters of GJ 536 b, and found significant evidence of the presence of a second planet. GJ 536 c is a low-mass planet ($m_{p} \sin i$ = 5.89 $\pm$ 0.70 M$_{\oplus}$), orbiting with a period of 32.761 $\pm$ 0.015 days, at a distance of 0.1617 $\pm$ 0.0028 au from its parent star. It induces an RV semi-amplitude of 1.80 $\pm$ 0.20 m$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. Given its distance to the star, it receives a flux of 1.692 $\pm$ 0.069 F$_{\oplus}$, for an equilibrium temperature of 290.5 $\pm$ 9.5 K. We update the mass of the planet GJ 536 b to $m_{p} \sin i$ = 6.37 $\pm$ 0.38 M$_{\oplus}$. The orbits of both planets are consistent with circular. We explored the use of statistical Doppler imaging on the photometric and RV data, and find a tentative projected obliquity of the stellar rotation axis of 58$^{+16}_{-19}$ deg. Current evidence does not support the presence of additional planets with masses &gt; 5 M$_{\oplus}$for orbital periods up to 100 days, or &gt; 10 M$_{\oplus}$ for periods up to 1000 days.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent generation of the ambipolar electric field in collisionless plasmas via multi-mode electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation of the ambipolar electric field in a gravitationally stratified, collisionless plasma atmosphere. In such environments, gravity tends to separate charged species. To prevent separation an electric field, classically described by the Pannekoek-Rosseland expression, is usually imposed externally. Here, we propose a self-consistent method to recover this field based on a multi-mode Fourier expansion of the electrostatic interaction. We show that, under suitable conditions, this approach naturally leads to the ambipolar electric field and restores charge neutrality. The method is tested in both isothermal and multi-temperature plasma configurations. This framework provides a foundation for future developments that may include collisions, ionization, and asymmetric boundary conditions to model more realistic stellar atmospheres.</description>

Abstract: We present an extended investigation of a recently introduced model of gravitationally confined, collisionless plasma (Barbieri et al. 2024a), which showed that rapid temperature fluctuations at the base of the plasma, occurring on timescales much shorter than the electron crossing time, can drive the system into a non-thermal state characterized by anti-correlated temperature and density profiles, commonly referred to as temperature inversion. To describe this phenomenon, a temporal coarse-graining formalism was developed (Barbieri et al. 2024b). In this work, we generalize that approach to cover regimes where the timescales of temperature fluctuations are comparable to or exceed the electron crossing time. We derive a set of kinetic equations that incorporate an additional term arising from the coarse-graining procedure, which was not present in the earlier formulation. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the plasma dynamics under these broader conditions, showing that the electric field influences the system when fluctuation timescales approach the electron crossing time. However, for timescales much larger than the proton crossing time, the electric field becomes negligible. The observed behaviours are interpreted within the framework of the extended temporal coarse-graining theory, and we identify the regimes and conditions in which temperature inversion persists.</description>

      <title>Alpha effect in density-stratified turbulence with large-scale shear in astrophysical clouds and discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combined effect of the density-stratified turbulence and a large-scale shear for arbitrary Mach numbers causes the alpha effect and the effective pumping velocity of a large-scale magnetic field. This results in generation of the large-scale magnetic field in colliding protogalactic clouds, merging protostellar clouds and protoplanetary discs. Compressibility of the turbulent velocity field (i.e., finite Mach number effects) does not affect the contributions caused by the inhomogeneity of turbulence to the $\alpha$ tensor and effective pumping velocity. The isotropic part of the alpha tensor is independent of the exponent of the turbulent kinetic energy spectrum. There is also an additional contribution to the effective pumping velocity of the mean magnetic field caused by product of the fluid density stratification and the divergence of the mean fluid velocity due to collapsing (or expanding) astrophysical clouds. However, the alpha tensor is independent of the effects of collapsing or expanding of clouds.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: IV. Seeding and growing supermassive black holes in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for seeding and growing supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in dark-matter halos along their assembly histories. Seeds are bred out of Pop-III stars formed during the first collapse of pristine gas in mini-halos that have reached the ${\rm H}_2$-cooling limit, modulated by UV radiation from star formation and dynamical heating from fast halo assembly. Such breeding persists until the enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM) enables Pop-II stars to form. Post-seeding growth of black holes (BHs) is driven by distinct channels, starting with episodic super-Eddington accretion associated with nuclear bursts induced by global disturbances of galaxies, followed by sustained sub-Eddington accretion via capturing sub-clouds formed in self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) in halos of fast assembly, and ending with merger-dominated, quiescent growth. We implement the model in subhalo merger trees to build a coherent framework to follow the SMBH-galaxy-halo co-evolution over their full lives in the full structure hierarchy. BH seeds are bred with a broad mass spectrum of $M_{\rm BH} = 10$--$10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$ at $z \approx 20$--$30$ in mini-halos with masses of $10^5$--$10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$. Nuclear bursts provide the key condition for seeds to grow into SMBHs. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$M_*$ relation is a multi-piece, redshift-dependent function shaped by the interplay among different growth channels. Our model predictions are broadly consistent with existing observations; especially, a population of BHs reminiscent of `little red dots' (LRDs) discovered by JWST naturally results from the seeding and growing processes. Potential future tests of the model are discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimising reference library selection for reference-star differential imaging of discs with SPHERE/IRDIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The direct detection of circumstellar discs through high-contrast imaging provides key insights into the history and dynamics of planetary systems. Pole-on discs, especially faint debris discs, are difficult to detect and require careful consideration during post-processing to remove stellar residuals from the data while preserving the disc signal. Reference-star differential imaging (RDI) serves as one of the primary post-processing methods for disc observations. We aim to develop a method of reference frame selection that is optimised for the reduction of pole-on discs. Method: We performed principal component analysis based RDI on seven known disc targets and 20 disc-free targets with varying observational conditions, using reference libraries built from frames preselected to best match different observational, atmospheric, and stellar parameters of the science frames. The contrast of the disc-free reductions was measured, and forward modelling was used to estimate the signal loss from over-subtraction using synthetic pole-on discs with two different widths and four different radii. The signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the real disc targets was measured. Results: Diverse reference libraries built using subsets of frames that closely matched different parameters achieved the best disc S/N and smallest deviation from the best contrast of each target, outperforming libraries built using a single criterion as a selection metric. Libraries built using frame-to-frame Pearson correlation coefficient alone as a selection criterion achieved the best mean contrast overall. Both selection metrics performed consistently well for all disc radii and observational conditions. We also found that reference libraries built using frames observed close in time to the science frame performed well for discs at small separations, giving the best contrast for ~30% of the targets at a radius of 20px.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Galactic Cosmic Ray Modulation in the Heliosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) penetration through the heliosphere to the vicinity of the Sun is considered. Galactic cosmic rays are charged particles with energies exceeding 10 MeV/nucl., originating from far beyond the boundaries of our Solar System. As they penetrate through the heliosphere - the region of space filled by the solar wind - they interact strongly with the interplanetary magnetic field. In this paper, we present numerical approaches to solving the so-called Parker transport equation for the isotropic velocity distribution function of GCRs. This equation includes a convective term, anisotropic diffusion, adiabatic cooling, and drifts. Additionally, the diffusion coefficient is spatially and energy-dependent, varying by several orders of magnitude. Our numerical approaches are based on the finite-difference method (Crank-Nicolson scheme) and the stochastic differential equations (SDE) method. The numerical methods were validated against a known analytical solution under simplified conditions. For the general problem formulation, which involves anisotropic diffusion and the Parker spiral interplanetary magnetic field configuration, we used the most efficient and flexible SDE method and compared the numerical results with the data from the works of Kota &amp; Jokipii (1983) and Burger (2012). Special attention was devoted to incorporating drift along the heliospheric current sheet in the model.</description>

      <title>Probing Heavy Dark Matter in Red Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red giants (RGs) provide a promising astrophysical environment for capturing dark matter (DM) via elastic scattering with stellar nuclei. Captured DM particles migrate toward the helium-rich core and accumulate into a compact configuration. As the DM population grows, it can become self-gravitating and undergo gravitational collapse, leading to adiabatic contraction through interactions with the ambient medium. The resulting energy release, through elastic scattering and, where relevant, DM annihilation during collapse, locally heats the stellar core and can trigger helium ignition earlier than that predicted by standard stellar evolution. We analyze the conditions under which DM-induced heating leads to runaway helium burning and identify the critical DM mass required for ignition. Imposing the observational constraint that helium ignition must not occur before the observed luminosity at the tip of the RG branch, we translate these conditions into bounds on DM properties. Remarkably, we find that RGs are sensitive to DM, particularly with masses around $10^{11} \,{\rm GeV}$ and spin-independent scattering cross sections near $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^2$, which is comparable to the reach of current terrestrial direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Parallel Collisionless Shocks in strongly Magnetized Electron-Ion Plasma. I. Temperature anisotropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisionless electron-ion shocks are fundamental to astrophysical plasmas, yet their behavior in strong magnetic fields remains poorly understood. Using Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations with the SHARP-1D3V code, we investigate the role of the ion magnetization parameter $\sigma_i$ in parallel shock transitions. Strongly magnetized converging flows ($\sigma_i &gt; 1$) exhibit lower density compression ratios ($R \sim 2$), smaller entropy jumps, and suppressed particle acceleration, while maintaining pressure anisotropy stability due to conserved perpendicular temperatures across the transition region, alongside increased parallel temperatures. In contrast, weakly magnetized shocks drive downstream mirror and firehose instabilities due to ion temperature anisotropy, which are suppressed in strongly magnetized cases. Additionally, weakly magnetized shocks exhibit the onset of a supra-thermal population induced by shock-drift acceleration, with most of the upstream kinetic energy thermalized for both electrons and ions in the downstream region. Our results demonstrate that perpendicular temperatures for both species are conserved in weakly and strongly magnetized cases and highlight deviations from standard ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) behavior in strongly magnetized cases. These findings provide critical insights into the role of magnetic fields in parallel collisionless astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>10,000 Resolved Triples from Gaia: Empirical Constraints on Triple Star Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500 pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence, red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au. A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of 1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios follow a power-law distribution with slope $-1.4$; (f) tertiary orbits are consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities, subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations. Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim 0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.</description>

Abstract: Context. Magneto-asteroseismology is a novel technique allowing for more precise determinations of internal properties of magnetic pulsating stars, but requires an accurate characterisation of the surface magnetic field, not previously possible with Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) due to the time-dependent surface velocity of pulsating stars. Aims. We aim to develop a new version of ZDI, which creates an additional surface velocity map, that includes the time-dependent velocities of surface elements due to pulsations. Methods. We present a new code, PIMMS: Pulsation-Informed Magnetic Mapping of Stars, which uses a surface-integrated line profile model that accounts for the additional Doppler shifts of local lines caused by pulsations. It is then possible to fit this model to spectropolarimetric observations, reconstructing maps of the surface brightness, magnetic field, and the velocity field due to the combination of pulsation and rotation. In this paper, we present and test PIMMS extensively, to understand its limitations and data requirements. Results. We find that PIMMS can accurately reproduce the magnetic fields and brightness distributions of realistic models of pulsating hot stars. The required number of observations is higher than that required for ZDI of a non-pulsating star due to the additional velocity map that must be disentangled from surface brightness variations. PIMMS is now ready to be applied to real stars.</description>

      <title>Turbulent heating in collisionless low-beta plasmas: imbalance, Landau damping, and electron-ion energy partition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An understanding of how turbulent energy is partitioned between ions and electrons in weakly collisional plasmas is crucial for modelling many astrophysical systems. Using theory and simulations of a four-dimensional reduced model of low-beta gyrokinetics (the `Kinetic Reduced Electron Heating Model'), we investigate the dependence of collisionless heating processes on plasma beta and imbalance (normalised cross-helicity). These parameters are important because they control the helicity barrier, the formation of which divides the parameter space into two distinct regimes with remarkably different properties. In the first, at lower beta and/or imbalance, the absence of a helicity barrier allows the cascade of injected power to proceed to small (perpendicular) scales, but its slow cascade rate makes it susceptible to significant electron Landau damping, in some cases leading to a marked steepening of the magnetic spectra on scales above the ion Larmor radius. In the second, at higher beta and/or imbalance, the helicity barrier halts the cascade, confining electron Landau damping to scales above the steep `transition-range' spectral break, resulting in dominant ion heating. We formulate quantitative models of these processes that compare well to simulations in each regime, and combine them with results of previous studies to construct a simple formula for the electron-ion heating ratio as a function of beta and imbalance. This model predicts a `winner takes all' picture of low-beta plasma heating, where a small change in the fluctuations' properties at large scales (the imbalance) can cause a sudden switch between electron and ion heating.</description>

      <title>Inferring the pair-instability mass gap from gravitational wave data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use hierarchical Bayesian inference with non-parametric Gaussian process models to investigate the effective inspiral spin parameter, $\chi_{\rm eff}$, as a function of primary black hole mass in the third gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-3). Our analysis reveals a transition in the population at a primary mass of $46^{+7}_{-5}\,M_\odot$. Beyond this mass, the $\chi_{\rm eff}$ distribution broadens, becomes consistent with being symmetric around zero, and has a median of $-0.03^{+0.36}_{-0.59}$ (90\% credibility). These results are consistent with the presence of a pair-instability mass gap that is repopulated by black holes that are the remnant of a previous merger, formed in dense star clusters. However, asymmetric distributions skewed toward positive $\chi_{\rm eff}$ are not excluded by current data. Below the inferred transition mass, we constrain the fraction of second-generation black holes to be $\lesssim 10\%$. These results provide model-independent support for a high-mass and high-spin population of black holes in the data, consistent with earlier work using parametric models. Imminent gravitational-wave data releases will be essential to sharpen constraints on spin symmetry and clarify the origin of the black holes.</description>

Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the origin of the heaviest elements on the periodic table, with a focus on those produced by the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process), using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy can increase the number of r-process elements detectable in cool stars by more than 50% relative to optical and infrared spectra. These elements are key to characterizing the physical conditions that govern the r-process and identify the nature, sites, and environments where r-process events occurred. HWO has the potential to greatly expand the sample of stars where rarely studied heavy elements can be detected beyond the Solar neighborhood to the Galactic halo, globular clusters, and dwarf galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We present the science case for characterizing the nature of the first stars using the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). High-resolution ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy with the HWO has the potential to confirm any surviving low-mass zero-metallicity first stars by placing unprecedented low limits on their metal abundances. It also has the potential to substantially increase the number of elements detectable in the spectra of known long-lived low-mass stars, which exhibit extremely low metal abundances that reveal the metals produced by the first stars. Elements important for this science case with UV transitions include C, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Sc, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn. HWO would expand the discovery space when compared with the Hubble Space Telescope by enabling high-resolution UV spectroscopy for much fainter stars throughout the Milky Way and neighboring stellar systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive red supergiants (RSGs) are known to become hydrodynamically unstable before they explode. Still, the vast majority of supernova (SN) models assume RSG progenitors in hydrostatic equilibrium. Here, we self-consistently follow the hydrodynamic evolution of RSGs with different masses and the development of radial envelope pulsations. Pulsations significantly alter the observable pre- and post-SN properties, and their importance increases substantially as a function of initial mass. We demonstrate that inferring core masses, let alone initial masses, from a single pre-SN luminosity and effective temperature of high-mass RSGs is inadvisable, as these can vary by an order of magnitude during the pulsation. We find that pulsations can naturally lead to ``early-excess" emission in SN light curves and to variations in early photospheric velocities, which can help break degeneracies in type-II SNe. We compare to SN~2023ixf, for which a pulsating RSG progenitor was discovered. We demonstrate that its pre- and post-SN characteristics agree very well with our exploding pulsating RSG model, whereas hydrostatic stellar models are not well-suited. The data coverage at early times is insufficient to break all degeneracies, but we find constraints on the explosion phase. We find no evidence for the claimed pulsation period of the SN~2024ggi progenitor, as it matches Spitzer's orbital period. This study underscores the importance of hydrodynamical pre-SN stellar models. It implies an important shift in our understanding of the last stages of massive star evolution, the interpretation of pre-SN properties, the connection between SNe and their progenitors, and the missing RSG problem.</description>

Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hill's mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a model to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then use this model to estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 30 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of recent growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>
