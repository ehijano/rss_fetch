      <title>Berglund-H\"ubsch mirrors of invertible curve singularities via Floer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a Floer theoretic approach to obtain the transpose polynomial $W^T$ of an invertible curve singularity $W$. This gives an intrinsic construction of the mirror transpose polynomial and enables us to define a canonical $A_\infty$-functor that takes Lagrangians in the Milnor fiber of W and converts them into matrix factorizations of $W^T$. We find Lagrangians in the Milnor fiber of $W$ that are mirror to the indecomposable matrix factorizations of $W^T$ when $W^T$ is ADE singularity and discover that Auslander-Reiten exact sequences can be realized as surgery exact triangles of Lagrangians in the mirror.
  There are two primary steps in the Floer theoretic method for obtaining a transposition polynomial: To get a Lagrangian $L$ and corresponding disc potential function $W_L$, we first determine the quotient $X$ by the maximal symmetry group for the Milnor fiber. Second, we define a class $\Gamma$ of symplectic cohomology of $X$ based on the monodromy of the singularity $W$. Another disc counting function, $g$, is defined by the closed-open image of $\Gamma$ on $L$. We demonstrate that restricting to the hypersurface $g = 0$ transforms the disc potential function $W_L$ into the transpose polynomial W T. This second step is the mirror of taking the cone of quantum cap action by the monodromy class $\Gamma$.</description>

      <title>Legendrian non-isotopic unit conormal bundles in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any compact connected submanifold $K$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, let $\Lambda_K$ denote its unit conormal bundle, which is a Legendrian submanifold of the unit cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$. In this paper, we give examples of pairs $(K_0,K_1)$ of compact connected submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^n$ such that $\Lambda_{K_0}$ is not Legendrian isotopic to $\Lambda_{K_1}$, although they cannot be distinguished by classical invariants. Here, $K_1$ is the image of an embedding $\iota_f \colon K_0 \to \mathbb{R}^n$ which is regular homotopic to the inclusion map of $K_0$ and the codimension in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is greater than or equal to $4$. As non-classical invariants, we define the strip Legendrian contact homology and a coproduct on it under certain conditions on Legendrian submanifolds. Then, we give a purely topological description of these invariants for $\Lambda_K$ when the codimension of $K$ is greater than or equal to $4$. The main examples $\Lambda_{K_0}$ and $\Lambda_{K_1}$ are distinguished by the coproduct, which is computed by using an idea of string topology.</description>

      <title>Bialgebras, and Lie monoid actions in Morse and Floer theory, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new family of oriented manifolds with boundaries called the forest biassociahedra and forest bimultiplihedra, generalizing the standard biassociahedra. They are defined as moduli spaces of ascending-descending biforests and are expected to act as parameter spaces for operations defined on Morse and Floer chains in the context of compact Lie group actions.
  We study the structure of their boundary, and derive some algebraic notions of ``$f$-bialgebras'', as well as related notions of bimodules, morphisms and categories. This allows us to state some conjectures describing compact Lie group actions on Morse and Floer chains, and on Fukaya categories.</description>

      <title>Born geometry via K\"unneth structures and recursion operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a simple definition of a Born geometry in the framework of K\"unneth geometry. While superficially different, this new definition is equivalent to the known definitions in terms of para-quaternionic or generalized geometries. We discuss integrability of Born structures and their associated connections. In particular we find that for integrable Born geometries the Born connection is obtained by a simple averaging under a conjugation from the K\"unneth connection. We also give examples of integrable Born geometries on nilmanifolds.</description>

      <title>Family Floer superpotential's critical values are eigenvalues of quantum product by $c_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the setting of the non-archimedean SYZ mirror construction (arXiv:2003.06106), we prove the folklore conjecture that the critical values of the mirror superpotential are the eigenvalues of the quantum multiplication by the first Chern class. Our result relies on a weak unobstructed assumption, but it is usually ensured in practice by Solomon's results on anti-symmetric Lagrangians. Lastly, we note that some explicit examples are presented in the recent work (arXiv:2206.04652).</description>

      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in (0,\frac{\pi}{2}), based on the existence of rectangular pegs in any smooth Jordan curve, which is first proved by Greene and Lobb [GL21] and we give an alternative Floer theoretical proof in this paper. The key insight is that the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. We present two distinct proofs for the multiplicity result: one involves Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. Both rely crucially on certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. Moreover, such a generic doubling result can be further extended to cyclic quadrilateral pegs based on the existence result [GL23]. In Appendix \ref{Appendix_B}, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>

      <title>On A Potential Contact Analogue Of Kirby Move Of Type 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository note, we explore the possibility of the existence of Kirby move of type 1 for contact surgery diagrams. In particular, we give the necessary conditions on a contact surgery diagram to become a potential candidate for contact Kirby move of type 1. We observe that there is a collection of contact positive integral surgery diagrams on Legendrian unknots satisfying those conditions.</description>

      <title>Classification of Horikawa surfaces with T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify all projective surfaces with only T-singularities, $K^2=2p_g-4$, and ample canonical class. In this way, we identify all surfaces, smoothable or not, with only T-singularities in the Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of Horikawa surfaces. We also prove that they are not smoothable when $p_g \geq 10$, except for the Lee-Park (Fintushel-Stern) examples, which we show to have only one deformation type unless $p_g=6$ (in which case they have two). This demonstrates that the challenging Horikawa problem cannot be addressed through complex T-degenerations, and we propose new questions regarding diffeomorphism types based on our classification. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper enable us to classify all KSBA surfaces with only T-singularities and $K^2=2p_g-3$, e.g. quintic surfaces and I-surfaces.</description>
