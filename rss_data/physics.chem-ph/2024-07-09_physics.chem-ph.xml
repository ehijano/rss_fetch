      <title>Uni-ELF: A Multi-Level Representation Learning Framework for Electrolyte Formulation Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in lithium battery technology heavily rely on the design and engineering of electrolytes. However, current schemes for molecular design and recipe optimization of electrolytes lack an effective computational-experimental closed loop and often fall short in accurately predicting diverse electrolyte formulation properties. In this work, we introduce Uni-ELF, a novel multi-level representation learning framework to advance electrolyte design. Our approach involves two-stage pretraining: reconstructing three-dimensional molecular structures at the molecular level using the Uni-Mol model, and predicting statistical structural properties (e.g., radial distribution functions) from molecular dynamics simulations at the mixture level. Through this comprehensive pretraining, Uni-ELF is able to capture intricate molecular and mixture-level information, which significantly enhances its predictive capability. As a result, Uni-ELF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predicting both molecular properties (e.g., melting point, boiling point, synthesizability) and formulation properties (e.g., conductivity, Coulombic efficiency). Moreover, Uni-ELF can be seamlessly integrated into an automatic experimental design workflow. We believe this innovative framework will pave the way for automated AI-based electrolyte design and engineering.</description>

      <title>TPDH-Graphene as a New Anodic Material for Lithium Ion Battery: DFT-Based Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of tetra-penta-deca-hexagonal graphene (TPDH-gr), a recently proposed 2D carbon allotrope as an anodic material in lithium ion batteries (LIB), was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that Li-atom adsorption is moderate (around 0.70 eV), allowing for easy desorption. Moreover, energy barrier, diffusion coefficient, and open circuit voltage (OCV) calculations show rapid Li atom diffusion on the TPDH-gr surface, stable intercalation of lithium atoms, and good performance during the charge and discharge cycles of the LIB. These findings, combined with the intrinsic metallic nature of TPDH-gr, indicate that this new 2D carbon allotrope is a promising candidate for use as an anodic LIB material.</description>

      <title>Signatures of supermassive charged gravitinos in liquid scintillator detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work two of the present authors have suggested possible experimental ways to search for stable supermassive particles with electric charges of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ in upcoming underground experiments and the new JUNO observatory in particular [K.A. Meissner and H. Nicolai, Eur. Phys. J. C {\bf 84}, 269 (2024)]. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the specific signature of such gravitino-induced events for the JUNO detector. The proposed method of detection relies on the `glow' produced by photons during the passage of such particles through the detector liquid, which would last for about a few to a few hundred microseconds depending on its velocity and the track. The cross sections for electronic excitation of the main component of the scintillator liquid, namely linear alkylbenzene (LAB), by the passing gravitino, are evaluated using quantum-chemical methods. The results show that, if such particles exist, the resulting signals would lead to a unique and unmistakable signature, for which we present event simulations as they would be seen by the JUNO photomultipliers. Our analysis brings together two very different research areas, namely fundamental particles physics and the search for a fundamental theory on the one hand, and methods of advanced quantum chemistry on the other.</description>

      <title>Entanglement kinetics in polymer melts are chemically specific</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the universality of entanglement kinetics in polymer melts. We compare predictions of a recently developed constitutive equation for disentanglement to molecular dynamics simulations of both united-atom polyethylene and Kremer-Grest models for polymers in shear and extensional flow. We confirm that entanglements recover on the retraction timescale, rather than the reptation timescale. We find that the convective constraint release parameter $\beta$ is independent of molecular weight, but that it increases with the ratio of Kuhn length $b_K$ to packing length $p$ as $\beta\sim (b_K/p)^\alpha$, with an exponent $\alpha=1.9$, which may suggest that disentanglement rate correlates with an increase in the tube diameter. These results may help shed light on which polymers are more likely to undergo shear banding.</description>

      <title>Multiple Interacting Photonic Modes in Strongly Coupled Organic Microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room temperature cavity quantum electrodynamics with molecular materials in optical cavities offers exciting prospects for controlling electronic, nuclear and photonic degrees of freedom for applications in physics, chemistry and materials science. However, achieving strong coupling with molecular ensembles typically requires high molecular densities and substantial electromagnetic field confinement. These conditions usually involve a significant degree of molecular disorder and a highly structured photonic density of states. It remains unclear to what extent these additional complexities modify the usual physical picture of strong coupling developed for atoms and inorganic semiconductors. Using a microscopic quantum description of molecular ensembles in realistic multimode optical resonators, we show that the emergence of a vacuum Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy is a necessary but not sufficient metric of coherent admixing between light and matter. In low finesse multi-mode situations we find that molecular dipoles can be partially hybridised with photonic dissipation channels associated with off-resonant cavity modes. These vacuum-induced dissipative processes ultimately limit the extent of light-matter coherence that the system can sustain.</description>

      <title>Quantized Acoustic Phonons Map the Dynamics of a Single Virus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural vibrational frequencies of biological particles such as viruses and bacteria encode critical information about their mechanical and biological states as they interact with their local environment and undergo structural evolution. However, detecting and tracking these vibrations within a biological context at the single particle level has remained elusive. In this study, we track the vibrational motions of single, unlabeled virus particles under ambient conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy. The ultrasonic spectrum of an 80-100 nm lentiviral pseudovirus reveals vibrational modes in the 19-22 GHz range sensitive to virus morphology and 2-10 GHz modes with nanosecond dephasing times reflecting viral envelope protein interactions. By tracking virus trajectories over minutes, we observe acoustic mode coupling mediated by the local environment. Single particle tracking allows capture of viral disassembly through correlated mode softening and dephasing. The sensitivity, high resolution, and speed of this approach promise deeper insights into biological dynamics and early-stage diagnostics at the single microorganism level.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Exact Two-Component Coupled-Cluster Study of Molecular Sensitivity Factors for Nuclear Schiff Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic exact two-component coupled-cluster calculations of molecular sensitivity factors for nuclear Schiff moments (NSMs) are reported. We focus on molecules containing heavy nuclei, especially octupole-deformed nuclei. Analytic relativistic coupled-cluster gradient techniques are used and serve as useful tools for identifying candidate molecules that sensitively probe for physics beyond the Standard Model in the hadronic sector. Notably, these tools enable straightforward ``black-box'' calculations. Two competing chemical mechanisms that contribute to the NSM are analyzed, illuminating the physics of ligand effects on NSM sensitivity factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite numerous efforts from numerical approaches to complement experimental measurements, several fundamental challenges have still hindered one's ability to truly provide an atomistic picture of the nucleation process in nanocrystals. Among them, our study resolves three obstacles: (1) Machine-learning force fields including long-range interactions able to capture the finesse of the underlying atomic interactions, (2) Data-driven characterization of the local ordering in a complex structural landscape associated with several crystal polymorphs and (3) Comparing results from a large range of temperatures using both brute-force and rare-event sampling. Altogether, our simulation strategy has allowed us to study zinc oxide crystallization from nano-droplet melt. Remarkably, our results show that different nucleation pathways compete depending on the investigated degree of supercooling.</description>

      <title>Reactive Molecular Dynamics Simulation on DNA Double Strand Breaks Induced by Hydrogen Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a scar model to reproduce how double-strand breaks occur in the telomeric DNA damaged by the effect of the $\beta$-decay of tritium to helium. In this scar model, the two hydrogens bonded to the 5$^\prime$ carbon connecting the pent saccharides and phosphate are removed. Molecular dynamics simulations using the reactive force field are carried out for 10 cases for the telomeric DNA consisting of 16 base pairs (32 nucleotides). It results in double-strand breaks (DSBs) being observed for structures with more than 24 scars. For 16 scar cases, only single-strand breaks (SSB) are observed. Moreover, in the case of $\left\{16, 0 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 0, 16 \right\},$ where only one of the strands had scars, SSB occurs only in the scarred strand. Secondly, in the $\left\{16, 8 \right\}$ and $\left\{ 8, 16 \right\}$ cases, DSBs occurs. Therefore, we conclude that the following conditions are necessary for DSBs:(i) Scars must occur on both the L and R strands. (ii) A large number of scars (24 or more) must occur in close proximity to each other.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>Fast and spectrally accurate construction of adaptive diagonal basis sets for electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we combine the periodic sinc basis set with a curvilinear coordinate system for electronic structure calculations. This extension allows for variable resolution across the computational domain, with higher resolution close to the nuclei and lower resolution in the inter-atomic regions. We address two key challenges that arise while using basis sets obtained by such a coordinate transformation. First, we use pseudospectral methods to evaluate the integrals needed to construct the Hamiltonian in this basis. Second, we demonstrate how to construct an appropriate coordinate transformation by solving the Monge-Amp\`ere equation using a new approach that we call the cyclic Knothe-Rosenblatt flow. The solution of both of these challenges enables mean-field calculations at a cost that is log-linear in the number of basis functions. We demonstrate that our method approaches the complete basis set limit faster than basis sets with uniform resolution. We also emphasize how these basis sets satisfy the diagonal approximation, which is shown to be a consequence of the pseudospectral method. The diagonal approximation is highly desirable for the solution of the electronic structure problem in many frameworks, including mean field theories, tensor network methods, quantum computing, and quantum Monte Carlo.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The preference of water self-ions (hydronium and hydroxide) near air/oil-water interfaces is one of the hottest topics in water research due to its importance for understanding properties, phenomena, and reactions of interfaces. In this work, we performed enhanced-sampling molecular dynamics based on state-of-the-art neural network potentials with M06-2X accuracy to investigate the propensity of hydronium and hydroxide ions at air/oil-water interfaces, which can simultaneously describe well the water autoionization process forming these ions, recombination of ions, and ionic distribution along the normal distance to the interface by employing a set of appropriate Voronoi collective variables. The results support a stable ionic double-layer distribution near the interface for both air-water and oil-water interface systems. Hydronium tends to reside in the topmost layer of the interface, while hydroxide with a slightly stronger interfacial stabilization free energy is enriched in the deeper interfacial layer. This double-layer distribution may help to understand the longstanding controversy about the interfacial acid-base nature.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Linear Response in Quantum-Electrodynamical Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the theoretical derivation and numerical implementation of the linear response equations for relativistic quantum electrodynamical density functional theory (QEDFT). In contrast to previous works based on the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, our approach describes electrons interacting with photonic cavity modes at the four-component Dirac-Kohn-Sham level, derived from fully relativistic QED through a series of established approximations. Moreover, we show that a new type of spin-orbit-like (SO) cavity-mediated interaction appears under the relativistic description of the coupling of matter with quantized cavity modes. Benchmark calculations performed for atoms of group 12 elements (Zn, Cd, Hg) demonstrate how a relativistic treatment enables the description of exciton polaritons which arise from the hybridization of formally forbidden singlet-triplet transitions with cavity modes. For atoms in cavities tuned on resonance with a singlet-triplet transition we discover a significant interplay between SO effects and coupling to an off-resonant intense singlet-singlet transition. This dynamic relationship highlights the crucial role of ab initio approaches in understanding cavity quantum electrodynamics. Finally, using the mercury porphyrin complex as an example, we show that relativistic linear response QEDFT provides computationally feasible first-principles calculations of polaritonic states in large heavy element-containing molecules of chemical interest.</description>

      <title>Continuous Gated First-Passage Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.09164v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gated first-passage processes, where completion depends on both hitting a target and satisfying additional constraints, are prevalent across various fields. Despite their significance, analytical solutions to basic problems remain unknown, e.g. the detection time of a diffusing particle by a gated interval, disk, or sphere. In this paper, we elucidate the challenges posed by continuous gated first-passage processes and present a renewal framework to overcome them. This framework offers a unified approach for a wide range of problems, including those with single-point, half-line, and interval targets. The latter have so far evaded exact solutions. Our analysis reveals that solutions to gated problems can be obtained directly from the ungated dynamics. This, in turn, reveals universal properties and asymptotic behaviors, shedding light on cryptic intermediate-time regimes and refining the notion of high-crypticity for continuous-space gated processes. Moreover, we extend our formalism to higher dimensions, showcasing its versatility and applicability. Overall, this work provides valuable insights into the dynamics of continuous gated first-passage processes and offers analytical tools for studying them across diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method: extended resolution of unity method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Projected Augmented Wave (PAW) Method is based on generating a transform between the pseudo wavefunction and all electron wavefunction. For the accuracy of the method, it is important that the local part of the transform (in each atomic sphere $\mathbf{R}$) be over a complete basis set (with deviations from completeness leading to corrections to the total energy not computed within current implementations of PAW). Here we show how to make this basis much closer to complete without significant additional computational work without modifying the transformation in any way by extending the resolution of unity used for the transform to include more wavefunctions and having them transform via the identity.</description>

Abstract: We develop a semi-analytical model for transport in structured catalytic microreactors, where both reactant and product are compressible fluids. Making use of the lubrication and Fick-Jacobs approximations, we reduce the three-dimensional governing equations to an effective one-dimensional set of equations. Our model captures the effect of compressibility, of corrugations in the shape of the reactor, as well as of an inhomogeneous catalytic coating of the reactor walls. We show that in the weakly compressible limit (e.g., liquid-phase reactors), the distribution of catalyst does not influence the reactor yield, which we verify experimentally. Beyond this limit, we show that introducing inhomogeneities in the catalytic coating and corrugations to the reactor walls can improve the yield.</description>
