      <title>Noise-induced resonant acceleration of a charge in an intermittent magnetic field: an exact solution for ergodic and non-ergodic fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the diffusion of a charged particle in a magnetic field subject to stochastic dichotomous fluctuations.The associated induced electric field gives rise to nontrivial dynamical regimes.In particular, when the mean magnetic field vanishes, the particle remains confined within a finite radius, regardless of the fluctuation statistics. For a non-zero mean field, we show, using a density approach for Poissonian fluctuations, that the particle undergoes an exponential regime of accelerated diffusion. Crucially and more generally, adopting a trajectory-based formalism, we derive an exact analytical solution valid for arbitrary waiting-time distributions, including non-Poissonian and non-ergodic cases.Even rare, abrupt field reversals are shown to trigger exponential acceleration of the particle's diffusion.We demonstrate that this behaviour stems from noise exciting resonance bands present for periodic fluctuations, and we propose noise-induced resonant acceleration as a robust and efficient charge acceleration mechanism, potentially more effective than Fermi's classic model for cosmic-ray acceleration.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wilson-Cowan model with short term synaptic plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized version of the Wilson-Cowan (WC) model is proposed which accounts for the evolution of the synaptic resources. Adiabatic elimination of the fast variables is performed to yield a simplified framework for the coupled interaction between active excitatory and inhibitory neurons. The latter model is shown to smoothly converge to the benchmark WC model, when the appropriate limit is performed. Different dynamical regimes are identified for the reduced model and commented upon with reference to the original formulation of the generalized dynamics. This includes identifying limit cycle oscillations for population of available resources.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary Control of Non-Hermitian Skin Modes via Disorder and Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the accumulation of a macroscopic number of bulk states at system boundaries, is a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics. However, effective control of skin-mode localization in higher-dimensional systems remains challenging. Here, we propose a versatile approach to manipulate the localization of skin modes in a two-dimensional nonreciprocal lattice by combining disorder and a static electric field. While the electric field alone suppresses the NHSE in a clean system, the introduction of disorder induces transverse wave-packet transport perpendicular to the field. When the nonreciprocal hopping direction is misaligned with the electric field, the hopping component perpendicular to the field guides the wave-packet propagation and leads to boundary localization. By tuning the relative orientations of the electric field and the nonreciprocal hopping, arbitrary control over the boundary localization position can be achieved. Our results demonstrate a robust and tunable mechanism for engineering boundary accumulation and directed transport in non-Hermitian systems, offering new opportunities for applications in classical platforms and quantum materials.</description>

      <title>From percolation transition to Anderson localization in one-dimensional speckle potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical particles in random potentials typically experience a percolation phase transition, being trapped in clusters of mean size $\chi$ that diverges algebraically at a percolation threshold. In contrast, quantum transport in random potentials is controlled by the Anderson localization length, which shows no distinct feature at this classical critical point. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the semi-classical crossover between these two regimes by studying particle propagation in a one-dimensional, red speckle potential, which hosts a percolation transition at its upper bound. As the system deviates from the classical limit, we find that the algebraic divergence of $\chi$ continuously connects to a smooth yet non-analytic increase of the localization length. We characterize this behavior both numerically and theoretically using a semi-classical approach. In this crossover regime, the correlated and non-Gaussian nature of the speckle potential becomes essential, causing the standard DMPK description for uncorrelated disorder to break down. Instead, we predict the emergence of a bimodal transmission distribution, a behavior normally absent in one dimension, which we capture within our semi-classical analysis. Deep in the quantum regime, the DMPK framework is recovered and the universal features of Anderson localization reappear.</description>

      <title>Modeling adsorption processes on the core-shell-like polymer structures: star and comb topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coagulation-flocculation of pollutants and chelation of heavy metal ions are two widely used techniques in wastewater purification. Despite the differences between their respective mechanisms and inherent length scales, they bear much similarity on a larger scale, and can both be treated as adsorption of obstacles on a polymer structure. In this regime, their adsorbing efficiency is predominantly affected by conformation statistics of involved polymers, and this approach has been used in our previous studies based on lattice polymer model for a linear polymer adsorbent. There is a strong experimental evidence that branched adsorbents are more efficient than their linear counterparts. In this study we focus on two simplest representatives of the core-shell branched architectures: the star-like (with zero-dimensional point-like core) and comb-like polymers (with one-dimensional rigid core) with various number of branches, $f$, branch lengths, $N$, and branches separations, $S$ (for the case of comb-like structure). The polymers are grown on a lattice using the Monte Carlo simulations with the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth algorithm. The quantitative estimates for adsorption capacity in terms of adsorbed obstacles per monomer and the average number of bonds per adsorbed particle (average adsorption strength) have been evaluated in a wide range of parameters $f$, $N$, and $S$. Both the case of implicit diffusion of obstacles (with averaging over different arrangements of immobilized obstacles) and explicit diffusion of obstacles (allowing to study dynamics of adsorption process) have been analyzed. We found that comb-like polymers display the higher adsorption capacity but lower adsorption strength, comparing to the star-like polymers, and these effects are more pronounced with increasing branches separations $S$.</description>

      <title>Height distribution of elastic interfaces in quenched random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elastic interfaces in quenched random media driven by external forces exhibit a continuous depinning phase transition between pinned and moving phases at a critical external force. Recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 175701 (2022)] has shown that the distribution of local interface heights at depinning displays negative skewness. Here, by considering local, long-range and fully-coupled (mean-field) elasticity, we expand on this result by demonstrating the robustness of the negative skewness at depinning when approaching the thermodynamic limit and considering different values of the spring stiffness controlling the avalanche cutoff. Additionally, we investigate the evolution of the height distribution as the external force is ramped up from zero, approaching the critical force from below. Starting from a symmetric height distribution at zero force, the distribution initially develops positive skewness increasing with the external force, followed by a steep drop to the negative value characteristic of the critical point as the depinning transition is reached.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped to the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which may correspond to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it difficult to design problem instances that fairly compare the two methods. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous mean-field analysis of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model on a network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the generalized Lotka-Volterra model with a network structure. Performing a high connectivity expansion for graphs, we write down a mean-field dynamical theory that incorporates degree heterogeneity. This allows us to describe the fixed points of the model in terms of a few simple order parameters. We extend the analysis even for diverging abundances, using a mapping to the replicator model. With this we present a unified approach for both cooperative and competitive systems that display complementary behaviors. In particular we show the central role of an order parameter called the critical degree, $g_c$. In the competitive regime $g_c$ serves to distinguish high degree nodes that are more likely to go extinct, while in the cooperative regime it has the reverse role, it will determine the low degree nodes that tend to go relatively extinct.</description>

      <title>Emergent Dynamical Translational Symmetry Breaking as an Order Principle for Localization and Topological Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization transitions represent a fundamental class of continuous phase transitions, yet they occur without any accompanying symmetry breaking. We resolve this by introducing the concept of dynamical translational symmetry (DTS), which is defined not by the Hamiltonian but by the long-time dynamics of local observables. Its order parameter, the time-averaged local translational contrast (TLTC), quantitatively diagnoses whether evolution restores or breaks translational equivalence. We demonstrate that the TLTC universally captures the Anderson localization transition, the many-body localization transition, and topological phase transitions, revealing that these disparate phenomena are unified by the emergent breaking of DTS. This work establishes a unified dynamical-symmetry framework for phases transitions beyond the equilibrium paradigm.</description>

      <title>On the Potential of Microtubules for Scalable Quantum Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the quantum coherence properties of tubulin heterodimers arranged into the protofilaments of cytoskeletal microtubules. In the physical model proposed by the authors, the microtubule interiors are treated as high-Q quantum electrodynamics (QED) cavities that can support decoherence-resistant entangled states under physiological conditions, with decoherence times of the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ sec. We identify strong electric dipole interactions between tubulin dimers and ordered water dipole quanta within the microtuble interior as the mechanism responsible for the extended coherence times. Classical nonlinear (pseudospin) $\sigma$-models describing solitonic excitations are reinterpreted as emergent quantum-coherent-or possibly pointer-states, arising from incomplete collapse of dipole-aligned quantum states. These solitons mediate dissipation-free energy transfer along microtubule filaments. We discuss logic-gate-like behavior facilitated by microtubule-associated proteins, and outline how such structures may enable scalable, ambient-temperature quantum computation, with the fundamental unit of information storage realized as a quDit encoded in the tubulin dipole state. We further describe a process akin to decision making that emerges following an external stimulus, whereby optimal, energy-loss-free signal and information transport pathways are selected across the microtubular network. Finally, we propose experimental approaches-including Rabi-splitting spectroscopy and entangled surface plasmon probes-to validate the use of biomatter as a substrate for scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic structure of relaxor ferroelectrics from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We hybridize the swap Monte Carlo and geometric relaxation methods to determine the intrinsic compositional structure (CS) of the lead magnesium niobate (PMN) relaxor. We verify the stability of a Nb-rich sublattice in PMN, as prescribed by the prevailing random-site model. However, ions in the complementary sublattice are not randomly mixed. Most Nb ions collapse into a single percolating cluster with a mesh-like structure. This specific geometry serves to prevent large space charges, and this behavior differs from typical phase separation in metallic alloys. Subsequent molecular dynamics simulations predict a pair distribution function that is consistent with neutron scattering experiments. Analysis of dipolar structures in the Nb cluster sheds light on the unique dielectric properties of PMN.</description>
