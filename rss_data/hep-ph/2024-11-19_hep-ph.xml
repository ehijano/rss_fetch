      <title>The Ferroaxionic Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that piezoelectric materials can be used to source virtual QCD axions, generating a new axion-mediated force. Spontaneous parity violation within the piezoelectric crystal combined with time-reversal violation from aligned spins provide the necessary symmetry breaking to produce an effective in-medium scalar coupling of the axion to nucleons up to 7 orders of magnitude larger than that in vacuum. We propose a detection scheme based on nuclear spin precession caused by the axion's pseudoscalar coupling to nuclear spins. This signal is resonantly enhanced when the distance between the source crystal and the spin sample is modulated at the spin precession frequency. Using this effect, future experimental setups can be sensitive to the QCD axion in the unexplored mass range from $10^{-5}\,\mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{-2}\,\mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Radiation Exposure from the Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that exotic forms of dark matter could expose humans on Earth or on prolonged space travel to a significant radiation dose. The radiation exposure from dark matter interacting with nuclei in the human body is generally assumed to be negligible compared to other sources of background radiation. However, as we discuss here, current data allow for dark matter models where this is not necessarily true. In particular, if dark matter is heavier and more strongly interacting than weakly interacting massive particle dark matter, it could act as ionizing radiation and deposit a significant amount of radiation energy in all or part of the human population, similar to or even exceeding the known radiation exposure from other background sources. Conversely, the non-observation of such an exposure can be used to constrain this type of heavier and more strongly interacting dark matter. We first consider the case where dark matter scatters elastically and identify the relevant parameter space in a model-independent way. We also discuss how previous bounds from cosmological probes, as well as atmospheric and space-based detectors, might be avoided, and how a re-analysis of existing radiation data, along with a simple experiment monitoring ionizing radiation in space with a lower detection threshold, could help constrain part of this parameter space. We finally propose a hypothetical dark matter candidate that scatters inelastically and argue that, in principle, one per mille of the Earth's population could attain a significant radiation dose from such a dark matter exposure in their lifetime.</description>

      <title>Searching for GeV Gamma-Ray Polarization and Axion-Like Particles with AMS-02</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the detectability of GeV-band gamma-ray polarization with the AMS-02 experiment and a proposed successor, from Galactic and extragalactic sources. Characterizing gamma-ray polarization in this energy range could shed light on gamma-ray emission mechanisms in the sources; physics beyond the Standard Model, such as the presence of axion-like particles (ALPs), could also induce a distinctive energy-dependent polarization signal due to propagation effects in magnetic fields. We present estimates for the minimum detectable polarization from bright sources and the forecast reach for axion-like particles (ALPs). We show that for an example bright extragalactic source (NGC1275), AMS-02 will only have sensitivity to ALP-induced polarization from currently open parameter space if the B-field configuration is unusually favorable to a signal. However, a successor experiment such as AMS-100 would be expected to probe new parameter space even for pessimistic B-field models, with prospects to measure the energy-dependence of such a signal. For Galactic sources, polarization measurements could provide a unique test of scenarios where ALPs induce energy-dependent features in the photon intensity. However, in the absence of a bright transient source (such as a Galactic supernova), the parameter space that would be probed by this approach with ten years of AMS-100 data is already nominally excluded by other experiments, although this conflict may be avoided in specific ALP models.</description>

      <title>Systematically Constructing the Likelihood for Boosted $H\to gg$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the binary discrimination problem of identification of boosted $H\to gg$ decays from massive QCD jets in a systematic expansion in the strong coupling. Though this decay mode of the Higgs is unlikely to be discovered at the LHC, we analytically demonstrate several features of the likelihood ratio for this problem through explicit analysis of signal and background matrix elements. Through leading-order, we prove that by imposing a constraint on the jet mass and measuring the energy fraction of the softer subjet an improvement of signal to background ratio that is independent of the kinematics of the jets at high boosts can be obtained, and is approximately equal to the inverse of the strong coupling evaluated at the Higgs mass. At next-to-leading order, we construct a powerful discrimination observable through a sort of anomaly detection approach by simply inverting the next-to-leading order $H\to gg$ matrix element with soft gluon emission, which is naturally infrared and collinear safe. Our analytic conclusions are validated in simulated data from all-purpose event generators and subsequent parton showering and demonstrate that the signal-to-background ratio can be improved by a factor of several hundred at high, but accessible, jet energies at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Broadband phonon production from axion absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that axion dark matter in the range meV $\lesssim m_a\lesssim$ 100 meV can incoherently excite phonons in crystal targets with unpolarised nuclear spins. This can occur through its coupling to nuclear spins and/or through its induced time-dependent electric dipole moment in nuclei. Due to the random orientation of the nuclear spins, translation symmetry is broken in the phonon effective theory, allowing axion absorption to create phonons with unrestricted momentum. The absorption rate is therefore proportional to the phonon density of states, which generically has support across a wide range of energies, allowing for a broadband detection scheme. We calculate the absorption rate for solid $\text{H}_2$, $\text{D}_2$, $\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$, $\text{GaAs}$, $\text{H}_2\text{O}$, $\text{D}_2\text{O}$, $\text{Be}$ and $\text{Li}_2 \text{O}$, and find that materials containing light, non-zero spin nuclei are the most promising. The predicted rates for the QCD axion are of the order of a few events / 10 kg-year exposure, setting an ambitious target for the required exposure and background suppression.</description>

      <title>Influence of center vortex interactions on the static potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the static potentials induced by vacuum domains for various representations in SU($4$) Yang-Mills theory within the framework of the domain structure model. By studying the interactions within the vacuum domains, we can uncover fundamental properties of the static potentials. It appears that attractions within the vacuum domains strongly adhere to Casimir scaling at intermediate distances. Conversely, the repulsions within the vacuum domains may decompose them into center vortices with the lowest magnitude of center vortex fluxes, thereby exhibiting $N$-ality at asymptotic distances.</description>

      <title>Prospective analysis of CKM element $|V_{cd}|$ and $D^+$-meson decay constant from leptonic decays $D^+ \to \ell^+ \nu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The leptonic decay of $D^+$-meson has attracted significant interest due to its unique characteristics. In this paper, we carry out an investigation into the $D^+$-meson leptonic decays $D^+\to \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ with $\ell=(e,\mu,\tau)$ by employing the QCD sum rules approach. In which the $D^+$-meson decay constant $f_{D^+}$ is an important input parameter in the process. To enhance the accuracy of our calculations for $f_{D^+}$, we consider the quark propagator and vertex up to dimension-six within the framework of background field theory. Consequently, we obtain the QCD sum rule expression for $f_{D^+}$ up to dimension-six condensates, yielding $f_{D^+}=203.0\pm1.5~\mathrm{MeV}$. Our results are in good agreement with BESIII measurements and theoretical predictions. We also present the integrated decay widths for the $D^+$-meson in three channels $\Gamma(D^+\to e^+\nu_e)=(5.263_{-0.075}^{+0.076})\times10^{-21}~\mathrm{GeV}$, $\Gamma(D^+\to \mu^+\nu_{\mu})=(2.236_{-0.032}^{+0.032})\times10^{-16}~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $\Gamma(D^+\to \tau^+\nu_{\tau})=(5.958_{-0.085}^{+0.086})\times10^{-16}~\mathrm{GeV}$. Accordingly, we compute the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to\ell^+\nu_{\ell})$ with the electron, muon and tau channels, which are $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to e^+\nu_e)=(8.260_{-0.118}^{+0.119})\times10^{-9}$, $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to\mu^+\nu_{\mu})=(3.508_{-0.050}^{+0.051})\times10^{-4}$ and $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to\tau^+\nu_{\tau})=(0.935_{-0.013}^{+0.013})\times10^{-3}$. Furthermore, we present our prediction for the CKM matrix element $|V_{cd}|$ using the branching fraction $\mathcal{B}(D^+\to\mu^+\nu_{\mu})$ obtained from BESIII Collaboration, yielding $|V_{cd}|=0.227_{-0.001}^{+0.002}$.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillation in the presence of background classical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of background classical sources affects a quantum field theory significantly in different ways. Neutrino oscillation is a phenomenon that confirms that neutrinos are massive fermions in nature, a celebrated result in modern physics. Neutrino oscillation plays an important role in many astrophysical observations. However, the interactions between the background classical sources with neutrinos are not often considered. In the present article, we show the effect of some classical sources, namely matter currents, electromagnetic waves, torsion, and gravitational waves on neutrino oscillation. It is shown explicitly that the above sources can change the helicity state of neutrinos during neutrino oscillation.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent thermodynamical treatment for quark matter in quasi-particle model at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the medium effects in strange quark matter in the framework of a grand-canonical ensemble using the phenomenological quasi-particle model. This model is studied with proper self-consistent thermodynamical treatment by incorporating chemical potential-dependent quark mass. We have also included the vector interaction in a self-consistent way. The main aim of this work is to explore the proper thermodynamic treatment in addressing the medium effects at both zero and finite temperatures. In the case of the finite temperature, we explore the study of self-consistent thermodynamics in the isothermal as well as the isentropic processes. The effect of finite temperature and lepton fraction have been studied on the equation of state, speed of sound, and particle fraction. The $M-R$ and $M-\Lambda$ diagrams are found to be consistent with the observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>

      <title>Towards two-loop QCD corrections to $ \mathbf{pp \to t \bar{t} j}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss the status of the computation of the two-loop QCD corrections to top-quark pair production associated with a jet at hadron colliders. This amplitude is a missing ingredient for next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) QCD predictions. I briefly present computational techniques to tackle the algebraic and analytic complexities of two-loop multi-scale amplitudes, in particular where massive propagators give rise to elliptic Feynman integrals. I then describe how a special function basis for the helicity amplitudes is obtained and present first numerical evaluations for the finite remainders of the $gg\to t\bar{t}g$ channel, after the infrared and ultraviolet poles have been identified analytically.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Lorentz and CPT violation from the $1S$-$2P$ transition in antihydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for the Lorentz- and CPT-violating frequency shift for the antihydrogen $1S$-$2P$ transition in the presence of an external magnetic field is derived. Using the recent measurement of the $1S$-$2P$ transition frequency in antihydrogen by the ALPHA collaboration, which they demonstrated agrees with predictions from the Standard Model of particle physics, we establish the first constraints on 26 effective coefficients for Lorentz and CPT violation. Also, this work uses these results to underscore the value of measuring multiple transition frequencies to test CPT symmetry through antihydrogen spectroscopy, emphasizing the advantages of transitions involving states with higher angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Elliptic Flow Coefficient and Impact Parameter in Heavy-Ion Collisions using CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep learning based method with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm is developed for simultaneous determination of the Elliptic Flow coefficient ($v_{2}$) and the Impact Parameter in Heavy-Ion Collisions at relativistic energies. The proposed CNN is trained on Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with minimum biased events simulated with the AMPT event generator. A total of twelve models were built on different input and output combinations and their performances were evaluated. The predictions of the CNN models were compared to the estimations of the simulated and experimental data. The deep learning model seems to preserve the centrality and $p_{T}$ dependence of $v_{2}$ at the LHC energy together with predicting successfully the impact parameter with low margins of error. This is the first time a CNN is built to predict both $v_{2}$ and the impact parameter simultaneously in heavy-ion system.</description>

      <title>Vortex information in multiphoton scalar pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex information of scalar pair production in circularly polarized field is investigated in the multiphoton regime. We find that vortex orientation is related to the intrinsic orbital angular momentum of created particles associating with the helicity of absorbed photons, while the magnitude of the orbital angular momentum, i.e., the topology charge is determined by the number of absorbed photons. Moreover, the properties of particle creation and vortices formation can be understood by analyzing the pair production process in quasiparticle representation. This study provides new insights into the angular momentum transfer from field to particle in the scalar pair production process. It is expected that there are similar findings about vortex features for different spin alignment in electron-positron pair production in strong fields via the topology charge as a new freedom.</description>

      <title>Implication of preheating on gravity assisted baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of preheating on baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation. In this scenario, the inclusion of a dimension-six operator ${(R/ \Lambda^2)} B_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{B}^{\mu\nu} $ abundantly generates helical hypermagnetic fields during inflation, leading to a baryon asymmetric Universe at the electroweak crossover. Focusing on the $R^2$-like regime, we first derive the relevant dynamics of preheating using a doubly-covariant formalism. We find that preheating can happen for the Higgs, transverse gauge and Goldstone bosons, however, it is dependent on the value of the non-minimal coupling $\xi_H$ between the Standard Model Higgs field and the Ricci scalar. We identify the preheating temperature to determine the appropriate scale $\Lambda$ for driving baryogenesis, which is around $\Lambda \sim 2.2 \, (2.6) \times 10^{-5}\, M_{\rm P}$ for $\xi_H \sim 1 \, (10)$. Our results represent the most accurate estimation of the scale of gravity induced baryogenesis in $R^2$-Higgs inflation to date. Areas for further improvement are identified.</description>

      <title>Investigating late-stage particle production in pp collisions with Balance Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balance functions have been regarded in the past as a method of investigating the late-stage hadronization found in the presence of a strongly-coupled medium. They are also used to constrain mechanisms of particle production in large and small collision systems. Measurements of charge balance functions for inclusive and identified particle pairs are reported as a function of charged particle multiplicity in proton--proton collisions simulated with the PYTHIA8 and the EPOS4 models. The charge balance functions of inclusive, pion, kaon, and proton pairs exhibit amplitudes and shapes that depend on particle species and differ significantly in the two models due to the different particle production mechanisms implemented in PYTHIA and EPOS. The shapes and amplitudes also evolve with multiplicity in both models. In addition, the evolution of the longitudinal rms width and that of balance functions integrals with multiplicity (and average transverse momentum) feature significant differences in the two models.</description>

      <title>Copositive criteria for a two-component dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11236v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a two-component scalar dark matter model in this work, where the scalars are stabilized by extra $Z_2 \times Z'_2$ symmetry. To guarantee the stability of the vacuum, we consider the copositive criteria and different choices of the signs of the couplings will contribute to different viable parameter spaces. Based on the copositive criteria, we systematically analyze the possible conditions and pick up 17 different cases with fixing some parameters to be negative. We randomly scan the parameter space under dark matter relic density constraint and direct detection constraint and focus on the quartic couplings with $\lambda_{13}$,$\lambda_{23}$,$\lambda_{14}$ and $\lambda_{24}$. The shapes of the viable parameter space for $|\lambda_{14}|-|\lambda_{24}|$ are almost similar among these cases, while for $|\lambda_{13}|$ and $|\lambda_{23}|$, the larger value are excluded as long as $\lambda_{13}\leqslant 0$ and $\lambda_{23}\leqslant 0$ due to the large interference effect of the $2 \to 2$ processes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous challenges persist in High Energy Physics (HEP), the addressing of which requires advancements in detection technology, computational methods, data analysis frameworks, and phenomenological designs. We provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of recent progress across these areas, in line with advances in quantum technology. We will discuss the potential of quantum devices in detecting subtle effects indicative of new physics beyond the Standard Model, the transformative role of quantum algorithms and large-scale quantum computers in studying real-time non-perturbative dynamics in the early universe and at colliders, as well as in analyzing complex HEP data. Additionally, we emphasize the importance of integrating quantum properties into HEP experiments to test quantum mechanics at unprecedented high-energy scales and search for hints of new physics. Looking ahead, the continued integration of resources to fully harness these evolving technologies will enhance our efforts to deepen our understanding of the fundamental laws of nature.</description>

      <title>Massive neutrinos, Anomalous magnetic moments and Dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amongst the issues plaguing the Standard Model (SM) are questions pertaining to neutrino masses and mixings, the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron and muon and the problem of a suitable dark matter (DM) candidate. All the three issues can be addressed at once by extending the SM with two generations of vector-like fermions and an inert scalar doublet, all odd under a Z2 symmetry. The light neutrino masses and mixings are generated radiatively while maintaining consistency with bounds on lepton flavor violation. Loop diagrams with the very same fields also serve to explain the anomalous magnetic moments. Similarly, the correct dark matter relic abundance is reproduced without coming into conflict with direct detection constraints, or those from big bang nucleosynthesis or the cosmic microwave observations. Finally, prospective signatures at the LHC are discussed.</description>

      <title>Unravelling theoretical challenges in understanding $B_c$ meson decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $B_c$ meson, a unique bound state comprising of two open heavy flavors, charm and bottom, offers a rich avenue for probing the predictions of the Next Decade - Standard Model (ND-SM) physics properties due to its heavy mass. With recent observations of its excited states, interest in understanding $B_c$ production mechanisms and decay modes has surged. This article presents the current state of art on $B_c$ mesons, encompassing production mechanisms, properties of different decay modes, and theoretical modeling. We present novel findings on the newly constructed ratios $(\mathcal{R}_{\eta_c/J/\psi}$, $\mathcal{R}_{D/D^*})$ in semileptonic and ($\mathcal{R}_\mu^\tau)^{B_c}$ , ($\mathcal{R}_\mu^\tau)^{B_c^*}$ in leptonic decays, respectively. These results emphasize the importance of $B_c$ studies in the future collider experiments. The article further explores CP effects in $B_c$ meson decays refining our understanding of heavy flavor properties. Finally, potential avenues for future research, and leveraging upcoming collider experiments are outlined.</description>

      <title>A novel configuration of gluonic tetraquark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the experimental measurement of the charmed hadronic state X(6900), we calculate the mass spectra of tetraquark hybrid states with configuration of \([8_{c}]_{\bar{Q}Q} \otimes [8_{c}]_{G} \otimes [8_{c}]_{\bar{Q}Q}\) in color, by virtual of the QCD sum rules. The two feasible types of currents with quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ are investigated, in which the contributions from operators up to dimension six are taken into account in operator product expansion (OPE). In the end, we find that, in charm sector, the tetracharm hybrid states with quantum number \(0^{++}\) has a mass of about \(6.98^{+0.16}_{-0.14} \, \text{GeV}\), while \(0^{-+}\) state mass is about \(7.26^{+0.16}_{-0.15} \, \text{GeV}\). The results are somehow compatible with the experimental observations. In bottom sector, calculation shows that the masses of tetrabottom hybrid states with quantum numbers $0^{++}$ and $0^{-+}$ are \(19.30^{+0.16}_{-0.17} \, \text{GeV}\) and \(19.50^{+0.17}_{-0.17} \, \text{GeV}\), respectively, which are left for future experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the nature of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To shed light on the properties of states whose nature, internal structure, and spin-parity quantum numbers are not fully elucidated, we systematically study their electromagnetic properties. In light of this concept, we present a comprehensive analysis of the magnetic dipole moment of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark within the context of QCD light-cone sum rules, utilizing three distinct interpolating currents in the form of diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations that are likely to couple this pentaquark with $J^P =\frac{3}{2}^-$ quantum numbers. The numerical analysis yielded the following results: $\mu_{{J_\mu^1}}= -0.75 \pm 0.15~\mu_N$, $\mu_{{J_\mu^2}}=2.02 \pm 0.34~\mu_N$ , and $\mu_{{J_\mu^3}}= 1.26 \pm 0.23~\mu_N$. The numerical results obtained have led to the conclusion that the magnetic dipole moments of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ state are capable of projecting its inner structure. As is seen, the different diquark-diquark-antiquark configurations of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state contain important information about its internal structure. Thus, this study will provide prominent data to investigate the inner structure of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ pentaquark state. We compared our results with other theoretical predictions that could be a useful complementary tool for interpreting the nature of the $P_{cs}(4459)$ state. We concluded that they do not agree with each other.</description>

      <title>New multinucleon knockout model in NuWro Monte Carlo generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation and results of a new model for the n-particle n-hole ($\it{np-nh}$) contribution in the NuWro event generator, grounded in the theoretical framework established by the Valencia group in 2020. For the $\it{2p2h}$ component, we introduce a novel nucleon sampling function with tunable parameters to approximate correlations in the momenta of outgoing nucleons. These parameters are calibrated by comparing our results to those of the Valencia model across a range of incoming neutrino energies. In addition, our model incorporates a distinct contribution from the $\it{3p3h}$ mechanism. We discuss the differences between the new NuWro implementation, the original Valencia model, and the previous NuWro version, focusing on the distribution of outgoing nucleon momenta. Finally, we assess the impact of the hadronic model on experimental analyses involving hadronic observables.</description>

      <title>Vacuum pair production in zeptosecond pulses: Peculiar momentum spectra and striking particle acceleration by bipolar pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the phenomenon of electron-positron pair production from vacuum in a combination of two counterpropagating electromagnetic pulses having a duration of the order of the Compton time. We show that in this extreme short-time domain, the momentum distributions of the particles produced possess a peculiar structure which strongly depends on whether the electromagnetic pulses have a unipolar or bipolar profile. It is shown that bipolar pulses can predominantly generate particles with ultrarelativistic velocities along the propagation direction of the pulses, while unipolar ones are generally more favorable in terms of the total particle yield in the same regime. The highly nontrivial properties of the $e^+e^-$ spectra revealed in our study provide strong experimental signatures paving the way to probe a complex vacuum response within the short-time domain of quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large double-logarithmic corrections are induced by soft gluon emissions near threshold in the semi-inclusive $e^+e^-$ annihilation (SIA) distributions, and must be resummed to all-orders in perturbation theory for reliable theoretical predictions. Building on strategy developed for threshold resummation for DIS structure function in momentum space using soft-collinear effective theory (SCET), we present the explicit formalism for SIA cross section. We then perform the resummation directly in momentum space for $\gamma^* \to q \bar q$, $H \to gg$ and $H \to b\bar b$ to N$^4$LL accuracy and demonstrate good convergence. We anticipate that these results will benefit the extraction of the light-quark, the heavy-quark as well as the gluon fragmentation functions.</description>

      <title>Improved Hessian Method in Global Analysis of Parton Distribution Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hessian method is widely used in the global analysis of parton distribution functions (PDFs). It uses a set of orthogonal eigenvectors to calculate the first-order derivative terms of a physics observable, so that the leading order PDF-induced uncertainty can be estimated accordingly. In this article, we report an improved Hessian method which introduces the second-order derivatives in the uncertainty estimation. To estimate the effect of the second-order uncertainties, a pseudo global analysis is designed. We also find that the PDF-induced uncertainties on physics variables can be significantly different by taking the second-order effects into account, particularly when the precisions of experimental inputs used in the PDF global analysis are limited.</description>

      <title>Threshold resummation for double-deeply virtual Compton scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The threshold region for double-deeply virtual Compton scattering (DDVCS) is discussed. I derive a resummation formula for the (partonic) threshold logarithms in the flavor non-singlet case. The resummations can be done by using (re)factorization theorems for the coefficient functions near the partonic thresholds. As a byproduct, we obtain the leading term in the threshold limit of the two-loop coefficient function in double-deeply-virtual Compton scattering, which agrees with the recent result from explicit calculation, providing a highly non-trivial cross-check.</description>

      <title>Glueball Axion-Like Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark Yang-Mills sectors that confine to form stable composite states, known as glueballs, have been traditionally proposed as a potential explanation for cosmological Dark Matter (DM). Earlier studies have established viability of the lightest scalar glueball as a possible DM candidate. In this work, we explore a whole class of effective composite sectors in the confined Yang-Mills regime featuring an additional pseudoscalar glueball state. We also investigate the role of effective interactions of the dark glueball sector with the visible sectors via higher-dimensional operators primarily focusing on dimension-8 couplings of glueballs to photons and gluons. We stress the remarkable similarities between the phenomenology of such glueball effective theories and Standard Model extensions featuring Axion-Like Particles (ALPs). Hence, one deals with a new class of composite Glueball ALPs (or GALPs) coupled to photons and/or nucleons in a wide mass range, from sub-eV to the Planck scale, yielding viable DM candidates that can be probed by astrophysical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Bounds on new neutrino interactions from the first CE$\nu$NS data at direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, two dark matter direct detection experiments have announced the first indications of nuclear recoils from solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS) with xenon nuclei. These results constitute a turning point, not only for dark matter searches that are now entering the \textit{neutrino fog}, but they also bring out new opportunities to exploit dark matter facilities as neutrino detectors. We investigate the implications of recent data from the PandaX-4T and XENONnT experiments on both Standard Model physics and new neutrino interactions. We first extract information on the weak mixing angle at low momentum transfer. Then, following a phenomenological approach, we consider Lorentz-invariant interactions (scalar, vector, axial-vector, and tensor) between neutrinos, quarks and charged leptons. Furthermore, we study the $U(1)_\mathrm{B-L}$ scenario as a concrete example of a new anomaly-free vector interaction. We find that despite the low statistics of these first experimental results, the inferred bounds are in some cases already competitive. For the scope of this work we also compute new bounds on some of the interactions using CE$\nu$NS data from COHERENT and electron recoil data from XENONnT, LUX-ZEPLIN, PandaX-4T, and TEXONO. It seems clear that while direct detection experiments continue to take data, more precise measurements will be available, thus allowing to test new neutrino interactions at the same level or even improving over dedicated neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the collinear limit of the Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) in single-inclusive jet production in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions. We introduce a non-perturbative model that allows us to describe the EEC in the entire angular region of the current experiments. Our results for $pp$ collisions show excellent agreement with CMS and ALICE data over a wide range of jet transverse momenta. For $pA$ collisions, we include modifications from the nuclear medium, and our predictions align well with the trends observed in recent ALICE measurements.</description>

Abstract: This analysis focuses on probing the lepton portal dark matter using Monte Carlo simulated samples from electron-positron collisions at the International Linear Collider (ILC) of 500 GeV center of mass energy with an integrated luminosity of 1000 fb$^{-1}$. The study examines a benchmark scenario where the dark matter is a scalar particle produced as a daughter particle of the vector-like lepton. The signal topology consists of missing transverse energy and dilepton. If no new physics is discovered,the study sets 95\% confidence level exclusion limits on the mass of vector-like leptons.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Scattering Enhancement from the Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a charged particle scattering off of an Aharonov-Bohm cosmic string. A classic computation gave an infinite total scattering cross section, leading to a Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement which can have important implications on baryon number asymmetry in the early universe. However, unlike the Callan-Rubakov effect, the Aharonov-Bohm interaction is topological and thus it is surprising that it leads to such a dramatic dynamical effect for single particle scattering. We reexamine this old problem through the modern lens of generalized global symmetries by embedding Aharanov-Bohm strings in a discrete gauge theory. We show that the scattering cross section is suppressed by the core size and there is thus no Callan-Rubakov-like enhancement.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Dark Matter Annihilation and Dark Matter-Baryon Velocity Offsets at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter annihilation has the potential to leave an imprint on the properties of the first luminous structures at Cosmic Dawn as well as the overall evolution of the intergalactic medium (IGM). In this work, we employ a semi-analytic method to model dark matter annihilation during Cosmic Dawn (approximately redshift $z=20$ to $40$), examining potential modifications to IGM evolution as well as gas collapse, cooling, and star formation in mini-halos. Our analysis takes into account the effects of dark matter-baryon velocity offsets, utilizing the public 21cmvFAST code, and producing predictions for the 21cm global signal. The results from our simplified model suggest that dark matter annihilation can suppress the gas fraction in small halos and alter the molecular cooling process, while the impact on star formation might be positive or negative depending on parameters of the dark matter model as well as the redshift and assumptions about velocity offsets. This underscores the need for more comprehensive simulations of the effects of exotic energy injection at Cosmic Dawn as observational probes are providing us new insights into the process of reionization and the formation of first stars and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Shear transport in far-from-equilibrium isotropization of supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We holographically study the far-from-equilibrium isotropization dynamics of the strongly coupled $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills plasma. The dual gravitational background is driven to be out of equilibrium and anisotropic by a time-dependent change in boundary conditions. At late times, the system relaxes and asymptotically approaches a static configuration. The large initial energy densities accelerate the isotropization significantly compared to the initial geometry corresponding to the supersymmetric Yang-Mills vacuum. We analyze shear transport during isotropization by directly computing the time-dependent stress tensor, which is now a nonlinear function of the shear rate. The shear viscosity far from equilibrium displays much richer dynamics than its near-equilibrium counterpart. Moreover, we uncover that the equilibrium viscosity-to-entropy ratio at late times depends on the details of the quench function and the initial data, which could be due to a resummation of the hydrodynamic description. In particular, this ratio can be parametrically smaller than the Kovtun-Son-Starinets bound calculated from linear response theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how curing an anomaly of the twistor uplift of self-dual Yang-Mills theory implies linear relations among one-loop, $n$-gluon, color-ordered subamplitudes in QCD, when all $n$ gluon helicities are positive, or when exactly one is negative. We compute the number of linearly independent subamplitudes as determined by these relations, in terms of unsigned Stirling numbers. Then we use a momentum-twistor parametrization to show that there are no further linear dependencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strange metal is a peculiar phase of matter in which the electron scattering rate, $\tau^{-1} \sim k_B T/\hbar$, which determines the electrical resistance, is universal across a wide family of materials and determined only by fundamental constants. In 1989, theorists hypothesized that this universality would manifest as scale-invariant behavior in the dynamic charge susceptibility, $\chi''(q,\omega)$. Here, we present momentum-resolved inelastic electron scattering measurements of the strange metal Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ showing that the susceptibility has the scale-invariant form $\chi''(q,\omega) = T^{-\nu} f(\omega/T)$, with exponent $\nu = 0.93$. We find the response is consistent with conformal invariance, meaning the dynamics may be thought of as occurring on a circle of radius $1/T$ in imaginary time, characterized by conformal dimension $\Delta = 0.05$. Our study indicates that the strange metal is a universal phenomenon whose properties are not determined by microscopic properties of a particular material.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization and diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical review of the possible connection between the stochastic quantization in physics and the diffusion models in machine learning. For machine-learning applications, the denoising diffusion model has been established as a successful technique, which is formulated in terms of the stochastic differential equation (SDE). In this review, we focus on an SDE approach used in the score-based generative modeling. Interestingly, the evolution of the probability distribution is equivalently described by a particular class of SDEs, and in a particular limit, the stochastic noises can be eliminated. Then, we turn to a similar mathematical formulation in quantum physics, that is, the stochastic quantization. We make a brief overview on the stochastic quantization using a simple toy model of the one-dimensional integration. The analogy between the diffusion model and the stochastic quantization is clearly seen in this concrete example. Finally, we discuss how the sign problem arises in the toy model with complex parameters. The origin of the difficulty is understood based on the Lefschetz thimble analysis. We point out that the SDE is not invariant under the variable change which induces a kernel and a special choice of the kernel guided by the Lefschetz thimble analysis can reduce the sign problem.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coleman's Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the absence of gravity, Coleman's theorem states that the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton solution, which is regular at the origin and exponentially decays at infinity, gives the lowest action. Perturbatively, this implies that any small deformation from $O(4)$-symmetry gives a larger action. In this letter we investigate the possibility of extending this theorem to the situation where the $O(4)$-symmetric instanton is singular, provided that the action is finite. In particular, we show a general form of the potential around the origin, which realizes a singular instanton with finite action. We then discuss a concrete example in which this situation is realized, and analyze non-trivial anisotropic deformations around the solution perturbatively. Intriguingly, in contrast to the case of Coleman's instantons, we find that there exists a deformed solution that has the same action as the one for the $O(4)$-symmetric solution up to the second order in perturbation. Our result implies that there exist non-$O(4)$-symmetric solutions with finite action beyond Coleman's instantons, and gives rise to the possibility of the existence of a non-$O(4)$-symmetric instanton with a lower action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 1+1 dimensional relativistic non-resistive magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) with longitudinal boost invariance and shear stress tensor. Several analytical solutions that describe the fluid temperature evolution under the equation of state (EoS) $\varepsilon=3p$ are derived, relevant to relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Extending the Victor-Bjorken ideal MHD flow to include non-zero shear viscosity, two perturbative analytical solutions for the first-order (Navier-Stokes) approximation are obtained. For small, power-law evolving external magnetic fields, our solutions are stable and show that both magnetic field and shear viscosity cause fluid heating with an early temperature peak, align with the numerical results. In the second-order (Israel-Stewart) theory, our findings show that the combined presence of magnetic field and shear viscosity leads to a slow cooling rate of fluid temperature, with initial shear stress significantly affecting temperature evolution of QGP.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the $\eta_c\eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ s-wave scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the s-wave scattering length in the $0^+$ sector of $\eta_c\eta_c$ and the $2^+$ sector of $J/\psi J/\psi$ using three $N_f=2$ twisted mass gauge ensembles with the lattice spacing $a=0.0667,0.085,0.098$ fm, respectively. The scattering lengths are extracted using the conventional L{\"u}scher finite size method. We observe sizable discretization effects and the results after a continuum extrapolation are $a^{0^+}_{\eta_c\eta_c}=-0.104(09)$ fm and $a^{2^+}_{J/\psi J/\psi}=-0.165(16)$ fm. Our results indicate that the interaction between the two respective charmonia are repulsive in nature in both cases.</description>

      <title>QED 5-loop on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the result of the numerical lattice computation of the lepton anomalous magnetic moment in QED up to five loops. We concentrate on the contributions from diagrams without lepton loops, which are the most difficult part of the calculation in the Feynman diagram method while the lattice formulation is the easiest. Good agreement with the results of the Feynman diagram method is observed.</description>

      <title>Computing $1/m_Q$ and $1/m_Q^2$ corrections to the static potential with lattice gauge theory using gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present selected preliminary lattice gauge theory results for $O(1/m_Q)$ and $O(1/m_Q^2)$ corrections to the static potential. These results are based on Wilson loops with two field strength insertions, which we renormalize using gradient flow. We explore tree level improvement to reduce systematic errors in the Wilson loops due to the finite lattice spacing and flow time, in particular at small temporal and spatial separations.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Two Excited $\Omega^{-}$ Hyperons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using $e^+e^-$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 19 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the BESIII detector at center-of-mass energies ranging from 4.13 to 4.70 GeV, we report the first evidence for a new excited $\Omega^{-}$ hyperon, the $\Omega^*(2109)^{-}$, through the process $e^+ e^- \to \Omega^*(2109)^{-} \bar{\Omega}^{+} +c.c.$ with a significance of 3.7 $\sigma$. The mass and width of $\Omega^*(2109)^{-}$ are measured to be $2108.8 \pm 5.5_{\rm stat} \pm 1.5_{\rm syst} {\rm MeV}/c^{2}$ and $21.6 \pm 17.7_{\rm stat} \pm 9.4_{\rm syst} {\rm MeV}$, respectively. We also present evidence for production of the $\Omega^*(2012)^{-}$ in the process $e^+ e^- \to \Omega^*(2012)^{-} \bar{\Omega}^{+} +c.c.$ with a significance of 3.7 $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>BAO vs. SN evidence for evolving dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We critically review the evidence for time-varying dark energy from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernova (SN) observations. First, we show that such evidence is present at the 3$\sigma$ level, even without the new BAO data from the dark energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), by instead using BAO data from the dark energy Survey (DES), combined with the DES5Y supernovae and Planck CMB data. Next, we examine the role of the DES5Y supernova dataset, showing that the preference for time-varying dark energy is driven by the low redshift supernovae common to both the DES5Y and Pantheon+ compilations. We find that combining Pantheon+ and DES5Y supernovae by removing the common supernovae leads to two different results, depending on whether they are removed from the DES5Y or the Pantheon+ catalog, leading to stronger or weaker exclusion of $\Lambda$CDM, at the (3.8$\sigma$) and (2.5$\sigma$) level, respectively. These common supernovae have smaller error bars in DES5Y compared to Pantheon+, and, as recently pointed out, there is an offset in magnitude in DES5Y between supernovae at ($z &gt; 0.1$), where almost all the measurements taken during the full five years of DES are, and the low-redshift ones ($z &lt; 0.1$), where all the historical set of nearby supernovae lies. We show that marginalizing over such an offset in DES5Y would lead to significantly weaker evidence for evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon at the physical pion mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the hadronic light-by-light scattering contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon using $N_f=2+1+1$ flavors of staggered quarks with masses tuned to their physical values. Our final result, in the continuum limit, reads $a_{\mu}^{\mathrm{hlbl}} = 125.5(11.6)_{\mathrm{stat}}(0.4)_{\mathrm{syst}} \times 10^{-11}$ where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. Light, strange and charm-quark contributions are considered. In addition to the connected and leading disconnected contributions, we also include an estimate of the sub-leading disconnected diagrams. Our result is compatible with previous lattice QCD and data-driven dispersive determinations.</description>

      <title>An introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization and spin transport are common phenomena in many quantum systems. Relativistic spin hydrodynamics provides an effective low-energy framework to describe these processes in quantum many-body systems. The fundamental symmetry underlying relativistic spin hydrodynamics is angular momentum conservation, which naturally leads to inter-conversion between spin and orbital angular momenta. This inter-conversion is a key feature of relativistic spin hydrodynamics, closely related to entropy production and introducing ambiguity in the construction of constitutive relations. In this article, we present a pedagogical introduction to relativistic spin hydrodynamics. We demonstrate how to derive the constitutive relations by applying local thermodynamic laws and explore several distinctive aspects of spin hydrodynamics. These include the pseudo-gauge ambiguity, the behavior of the system in the presence of strong vorticity, and the challenges of modeling the freeze-out of spin in heavy-ion collisions. We also outline some future prospects for spin hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>A modular perspective to the jet suppression from a small to large radius in very high transverse momentum jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the scope of the JETSCAPE framework to cover the jet radius parameter ($R$) dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. The primary focus of this work has been the in-depth analysis of the high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets up to 1 TeV (to probe the quark-gluon plasma medium at much shorter distance scales) and the quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed in the Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{\rm s_{NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV for the most-central (0-10\%) collisions. The nuclear modification factor is calculated for inclusive jets via coupling of the MATTER module (which simulates the high virtuality phase of the parton evolution) with the LBT module (which simulates the low virtuality phase of the parton evolution). These calculations are then compared with the experimental results collected at the ATLAS and the CMS detectors in the jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$) ranging from 100 GeV to 1 TeV for the ATLAS detector and greater than 300 GeV up to 1 TeV for the CMS detector. The predictions made by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes, with the deviations staying within 10-25\%. Our major focus is on calculating the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet radius and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the observations are well described by the JETSCAPE framework which is based on the hydrodynamic multi-stage evolution of the parton shower.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) as an all-dark matter (DM) hypothesis has recently been demotivated by the prediction that these objects would source an excessive rate of fast radio bursts (FRBs). However, these predictions were based on several simplifying assumptions to which this rate is highly sensitive. In this article, we improve previous estimates of this rate arising from the capture of PBHs by neutron stars (NSs), aiming to revitalise this theory. We more accurately compute the velocity distribution functions of PBHs and NSs and also consider an enhancement in the NS and DM density profiles at galactic centers due to the presence of a central supermassive black hole. We find that previous estimates of the rate of FRBs sourced by the capture of PBHs by NSs were 3 orders of magnitude too large, concluding that the PBHs as all DM hypothesis remains a viable theory and that the observed FRB rate can only be entirely explained when considering a central, sufficiently spiky PBH density profile.</description>

      <title>Modification of the Sommerfeld effect due to coannihilator decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dark matter coannihilation scenarios, the Sommerfeld effect of coannihilators is usually important in calculations of dark matter thermal relic abundance. Due to decays of coannihilators, two annihilating coannihilators can only approach each other from a finite initial separation. While conventional derivations of Sommerfeld factors essentially assume an infinite initial separation, Sommerfeld factors for a pair of annihilating coannihilators may be different. We find that the Sommerfeld factor for a pair of coannihilators is less prominent than the one obtained without considering decays. The modification of the Sommerfeld factor may result in a change of the dark matter thermal relic abundance well beyond the percent level.</description>

      <title>Factorization of photon induced processes in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate photon-photon scattering in ultra-peripheral heavy ion collisions (UPCs). We start by deriving an effective Lagrangian from first principles and then apply factorization techniques from Soft-Collinear effective theory (SCET). This approach allows us to decompose the photon-photon scattering cross-section into two primary factors: the generalized transverse momentum distributions (GTMDs) and the hard scattering amplitude. We further analyze the emission of soft photons by final state leptons, incorporating a soft function into the cross section through an evolution method. Our analysis yields detailed predictions for observable angular correlations among the final state leptons. Specifically, we calculate the angular correlations characterized by the azimuthal parameters $\langle\cos 2\phi\rangle$ and $\langle\cos 4\phi\rangle$, highlighting the influence of initial photons polarization and recoil effects from final state soft photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the 3-3-1 model with neutral leptons (called the 331$NL$ for short) and by that, we will point out that this model can simultaneously explain the lepton flavor violating (LFV) decays of the $Z$ boson $Z \to e_a e_b$, Standard model-like Higgs boson decay $h\to e_be_a$, and the charged leptons $e_b\to e_a \gamma$ consistent with the recent experimental data. In addition, the numerical results show strict relations among these decay rates of $Z$ and $h$ which are predicted by this model. As a result, the decay channels can be determined theoretically if one of them is detected by experiments.</description>

      <title>Hawking Radiation of Nonrelativistic Scalars: Applications to Pion and Axion Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In studying secondary gamma-ray emissions from Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), the production of scalar particles like pions and axion-like particles (ALPs) via Hawking radiation is crucial. While previous analyses assumed relativistic production, asteroid-mass PBHs, relevant to upcoming experiments like AMEGO-X, likely produce pions and ALPs non-relativistically when their masses exceed 10 MeV. To account for mass dependence in Hawking radiation, we revisit the greybody factors for massive scalars from Schwarzschild black holes, revealing significant mass corrections to particle production rates compared to the projected AMEGO-X sensitivity. We highlight the importance of considering non-relativistic $\pi^0$ production in interpreting PBH gamma-ray signals, essential for determining PBH properties. Additionally, we comment on the potential suppression of pion production due to form factor effects when producing extended objects via Hawking radiation. We also provide an example code for calculating the Hawking radiation spectrum of massive scalar particles.</description>

      <title>Z_5 two-component dark matter in the Type-II seesaw mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15116v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the Z5 two-component dark matter model within the framework of the Type-II seesaw mechanism. Due to the new annihilation processes related to triplets, the light component cannot necessarily be dominant in the dark matter relic density, which is different from the Z5 two-component dark matter model in the SM. The model is considered to explain the excess of electron-positron flux measured by the AMS-02 Collaborations in this work, which is encouraged by the decay of the triplets arising from dark matter annihilations in the Galactic halo. We discuss the cases of the light and heavy components determining dark matter density within a viable parameter space satisfying relic density and direct detection constraints, and by fitting the antiproton spectrum observed in the PAMELA and AMS experiments, we find that the parameter space is flexible and the electron-positron flux excess can be obtained in both cases with the mass of two dark matter particles being larger than that of the triplets'.</description>

      <title>Probing exotic long-lived particles from the prompt side using the CONTUR method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18710v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A method to derive constraints on new physics models featuring exotic long-lived particles using detector-corrected measurements of prompt states is presented. The CONTUR workflow is modified to either account for the fraction of long-lived particles which decay early enough to be reconstructed as prompt, or to be sensitive to the recoil of such particles against a prompt system. This makes it possible to determine how many of signal events would be selected in the RIVET routines which encapsulate the fiducial regions of dozens of measurements of Standard Model processes by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. New constraints are set on several popular exotic long-lived particle models in the very short-lifetime or very long-lifetime regimes, which are often poorly covered by direct searches. The probed models include feebly-interacting dark matter, hidden sector models mediated by a heavy neutral scalar, dark photon models and a model featuring photo-phobic axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>HEFT's appraisal of triple (versus double) Higgs weak boson fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Higgs boson interactions with massive gauge bosons are known to be tell-tale probes of the vacuum manifold of electroweak symmetry breaking. Phenomenologically, a precise determination of these parameters is hampered through increasingly rare processes at the presently available energy frontier provided by the Large Hadron Collider. Contact interactions of three Higgs bosons with the $W$ and $Z$ bosons seem currently well out of experimental reach due to an irrelevant SM production cross section. From a theoretical perspective, in perturbative extensions of the SM such interactions are suppressed by weak loops and further diluted in a priori sensitive processes like weak boson fusion (WBF) when they admit a dimension-six Standard Model Effective Field Theory description. In this work, we identify scenarios that can indeed lead to large, and perhaps even observable modifications of WBF triple Higgs production most directly parametrised by Higgs Effective Field Theory. We critically analyse these enhancements at the LHC and future colliders from the perspective of unitarity and demonstrate the radiative stability of such analyses under QCD corrections at hadron colliders. Taking into account the restrictions from unitarity, we finally study the expected sensitivity to the electroweak triple Higgs production within HEFT, considering $HHVV$ and $HHHVV$ effective couplings, at both future hadron and lepton colliders. Particularly, we present numerical predictions for LHC, FCC, CLIC and muon colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we have investigated the radiative and semileptonic decay of doubly heavy baryons. Our focus is to determine the static and dynamic properties such as ground state masses, magnetic moment, transition magnetic moment, radiative decay and heavy-to-heavy semileptonic decay rates including their corresponding branching fractions. The ground state masses are calculated by solving the six-dimensional hyperradial Schr\"{o}dinger equation. The magnetic moments and transition magnetic moments for $J^P=\frac{1}{2}^+$ and $J^P=\frac{3}{2}^+$ baryons are also calculated. In addition, radiative M1 decay widths are computed from the transition magnetic moment. We have employed the Isgur-Wise function(IWF) to analyse the semileptonic decay widths of the doubly heavy baryons. The obtained results are compared with other theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>An alternative way to decipher the nature of the doubly charmed tetraquark $T_{cc}(3875)^+$: its antiparticle $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ photoproduction off nuclei near threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inclusive photoproduction of $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ mesons (which are the antiparticles of the doubly charmed tetraquarks $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ discovered recently by the LHCb Collaboration) from nuclei in the near-threshold energy region within the nuclear spectral function approach by considering incoherent direct (${\gamma}p(n) \to D^+(D^0){T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-}\Lambda^+_c$) photon--nucleon $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ creation processes as well as five possible different scenarios for their internal structure with the main goal of clarifying the possibility to decipher this structure (and, hence, that of $T_{cc}(3875)^+$) in photoproduction via integral and differential observables. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold photon beam energies of 30--38 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory polar angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ as well as the A and momentum dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ production at photon energy of 35 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $T_{{\bar c}{\bar c}}(3875)^-$ meson intrinsic structure. We demonstrate that the absolute and relative observables considered show a certain sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in future experiments at the proposed high-luminosity electron-ion colliders EIC and EicC in the US and China in the near-threshold energy region might shed light on the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ internal structure.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter with a 1000 km baseline interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) arise from well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model and could account for dark matter. ALP dark matter would manifest as a field oscillating at an (as of yet) unknown frequency. The frequency depends linearly on the ALP mass and plausibly ranges from $10^{-22}$ to $10$ eV/$c^2$. This motivates broadband search approaches. We report on a direct search for ALP dark matter with an interferometer composed of two atomic K-Rb-$^3$He comagnetometers, one situated in Mainz, Germany, and the other in Krak\'ow, Poland. We leverage the anticipated spatio-temporal coherence properties of the ALP field and probe all ALP-gradient-spin interactions covering a mass range of nine orders of magnitude. No significant evidence of an ALP signal is found. We thus place new upper limits on the ALP-neutron, ALP-proton and ALP-electron couplings reaching below $g_{aNN}&lt;10^{-9}$ GeV$^{-1}$, $g_{aPP}&lt;10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{aee}&lt;10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-1}$, respectively. These limits improve upon previous laboratory constraints for neutron and proton couplings by up to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Scalaron dark matter and the thermal history of the universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In metric $f(R)$ gravity minimally coupled to the Standard Model, the scalaron field can act as a dark-matter candidate if its mass lies in the range $\text{meV} \lesssim m \lesssim \text{MeV}$. The evolution of the scalaron is influenced by the trace of the stress-energy tensor, whose behaviour, as shown in our previous work, becomes non-adiabatic during the electroweak crossover, potentially triggering scalaron oscillations. While we previously approximated this crossover as a second-order phase transition at the one-loop level, the transition is actually smoother. In this paper, we refine our analysis to account for this smooth crossover and show that scalaron oscillations are still excited in a qualitatively similar manner, driven by the rapid dynamics of the electroweak crossover observed in numerical lattice simulations, provided the scalaron mass is sufficiently small. We also investigate the time-dependent contribution to the stress-energy trace due to the trace anomaly of quantum chromodynamics. Our results indicate that, while the trace anomaly shifts the scalaron's equilibrium value, this shift evolves adiabatically compared to the fast oscillations of the scalaron, meaning that the trace anomaly does not significantly affect the potential cosmological scenarios for scalaron evolution.</description>

Abstract: I give a short summary of scenarios with new physics scalars that could be investigated at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. I concentrate on cases where at least one of the additional scalar has a mass below 125 GeV, and discuss models where this could be realized. In general, there are quite a few additional new physics scenarios and signatures that are still allowed by current constraints and should be investigated in more detail at future $e^+e^-$ machines. Most of the material presented here has already been discussed in arXiv:2307.15962, and I therefore try to focus on novel developments since then.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the CP Phase $\delta_{CP}$ in the Neutrino Oscillation and an Axion-less Solution to the Strong CP Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01224v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model of the axion-less solution to the strong CP problem has been recently constructed based on the $\bf T^2/\mathbb{Z}_3$ orbifold in the six dimensional space-time. We extend, in this paper, the model to include the lepton sector with three right-handed neutrinos. A crucial point in the extended model is that we have only one CP-violating phase and thus the CP phase in the neutrino oscillation can be predicted by the CP phase in the CKM matrix. The CP phase $\delta_{CP}$ in the PMNS matrix is predicted as $\delta_{CP}\simeq 192^\circ - 195^\circ$ which can be tested in the near future experiments. We also discuss the effective mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ responsible for the neutrino-less double beta decay of nucleus, which is predicted as $m_{\beta\beta} \simeq 8-11$\,meV. We consider the leptogenesis and confirm that our model generates the right sign of the baryon asymmetry if the first family right-handed neutrino is the lightest among the heavy right-handed neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Neutrino mass and ultralight dark matter mass from the Higgs mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a model in which small neutrino masses are generated via Yukawa coupling to a self-interacting ultralight dark matter (ULDM) field, treated as a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson associated with a heavy Higgs-like field. ULDM has a mass \( m \gtrsim 10^{-22}~\text{eV} \) and a characteristic energy scale \( \tilde{m} \simeq 10~\text{eV} \). The resulting neutrino mass, as well as the mass and self-interaction strength of ULDM, align with cosmological observations. A quantum stability condition for an ULDM effective potential demands a small mass for neutrinos roughly bounded by $\tilde{m}$. The phase transition temperature for the Higgs mechanism can approach the grand unified theory (GUT) scale, potentially inducing the electroweak scale by reverting the type I seesaw mechanism for Majonara neutrinos. In this framework, neutrino masses can vary with spacetime, a feature that may be experimentally detectable through neutrino oscillation experiments. We also explore a scenario in which the tiny ULDM mass arises through radiative corrections via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism, beginning from a massless field theory.
  Our model addresses both the neutrino mass and ULDM mass puzzles through a unified approach, providing insights into possible extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Can a pseudoscalar with a mass of 365 GeV in two-Higgs-doublet models explain the CMS $t\bar{t}$ excess?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the recently reported $t\bar{t}$ excess by the CMS Collaboration within the framework of conventional Two-Higgs-Doublet Models (2HDMs). Considering all four types (I, II, X, and Y), we perform a comprehensive parameter space scan using the best-fit values for a pseudoscalar boson $A$: $M_A = 365$ GeV, $\Gamma_A/M_A = 2\%$, and $\tan\beta = 1.28$. Theoretical requirements and experimental constraints are systematically applied, including conditions from a bounded-below scalar potential, vacuum stability, unitarity, perturbativity, Flavor-Changing Neutral Currents (FCNCs), and direct searches at high-energy colliders. Our analysis shows that perturbativity imposes upper bounds of around 723 GeV on $M_{H^\pm}$ and $M_H$. FCNC constraints exclude all viable parameter space in Types II and Y, while a small region persists in Types I and X, but this region is ultimately ruled out by recent $t\bar{t} Z$ measurements by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the LHC. We conclude that conventional 2HDMs alone cannot accommodate a pseudoscalar boson that explains the observed $t\bar{t}$ excess within viable parameter space. However, incorporating toponium effects in the background fit could potentially alter this conclusion.</description>

      <title>Exploring multi-step electroweak phase transitions in the 2HDM+$\boldsymbol{a}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15975v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiple electroweak phase transitions occurring sequentially in the early universe can give rise to intriguing phenomenology, compared to the typical single-step electroweak phase transition. In this work, we investigate this scenario within the framework of the two-Higgs-doublet model with a pseudoscalar, utilizing the complete one-loop finite-temperature effective potential. After considering relevant experimental and theoretical constraints, we identify four distinct types of phase transitions. In the first case, only the configuration of the CP-even Higgs acquires a non-zero value via a first-order or a cross-over electroweak phase transition, leading to electroweak symmetry breaking. In the remaining three cases, the pseudoscalar fields can obtain vacuum expectation values at different phases of the multi-step phase transition process, leading to spontaneous breaking of the CP symmetry. As the temperature decreases, the phase shifts to the vacuum observed today via first-order electroweak phase transition, at this point, the vacuum expectation value of the pseudoscalar field returns to zero, restoring the CP symmetry. Finally, we compare the transition strength and the stochastic gravitational wave background generated in the four situations along with the projected detection limits.</description>

      <title>Probing long-lived doubly charged scalar in the Georgi-Machacek model at the LHC and in far detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Searching for long-lived particles (LLPs) beyond the Standard Model (SM) is a promising direction in collider experiments. The Georgi-Machacek (GM) model extends the scalar sector in the SM by introducing various new scalar bosons. In this study, we focus on the parameter space that allows the light doubly charged scalar to become long-lived. This light doubly charged scalar is fermophobic and predominantly decays into a pair of on-shell or off-shell same-sign $W$ bosons. We investigate three types of signal signatures at the LHC: displaced vertices in the inner tracking detector, displaced showers in the muon system, and heavy stable charged particles. Additionally, we analyze the potential for detecting such doubly charged scalars in far detectors, including ANUBIS, MATHUSLA, FACET, FASER, CODEX-b, MoEDAL-MAPP and AL3X. By combining the LLP searches at the LHC and in far detectors, we project that the limits on the mixing angle, $\theta_H$, (between the doublet and triplets) can cover most of the parameter space with $\sin\theta_H\lesssim 10^{-3}$ for the mass range of long-lived doubly charged scalars between $50$ GeV to $180$ GeV, assuming the full integrated luminosity at the LHC and HL-LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21850v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If a neutrino or antineutrino produced in the decay of an unstable particle is not entangled to its accompanying particles, its mass is necessarily correlated with its momentum. In this note, I illustrate this entanglement would destroy the quantum coherence between the neutrino's mass eigenstates in both the momentum and position representations, which was overlooked by other authors in previous investigations of entanglement and coherence associated with neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven results for light-quark connected and strange-plus-disconnected hadronic $g-2$ short- and long-distance windows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key issue affecting the attempt to reduce the uncertainty on the Standard Model prediction for the muon anomalous magnetic moment is the current discrepancy between lattice-QCD and data-driven results for the hadronic vacuum polarization. Progress on this issue benefits from precise data-driven determinations of the isospin-limit light-quark-connected (lqc) and strange-plus-light-quark-disconnected (s+lqd) components of the related RBC/UKQCD windows. In this paper, using a strategy employed previously for the intermediate window, we provide data-driven results for the lqc and s+lqd components of the short- and long-distance RBC/UKQCD windows. Comparing these results with those from the lattice, we find significant discrepancies in the lqc parts but good agreement for the s+lqd components. We also explore the impact of recent CMD-3 $e^+e^-\to \pi^+\pi^-$ cross-section results, demonstrating that an upward shift in the $\rho$-peak region of the type seen in the CMD-3 data serves to eliminate the discrepancies for the lqc components without compromising the good agreement between lattice and data-driven s+lqd results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we look at the current bounds on the coupling strength of axion-like particles (ALPs) with two photons in the context of the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We relate the coupling strength to the compactification radius that governs the size of the extra dimension in the RS warped geometry model and show how the current bounds on the ALP can be used to derive appropriate constraints on the size of the extra fifth dimension in the RS model. We show that the resulting constraints fail to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem for light/ultralight ALPs and require a massive ALP of at least $m_{a} \gtrsim 0.1$ [GeV] to be relevant in the context of the hierarchy problem when the gauge field is in the bulk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a first ab-initio calculation of the $\pi^0$, $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors performed with physical light-quark masses. We provide a complete parametrization of the form factors that includes both single and double-virtual kinematics. Our results are compared with experimental measurements of the form factors in the space-like region and with the measured two-photon decay widths. In a second step, our parametrizations of the transition form factors are used to compute the dominant pseudoscalar-pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon $g-2$. Our final result reads $a_{\mu}^{\rm hlbl, ps-pole} = (85.1 \pm 5.2) \times 10^{-11}$. Although the pion-pole is dominant, we confirm that, together, the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ provide roughly half of its contribution.</description>

      <title>Bubble velocities and oscillon precursors in first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable `false' vacuum states are an important feature of the Standard Model of particle physics and many theories beyond it. Describing the dynamics of a phase transition out of a false vacuum via the nucleation of bubbles is essential for understanding the cosmology of vacuum decay and the full spectrum of observables. In this paper, we study vacuum decay by numerically evolving ensembles of field theories in 1+1 dimensions from a metastable state. We demonstrate that for an initial Bose-Einstein distribution of fluctuations, bubbles form with a Gaussian spread of center-of-mass velocities and that bubble nucleation events are preceded by an oscillon -- a long-lived, time-dependent, pseudo-stable configuration of the field. Defining an effective temperature from the long-wavelength amplitude of fluctuations in the ensemble of simulations, we find good agreement between theoretical finite temperature predictions and empirical measurements of the decay rate, velocity distribution and critical bubble solution. We comment on the generalization of our results and the implications for cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Post-Newtonian effects in compact binaries with a dark matter spike: A Lagrangian approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the Lagrangian method to study the post-Newtonian evolution of a compact binary system with environmental effects, including a dark matter spike, and obtain the resulting gravitational wave emission. This formalism allows one to incorporate post-Newtonian effects up to any desired known order, as well as any other environmental effect around the binary, as long as their dissipation power or force formulae are known. In particular, in this work, we employ this method to study a black hole--black hole binary system of mass ratio $10^5$ by including post-Newtonian effects of order 1PN and 2.5PN, as well as the effect of relativistic dynamical friction. We obtain the modified orbits and the corresponding modified gravitational waveform. Finally, we contrast these modifications against the LISA sensitivity curve in frequency space and show that this observatory can detect the associated signals.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly-interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction, evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important first step for our deeper understanding of an important relation to a strongly-interacting mesoscopic Bose polaron problem.</description>

      <title>Weak equivalence principle and nonrelativistic limit of general dispersion relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the weak equivalence principle in the context of modified dispersion relations, a prevalent approach to quantum gravity phenomenology. We find that generic modified dispersion relations violate the weak equivalence principle. The acceleration in general depends on the mass of the test body, unless the Hamiltonian is either two-homogeneous in the test particles' 4-momenta or the corresponding Lagrangian differs from the homogeneous case by a total derivative only. The key ingredient of this calculation is a $3+1$ decomposition of the parametrization invariant relativistic test particle action derived from the dispersion relation. Additionally, we apply a perturbative expansion in the test particle's spatial velocity and the inverse speed of light. To quantify our result, we provide a general formula for the E\"otv\'os factor of modified dispersion relations. As a specific example, we study the point-particle motion determined from the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e dispersion relation in the bicrossproduct basis. Comparing the ensuing non-vanishing E\"otv\'os factor to recent data from the MICROSCOPE experiment, we obtain a bound of the model parameter $\hat{\Xi} {}^{-1}\geq10^{15}{\rm GeV}/c^2$.</description>

Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We demonstrate that while some of these observables are more sensitive to transport properties than traditional flow observables, others are less sensitive, making them suitable for studying different stages of the evolution.</description>

      <title>Prospects for cosmological research with the FAST array: 21-cm intensity mapping survey observation strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise cosmological measurements are essential for understanding the evolution of the universe and the nature of dark energy. The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST), the most sensitive single-dish radio telescope, has the potential to provide the precise cosmological measurements through neutral hydrogen 21-cm intensity mapping sky survey. This paper primarily explores the potential of technological upgrades for FAST in cosmology. The most crucial upgrade begins with equipping FAST with a wide-band receiver ($0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5$). This upgrade can enable FAST to achieve higher precision in cosmological parameter estimation than the Square Kilometre Array Phase-1 Mid frequency. On this basis, expanding to a FAST array (FASTA) consisting of six identical FASTs would offer significant improvements in precision compared to FAST. Additionally, compared with the current results from the data combination of cosmic microwave background, baryon acoustic oscillations (optical galaxy surveys), and type Ia supernovae, FASTA can provide comparable constraints. Specifically, for the dark-energy equation-of-state parameters, FASTA can achieve $\sigma(w_0) = 0.09$ and $\sigma(w_a) = 0.33$.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of recent DESI and Type Ia supernovae data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$, with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag and $H_0$ the Hubble constant. Breaking the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy with the SH0ES prior on $H_0$, the significance of the tension between our non-parametric determination of $r_d=136.20^{+2.20}_{-2.40}\,{\text{Mpc}}$ and the \textit{Planck} $\Lambda$CDM-based determination is at the $5\sigma$ level, slightly lower than the $6\sigma$ obtained when adopting the older SDSS dataset in place of DESI. This indicates the persistence at very high significance of the ``sound horizon tension'', reinforcing the need for pre-recombination new physics. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>A universal implementation of radiative effects in neutrino event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the similarities between electron-nucleus ($eA$) and neutrino-nucleus scattering ($\nu A$), $eA$ data can contribute key information to improve cross-section modeling in $eA$ and hence in $\nu A$ event generators. However, to compare data and generated events, either the data must be radiatively corrected or radiative effects need to be included in the event generators. We implemented a universal radiative corrections program that can be used with all reaction mechanisms and any $eA$ event generator. Our program includes real photon radiation by the incident and scattered electrons, and virtual photon exchange and photon vacuum polarization diagrams. It uses the ``extended peaking" approximation for electron radiation and neglects charged hadron radiation. This method, validated with GENIE, can also be extended to simulate $\nu A$ radiative effects. This work facilitates data-event-generator comparisons used to improve $\nu A$ event generators for the next-generation of neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Updated Cosmological Constraints in Extended Parameter Space with Planck PR4, DESI Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Supernovae: Dynamical Dark Energy, Neutrino Masses, Lensing Anomaly, and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on cosmological parameters in a 12-parameter model, extending the standard six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM by including dynamical dark energy (DE: $w_0$, $w_a$), the sum of neutrino masses ($\sum m_{\nu}$), the effective number of non-photon radiation species ($N_{\rm eff}$), the lensing amplitude scaling ($A_{\rm lens}$), and the running of the scalar spectral index ($\alpha_s$). For CMB data, we use the Planck PR4 (2020) HiLLiPoP and LoLLiPoP likelihoods, Planck PR4+ACT DR6 lensing, and Planck 2018 low-$l$ TT likelihoods, along with DESI DR1 BAO and Pantheon+ and DESY5 uncalibrated type Ia Supernovae (SNe) likelihoods. Key findings are the following: i) Contrary to DESI results, CMB+BAO+Pantheon+ data include a cosmological constant within $2\sigma$, while CMB+BAO+DESY5 excludes it at over $2\sigma$, indicating the dynamical nature of dark energy is not yet robust. Potential systematics in the DESY5 sample may drive this exclusion. ii) Some data combinations show a $1\sigma$+ detection of non-zero $\sum m_{\nu}$, indicating possible future detection. We also provide a robust upper bound of $\sum m_{\nu} \lesssim 0.3$ eV (95% confidence limit (C.L.)). iii) With CMB+BAO+SNe, $A_{\rm lens} = 1$ is included at $2\sigma$ (albeit not at $1\sigma$), indicating no significant lensing anomaly in this extended cosmology with Planck PR4 likelihoods. iv) The Hubble tension persists at $3.2$ to $3.9\sigma$, suggesting these simple extensions do not resolve it. v) The $S_8$ tension with DES Year 3 weak lensing is reduced to $1.4\sigma$, likely due to additional parameters and the Planck PR4 likelihoods.</description>

      <title>Comparing effective temperatures in standard, Tsallis, and q-dual statistics from transverse momentum spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold collisions at RHIC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified light charged hadrons produced in gold--gold (Au+Au) collisions across various centrality classes at center-of-mass energies per nucleon pair, $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from 7.7 to 200 GeV, as measured by the STAR Collaboration at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The analysis employs standard (Bose-Einstein/Fermi-Dirac), Tsallis, and q-dual statistics to fit the same $p_T$ spectra and derive distinct effective temperatures: $T_{\text{Standard}}$, $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$, and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$. In most instances, there exists an approximately linear relationship or positive correlation between $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, as well as between $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ and $T_{\text{Standard}}$, when considering $T_{\text{Standard}}$ as a baseline. However, while both $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ and $T_{\text{q-dual}}$ increase from semi-central to central Au+Au collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, where QGP is expected, changes in $T_{\text{Standard}}$ occur more gradually. This work suggests that $T_{\text{Standard}}$ is better suited for characterizing phase transitions between hadronic matter and QGP compared to $T_{\text{Tsallis}}$ or $T_{\text{q-dual}}$, primarily due to the considerations related to entropy index in the Tsallis and q-dual statistics.</description>
