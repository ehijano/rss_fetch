      <title>Variational (Energy-Based) Spectral Learning: A Machine Learning Framework for Solving Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce variational spectral learning (VSL), a machine learning framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) that operates directly in the coefficient space of spectral expansions. VSL offers a principled bridge between variational PDE theory, spectral discretization, and contemporary machine learning practice. The core idea is to recast a given PDE \[ \mathcal{L}u = f \quad \text{in} \quad Q=\Omega\times(0,T), \] together with boundary and initial conditions, into differentiable space--time energies built from strong-form least-squares residuals and weak (Galerkin) formulations. The solution is represented as a finite spectral expansion \[ u_N(x,t)=\sum_{n=1}^{N} c_n\,\phi_n(x,t), \] where $\phi_n$ are tensor-product Chebyshev bases in space and time, with Dirichlet-satisfying spatial modes enforcing homogeneous boundary conditions analytically. This yields a compact linear parameterization in the coefficient vector $\mathbf{c}$, while all PDE complexity is absorbed into the variational energy. We show how to construct strong-form and weak-form space-time functionals, augment them with initial-condition and Tikhonov regularization terms, and minimize the resulting objective with gradient-based optimization. In practice, VSL is implemented in TensorFlow using automatic differentiation and Keras cosine-decay-with-restarts learning-rate schedules, enabling robust optimization of moderately sized coefficient vectors. Numerical experiments on benchmark elliptic and parabolic problems, including one- and two-dimensional Poisson, diffusion, and Burgers-type equations, demonstrate that VSL attains accuracy comparable to classical spectral collocation with Crank-Nicolson time stepping, while providing a differentiable objective suitable for modern optimization tooling.</description>

      <title>On well-posed energy/entropy stable boundary conditions for the rotating shallow water equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive and analyze well-posed, energy- and entropy-stable boundary conditions (BCs) for the two-dimensional linear and nonlinear rotating shallow water equations (RSWE) in vector invariant form. The focus of the study is on subcritical flows, which are commonly observed in atmospheric, oceanic, and geostrophic flow applications. We consider spatial domains with smooth boundaries and formulate both linear and nonlinear BCs using mass flux, Riemann's invariants, and Bernoulli's potential, ensuring that the resulting initial boundary value problem (IBVP) is provably entropy- and energy-stable. The linear analysis is comprehensive, providing sufficient conditions to establish the existence, uniqueness, and energy stability of solutions to the linear IBVP. For the nonlinear IBVP, which admits more general solutions, our goal is to develop nonlinear BCs that guarantee entropy stability. We introduce the concepts of linear consistency and linear stability for nonlinear IBVPs, demonstrating that if a nonlinear IBVP is both linearly consistent and linearly stable, then, for sufficiently regular initial and boundary data over a finite time interval, a unique smooth solution exists. Both the linear and nonlinear IBVPs can be efficiently solved using high-order accurate numerical methods. By employing high-order summation-by-parts operators to discretize spatial derivatives and implementing weak enforcement of BCs via penalty techniques, we develop provably energy- and entropy-stable numerical schemes on curvilinear meshes. Extensive numerical experiments are presented to verify the accuracy of the methods and to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed BCs and numerical schemes.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Energy-Conserving Methods for the Hyperbolized Serre-Green-Naghdi Equations in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop energy-conserving numerical methods for a two-dimensional hyperbolic approximation of the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations with variable bathymetry for both periodic and reflecting boundary conditions. The hyperbolic formulation avoids the costly inversion of an elliptic operator present in the classical model. Our schemes combine split forms with summation-by-parts (SBP) operators to construct semidiscretizations that conserve the total water mass and the total energy. We provide analytical proofs of these conservation properties and also verify them numerically. While the framework is general, our implementation focuses on second-order finite-difference SBP operators. The methods are implemented in Julia for CPU and GPU architectures (AMD and NVIDIA) and achieve substantial speedups on modern accelerators. We validate the approach through convergence studies based on solitary-wave and manufactured-solution tests, and by comparisons to analytical, experimental, and existing numerical results. All source code to reproduce our results is available online.</description>

      <title>A Schr\"odinger-Based Dispersive Regularization Approach for Numerical Simulation of One-Dimensional Shallow Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel dispersive regularization framework for the numerical simulation of the one-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE). The classical hyperbolic system is regularized by a third-order dispersive term in the momentum equation, which renders the system equivalent, via the Madelung transform, to a defocusing cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a drift term induced by bottom topography.
  Instead of solving the shallow water equations directly, we solve the associated Schr\"odinger equation and recover the hydrodynamic variables through a simple postprocessing procedure. This approach transforms the original nonlinear hyperbolic system into a semilinear complex-valued equation, which can be efficiently approximated using a Strang time-splitting method combined with a spectral element discretization in space.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in subcritical regimes without shock formation, the Schr\"odinger regularization provides an $O(\varepsilon)$ approximation to the classical shallow water solution, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the regularization parameter. Importantly, we observe that this convergence behavior persists even in the presence of moving wetting--drying interfaces, where vacuum states emerge and standard shallow water solvers often encounter difficulties. These results suggest that the Schr\"odinger-based formulation offers a robust and promising alternative framework for the numerical simulation of shallow water flows with dry states.</description>

      <title>Volumetric locking-free Mixed Virtual Element Methods for Contact Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of the 2D frictionless contact problem in elasticity using the Virtual Element Methods (VEMs). To overcome the volumetric locking phenomenon in the nearly incompressible case, we adopt a mixed displacement/pressure ($u/p$) variational formulation, where pressure is introduced as an independent unknown. We present the VEM discretization and develop a general error analysis, keeping explicit track of the constants involved in the error estimates, thus allowing to consider meshes with "small edges". As examples, we consider two possible VEM schemes: a first-order scheme and a second-order scheme. The numerical results confirm the theoretical predictions, specifically both schemes show: 1) robustness with respect to the volumetric parameter $\lambda$, thus preventing the occurrence of the volumetric locking phenomenon; 2) good behavior even in the presence of "small edges"; 3) achievement of the expected theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>A Derivative-Free Saddle-search Algorithm With Linear Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a derivative-free saddle-search algorithm designed to locate transition states using only function evaluations. The algorithm employs a nested architecture consisting of an inner eigenvector search and an outer saddle-point search. Through rigorous numerical analysis, we prove the almost sure convergence of the inner step under suitable assumptions. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of the outer search using a decaying step size, while demonstrating linear convergence under constant step size and boundedness conditions. Numerical experiments are provided to validate our theoretical results and demonstrate the algorithm's practical applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a linear and partitioned finite element method for fluid-shell interactions under the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework. We adopt the P1-bubble/P1/P1 elements for the fluid velocity, pressure, and structure velocity, respectively. We show the stability and error estimates of the scheme without assuming infinitesimal structural deformation nor neglecting fluid convection effects. The theoretical convergence rate is further corroborated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To numerically solve a generic elliptic equation on two-dimensional domains with rectangular Cartesian grids, we propose a cut-cell geometric multigrid method that features (1) general algorithmic steps that apply to all forms of elliptic equations and all types of boundary conditions, (2) the versatility of handling both regular and irregular domains with arbitrarily complex topology and geometry, (3) the fourth-order accuracy even at the presence of ${\cal C}^1$ discontinuities on the domain boundary, and (4) the optimal complexity of $O(h^{-2})$. Test results demonstrate the generality, accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and excellent conditioning of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Registration methods in bounded domains have received significant attention in the model reduction literature, as a valuable tool for nonlinear approximation. The aim of this work is to provide a concise yet complete overview of relevant results for registration methods in $n$-dimensional domains, from the perspective of parametric model reduction. We present a thorough analysis of two classes of methods, vector flows and compositional maps: we discuss the enforcement of the bijectivity constraint and we comment on the approximation properties of the two methods, for Lipschitz $n$-dimensional domains.</description>

      <title>Pretrain Finite Element Method: A Pretraining and Warm-start Framework for PDEs via Physics-Informed Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a Pretrained Finite Element Method (PFEM),a physics driven framework that bridges the efficiency of neural operator learning with the accuracy and robustness of classical finite element methods (FEM). PFEM consists of a physics informed pretraining stage and an optional finetuning stage. In the pretraining stage, a neural operator based on the Transolver architecture is trained solely from governing partial differential equations, without relying on labeled solution data. The model operates directly on unstructured point clouds, jointly encoding geometric information, material properties, and boundary conditions, and produces physically consistent initial solutions with extremely high computational efficiency. PDE constraints are enforced through explicit finite element, based differentiation, avoiding the overhead associated with automatic differentiation. In the fine-tuning stage, the pretrained prediction is used as an initial guess for conventional FEM solvers, preserving their accuracy, convergence guarantees, and extrapolation capability while substantially reducing the number of iterations required to reach a prescribed tolerance. PFEM is validated on a broad range of benchmark problems, including linear elasticity and nonlinear hyperelasticity with complex geometries, heterogeneous materials, and arbitrary boundary conditions. Numerical results demonstrate strong generalization in the pretraining stage with relative errors on the order of 1\%, and speedups of up to one order of magnitude in the fine-tuning stage compared to FEM with zero initial guesses.</description>

      <title>Stability, convergence, and geometric properties of second-order-in-time space-time discretizations for linear and semilinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit second-order-in-time space-time discretizations of the linear and semilinear wave equations by establishing precise equivalences with first-order-in-time formulations. Focusing on schemes using continuous piecewise-polynomial trial functions in time, we analyze their stability, convergence, and geometric properties. We consider first a weak space-time formulation with test functions projected onto discontinuous polynomials of one degree lower in time, showing that it is equivalent to the scheme proposed in [French, Peterson 1996] in the linear case, and extended in [Karakashian, Makridakis 2005] to the semilinear case. In particular, this equivalence shows that this method conserves energy at mesh nodes but is not symplectic. We then introduce two symplectic variants, obtained through Gauss-Legendre and Gauss-Lobatto quadratures in time, and show that they correspond to specific Runge-Kutta time integrators. These connections clarify the geometric structure of the space-time methods considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the effects of electric charge on the dynamics of drug transport and absorption in subcutaneous injections of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). We develop a novel mathematical and computational model, based on the Nernst-Planck equations and porous media flow theory, to investigate the complex interactions between mAbs and charged species in subcutaneous tissue. The model enables us to study short-term transport dynamics and long-term binding and absorption for two mAbs with different electric properties. We examine the influence of buffer pH, body mass index, injection depth, and formulation concentration on drug distribution and compare our numerical results with experimental data from the literature.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Model for Solving Lane-Emden Equation using Legendre Wavelet Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we know differential equations are very useful for electrical engineers to solve a variety of problems like: voltage across a capacitor, input versus output voltage, etc. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to find the solutions of non-linear differential equations based on the Lane Emden equation of second order using the Legendre wavelet neural network (LWNN) method. Here all the considered equations are singular initial value problems. To manage the singularity challenge, we have employed an artificial neural network method. This approach utilizes a neural network of a single layer, where the hidden layer is omitted by enlarging the input using Legendre wavelets functions. We have applied a feed-forward neural network method to the proposed problem along with the principle of error backpropagation. The effectiveness of the Legendre wavelet Neural Network method is validated through Lane Emden equations..</description>

      <title>On discrete Sobolev inequalities for nonconforming finite elements under a semi-regular mesh condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a discrete $ L^q-L^p$ Sobolev inequality tailored for the Crouzeix--Raviart and discontinuous Crouzeix--Raviart finite element spaces on anisotropic meshes in both two and three dimensions. Subject to a semi-regular mesh condition, this discrete Sobolev inequality is applicable to all pairs $(q,p)$ that align with the local Sobolev embedding, including scenarios where $q \leq p$. Importantly, the constant is influenced solely by the domain and the semi-regular parameter, ensuring robustness against variations in aspect ratios and interior angles of the mesh. The proof employs an anisotropy-sensitive trace inequality that leverages the element height, a two-step affine/Piola mapping approach, the stability of the Raviart--Thomas interpolation, and a discrete integration-by-parts identity augmented with weighted jump/trace terms on faces. This Sobolev inequality serves as a mesh-robust foundation for the stability and error analysis of nonconforming and discontinuous Galerkin methods on highly anisotropic meshes.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Genetic Interacting Particle Method for Reaction-Diffusion-Advection Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a stochastic genetic interacting particle method (SGIP) for reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equations. The SGIP method employs operator splitting to approximate the advection-diffusion and reaction processes, treating the former using particle drift-diffusion and the latter via exact or implicit integration of reaction dynamics over bins, where particle density is estimated using a histogram. A key innovation is the incorporation of adaptive resampling to close the loop of particle and density field description of solutions, mimicking the selection mechanism in genetics. Resampling is also crucial for maintaining long-term stability by redistributing particles in accordance with the evolving density field. We provide a comprehensive error analysis and establish convergence bounds under appropriate regularity assumptions. Numerical experiments in one to three space dimensions demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various reaction types (Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov (FKPP), cubic, Arrhenius) and flow configurations (shear, cellular, cat's eye, Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) flows), showing excellent agreement with the finite difference method (FDM) while offering computational advantages for complex flow geometries and higher-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>A Cartesian Cut-Cell Two-Fluid Method for Two-Phase Diffusion Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Cartesian cut-cell finite-volume method for sharp-interface two-phase diffusion problems in static geometries. The formulation follows a two-fluid approach: independent diffusion equations are discretized in each phase on a fixed Cartesian grid, while the phases are coupled through embedded interface conditions enforcing continuity of diffusive flux and a general jump law. Cut cells are treated by integrating the governing equations over phase-restricted control volumes and surfaces, yielding discrete divergence and gradient operators that are locally conservative within each phase. Interface coupling is achieved by introducing a small set of interfacial unknowns per cut cell on the embedded boundary; the resulting algebraic system involves only bulk and interfacial averages. A key feature of the method is the use of a reduced set of geometric information based solely on low-order moments (trimmed volumes, apertures and interface measures/centroids), allowing robust implementation without constructing explicitly cut-cell polytopes. The method supports steady (Poisson) and unsteady (diffusion) regimes and incorporates Dirichlet, Neumann, Robin boundary conditions and general jumps. We validate the scheme on one-, two- and three-dimensional single-phase and two-phase benchmarks, including curved embedded boundaries, Robin conditions and strong property/jump contrasts. The results demonstrate a superlinear convergence behavior, sharp enforcement of interfacial laws and excellent conservation properties. Extensions to moving interfaces and Stefan-type free-boundary problems are natural perspectives of this framework.</description>

      <title>A split-step Christov method for approximating rational PDE solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rational solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) are notoriously difficult to approximate via spectral Fourier methods due to their algebraically slow decay rate. In this work we discuss approximating rational PDE solutions in a basis of orthogonal functions known as the Fourier series, allowing for the computation of its spectrum via the fast Fourier transform. Spectral differentiation matrices are derived. Several explicit fourth-order split-step integrators are derived and their performance compared. As an application, rogue wave solutions in a family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations are explored. Perturbing the constant background is found to generate rogue wave-like structures. The effects of higher-order dispersion and generalized nonlinearities are also examined.</description>

      <title>TTrace: Lightweight Error Checking and Diagnosis for Distributed Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed training is essential for scaling the training of large neural network models, such as large language models (LLMs), across thousands of GPUs. However, the complexity of distributed training programs makes them particularly prone to silent bugs, which do not produce explicit error signals but lead to incorrect training outcomes. Effectively detecting and localizing such silent bugs in distributed training is challenging. Common debugging practices based on monitoring training loss or gradient norm curves are indirect, inefficient, and provide no way to localize bugs. To address those challenges, we design and implement TTrace, the first systematic differential testing system for detecting and localizing silent bugs in distributed training. TTrace aligns intermediate tensors from distributed training with those from a trusted reference implementation. To properly compare the floating-point values in the corresponding tensors, we propose a novel mathematical analysis that provides a guideline for setting tolerances, enabling TTrace to distinguish bug-induced errors from numerical errors. Experimental results demonstrate that TTrace effectively detects 11 existing bugs and 3 new bugs in the widely used Megatron-LM framework, while requiring fewer than 10 lines of code changes. TTrace is effective in various training recipes, including low-precision recipes involving BF16 and FP8. Notably, a popular open-source training framework has already adopted the method proposed by TTrace in its development workflow.</description>

      <title>Geometric integrators for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A variational formulation for non-equilibrium thermodynamics was developed by Gay-Balmaz and Yoshimura. In a recent article, the first two authors of the present paper introduced partially cosymplectic structures as a geometric framework for thermodynamic systems, recovering the evolution equations obtained variationally. In this paper, we develop a discrete variational principle for adiabatically closed simple thermodynamic systems, which can be utilised to construct numerical integrators for the dynamics of such systems. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>A Trust-region Funnel Algorithm for Grey-Box Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grey-box optimisation, where some parts of an optimisation problem are represented by explicit algebraic (glass-box) models while others are treated as black-box models lacking analytic derivatives, remains a challenge in process systems engineering. Trust-region (TR) methods provide a robust framework for grey-box problems by combining accurate glass-box derivatives with local reduced models (RMs) for black-box components. However, existing TR approaches often involve complex multi-layered formulations requiring extensive parameter tuning, or lack open-source implementations. Motivated by the recent advances in funnel-based convergence theory for nonlinear optimisation and the TR filter method, we propose a novel TR funnel algorithm for grey-box optimisation that replaces the filter acceptance criterion with a generalisable uni-dimensional funnel, maintaining a monotonically non-increasing upper bound on approximation error of the local black-box RMs. A global convergence proof to a first-order critical point is established. The algorithm, implemented in an open-source Pyomo framework, supports multiple RM forms and globalisation strategies (filter or funnel). Benchmark tests on seven numerical and engineering problems show that the TR funnel algorithm achieves comparable and often improved performance relative to the classical TR filter method. The TR funnel method thus provides a simpler, and extensible alternative for large-scale grey-box optimisation.</description>
