      <title>The generalized adiabatic theorem for extended lattice systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an adiabatic theorem for infinitely extended lattice fermion systems with gapped ground states, allowing perturbations that may close the gap. The Heisenberg dynamics on the CAR-algebra is generated by a time dependent two-parameter family of Hamiltonians $H^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t=\eta^{-1}(H_t+\varepsilon(H^1_t+V_t))$, where $H_t$ is assumed to have a gapped ground state $\omega_t$, $\eta \in (0,1]$ is the adiabatic parameter and $ \varepsilon \in [0,1]$ controls the strength of the perturbation. We construct a quasi-local dressing transformation $\beta^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t=\exp(i \mathcal{L}_{S^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t})$ that yields super-adiabatic states $\omega^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t =\omega_t \circ \beta^{\varepsilon,\eta}_t$ which, when tested against local observables, solve the corresponding time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation up to errors asymptotically smaller than any power of $\eta$ and $\varepsilon$. The construction is local in space and time, does not assume uniqueness of the ground state, and works under super-polynomial decay of the interactions $H_t$ and $H_t^1$ rather than exponential decay. If the Hamiltonian is time-independent on an interval, the dressed state is $\eta$-independent and forms a non-equilibrium almost-stationary state with lifetime of order $\varepsilon^{-\infty}$. The result provides a rigorous basis for linear response to macroscopic changes in gapped systems, including a proof of Ohm's law for macroscopic Hall currents.</description>

      <title>New Best-Known Max-Cut Solution for the G63 Instance in the G-Set Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over two decades, the G-set benchmark has remained a cornerstone challenge for combinatorial optimization solvers. Remarkably, it continues to yield new best-known solutions even to the present day. Here, we report a new best-known Max-Cut of 27,047 for the 7000-node G63 instance-one of the two instances in the benchmark with the largest number of edges. This result is achieved using an optimized Population Annealing Monte Carlo framework, augmented with adaptive control of stochasticity and the periodic introduction of non-local moves, and accelerated on a GPU platform.</description>

      <title>Ground state energy of a dilute inhomogeneous Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the ground state energy of a system of N fermions with two spin states in the large N limit. The particles are placed in an inhomogeneous trapping potential and interact via scaled interactions. We study a dilute limit where the range of the interaction potential is much smaller than the typical inter-particle distance. We show that the energy per particle converges to the Thomas-Fermi energy of the system, with a perturbative term corresponding tot he interaction and exhibiting the scattering length of the potential. The proof is decomposed into two bounds. First, we construct an appropriate test-state to prove the upper bound. Then, we prove the lower bound by the Dyson lemma, which allows us to regularize the interaction potential, and several semi-classical tools.</description>

      <title>Projective limits in Euclidean quantum field theory, II: Abelian gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two constructions of continuum and thermodynamic limits of Abelian polyhedral gauge theories in arbitrary spacetime dimension. The first construction relies on the existence of projective systems of heat kernel measures, while the second involves an infinite dimensional heat kernel measure defined using projective limit of Hilbert spaces. As a special case, we obtain a model of Abelian gauge theory on the infinite cubical lattice, which, in contrast to the standard one, is massless for arbitrary values of the coupling parameter.</description>

      <title>Quantum Difference Equations for Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider quantum difference equation (QDE) for equivariant quantum K-theory of the Grassmannian. In this paper we obtain a solution to the QDE and use the solution to asymptotically derive the Bethe ansatz equations. In the limit, we obtain similar results for the cohomological analogue. For both cases, we describe the nonequivariant solutions as well. As an application, we identify the quantum K-theory ring of $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$ with a quantum 5 vertex XXZ integrable spin chain.</description>

      <title>A Probability Space at Inception of Stochastic Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, progress has been made in the theory of turbulence, which provides a framework on how a deterministic process changes to a stochastic one owing to the change in thermodynamic states. It is well known that, in the framework of Newtonian mechanics, motions are dissipative; however, when subjected to periodic motion, a system can produce nondissipative motions intermittently and subject to resonance. It is in resonance that turbulence occurs in fluid flow, solid vibration, thermal transport, etc. In this, the findings from these physical systems are analyzed in the framework of statistics with their own probability space to establish their compliance to the stochastic process. In particular, a systematic alignment of the inception of the stochastic process with the signed measure theory, signed probability space, and stochastic process was investigated. It was found that the oscillatory load from the dissipative state excited the system and resulted in a quasi-periodic probability density function with the negative probability regimes. In addition, the vectorial nature of the random velocity splits the probability density function along both the positive and negative axes with slight asymmetricity. By assuming that a deterministic process has a probability of 1, we can express the inception of a stochastic process, and the subsequent benefit is that a dynamic fractal falls on the probability density function. Moreover, we leave some questions of inconsistency between the physical system and the measurement theory for future investigation. We believe that the establishment of the probability density function of resonance nondissipative dynamics in contemporary statistics should make many mathematical tools available and the analytical formulas for the random velocity and probability density function can provide a convenient platform for the development of statistics.</description>

      <title>A Universal Chern Model on Arbitrary Triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a triangulation of a closed orientable surface, we consider the lattice with sites at the vertices, edges and facets of the triangulation. Borrowing from mathematics literature, we introduce on this lattice a pair of tight-binding Hamiltonians derived from the boundary and Poincar\'e duality maps of finite simplicial manifolds. These Hamiltonians have been proved to have clean topological spectral gaps carrying non-trivial Chern numbers in the limit of infinite refinement of the triangulation. We confirm this via numerical simulations, and demonstrate how these models enable topological edge modes at the surfaces of real-world objects. Furthermore, we describe a metamaterial whose dynamics reproduces that of the proposed model, thus bringing the topological metamaterials closer to real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Convex Optimization Approach to the Discrete Hanging Chain Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the discrete version of the classical hanging chain problem. We generalize the problem, by allowing for arbitrary mass and length of each link. We show that the shape of the chain can be obtained by solving a convex optimization problem. Then we use optimality conditions to show that the problem can be further reduced to solving a single non-linear equation, when the links of the chain have symmetric mass and length.</description>

      <title>Compact binary system dynamics at the second post-Newtonian order: analytical formula of the coordinate time for eccentric and circular orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is based on the letter Phys. Lett. B, 865, 139484 (2025), where we developed the analytical expression of the coordinate time in terms of the eccentric anomaly at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The aim of this paper is to provide more details about the performed calculations and to produce other new results. More specifically, we will focus on deriving the analytical expression of the coordinate time at the second Post-Newtonian order for circular orbits and then discuss two astrophysical applications involving binary neutron star and black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Two-parameter Langlands Correspondence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our paper arXiv:1701.03146 we established, for every simply-laced Lie algebra g, a canonical isomorphism between the spaces of deformed conformal blocks of the deformed W-algebra and the quantum affine algebra corresponding to g, which we view as a q-deformation of the quantum Langlands correspondence. This was done by realizing the deformed conformal blocks of these algebras via the quantum K-theory of the Nakajima quiver varieties. We also linked this isomorphism to a duality emerging from the 6d little string theory. Here, we give a brief survey of these results and propose an extension to the non-simply laced case, which exhibits a Langlands-type duality.</description>

      <title>No-broadcasting of non-Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian states are of fundamental importance in the physics of continuous-variable quantum systems. They are appealing for the experimental ease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and an elegant mathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies require us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian elements. In terms of quantum resource theory, we can then recognize non-Gaussian states as resources and Gaussian operations and states as free, which can be used and prepared easily. Given such a structure of resource theory, the task of broadcasting the resource is to determine if the resource content of a state can be cloned in a meaningful way, which, if possible, provides a strong operation for manipulation of the resource. In this work, we prove that broadcasting of non-Gaussian states via Gaussian operations is not possible. For this, we first show that the relative entropy of non- Gaussianity is not super-additive, which rules it out as a prime candidate in the analysis of such no-go results. Our proof is then based on understanding fixed points of Gaussian operations and relates to the theory of control systems. The no-go theorem also states that if two initially uncorrelated systems interact by Gaussian dynamics and non-Gaussianity is created at one subsystem, then the non-Gaussianity of the other subsystem must be reduced. Further, keeping the set of free operations fixed to Gaussian operations, we can also comment on the broadcasting of Wigner negativity and genuine quantum non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an entropy based adaptive measurement sequence strategy for quantum sensing of magnetic fields. To physically ground our ideas we consider a sensor employing a nitrogen vacancy center in diamond, however our approach is applicable to other quantum sensor arrangements. The sensitivity and accuracy of these sensors typically rely on long sequences of rapidly occurring measurements. We introduce a new technique for designing these measurement sequences aimed at reducing the number of measurements required for a specified accuracy as measured by entropy, by selecting measurement parameters that optimally reduce entropy at each measurement. We compare, via simulation, the efficiency and sensitivity of our new method with several existing measurement sequence design strategies. Our results show quantifiable improvements in sensing performance. We also show analytically that our entropy reduction approach, reduces, under certain simplified conditions, to a well-known and widely used measurement strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a certain type of multiple commutation relations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{gl}}_N)$. We show that all the coefficients in the multiple commutation relations between the $L$-operator elements are given in terms of the trigonometric weight functions for the vector representation, independent of the representation of the $L$-operator. For rank one case, our proof also gives a conceptual understanding why the coefficients can also be expressed using the Izergin-Korepin determinants. As a related result, by specializing expressions for the universal nested Bethe vector by Pakuliak-Ragoucy-Slavnov, we also find a construction of the Gelfand-Tsetlin basis for the vector representation using different $L$-operator elements from the constructions by Nazarov-Tarasov or Molev. We also present corresponding results for the Yangian $Y_h(\mathfrak{gl}_N)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the semiclassical limit of cubic Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations for mixed states. We justify the limit to a singular Vlasov equation (in which the force field is proportional to the gradient of the density), for data with finite Sobolev regularity whose velocity profiles satisfy a quantum Penrose stability condition. This latter condition is always satisfied for small data (with a smallness condition independent of the semiclassical parameter) both in the focusing and the defocusing case, and for small perturbations of a large class of physically relevant examples in the defocusing case, such as local Maxwellian-like profiles.</description>

Abstract: Using a stochastic control approach we establish couplings of the Liouville field and the sinh-Gordon field with the Gaussian free field in dimension $d=2$, such that the difference is in a Sobolev space of regularity $\alpha&gt;1$. The analysis covers the entire $L^2$ phase. Our main tools are estimates for the short scales of the minimiser of the variational problem and several applications of the Brascamp-Lieb inequality.</description>

      <title>One-arm exponents of high-dimensional percolation revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider sufficiently spread-out Bernoulli percolation in dimensions ${d&gt;6}$. We present a short and simple proof of the up-to-constants estimate for the one-arm probability in both the full-space and half-space settings. These results were previously established by Kozma and Nachmias and by Chatterjee and Hanson, respectively. Our proof improves upon the entropic technique introduced by Dewan and Muirhead, relying on a sharp estimate on a suitably chosen correlation length recently obtained by Duminil-Copin and Panis. This approach is inspired by our companion work, where we compute the one-arm exponent for several percolation models related to the high-dimensional Ising model.</description>

      <title>Quantum group deformation of the Kittel--Shore model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kittel--Shore (KS) Hamiltonian describes $N$ spins with long-range interactions that are identically coupled; therefore, this (mean-field) model is also known as the Heisenberg XXX model on the complete graph. In this paper, the underlying $U(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ coalgebra symmetry of the KS model is demonstrated for arbitrary spins, and the quantum deformation of the KS Hamiltonian ($q$-KS model) is obtained using the corresponding $U_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ quantum group. By construction, the existence of such a symmetry guarantees that all integrability properties of the KS model are preserved under $q$-deformation. In particular, the $q$-KS model for spin-$1/2$ particles is analysed, the cases with $N=2$ and $3$ spins are studied in detail, and higher-spin $q$-KS models are sketched. As a first excursion into the thermodynamic properties of the spin-$1/2$ $q$-KS model, the dependence of the Curie temperature on the deformation parameter is studied through numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>Solidification of Icosahedral Quasicrystals: Viewpoint Based on a Quaternion Orientational Order Parameter and the Formation of the E8 Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.12165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, the solidification phase transition between isotropic liquids and icosahedral quasicrystalline structures is classified by the application of a quaternion orientational order parameter. We suggest that the formation of the E8 lattice in 8-dimensions, from which three-dimensional icosahedral quasicrystals derive by projection, occurs without dimensionally restricting the degrees of freedom of the quaternion orientational order parameter to the quaternion plane. This is different from the development of regular crystalline solids in three-dimensions, which occurs in "restricted dimensions" and requires topological-ordering, as previously discussed by the authors. In other words, herein, the formation of lattices in eight-dimensions is considered as a higher-dimensional analogy to the formation of "bulk" superfluidity. It follows that, the solidification of lattices in 8-dimensions (and derivative icosahedral quasicrystalline solids) should occur without the necessity of topological defects.</description>

      <title>Exact solution of TASEP and variants with inhomogeneous speeds and memory lengths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [arXiv:1701.00018, arXiv:2107.07984] an explicit biorthogonalization method was developed that applies to a class of determinantal measures which describe the evolution of several variants of classical interacting particle systems in the KPZ universality class. The method leads to explicit Fredholm determinant formulas for the multipoint distributions of these systems which are suitable for asymptotic analysis. In this paper we extend the method to a broader class of determinantal measures which is applicable to systems where particles have different jump speeds and different memory lengths. As an application of our results we study three particular examples: some variants of TASEP with two blocks of particles having different speeds, a version of discrete time TASEP which mixes particles with sequential and parallel update, and a version of sequential TASEP with a block of long memory particles placed at the bulk of the system.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for Poincar\'e-Einstein Fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the non-linear Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the Poincar\'e-Einstein filling problem. For even dimensional manifolds the range of this non-local map is described in terms of a rank two "Dirichlet-to Neumann tensor" along the boundary determined by the Poincar\'e-Einstein metric. This tensor is proportional to the variation of renormalized volume along a path of Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics. We construct natural "Dirichlet-to-Neumann hypersurface invariants" that are conformally invariant and recover all Dirichlet-to-Neumann tensors. We give an explicit formula for these hypersurface invariants and use a new vanishing result for odd order $T$-curvatures to show that they are the unique, natural conformal hypersurface invariant of transverse order equaling the boundary dimension. We also construct such conformally invariant Dirichlet-to-Neumann hypersurface invariants for Poincar\'e-Einstein fillings for odd dimensional manifolds with conformally flat boundary.</description>

      <title>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By examining rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensates through the perspective of large spin, we identify a novel type of topological point defects in the magnetization texture. These defects are not predicted by conventional homotopy analysis but rather by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The magnetization texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice contains doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects, where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure describes an unconventional "unvortex" lattice, which contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity is concentrated exclusively within defect points. Numerical results are presented, confirming these predictions and demonstrating their persistence in smaller-spin condensates.</description>

      <title>Low energy resolvent asymptotics of the multipole Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute low energy asymptotics for the resolvent of the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles for both integer and non-integer total fluxes. For integral total flux we reduce to prior results in black-box scattering while for non-integral total flux we build on the corresponding techniques using an appropriately chosen model resolvent. The resolvent expansion can be used to obtain long-time wave asymptotics for the Aharonov--Bohm Hamiltonian with multiple poles. An interesting phenomenon is that if the total flux is an integer then the scattering resembles even-dimensional Euclidean scattering, while if it is half an odd integer then it resembles odd-dimensional Euclidean scattering. The behavior for other values of total flux thus provides an `interpolation' between these.</description>

Abstract: Sch\"afke and Schmidt established that the asymptotics of the coefficients of the local solution to some linear differential equation is related to global structures of solutions. The Heun class equations have the accessory parameters, and we investigate the polynomials whose variable is the accessory parameter which appears as the coefficients of the local solution. By calculating the zeros of the polynomials numerically, we obtain the data of the spectral related to the Heun class equations numerically.</description>

      <title>The probability of almost all eigenvalues being real for the elliptic real Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate real eigenvalues of real elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $n$, indexed by the parameter of asymmetry $\tau \in [0,1]$. In both the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes, where $\tau \in [0,1)$ is fixed or $1-\tau=O(1/n)$, respectively, we derive the asymptotic expansion of the probability $p_{n,n-2l}$ that all but a finite number $2l$ of eigenvalues are real. In particular, we show that the expansion is of the form \begin{align*} \log p_{n, n-2l} = \begin{cases} a_1 n^2 +a_2 n + a_3 \log n +O(1) &amp;\text{at strong non-Hermiticity}, \\ b_1 n +b_2 \log n + b_3 +o(1) &amp;\text{at weak non-Hermiticity}, \end{cases} \end{align*} and we determine all coefficients explicitly. Furthermore, in the special case where $l=1$, we derive the full-order expansions. For the proofs, we employ distinct methods for the strongly and weakly non-Hermitian regimes. In the former case, we utilise potential-theoretic techniques to analyse the free energy of elliptic Ginibre matrices conditioned to have $n-2l$ real eigenvalues, together with the strong Szeg\H{o} limit theorems. In the latter case, we utilise the skew-orthogonal polynomial formalism and the asymptotic behaviour of the Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamics: Entropic Forces in Deep and Universal Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid discovery of emergent phenomena in deep learning and large language models, understanding their cause has become an urgent need. Here, we propose a rigorous entropic-force theory for understanding the learning dynamics of neural networks trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants. Building on the theory of parameter symmetries and an entropic loss landscape, we show that representation learning is crucially governed by emergent entropic forces arising from stochasticity and discrete-time updates. These forces systematically break continuous parameter symmetries and preserve discrete ones, leading to a series of gradient balance phenomena that resemble the equipartition property of thermal systems. These phenomena, in turn, (a) explain the universal alignment of neural representations between AI models and lead to a proof of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and (b) reconcile the seemingly contradictory observations of sharpness- and flatness-seeking behavior of deep learning optimization. Our theory and experiments demonstrate that a combination of entropic forces and symmetry breaking is key to understanding emergent phenomena in deep learning.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Uplifts: Parisi-Sourlas with Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defects in conformal field theories (CFTs) play a key role in critical phenomena by modifying scaling behaviors and generating new universality classes. We introduce Parisi-Sourlas (PS) supersymmetry in the presence of extended operators and demonstrate that any $p$-dimensional defect in a CFT$_d$ can be uplifted to a defect in a PS-supersymmetric CFT$_{d+2}$. Surprisingly, there are actually two distinct uplifted defects--of dimensions $p$ and $p+2$--which reduce to the original one. We show how this reduction works for correlators with insertions both in the bulk and on the defect. As a byproduct, we find new relations between defect conformal blocks in dimensions $d$ and $d+2$. We further show that the reduction of the $p$-dimensional defect implies and extend a "global symmetry reduction" previously considered in the literature. Finally, we provide various examples of these uplifts, including perturbative computations in epsilon expansion of the uplift of the Ising magnetic line defect, as well as exact computations of observables in the four-dimensional uplift of minimal models with boundaries.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The locally defined Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Translations and Carroll boosts associated with two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe the motions. The Displacement Memory Effect arises for particular choices of the parameters which yield trajectories with zero momentum. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the moduli space of rigidified perfect complexes with support on a general complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ and its Tyurin degeneration $X\rightsquigarrow X_1\cup_SX_2$ to a complete intersection of Fano threefolds $X_1,X_2$ meeting along their anti-canonical divisor $S$. The corresponding derived dg moduli scheme over the generic fiber degenerates to the (Fano) moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{1}, \mathcal{M}_{2},$ of perfect complexes supported on each Fano which glue after derived restriction to the relative divisor $S$. We prove that the total moduli space of the degeneration family carries a relative Lagrangian foliation structure, which implies the existence of a flat Gauss-Manin connection on periodic cyclic homology of the category of the matrix factorizations associated with fiber-wise moduli spaces, realized locally as the derived critical loci of suitable potential functions. The Fano moduli spaces each define derived Lagrangians in the (ambient) moduli space of restricted complexes to the relative divisor $S$. The flatness of the Gauss-Manin connection implies the derived geometric deformation invariance of the categorified DT-invariants associated to fiberwise matrix factorization categories, hence, the categorified DT-invariants of the generic fiber are expressed in terms of a derived intersection cohomology of the corresponding Fano moduli spaces on the special fiber.</description>
