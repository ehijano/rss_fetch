      <title>Heterogeneous-free narrow linewidth semiconductor laser with optical injection locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrow linewidth lasers are indispensable for coherent optical systems, including communications, metrology, and sensing. Although compact semiconductor lasers with narrow linewidths and low noise have been demonstrated, their spectral purity typically relies on hybrid or heterogeneous external cavity feedback. Here, we present a theoretical and experimental demonstration of a heterogeneous free optical injection locking (HF OIL) semiconductor laser. By integrating a topological interface state extended (TISE) laser with a micro ring resonator (MRR) on an AlGaInAs multiple quantum well platform,we achieve monolithic photon injection and phase locking, thereby reducing the optical linewidth. We fabricated and characterized a 1550 nm sidewall HF OIL laser, achieving stable single mode operation over a broad current range (65 to 300 mA) and a side mode suppression ratio (SMSR) over 50 dB. Under injection locking, the devices Voigt fitted linewidth narrowed from over 1.7 MHz (free running) to 4.2 kHz, representing a three order of magnitude improvement over conventional distributed feedback lasers. The intrinsic linewidth of 1.4 kHz is measured by correlated delayed self-heterodyne frequency noise power spectrum density (FN PSD) method. Moreover, the HF OIL laser demonstrated high phase stability and the ability to transition from a random phased to a phase locked state. These results underscore the potential of HF-OIL lasers in advancing coherent optical communications and phase encoders in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems.</description>

      <title>Harnessing ultrafast optical pulses for 3D microfabrication by selective tweezing and immobilization of colloidal particles in an integrated system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfabrication using nano- to micron-sized building blocks holds great potential for applications in next-generation electronics, optoelectronics, and advanced materials. However, traditional methods like chemical vapor deposition and molecular beam epitaxy require highly controlled environments and specialized equipment, limiting scalability and precision. To address these challenges, we present a single-laser platform for selective tweezing and immobilization of colloids (STIC) that integrates particle manipulation, assembly, and stabilization in one system. STIC utilizes a femtosecond laser at ultra-low power for precise, contact-free optical manipulation of colloids without material damage. At higher power, the same laser enables two-photon polymerization (TPP) to immobilize colloids securely in their intended positions. Using STIC, we demonstrate the assembly of 3D structures from dielectric beads to patterned arrangements of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD e.g., MoS2). We also incorporate a TPP-fabricated handle as an intermediate support, significantly enhancing the optical tweezing efficiency of TMDs. The single-laser design eliminates the need for dual-laser systems, simplifying optical alignment, reducing heating damage, and improving efficiency. Additionally, we show that STIC supports direct multiphoton imaging for in situ inspection during fabrication. This work establishes a versatile, scalable optical platform for high-precision microstructure fabrication, offering a pathway to overcome current limitations in micro- and nanomanufacturing.</description>

      <title>Electrical Generation of Colour Centres in Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defects in wide band gap crystals have emerged as a promising platform for hosting colour centres that enable quantum photonic applications. Among these, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a van der Waals material, stands out for its ability to be integrated into heterostructures, enabling unconventional charge injection mechanisms that bypass the need for p-n junctions. This advancement allows for the electrical excitation of hBN colour centres deep inside the large hBN bandgap, which has seen rapid progress in recent developments. Here, we fabricate hBN electroluminescence (EL) devices that generate narrowband colour centres suitable for electrical excitation. The colour centres are localised to tunnelling current hotspots within the hBN flake, which are designed during device fabrication. We outline the optimal conditions for device operation and colour centre stability, focusing on minimising background emission and ensuring prolonged operation. Our findings follow up on the existing literature and mark a step forward towards the integration of hBN based colour centres into quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Observation of space-time nonseparable helical pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality is a fascinating natural phenomenon with widespread applications in scientific research. Toroidal responses, distinct from chiral responses, represent an emerging and intriguing field that investigates toroidal electromagnetic phenomena. This field has garnered significant attention following the first experimental observations of oscillating toroidal dipoles and electromagnetic toroidal pulses. Breaking the symmetry of toroidal responses and observing chiral toroidal responses are crucial for advancing our understanding of toroidal phenomena and expanding the theoretical and practical applications of toroidal electrodynamics. Here, we present two complementary methods for breaking the symmetry of toroidal pulses and generating chiral space-time nonseparable helical pulses (SNHPs)-quasi-linearly polarized and chiral toroidal-across the optical and microwave spectral ranges. This was achieved through polarization decomposition of toroidal light pulses and direct emission from an ultrawideband spiral antenna, respectively. These advancements pave the way for experimental investigations into information transfer and light-matter interactions involving chiral SNHPs, including toroid-vortex coupling, classical-quantal entanglement, and optical machining, all of which are of growing interest in both fundamental science and practical applications.</description>

      <title>Ultrasensitive Higher-Order Exceptional Points via Non-Hermitian Zero-Index Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order exceptional points (EPs) in optical structures enable ultra-sensitive responses to perturbations. However, previous investigations on higher-order EPs have predominantly focused on coupled systems, leaving their fundamental physics in open scattering systems largely unexplored. Here, we harness wave interference to realize higher-order EPs in non-Hermitian zero-index materials connected to multiple open channels. Specifically, we demonstrate that a three-channel model can give rise to three interesting types of third-order EPs: lasing EP, reflecting EP, and absorbing EP. Notably, near the third-order absorbing EP, we observe ultrasensitivity--a drastic change in output power in response to perturbations at the operating frequency--in a purely lossy system. These findings pave the way for achieving higher-order and even arbitrary-order EPs in open scattering systems, offering significant potential for advanced sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable freeform optimization of wide-aperture 3D metalenses by zoned discrete axisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for design and optimization of 3D freeform metalenses that attains nearly linear scaling of computational cost with diameter, by breaking the lens into a sequence of radial ``zones'' with $n$-fold discrete axisymmetry, where $n$ increases with radius. This allows vastly more design freedom than imposing continuous axisymmetry, while avoiding the compromises of the locally periodic approximation (LPA) or scalar diffraction theory. Using a GPU-accelerated finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) solver in cylindrical coordinates, we perform full-wave simulation and topology optimization within each supra-wavelength zone. We validate our approach by designing millimeter and centimeter-scale, poly-achromatic, 3D freeform metalenses which outperform the state of the art. By demonstrating the scalability and resulting optical performance enabled by our ``zoned discrete axisymmetry'' (ZDA) and supra-wavelength domain decomposition, we highlight the potential of our framework to advance large-scale meta-optics and next-generation photonic technologies.</description>

      <title>Training Hybrid Neural Networks with Multimode Optical Nonlinearities Using Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to train ever-larger neural networks brings artificial intelligence to the forefront of scientific and technical discoveries. However, their exponentially increasing size creates a proportionally greater demand for energy and computational hardware. Incorporating complex physical events in networks as fixed, efficient computation modules can address this demand by decreasing the complexity of trainable layers. Here, we utilize ultrashort pulse propagation in multimode fibers, which perform large-scale nonlinear transformations, for this purpose. Training the hybrid architecture is achieved through a neural model that differentiably approximates the optical system. The training algorithm updates the neural simulator and backpropagates the error signal over this proxy to optimize layers preceding the optical one. Our experimental results achieve state-of-the-art image classification accuracies and simulation fidelity. Moreover, the framework demonstrates exceptional resilience to experimental drifts. By integrating low-energy physical systems into neural networks, this approach enables scalable, energy-efficient AI models with significantly reduced computational demands.</description>

      <title>Guiding polaritonic energy and momentum through two-dimensional Bravais lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong exciton absorption in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides provides a promising platform for studying polaritons with tunable dispersions, which are crucial for controlling polaritonic energy and momentum, but remain underexplored. In this work, monolayer MoS$_2$ is coupled with a Fabry-P\'erot microcavity to form polaritons. Five types of Bravais lattices with sub-wavelength periods, based on polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) nanopillars, are intentionally designed. The energy overlap between the periodic PMMA scattering wave and the polariton establishes a coupling channel that controls the directional flow of polaritonic energy, as demonstrated through angle-resolved reflectance measurements. Back-space image measurements further demonstrate that the dispersion in reciprocal space can be directly and manually tuned, allowing for control over their number and their positions. The coupling between the polariton and PMMA scattering wave is further demonstrated by analyzing the reflectance using the two-port two-mode model. The symmetries of 2D Bravais lattices allow the angle between energy and momentum flow to vary widely, from 90{\deg}, 60{\deg}, 45{\deg}, and 30{\deg} to arbitrary values. By adjusting the lattice vector lengths, the position of the dispersion branch in a specific direction can be fine-tuned, enabling full-range control over polariton dispersion. This work presents the first theoretical and experimental demonstrations of guiding the direction of polaritonic energy and momentum through Bravais lattice design.</description>

      <title>Fabry-Perot resonance modes in a MoS$_2$-based vertical stacking cavity for strong light-matter coupling and topological phase singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rich dielectric properties in atomic transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhance light-matter interactions and contribute to a variety of optical phenomena. The direct transfer of TMDs onto photonic crystals facilitates optical field confinement and modifies photon dispersion through the generation of polaritons. However, light-matter interaction is severely limited by this stacking method. This limitation can be significantly improved by constructing a vertical stacking cavity with alternating layers of dielectric material and monolayer MoS$_2$. This multilayer structure is proven to be a compact, versatile, and customizable platform for controlling Fabry-Perot cavity resonance mode. Angle-resolved reflectance further aids in studying resonance mode dispersion. Moreover, the strong light-matter interaction results in multiple perfect absorptions, with the monolayer MoS$_2$ significantly contributing to the absorption in this system, as schematically revealed by the electric field distribution. The multiple perfect absorptions produce an unusual amounts of phase singularities with topological pairs, whose generation, evolution, and annihilation can be controlled by adjusting cavity parameters. Our findings provide a flexible and consistent framework for optimizing light-matter interactions and supporting further studies on wavefront shaping, optical vortices, and topological variants.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Strongly Tilted Dirac Points at General Positions in the Reciprocal Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-II Dirac points (DPs), which occur at the intersection of strongly tilted and touching energy bands, exhibit many intriguing physical phenomena fundamentally different from the non-tilted type-I counterparts. Over the past decade, their discovery has spurred extensive research into electronic systems and other Bloch-wave systems, such as photonic and phononic crystals. However, current studies typically focus on type-II DPs along high-symmetry directions in the first Brillouin zone (FBZ) under mirror symmetry conditions, which are highly restrictive and limit further investigations and applications. To overcome the stringent constraint, here we identify and demonstrate the emergence of type-II DPs at general positions inside the FBZ without requiring the mirror symmetry. The type-II DPs, being accidental degeneracies, are experimentally realized on a metacrystal slab with H-shaped metallic patterns. Our findings indicate that even in the absence of mirror symmetry, type-II DPs can emerge at designated locations inside the FBZ by simply rotating the H-shaped patterns and adjusting geometrical and physical parameters. Furthermore, based on the rotated type-II DPs, off-axis conical diffractions have been both realized and experimentally observed. Meanwhile, we discovered that during the rotation process, the type-II DPs transform into off-axis type-I DPs, but still strongly tilted, resulting in the emergence of negative refractions. Hence, the generic method we propose for inducing type-II or strongly tilted type-I DPs without the high-symmetry limitations opens potential avenues for related research. For example, the observed off-axis conical diffraction and negative refraction could inspire future development and applications in photonics and other Bloch-wave systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quantum noise on non-Hermitian resonators at an exceptional point (EP). The system's irreversible Markovian dynamics is modeled using the Lindblad master equation, which accounts for the incoherent pump, radiative losses, and external monochromatic field. An exact analytic solution is derived in the form of the characteristic function of the Husimi distribution, enabling the calculation of all quantum mechanical observables associated with the bosonic degrees of freedom. Our analysis reveals that quantum noise strongly influences the system's response when the system exhibits $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetry. Out of the $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric regime, however, the system demonstrates stability within a specific parametric domain, where the effects of quantum noise on the signal-to-noise ratio can be mitigated by increasing the external field.</description>

      <title>Ultrashort Carbon Nanotubes with Luminescent Color Centers are Ultrabright NIR-II Nano-Emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining brightness and nanoscale size of short-wave infrared (SWIR) emitters is equally essential in the fields of bioimaging, photonics, and quantum science, but such nano-emitters are still lacking. Here we report that when functionalized with luminescent color centers, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with lengths much shorter than 100 nm, are surprisingly bright in the near-infrared second-biological window (NIR-II) of the SWIR. We discuss the origin of this exceptional brightness based on the uncontrollable presence of quenching defects in solubilized carbon nanotubes. The observed NIR-II brightness exceeds that of well-known visible emitters, including quantum dots. After being made biocompatible, ultrashort carbon nanotubes with luminescent color centers open the route toward point-spread function engineering and 3-dimensional single-particle studies for nanoscale NIR-II imaging in thick brain tissue.</description>

      <title>Tutorial of Fourier transform for ultrafast optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20698v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial is designed for individuals who are new to the field of ultrafast optics. It was written in response to the apparent lack of comprehensive introductions to the basic Fourier transform, extending beyond the flat-phase description. Additionally, there is a need for complete derivations of several relations involving the Fourier transform, maintaining its most general formulation. This approach avoids the arbitrary selection of Fourier-transform constants and ensures a complete understanding. It shows the importance of having Fourier-transform constants as parameters, which I would like to advocate people to do. Most important of all, I have seen misuse of Fourier transform over my years of discussion in the lab and from others' questions since I shared my code publicly on Github. Surprisingly, since people check the correctness of numerical implementation only by seeing if the simulation result is smooth and if it duplicates the "overall physics," this seems to be a widespread problem from my perspective, which can be solved by a simple tutorial. This is why I hope that this tutorial can help people understand more about the Fourier transform, especially in the context of ultrafast optics.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale correlated morphology and optoelectronic properties in GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving uniform nanowire size, density, and alignment across a wafer is challenging, as small variations in growth parameters can impact performance in energy harvesting devices like solar cells and photodetectors. This study demonstrates the in-depth characterization of uniformly grown GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell nanowires on a two-inch Si(111) substrate using Ga-induced self-catalyzed molecular beam epitaxy. By integrating Scanning Electron Microscopy and Time Correlated Single-Photon Counting, we establish a detailed model of structural and optoelectronic properties across wafer and micron scales. While emission intensity varies by up to 35%, carrier lifetime shows only 9% variation, indicating stable material quality despite structural inhomogeneities. These findings indicate that, for the two-inch GaAs/AlGaAs nanowire wafer, achieving uniform nanowire coverage had a greater impact on consistent optoelectronic properties than variations in material quality, highlighting its significance for scalable III-V semiconductor integration on silicon in advanced optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Ultra-compact broadband spot size converter using metamaterial cell-based inverse design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the expansion of silicon photonics from datacom applications into emerging fields like optical I/O, quantum and programmable photonics there is an increasing demand for devices that combine ultra-compact footprints, low losses, and broad bandwidths. While inverse design techniques have proven very efficient in achieving small footprints, they often underutilize physical insight and rely on large parameter spaces that are challenging to explore, thereby limiting the performance of the resulting devices. Here we present a design methodology that combines inverse design with a topology based on cells, each of which contains a subwavelength metamaterial. This approach significantly reduces the parameter space, while the inherent anisotropy of the subwavelength structures yields shorter devices. We experimentally demonstrate our technique with an ultra-compact spot size converter that achieves a x24 expansion ratio times (from 0.5 um to 12 um) over a length of only 7 um, with insertion losses of 0.8 dB across a measured bandwidth of 160 nm (up to 300 nm in simulation), surpassing the state-of-the-art by a wide margin.</description>

      <title>Sub-2 Kelvin characterization of nitrogen-vacancy centers in silicon carbide nanopillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10509v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of efficient quantum communication technologies depends on the innovation in multiple layers of its implementation, a challenge we address from the fundamental properties of the physical system at the nano-scale to the instrumentation level at the macro-scale. We select a promising near infrared quantum emitter, the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in 4H-SiC, and integrate it, at an ensemble level, with nanopillar structures that enhance photon collection efficiency into an objective lens. Moreover, changes in collection efficiency in pillars compared to bulk can serve as indicators of color center orientation in the lattice. To characterize NV center properties at the unprecedented sub-2 Kelvin temperatures, we incorporate compatible superconducting nanowire single photon detectors inside the chamber of an optical cryostat and create the ICECAP, the Integrated Cryogenic system for Emission, Collection And Photon-detection. ICECAP measurements show no significant linewidth broadening of NV ensemble emission and up to 14-fold enhancement in collected emission. With additional filtering, we measure emitter lifetimes of NV centers in a basal ($hk$) and an axial ($kk$) orientation unveiling their cryogenic values of 2.2 ns and 2.8 ns.</description>

      <title>Spin Photonic Topological Insulator Antenna By Armchair Arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15820v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new X-band leaky wave antenna has been developed using spin photonic topological insulators. This antenna features a hexagonal unit cell arranged in an armchair configuration. This arrangement provides advantages over the zigzag configuration, particularly by offering a wider leaky region and a more suitable pattern. To design the structure, a parametric study on the cell dimensions has been conducted, and another study has designed the transition region to couple the topological structure with the classical line. The proposed antenna has a low profile and illuminates two sides of the structure simultaneously. Additionally, it offers a 53-degree scanning range and a bandwidth of 2.7 GHz, making it a groundbreaking improvement over other leaky wave antennas that utilize photonic topological insulators. The proposed antenna is a unbalaned CRLH leaky wave antenna that can radiate in both backward and forward directions. Notably, when transitioning through the broadside in the scanning range, there is no significant drop in performance despite the existence of an open stop band. To the best of our knowledge, this characteristic appears to be unique among unbalaned CRLH leaky wave antennas.</description>
