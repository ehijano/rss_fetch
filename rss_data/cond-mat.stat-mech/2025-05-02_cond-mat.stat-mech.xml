      <title>Symmetry induced pairing in dark excitonic condensate at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose Einstein condensate of optically inactive (dark) intervalley excitons must be inherently multi-component because of the point group and the time-reversal symmetries of a crystal. Accordingly, a number of the condensate components N$_v$ is determined by the symmetry. Since the valleys hosting such excitons are separated by large quasi-momenta, the minimal inter-component Josephson-type coupling can only be established between pairs of excitons from the time-reversed valleys. As a result, a paired condensate can emerge at finite temperature, that is, the phase where individual valleys are not characterized by the condensate order, while the order exists for the pairs from the time-reversed valleys. This prediction follows from the elementary mean field analysis regardless of the dimensionality. However, as Monte Carlo simulations show, no such a phase exists in 3D crystals. Instead, the N$_v$-component condensation proceeds as the Ist order transition from the normal state. The paired phase does exist in 2D for N$_v\geq 6$. It forms by Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition from the high temperature (normal) phase. Upon further lowering temperature, a second transition transforms the paired phase into the N$_v$-component condensate.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic potentials from a probabilistic view on the system-environment interaction energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In open systems with strong coupling, the interaction energy between the system and the environment is significant, so thermodynamic quantities cannot be reliably obtained by traditional statistical mechanics methods. The Hamiltonian of mean force $\mathcal{H}^{*}_{\beta}$ offers an in principle accurate theoretical basis by explicitly accounting for the interaction energy. However, calculating the Hamiltonian of mean force is challenging both theoretically and computationally. We demonstrate that when the condition $\text{Var}_{\mathcal{E}_0} (e^{-\beta {V}_{\mathcal{SE}}}) = 0$ is met, the dependence of thermodynamic variables can be shifted from $\{P_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}}), \mathcal{H}^{*}_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}})\}$ to $\{P_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}}), P(V_{\mathcal{SE}})\}$. This change simplifies thermodynamic measurements. As a central result, we derive a general equality that holds for arbitrary coupling strengths and from which an inequality follows - aligned with Jensen's inequality applied to the Gibbs-Bogoliubov-Feynman bound. This equality, analogous in importance to the Jarzynski equality, offers deeper insight into free energy differences in strongly coupled systems. Finally, by combining our result with said Jarzynski equality, we derive additional relations that further clarify thermodynamic behavior in strongly coupled open systems.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal anti-aligning active mixtures: deriving the exact Boltzmann collision operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the effect of non-reciprocity in a binary mixture of self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions, where a particle of type A reacts differently to a particle of type B than vice versa. Starting from a well-known microscopic Langevin-model for the particles, setting up the corresponding exact N-particle Fokker-Planck equation and making Boltzmann's assumptions of low density and one-sided molecular chaos, the non-linear active Boltzmann equation with the exact collision operator is derived. In this derivation, the effect of phase-space compression and the build-up of pair-correlations during binary interactions is explicitly taken into account, leading to a theoretical description beyond mean-field. This extends previous results for reciprocal interactions, where it was found that orientational order can emerge in a system with purely anti-aligning interactions. Although the equations of motion are more complex than in the reciprocal system, the theory still leads to analytical expressions and predictions. Comparisons with agent-based simulations show excellent quantitative agreement of the dynamic and static behavior in the low density and/or small coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Approximate calculation of functional integrals arising from the operator approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the operator approach to a stochastic system belonging to a class of death-birth processes, which we introduce utilizing the master equation approach. By employing Doi- Peliti formalism we recast the master equation in the form of a Schr\"odinger-like equation. Therein appearing pseudo-Hamiltonian is conveniently expressed in a suitable Fock space, constructed using bosonic-like creation and annihilation operators. The kernel of the associated time evolution operator is rewritten using a functional integral, for which we propose an approximate method that allows its analytical treatment. The method is based on the expansion in eigenfunctions of the Hamiltonian generating given functional integral. In this manner, we obtain approximate values for the probabilities of the system being in the first and second states for the case of the pure birth process.</description>

      <title>Field-theoretic Analysis of Dynamic Isotropic Percolation: Three-loop Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The general epidemic process is a paradigmatic model in non-equilibrium statistical physics displaying a continuous phase transition between active and absorbing states.The dynamic isotropic percolation universality class captures its universal properties, which we aim to quantitatively study by means of the field-theoretic formulation of the model augmented with a perturbative renormalization group analysis. The main purpose of this work consists in determining the critical dynamic exponent $z$ to the three-loop approximation. This allows us to finalize the quantitative description of the dynamic isotropic percolation class to this order of perturbation theory. The calculations are performed within the dimensional regularization with the minimal subtraction scheme and actual perturbative expansions are carried out in a formally small parameter $\epsilon$, where $\epsilon = 6 - d$ is a deviation from the upper critical dimension $d_c = 6$.</description>

      <title>Phonon Induced Energy Relaxation in Quantum Critical Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metals at the brink of electronic quantum phase transitions display high-temperature superconductivity, competing orders, and unconventional charge transport, revealing strong departures from conventional Fermi liquid behavior. Investigation of these fascinating intertwined phenomena has been at the center of research across a variety of correlated materials over the past many decades. A ubiquitous experimental observation is the emergence of a universal timescale that governs electrical transport and momentum relaxation. In this work, we analyze an equally important theoretical question of how the energy contained in the electronic degrees of freedom near a quantum phase transition relaxes to the environment via their coupling to acoustic phonons. Assuming that the bottleneck for energy dissipation is controlled by the coupling between electronic degrees of freedom and acoustic phonons, we present a universal theory of the temperature dependence of the energy relaxation rate in a marginal Fermi liquid. We find that the energy relaxation rate exhibits a complex set of temperature-dependent crossovers controlled by emergent energy scales in the problem. We place these results in the context of recent measurements of the energy relaxation rate via non-linear optical spectroscopy in the normal state of hole-doped cuprates.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Dynamics with Imperfections in a Solvable Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study how probes of quantum scrambling dynamics respond to two kinds of imperfections -- unequal forward and backward evolutions and decoherence -- in a solvable Brownian circuit model. We calculate a ``renormalized'' out-of-time-order correlator (ROTOC) in the model with $N$ qubits, and we show that the circuit-averaged ROTOC is controlled by an effective probability distribution in operator weight space which obeys a system of $N$ non-linear equations of motion. These equations can be easily solved numerically for large system sizes which are beyond the reach of exact methods. Moreover, for an operator initially concentrated on weight one $w_0=1$, we provide an exact solution to the equations in the thermodynamic limit of many qubits that is valid for all times, all non-vanishing perturbation strengths $p\gtrsim 1/\sqrt{N}$, and all decoherence strengths. We also show that a generic initial condition $w_0 &gt;1$ leads to a metastable state that eventually collapses to the $w_0=1$ case after a lifetime $\sim \log(N/w_0)$. Our results highlight situations where it is still possible to extract the unperturbed chaos exponent even in the presence of imperfections, and we comment on the applications of our results to existing experiments with nuclear spins and to future scrambling experiments.</description>

      <title>An unbiased measure over the matrix product state manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix product states are useful representations for a large variety of naturally occurring quantum states. Studying their typical properties is important for understanding universal behavior, including quantum chaos and thermalization, as well as the limits of classical simulations of quantum devices. We show that the usual ensemble of sequentially generated random matrix product states (RMPS) using local Haar random unitaries is not uniform when viewed as a restriction of the full Hilbert space. As a result, the entanglement across the chain exhibits an anomalous asymmetry under spatial inversion. We show how to construct an unbiased measure starting from the left-canonical form and design a Metropolis algorithm for sampling random states. Some properties of this new ensemble are investigated both analytically and numerically, such as the resulting resolution of identity over matrix product states and the typical entanglement spectrum, which is found to differ from the sequentially generated case.</description>

      <title>Emergent photons and mechanisms of confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically study $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories in 4D as prototypical models of systems with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 1-$\textit{form symmetry}$. For $N \geq 3$, we provide evidence that such systems exhibit not only the expected phases with spontaneously broken/restored symmetry but also a third photon phase. When present, the 1-form symmetry provides a precise notion of confinement, and it is commonly believed that confinement ensues due to the proliferation of extended, string-like objects known as $\textit{center vortices}$, which carry a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ flux. However, this picture is challenged by the three-phase scenario investigated here. We show that both the confined and the photon phases are associated with the proliferation of center vortices and that the key difference between them lies in whether or not vortex-junctions, the $\textit{monopoles}$, proliferate.</description>

      <title>Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00087v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Approximation theory for Green's functions via the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that Green's functions can be expressed as continued fractions; the content at the $n$-th level of the fraction is encoded in a coefficient $b_n$, which can be recursively obtained using the Lanczos algorithm. We present a theory concerning errors in approximating Green's functions using continued fractions when only the first $N$ coefficients are known exactly. Our focus lies on the stitching approximation (also known as the recursion method), wherein truncated continued fractions are completed with a sequence of coefficients for which exact solutions are available. We assume a now standard conjecture about the growth of the Lanczos coefficients in chaotic many-body systems, and that the stitching approximation converges to the correct answer. Given these assumptions, we show that the rate of convergence of the stitching approximation to a Green's function depends strongly on the decay of staggered subleading terms in the Lanczos cofficients. Typically, the decay of the error term ranges from $1/\mathrm{poly}(N)$ in the best case to $1/\mathrm{poly}(\log N)$ in the worst case, depending on the differentiability of the spectral function at the origin. We present different variants of this error estimate for different asymptotic behaviours of the $b_n$, and we also conjecture a relationship between the asymptotic behavior of the $b_n$'s and the smoothness of the Green's function. Lastly, with the above assumptions, we prove a formula linking the spectral function's value at the origin to a product of continued fraction coefficients, which we then apply to estimate the diffusion constant in the mixed field Ising model.</description>

      <title>Rare Trajectories in a Prototypical Mean-field Disordered Model: Insights into Landscape and Instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For disordered systems within the random first-order transition (RFOT) universality class, such as structural glasses and certain spin glasses, the role played by activated relaxation processes is rich to the point of perplexity. Over the last decades, various efforts have attempted to formalize and systematize such processes in terms of instantons similar to the nucleation droplets of first- order phase transitions. In particular, Kirkpatrick, Thirumalai, and Wolynes proposed in the late '80s an influential nucleation theory of relaxation in structural glasses. Already within this picture, however, the resulting structures are far from the compact objects expected from the classical droplet description. In addition, an altogether different type of single-particle hopping-like instantons has recently been isolated in molecular simulations. Landscape studies of mean-field spin glass models have further revealed that simple saddle crossing does not capture relaxation in these systems. We present here a landscape-agnostic study of rare dynamical events, which delineates the richness of instantons in these systems. Our work not only captures the structure of metastable states, but also identifies the point of irreversibility, beyond which activated relaxation processes become a fait accompli. An interpretation of the associated landscape features is articulated, thus charting a path toward a complete understanding of RFOT instantons.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic approach to system-environment coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified statistical framework for quantifying system-environment coupling by treating the interaction energy $V_\mathcal{SE}$ as a stochastic variable. Using a reference-particle decomposition, we derive exact, closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of $V_\mathcal{SE}$ in terms of the single-particle density and up to four-body correlation functions. When $V_\mathcal{SE}$ is approximately Gaussian, these two moments suffice to compute the free energy shift of the strongly coupled system. To validate our framework, we ran explicit Monte Carlo simulations of the full system-environment configurations across a range of system sizes, generating reference distributions of the interaction energy $V_\mathcal{SE}$. We then applied our derived analytical formulas to predict these distributions and found excellent agreement in both the weak- and strong-coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Site-Percolation-Driven Ionic Conductivity in Random Substitutional Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design of superionic conductors for all-solid-state batteries often faces a fundamental trade-off between stability and ionic conductivity. Random Substitutional Crystals (RSCs), where atomic species are randomly distributed throughout a crystal lattice, present a promising route to overcome this competitive relation. Although extensive studies have focused on local ionic hopping, the role of mesoscale structural organization in determining macroscopic conductivity remains poorly understood, limiting the rational design of optimal compositions. Here, we systematically investigate the ionic conductivity of NaCl-type RSCs as a function of composition using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that ionic conductivity increases sharply once the carrier ion concentration exceeds a critical threshold, without disrupting the underlying crystal structure. Strikingly, this threshold aligns with the site percolation threshold predicted by percolation theory.

      <title>Exact treatment of the quantum Langevin equation under time-dependent system-bath coupling via a train of delta distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quantum Langevin equation for the Caldeira-Leggett model with an arbitrary time-dependent coupling constant. We solve this equation exactly by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. This method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment. Furthermore, we compute the two-time correlation functions of the system's quadratures and show that the discrete-time Fourier transform is well-suited for defining spectral densities, as the Dirac-delta switchings turn continuous functions into discretized samples.</description>

      <title>Local Information Flow in Quantum Quench Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of quantum information in one-dimensional systems undergoing a quantum quench using a local perspective based on the information lattice. This framework provides a scale- and space-resolved decomposition of quantum correlations, enabling a hydrodynamic description of the information flow through well-defined local densities -- termed local information -- and currents. We apply this framework to three local quenches in noninteracting fermionic chains: (i) the release of a single particle into an empty tight-binding chain, (ii) the connection of two critical chains via the removal of a central barrier, and (iii) the coupling of a topological Kitaev chain to a critical chain. In each case, the information lattice reveals the local structure of correlation buildup and information interface effects, going beyond global measures such as the von Neumann entropy. In particular, through the information lattice we uncover the signatures in the local information flow associated with topological edge modes and analytically explain the fractional von Neumann entropy values observed in Majorana quench protocols. Our approach is general and applicable to interacting, disordered, and open systems, providing a powerful tool for characterizing quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic phases in first detected return times of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05585v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the first return time to the initial state of a quantum many-body system subject to global projective measurements at stroboscopic times. We show that this distribution can be mapped to a continuation of the canonical partition function of a classical spin chain with noninteracting domains at equilibrium, which is entirely characterized by the Loschmidt amplitude of the quantum many-body system. This allows us to conclude that this probability may decay either algebraically or exponentially at long times, depending on whether the spin chain displays a ferromagnetic or a paramagnetic phase. We illustrate this idea on the example of the return time of $N$ adjacent fermions in a tight-binding model, revealing a rich phase behavior, which can be tuned by scaling the probing time as a function of $N$. The analysis presented here provides an overarching understanding of many-body quantum first-detection problems in terms of equilibrium thermodynamic phases. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with exact numerical computations.</description>

Abstract: The effect of hydrodynamic interactions on the non-equilibrium stochastic dynamics of particles -- arising from the conservation of momentum in the fluid medium -- is examined in the context of the relationship between fluctuations, response functions, and the entropy production rate. The multiplicative nature of the hydrodynamic interactions is shown to introduce subtleties that preclude a straightforward extension of the Harada-Sasa relation. A generalization of the definitions involved in the framework is used to propose a new form of the relation applicable to systems with hydrodynamic interactions. The resulting framework will enable characterization of the non-equilibrium properties of living and active matter systems, which are predominantly in suspensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization is a fundamental dynamical state of interacting oscillators, observed in natural biological rhythms and in the brain. Global synchronization which occurs when non-linear or chaotic oscillators placed on the nodes of a network display the same dynamics as received great attention in network theory. Here we propose and investigate Global Topological Dirac Synchronization on higher-order networks such as cell and simplicial complexes. This is a state where oscillators associated to simplices and cells of arbitrary dimension, coupled by the Topological Dirac operator, operate at unison. By combining algebraic topology with non-linear dynamics and machine learning, we derive the topological conditions under which this state exists and the dynamical conditions under which it is stable. We provide evidence of 1-dimensional simplicial complexes (networks) and 2-dimensional simplicial and cell complexes where Global Topological Dirac Synchronization can be observed. Our results point out that Global Topological Dirac Synchronization is a possible dynamical state of simplicial and cell complexes that occur only in some specific network topologies and geometries, the latter ones being determined by the weights of the higher-order networks</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced phase transition in periodically driven free-fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that unitary evolution tends to increase entanglement, whereas continuous monitoring counteracts this growth by pinning the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstates of the measurement operators. In this work, we investigate the fate of the measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is modulated periodically in time using a square pulse. In the high-frequency limit, a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in {Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021)}] reveals that if the hopping amplitude is varied symmetrically around zero, the system always favors the area-law phase, where the steady-state entanglement entropy is independent of subsystem size. In contrast, asymmetry in the drive amplitudes tends to promote entanglement growth. Furthermore, numerical evidence for the system sizes accessible to us suggests that decreasing the drive frequency typically favors entanglement growth. For such driven systems, at least for reasonably small frequency regimes, as a function of measurement strength, we observe a potential signature of a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition between a gapless critical phase, characterized by logarithmic growth of entanglement entropy with subsystem size, and a gapped area-law phase. However, it is almost impossible to rule out the possibility that the transition observed here is not an actual thermodynamic transition, but a finite-size crossover between logarithmic to area law entanglement phase. Even in that scenario, the critical length scale beyond which the area law phase prevails increases with the increasing time period of driving. On the other hand, for a symmetric drive, the system consistently exhibits an area-law phase, regardless of the driving frequency.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between unitary dynamics and quantum measurements induces diverse phenomena in open quantum systems with no counterparts in closed quantum systems at equilibrium. Here, we generally classify Kraus operators and their effective non-Hermitian dynamical generators, thereby establishing the tenfold classification for symmetry and topology of monitored free fermions. Our classification elucidates the role of topology in measurement-induced phase transitions and identifies potential topological terms in the corresponding nonlinear sigma models. Furthermore, we establish the bulk-boundary correspondence in monitored quantum dynamics: nontrivial topology in spacetime manifests itself as topologically nontrivial steady states and gapless boundary states in Lyapunov spectra, such as Lyapunov zero modes and chiral edge modes, leading to the topologically protected slowdown of dynamical purification.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Geometrical Structure of Bifurcations during Spatial Decision-Making</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Animals must constantly make decisions on the move, such as when choosing among multiple options, or "targets", in space. Recent evidence suggests that this results from a recursive feedback between the (vectorial) neural representation of the targets and the resulting motion defined by this consensus, which then changes the egocentric neural representation of the the options, and so on. Here we employ a simple model of this process to both explore how its dynamics account for the experimentally-observed abruptly-branching trajectories exhibited by animals during spatial decision-making, and to provide new insights into spatiotemporal computation. Essential neural dynamics, notably local excitation and long-range inhibition, are captured in our model via spin-system dynamics, with groups of Ising-spins representing neural "activity bumps" corresponding to target directions. Analysis, employing a novel "mean-field trajectory" approach, reveals the nature of the spontaneous symmetry breaking - bifurcations in the model that result in literal bifurcations in trajectory space and how it results in new geometric principles for spatiotemporal decision-making. We find that all bifurcation points, beyond the very first, fall on a small number of "bifurcation curves". It is the spatial organization of these curves that is shown to be key to determining the shape of the trajectories, such as self-similar or space filling, exhibited during decision-making, irrespective of the trajectory's starting point. Furthermore, we find that a non-Euclidean representation of space considerably reduces the number of bifurcation points in many geometrical configurations, preventing endless indecision and promoting effective spatial decision-making. This suggests that a non-Euclidean neural representation of space may be expected to have evolved across species in order to facilitate spatial decision-making.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of quantum Markov semigroups describing the evolution of interacting quantum lattice systems, specified either as generic qudits or as fermions. The corresponding generators, which include both conservative and dissipative evolutions, are given by the superposition of local generators in the Lindblad form. Under general conditions, we show that the associated infinite volume dynamics is well defined and can be obtained as the strong limit of the finite volume dynamics. By regarding the interacting evolution as a perturbation of a non-interacting dissipative dynamics, we further obtain a quantitative criterion that yields the ergodicity of the quantum Markov semigroup together with the exponential convergence of local observables. The analysis is based on suitable a priori bounds on the resolvent equation which yield quantitive estimates on the evolution of local observables.</description>

      <title>Combining integral equation closures with force density functional theory for the study of inhomogeneous fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is a powerful framework to study inhomogeneous fluids. Its standard form is based on the knowledge of a generating free energy functional. If this is known exactly, then the results obtained by using standard DFT or its alternative, recently developed version, force-DFT, are the same. If the free energy functional is known only approximately then these two routes produce different outcomes. However, as we show in this work, force-DFT has the advantage that it is also implementable without knowledge of the free energy functional, by using instead liquid-state integral equation closures. This broadens the range of systems that can be explored, since free energy functionals are generally difficult to approximate. In this paper we investigate the utility of using inhomogeneous integral equation closures within force-DFT thus demonstrating the versatility and accuracy of this approach.</description>

Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Target model in this study is an extended version of the cluster model in one dimension with $Z_2\otimes Z_2$ symmetry, and we investigate effects of decoherence applied to the ground state of the model, focusing on the symmetry aspect. By using a scheme that we propose, a strong symmetry protected topological (SPT) mixed state and double average SPT (ASPT) state are constructed through the pure gapless SPT order and the domain-wall duality. Among them, the double ASPT is categorized by coexisting orders, i.e., a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking and ASPT defined by the remaining weak and strong symmetries. We make use of the doubled Hilbert space formalism for the construction scheme. We numerically demonstrate the emergence of the two mixed SPT states and find that a phase transition occurs between them tuned by the strength of decoherence. Finally, we discuss the coexistence of SPT and SWSSB in the double SPT state from the view point of symmetrically invertible property, and comment on the classification of ASPT proposed recently. Suitable multiple-decoherence channel applied to SPT states gives a broad possibility to induce rich ASPTs, possessing non-trivial internal entanglement properties from the view of doubled Hilbert space formalism.</description>

      <title>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</description>

Abstract: The kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials is developed. The scattering process is studied theoretically, which yields the relative speed and the impact parameter dependence of the scattering angle. The viscosity is derived from the Boltzmann equation and its temperature dependence is plotted. We also perform the direct simulation Monte Carlo to check the validity of the theory.</description>
