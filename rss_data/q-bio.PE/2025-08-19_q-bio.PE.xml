      <title>Binomial maps: stochastically evolving iterated integer maps for finite population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic nature of iterated map models of population dynamics is justifiable for infinite-sized populations, as the stochastic fluctuations are negligible in this limit. However, they are ill-suited for finite-population systems where finite-size effects like demographic noise and extinction cannot be ignored. Adding noise to the equations cannot model the demographic noise as it can only represent environmental stochasticity. An approach, sometimes used in ecological literature, but surprisingly uncommon in dynamical systems community, is \emph{Binomial maps}, which allow stochastic evolution of deterministic iterated map models of population. Here we present their formulation in a way so as to make their connection to the agent-based models explicit, and demonstrate it for the Logistic and Ricker maps. We also show that the Binomial maps are not completely equivalent to their deterministic counterparts, and derive sufficient conditions under which the equivalence holds. This approach enables rigorous finite-population analysis within familiar map-based models, opening the door to systematic study of extinction risk, quasi-stationarity, and noise-induced transitions.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of HPAI transmission between dairy cattle and wild birds with environmental effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI), especially the H5N1 strain, remains a major threat to animal health, food security, and public health. Recent spillover events in dairy cattle in the United States, linked to wild birds, highlight the critical importance of understanding transmission pathways at the cattle--wild bird--environment interface. In this work, we formulate and analyze a deterministic compartmental model that captures the transmission of HPAI between dairy cattle and wild birds, incorporating both direct and indirect (environmental) routes. The model combines an $SEIR$ framework for cattle with an $SIR$ structure for wild birds, coupled through an environmental compartment. We derive the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_{0}$, using the next-generation matrix approach, decomposing it into cattle-to-cattle, bird-to-bird, and environmental contributions. Qualitative analysis establishes positivity, boundedness, and global stability of equilibria through Lyapunov functions. Numerical simulations confirm the results of the theoretical analyses, illustrating outbreak trajectories, extinction thresholds, and persistence dynamics. A global sensitivity analysis, based on Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficients, identifies key parameters, particularly transmission among cattle, environmental contamination, and recovery rate as critical drivers of epidemic outcomes. Our results show that disease elimination is achievable when $\mathcal{R}_{0} &lt; 1$, while persistence is inevitable for $\mathcal{R}_{0} &gt; 1$. These findings provide a comprehensive mathematical framework for assessing HPAI risks and offer guidance for biosecurity strategies aimed at mitigating spillover and controlling outbreaks in livestock populations.</description>

      <title>Estimating wolf population size in France using non-invasive genetic sampling and spatial capture recapture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population size is a key metric for management and conservation. This is especially true for large carnivore populations for which management decisions are often based on population size estimates. In France, gray wolves (Canis lupus) have been monitored for more than two decades using non-invasive genetic sampling and capture-recapture models. Population size estimates directly inform the annual number of wolves that can be killed legally. It is therefore key to use appropriate methods to obtain robust population size estimates. To track the recent numerical and geographical expansion of the population, a substantial increase in sample collection was performed during the winter 2023/24 within the entire wolf distribution range in France. A total of 1964 samples were genotyped and assigned to 576 different individuals using microsatellites genetic markers. During the winter 2023/24, spatial capture-recapture models estimated the wolf population size in France to be likely between 920 and 1125 individuals (95% credible interval). Detection probability varied spatially and was positively influenced by snow cover and accessibility. Wolf density was strongly associated with historical presence, reflecting the ongoing recolonization process from the Alps. This work illustrates the usefulness of non-invasive genetic data and spatial capture-recapture for large-scale population assessment. It also lays the ground for future improvements in monitoring to fully exploit the potential of spatial capture-recapture models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the systematics of Brevipalpus flat mites (Tenuipalpidae): phylogeny, species groups and cryptic diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phytophagous mites in the genus Brevipalpus (Tenuipalpidae) can be major pests, causing direct damage to their host plants or vectoring viruses. However, a phylogeny-based classification to understand their evolution and predict their bioecological aspects is lacking. Accurate species identification is crucial for studying pathosystem interactions, implementing quarantine measures, and developing control strategies. This study revisited the classification of Brevipalpus based on phylogenetic relationships, identifying cryptic species and determining genetic distance boundaries. A multi-tool exploration of DNA datasets, including mitochondrial (two COI regions) and nuclear (ITS2 and D1-D3) data combined with a detailed morphological study using light and scanning microscopy, was performed. Specimens were collected from 20 host plant families from South America, Europe, and the Middle East. Species were discriminated using three different approaches, namely, Automatic Barcode Gap Discovery (ABGD), Assemble Species by Automatic Partition (ASAP), and a local regression to establish consistent genetic distance thresholds. Results indicate that the current species-group classification only partially matches that based on genetic lineages. Some species currently classified as belonging to the phoenicis and cuneatus species groups were found to be polyphyletic and related to species placed in other species groups. A rearrangement of the species groups to align with the observed genetic lineages is proposed, and phylogenetically informative morphological traits are defined. Cryptic diversity in certain taxa was consistently confirmed by various methods. Nuclear and mitochondrial markers were essential for identifying candidate lineages when morphology alone was insufficient. Nuclear markers detected host-associated lineages within certain species. Inconsistencies between markers and methods suggest the presence of ongoing speciation processes, and hypotheses about speciation events were explored. Intra- and interspecific genetic distances and threshold values were determined for the four studied genomic fragments and can be used for routine taxonomic identification and uncovering cryptic lineages. Further research should combine genetic data, carefully selected markers, and thorough morphological analyses before proposing new species.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Multistability of Clonallike States in the Eigen Model: a Fidelity Catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eigen model is a prototypical toy model of evolution that is synonymous with the so-called error catastrophe: when mutation rates are sufficiently high, the genetic variant with the largest replication rate does not occupy the largest fraction of the total population because it acts as a source for the other variants. Here we show that, in the stochastic version of the Eigen model, there is also a fidelity catastrophe. This arises due to the state-dependence of fluctuations and occurs when rates of mutation fall beneath a certain threshold, which we calculate. The result is a type of noise-induced multistability whereupon the system stochastically switches between short-lived regimes of effectively clonal behavior by different genetic variants. Most notably, when the number of possible variants -- typically $\sim4^L$, with $L\gg 1$ the length of the genome -- is significantly larger than the population size, there is only a vanishingly small interval of mutation rates for which the Eigen model is neither in the fidelity- nor error-catastrophe regimes, seemingly subverting traditional expectations for evolutionary systems.</description>

      <title>Improving MSA Estimation through Adaptive Weight Vectors in MOEA/D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate phylogenetic inference from biological sequences depends critically on the quality of multiple sequence alignments, yet optimal alignment for many sequences is computationally intractable and sensitive to scoring choices. In this work we introduce MOEA/D-ADF, a novel variant of MOEA/D that adaptively adjusts subproblem weight vectors based on fitness variance to improve the exploration-exploitation trade-off. We combine MOEA/D-ADF with PMAO (PASTA with many application-aware optimization criteria) to form PMAO++, where PMAO-generated solutions are used to seed MOEA/D-ADF, which then evolves a population using 30 weight vectors to produce a diverse ensemble of alignment-tree pairs. PMAO++ outperforms the original PMAO on a majority of benchmark cases, achieving better false-negative (FN) rates on 12 of 17 BAliBASE-derived datasets and producing superior best-case trees, including several instances with zero FN rate. Beyond improving single best alignments, the rich set of alignment-tree pairs produced by PMAO++ is especially valuable for downstream summary methods (for example, consensus and summary-tree approaches), allowing more robust phylogenetic inference by integrating signal across multiple plausible alignments and trees. Certain dataset features, such as large terminal N/C extensions found in the RV40 group, remain challenging, but overall PMAO++ demonstrates clear advantages for sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. Future work will explore parameter tuning, larger benchmark suites, and tighter integration with summary-tree pipelines to further enhance applicability for biological sequence studies.</description>
