      <title>What are Switchbacks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solitary Alfv\'en wave model that exhibits nontrivial three-dimensional twisting of open magnetic field lines while preserving constant $|B|$. Embedded rotational discontinuities sharply deflect the otherwise uniform field lines, producing localized, large-amplitude field reversals in one-dimensional profiles that closely resemble the ``switchbacks'' observed by the Parker Solar Probe in the inner heliosphere. This indicates that switchbacks, as seen in one-dimensional spacecraft time series, arise from traversals through strongly curved segments of open magnetic field lines.</description>

      <title>Solar Energetic Particle Forecasting with Multi-Task Deep Learning: SEPNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events pose severe threats to spacecraft, astronaut safety, and aviation operations, accurate SEP forecasting remains a critical challenge in space weather research due to their complex origins and highly variable propagation. In this work, we built SEPNet, an innovative multi-task neural network that jointly predicts future solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and SEPs, incorporating long short-term memory and transformer architectures that capture contextual dependencies. SEPNet is a machine learning framework for SEP prediction that utilizes an extensive set of predictors, including solar flares, CMEs, and space-weather HMI active region patches (SHARP) magnetic field parameters. SEPNet is rigorously evaluated on the SEPVAL SEP dataset (whitman, 2025b), which is used to evaluate the performance of the current SEP prediction models. The performance of SEPNet is compared with classical machine learning methods and current state-of-the-art pre-eruptive SEP prediction models. The results show that SEPNet, particularly with SHARP parameters, achieves higher detection rates and skill scores while maintaining suitable for real-time space weather alert operations. Although class imbalance in the data leads to relatively high false alarm rates, SEPNet consistently outperforms reference methods and provides timely SEP forecasts, highlighting the capability of deep multi-task learning for next-generation space weather prediction. All data and code are available on GitHub at https://github.com/yuyian/SEP-Prediction.git.</description>

      <title>Deployable Prototype Testing and Control Allocation of the CABLESSail Concept for Solar Sail Shape Control and Momentum Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents prototype testing and a control allocation algorithm for the Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept aimed at performing momentum management of a solar sail. CABLESSail uses actuated cables routed along the structural booms of the solar sail to control the shape of the solar sail and changes the solar radiation pressure disturbance torques acting on it. Small-scale prototype tests of CABLESSail are presented in this paper, which demonstrate the effectiveness of cable actuation on deployable booms. A novel control allocation method is also presented in this paper that provides a computationally-efficient manner to determine the deformations required in each of the structural booms to impart the desired momentum management torque on the solar sail. Numerical simulation results with the proposed algorithm demonstrate robustness to uncertainty in the shape of the sail membrane, resulting in reliable generation of momentum management torques that exceed or meet the capabilities of state-of-the-art solar sail actuators. Both the prototype tests and control allocation methods presented in this paper represent key steps in raising the technology readiness level of the CABLESSail concept.</description>

      <title>Evidence for in situ particle energization during the May-2024 event based on ASPEX instrument on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction between interplanetary Coronal Mass Ejection (ICME) structures can alter the geo-effectiveness of the ICME events in myriad ways. Many aspects of these interaction processes are not well-understood till date. Using the energy spectra measured in two mutually orthogonal top hat analyzers (THA 1 and 2), which are part of the Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer (SWIS) subsystem of the Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on board India's Aditya L1 mission, we gain insights into intricate features of ICME ICME interactions during May 2024 solar event. We report here an unprecedented two-orthogonal-plane perspective of ICME ICME interactions for the first time from the L1 point. The investigation reveals a special interaction region formed by the propagation of the forward shock driven by complex ejecta in the preceding ICME. The interaction causes the formation of a downstream region spanning over 13 hours, which propagates in the interplanetary medium. The observations reveal that this region serves as a site for proton and alpha particle energization, and the particles within this region get distributed from one plane to the other. The presence of forward shock and particle energization is confirmed by the energetic particle flux measurements by the SupraThermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of ASPEX. These observations provide an unprecedented perspective on how solar wind ions become energized and distributed in an ICME-ICME interaction region.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Particle Energy Gain During Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The factors that control the maximum energy attained by protons and electrons during magnetic reconnection are investigated analytically and using large-scale simulations with the \textit{kglobal} model. Previous work revealed that a strong ambient guide field strongly impacts particle energy gain during reconnection, suppressing energy gain from Fermi reflection by increasing the radius of curvature of reconnected field lines. However, previous simulations have also shown that the maximum energy gain increases with the system size. The physical basis for this result has not been explored. We perform simulations that vary the effective system size over a large range to isolate the processes determining the maximum energy gain. The maximum energy $W_{max}$ is regulated by the number of magnetic-island mergers that occur, as multiple flux ropes that form at early time repeatedly merge until the largest approaches the system scale. Fermi reflection in these repeated mergers dominates particle energy gain. The number of mergers is linked to the effective system size -- larger systems produce a larger number of flux ropes and more mergers. That $W_{max}$ is linked to the number of flux rope mergers has implications for understanding why particle-in-cell simulations only produce powerlaw distributions of energetic particles with a limited range in energy.</description>

      <title>Citizen CATE 2024: Extending Totality During the 8 April 2024 Total Solar Eclipse with a Distributed Network of Community Participants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Citizen CATE 2024 next-generation experiment placed 43 identical telescope and camera setups along the path of totality during the total solar eclipse (TSE) on 8 April 2024 to capture a 60-minute movie of the inner and middle solar corona in polarized visible light. The 2024 TSE path covered a large geographic swath of North America and we recruited and trained 36 teams of community participants ("citizen scientists") representative of the various communities along the path of totality. Afterwards, these teams retained the equipment in their communities for ongoing education and public engagement activities. Participants ranged from students (K12, undergraduate, and graduate), educators, and adult learners to amateur and professional astronomers. In addition to equipment for their communities, CATE 2024 teams received hands-on telescope training, educational and learning materials, and instruction on data analysis techniques. CATE 2024 used high-cadence, high-dynamic-range (HDR) polarimetric observations of the solar corona to characterize the physical processes that shape its heating, structure, and evolution at scales and sensitivities that cannot be studied outside of a TSE. Conventional eclipse observations do not span sufficient time to capture changing coronal topology, but the extended observation from CATE 2024 does. Analysis of the fully calibrated dataset will provide deeper insight and understanding into these critical physical processes. We present an overview of the CATE 2024 project, including how we engaged local communities along the path of totality, and the first look at CATE 2024 data products from the 2024 TSE.</description>

      <title>Static and Dynamic Torque Generation Analysis of a Cable-Actuated Solar Sail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a static and dynamic torque analysis of the CABLESSail concept, which involves cables routed along the length of the flexible booms that hold the solar sail membrane in such a manner that tensioning the cables results in a bending deformation of the booms. This provides a mechanism where actuation of the cables can be used to create an imbalance in solar radiation pressure (SRP) on the sail and thus, impart SRP torques that can be used for momentum management of the solar sail. Simulation results are included that demonstrate how large SRP torques can be induced by tensioning the solar sail's cables, which can be used for momentum management. Comparisons to the existing active mass translator technology are included, along with simulations demonstrating the ability to reliably generate control torques in the presence of an uncertain sail membrane shape. An appendix contains a detailed derivation of the cable-actuated solar sail dynamic model used in this work.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Atmospheric Radiation: From Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements to Terrestrial Gamma-Ray Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21723v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a unified conceptual and observational framework that reinterprets these radiation bursts as manifestations of the same runaway processes happening at different atmospheric depths (Dual-stage model, DSM). We review recent results from satellite (ASIM), aircraft (ALOFT), balloon (HELEN), and ground-based (SEVAN and KANAZAWA) experiments to demonstrate the advantages of this integrated approach. This study addresses key contradictions in the field, introduces new classification criteria based on physics rather than detector location, and enhances our understanding of particle acceleration in thunderstorms.</description>

      <title>Probing Proton versus Electron Heating and Energization during Magnetic Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanisms controlling the relative heating and energization of electrons and protons during magnetic reconnection are explored. Simulations are carried out with the kglobal model, which produces bulk heating and the extended powerlaw distributions of both species that have been documented in observations. The simulations have been carried out with a range of proton-to-electron mass ratios and upstream temperatures to isolate the factors that control energy gain. The simulations reveal that when the upstream temperatures of the two species are equal, the proton heating and energization exceeds that of electrons and that this is a consequence of the much larger energy gain of protons on their first entry into the reconnection exhaust. The effective energy gain of protons on exhaust entry scales as $m_iC_A^2$ since the protons counterstream at the Alfv\'en speed $C_A$ while the initial electron energy gain is smaller by the factor $(\beta_{e0}m_e/m_i)^{1/2}$. Since Fermi reflection during flux rope merger dominates energy gain in large-scale reconnecting systems and the rate of energy gain is proportional to energy, protons continue to gain energy faster than electrons for the duration of the simulations, leading to temperature increments of protons exceeding that of electrons and the non-thermal energy content of protons also exceeding that of electrons.</description>
