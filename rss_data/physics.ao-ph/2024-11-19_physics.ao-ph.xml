      <title>ACE2: Accurately learning subseasonal to decadal atmospheric variability and forced responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing machine learning models of weather variability are not formulated to enable assessment of their response to varying external boundary conditions such as sea surface temperature and greenhouse gases. Here we present ACE2 (Ai2 Climate Emulator version 2) and its application to reproducing atmospheric variability over the past 80 years on timescales from days to decades. ACE2 is a 450M-parameter autoregressive machine learning emulator, operating with 6-hour temporal resolution, 1{\deg} horizontal resolution and eight vertical layers. It exactly conserves global dry air mass and moisture and can be stepped forward stably for arbitrarily many steps with a throughput of about 1500 simulated years per wall clock day. ACE2 generates emergent phenomena such as tropical cyclones, the Madden Julian Oscillation, and sudden stratospheric warmings. Furthermore, it accurately reproduces the atmospheric response to El Ni\~no variability and global trends of temperature over the past 80 years. However, its sensitivities to separately changing sea surface temperature and carbon dioxide are not entirely realistic.</description>

      <title>The role of Solar Activity in shaping Precipitation Extremes: A Regional Exploration in Kerala, India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been global attention focused on extreme climatic changes. The purpose of this paper is to explore the response of extreme precipitation events to solar activity, over Kerala, India. The three solar indices - sunspot number, F10.7 index, and cosmic ray intensity - are examined, and their relationship to rainfall is examined during a 57-year period (1965 - 2021), starting with Solar Cycle 20. Both solar and rainfall data are considered on an annual scale as well as on a seasonal scale by dividing them into winter, pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon seasons. The solar indices are used to calculate correlation coefficients with seasonal rainfall. Through correlation analysis, it is found that the precipitation in Kerala is correlated with the sunspot activity, but with different significance. When solar activity is high, the winter and monsoon seasons exhibit strong correlations with high significance. The solar influence at the regional level is also studied. The central and southern parts of Kerala appear to be influenced by the Sun during periods of high activity. The years with excess and deficiency of rainfall are calculated and compared with the solar indices. It was observed that the years with excessive and insufficient rainfall coincide with the years when the solar activity is at its highest or minimum. It is suggested that there is a physical link and a way to predict extreme rainfall events in Kerala based on the association between solar activity and those events.</description>

      <title>Efficient Spectral Element Method for the Euler Equations on Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mitigating the impact of waves leaving a numerical domain has been a persistent challenge in numerical modeling. Reducing wave reflection at the domain boundary is crucial for accurate simulations. Absorbing layers, while common, often incur significant computational costs. This paper introduces an efficient application of a Legendre-Laguerre basis for absorbing layers for two-dimensional non-linear compressible Euler equations. The method couples a spectral-element bounded domain with a semi-infinite region, employing a tensor product of Lagrange and scaled Laguerre basis functions. Semi-infinite elements are used in the absorbing layer with Rayleigh damping. In comparison to existing methods with similar absorbing layer extensions, this approach, a pioneering application to the Euler equations of compressible and stratified flows, demonstrates substantial computational savings. The study marks the first application of semi-infinite elements to mitigate wave reflection in the solution of the Euler equations, particularly in nonhydrostatic atmospheric modeling. A comprehensive set of tests demonstrates the method's versatility for general systems of conservation laws, with a focus on its effectiveness in damping vertically propagating mountain gravity waves, a benchmark for atmospheric models. Across all tests, the model presented in this paper consistently exhibits notable performance improvements compared to a traditional Rayleigh damping approach.</description>

      <title>FuXi Weather: A data-to-forecast machine learning system for global weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weather forecasting traditionally relies on numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems that integrates global observational systems, data assimilation (DA), and forecasting models. Despite steady improvements in forecast accuracy over recent decades, further advances are increasingly constrained by high computational costs, the underutilization of vast observational datasets, and the challenges of obtaining finer resolution. These limitations, alongside the uneven distribution of observational networks, result in global disparities in forecast accuracy, leaving some regions vulnerable to extreme weather. Recent advances in machine learning present a promising alternative, providing more efficient and accurate forecasts using the same initial conditions as NWP. However, current machine learning models still depend on the initial conditions generated by NWP systems, which require extensive computational resources and expertise. Here we introduce FuXi Weather, a machine learning weather forecasting system that assimilates data from multiple satellites. Operating on a 6-hourly DA and forecast cycle, FuXi Weather generates reliable and accurate 10-day global weather forecasts at a spatial resolution of $0.25^\circ$. FuXi Weather is the first system to achieve all-grid, all-surface, all-channel, and all-sky DA and forecasting, extending skillful forecast lead times beyond those of the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) high-resolution forecasts (HRES) while using significantly fewer observations. FuXi Weather consistently outperforms ECMWF HRES in observation-sparse regions, such as central Africa, demonstrating its potential to improve forecasts where observational infrastructure is limited.</description>
