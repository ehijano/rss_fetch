      <title>Generalized Non-Standard Finite Difference Method for Fractional PDEs on Non-Uniform Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Generalized Non-Standard Finite Difference (GNSFD) scheme for the numerical solution of a class of fractional partial differential equations (FrPDEs). The formulation of the method is grounded in optimization and leverages the fractional Taylor series (FrTS) expansion associated with Caputo fractional derivatives (FrDs). To discretize the time derivatives, the non-trivial denominator functions are utilized. The theoretical analysis establishes the consistency, stability, and convergence of the proposed scheme. Results are compared against existing methods to substantiate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the approach.</description>

      <title>SRaFTE: Super-Resolution and Future Time Extrapolation for Time-Dependent PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SRaFTE (Super-Resolution and Future Time Extrapolation), a two-phase learning framework that couples coarse grid solvers with neural operators to super-resolve and forecast fine grid dynamics for time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs). In our construction, Phase 1 learns a super-resolution map from coarse to fine solutions, while Phase 2 embeds this operator in a predictor-corrector loop with the coarse solver, forming an operator composition that serves as a surrogate fine grid propagator for future-time extrapolation. We benchmark SRaFTE on three canonical two-dimensional PDEs of increasing dynamical complexity: the heat equation, the wave equation, and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Compared to well-known benchmarks, SRaFTE provides reliable super-resolution in Phase 1 and delivers consistently accurate long-term forecasts in Phase 2 across all three examples for new test data. Our results suggest that coupling a learned super-resolution operator with a coarse grid solver provides an effective and efficient means of modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly when the dynamics of the PDEs at the coarse and fine resolutions exhibit pronounced scale separation.</description>

      <title>Transmission Conditions for the Non-Overlapping Schwarz Coupling of Full Order and Operator Inference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates transmission conditions for the domain decomposition-based coupling of subdomain-local models using the non-overlapping Schwarz alternating method (NO-SAM). Building on prior efforts involving overlapping SAM (O-SAM), we formulate and assess two NO-SAM variants, based on alternating Dirichlet-Neumann and Robin-Robin transmission conditions. For the subdomain-local models, we consider a mix of full order models (FOMs) and non-intrusive reduced order models (ROMs) constructed via an emerging model reduction technique known as operator inference (OpInf). Of particular novelty is the first application of NO-SAM to couple non-intrusive OpInf ROMs with each other, and with FOMs. Numerical studies on a one-dimensional linear elastic wave propagation benchmark problem demonstrate that transmission condition choice and parameter tuning significantly impact convergence rate, accuracy, and stability. Robin-Robin coupling often yields faster convergence than alternating Dirichlet-Neumann, though improper parameter selection can induce spurious oscillations at subdomain interfaces. For FOM-OpInf and OpInf-OpInf couplings, sufficient modal content in the ROM basis improves accuracy and mitigates instability, in some cases outperforming the coupled FOM-FOM reference solutions in both accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight NO-SAM's potential for enabling flexible, non-intrusive, and efficient multi-model coupling across independently meshed subdomains, while emphasizing the need for careful interface condition design in higher-dimensional and predictive settings.</description>

      <title>Bi-fidelity Interpolative Decomposition for Multimodal Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-fidelity simulation is a widely used strategy to reduce the computational cost of many-query numerical simulation tasks such as uncertainty quantification, design space exploration, and design optimization. The reduced basis approach based on bi-fidelity interpolative decomposition is one such approach, which identifies a reduced basis, along with an interpolation rule in that basis, from low-fidelity samples to approximate the corresponding high-fidelity samples. However, as illustrated in the present study, when the model response is multi-modal and mode occupancy is stochastic, the assumptions underpinning this approach may not hold, thus leading to inaccurate estimates. We introduce the multi-modal interpolative decomposition method using bi-fidelity data, an extension tailored for this use case. Our work is motivated by a complex engineering application: a laser-ignited methane-oxygen rocket combustor evaluated over uncertain input parameters, exhibiting a bifurcation-like phenomenon in some regions of parameter space. Unlike the standard bi-fidelity interpolative decomposition approach, the proposed method can approximate a dataset of high-fidelity simulations for 16\% of the cost, while maintaining relatively high correlation (0.70--0.90) with parameter sensitivities.</description>

      <title>A Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework Using Petrov-Galerkin Method for Solving Singularly Perturbed Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a Variational Physics-Informed Neural Network (VPINN) framework that integrates the Petrov-Galerkin formulation with deep neural networks (DNNs) for solving one-dimensional singularly perturbed boundary value problems (BVPs) and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) involving one or two small parameters. The method adopts a nonlinear approximation in which the trial space is defined by neural network functions, while the test space is constructed from hat functions. The weak formulation is constructed using localized test functions, with interface penalty terms introduced to enhance numerical stability and accurately capture boundary layers. Dirichlet boundary conditions are imposed via hard constraints, and source terms are computed using automatic differentiation. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing significantly improved accuracy in both the $L_2$ and maximum norms compared to the standard VPINN approach for one-dimensional singularly perturbed differential equations (SPDEs).</description>

      <title>Dynamical symmetry breaking described by cubic nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical symmetry breaking associated with the existence and non-existence of breather solutions is studied. Here, nonlinear hyperbolic evolution equations are calculated using a high-precision numerical scheme. %%% First, for clarifying the dynamical symmetry breaking, it is necessary to use a sufficiently high-precision scheme in the time-dependent framework. Second, the error of numerical calculations is generally more easily accumulated for calculating hyperbolic equations rather than parabolic equations. Third, numerical calculations become easily unstable for nonlinear cases. Our strategy for the high-precision and stable scheme is to implement the implicit Runge-Kutta method for time, and the Fourier spectral decomposition for space. %%% In this paper, focusing on the breather solutions, the relationship between the velocity, mass, and the amplitude of the perturbation is clarified. As a result, the conditions for transitioning from one state to another are clarified.</description>

      <title>The Green's Function on Rhombic Flat Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the Green's function $G$ for any flat rhombic torus $T$, always with numerical values of significant digits up to the fourth decimal place (noting that $G$ is unique for $|T|=1$ and $\int_TGdA=0$). This precision is guaranteed by the strategies we adopt, which include theorems such as the Legendre Relation, properties of the Weierstra\ss\,P-Function, and also the algorithmic control of numerical errors. Our code uses complex integration routines developed by H. Karcher, who also introduced the symmetric P-Weierstra\ss\,function, and these resources simplify the computation of elliptic functions considerably.</description>

      <title>Data-driven balanced truncation for linear systems with quadratic outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the framework for a non-intrusive, quadrature-based method for approximate balanced truncation (QuadBT) of linear systems with quadratic outputs, thus extending the applicability of QuadBT, which was originally designed for data-driven balanced truncation of standard linear systems with linear outputs only. The new approach makes use of the time-domain and frequency-domain quadrature-based representation of the system's infinite Gramians, only implicitly. We show that by sampling solely the extended impulse responses of the original system and their derivatives (or the corresponding transfer functions), we construct a reduced-order model that mimics the approximation quality of the intrusive (projection-based) balanced truncation. We validate the proposed framework on a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for Stokes flow in complex branched structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Slow, viscous flow in branched structures arises in many biological and engineering settings. Direct numerical simulation of flow in such complicated multi-scale geometry, however, is a computationally intensive task. We propose a scattering theory framework that dramatically reduces this cost by decomposing networks into components connected by short straight channels. Exploiting the phenomenon of rapid return to Poiseuille flow (Saint-Venant's principle in the context of elasticity), we compute a high-order accurate scattering matrix for each component via boundary integral equations. These precomputed components can then be assembled into arbitrary branched structures, and the precomputed local solutions on each component can be assembled into an accurate global solution. The method is modular, has negligible cost, and appears to be the first full-fidelity solver that makes use of the return to Poiseuille flow phenomenon. In our two-dimensional examples, it matches the accuracy of full-domain solvers while requiring only a fraction of the computational effort.</description>

      <title>An efficient splitting iteration for a CDA-accelerated solver for incompressible flow problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose, analyze, and test an efficient splitting iteration for solving the incompressible, steady Navier-Stokes equations in the setting where partial solution data is known. The (possibly noisy) solution data is incorporated into a Picard-type solver via continuous data assimilation (CDA). Efficiency is gained over the usual Picard iteration through an algebraic splitting of Yosida-type that produces easier linear solves, and accuracy/consistency is shown to be maintained through the use of an incremental pressure and grad-div stabilization. We prove that CDA scales the Lipschitz constant of the associated fixed point operator by $H^{1/2}$, where $H$ is the characteristic spacing of the known solution data. This implies that CDA accelerates an already converging solver (and the more data, the more acceleration) and enables convergence of solvers in parameter regimes where the solver would fail (and the more data, the larger the parameter regime). Numerical tests illustrate the theory on several benchmark test problems and show that the proposed efficient solver gives nearly identical results in terms of number of iterations to converge; in other words, the proposed solver gives an efficiency gain with no loss in convergence rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an immersed $C^0$ interior penalty method for solving two-dimensional biharmonic interface problems on unfitted meshes. To accommodate the biharmonic interface conditions, high-order immersed finite element (IFE) spaces are constructed in the least-squares sense. We establish key properties of these spaces including unisolvency and partition of unity are, and verify their optimal approximation capability. These spaces are further incorporated into a modified $C^0$ interior penalty scheme with additional penalty terms on interface segments. The well-posedness of the discrete solution is proved. Numerical experiments with various interface geometries confirm optimal convergence of the proposed method in $L^2$, $H^1$ and $H^2$ norms.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Localized Orthogonal Decomposition for Numerical Homogenization of Diffusion Operators with Random Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a neural network--enhanced surrogate modeling approach for diffusion problems with spatially varying random field coefficients. The method builds on numerical homogenization, which compresses fine-scale coefficients into coarse-scale surrogates without requiring periodicity. To overcome computational bottlenecks, we train a neural network to map fine-scale coefficient samples to effective coarse-scale information, enabling the construction of accurate surrogates at the target resolution. This framework allows for the fast and efficient compression of new coefficient realizations, thereby ensuring reliable coarse models and supporting scalable computations for large ensembles of random coefficients. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through systematic numerical experiments for two classes of coefficients, emphasizing the influence of coefficient contrast: (i) lognormal diffusion coefficients, a standard model for uncertain subsurface structures in geophysics, and (ii) hierarchical Gaussian random fields with random correlation lengths.</description>

      <title>Finite element method for a constant time delay subdiffusion equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers to numerically solve a subdiffusion equation involving constant time delay $\tau$ and Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative. First, a fully discrete finite element scheme is developed for the considered problem under the symmetric graded time mesh, where the Caputo fractional derivative is approximated via the L1 formula, while the Riemann-Liouville integral is discretized using the fractional right rectangular rule. Under the assumption that the exact solution has low regularities at $t=0$ and $\tau$, the local truncation errors of both the L1 formula and the fractional right rectangular rule are analyzed. It is worth noting that, by setting the mesh parameter $r=1$, the symmetric graded time mesh will degenerate to a uniform mesh. Consequently, we proceed to discuss the stability and convergence of the proposed numerical scheme under two scenarios. For the uniform time mesh, by introducing a discrete sequence $\{P_k\}$, the unconditional stability and local time error estimate for the developed scheme is established. Conversely, on the symmetric graded time mesh, through the introduction of a discrete fractional Gronwall inequality, the stability and globally optimal time error estimate can be obtained. Finally, some numerical tests are presented to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Variational data assimilation for the wave equation in heterogeneous media: Numerical investigation of stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several numerical methods for solving the unique continuation problem for the wave equation in a homogeneous medium with given data on the lateral boundary of the space-time cylinder have been proposed. This problem enjoys Lipschitz stability if the geometric control condition is fulfilled, which allows devising optimally convergent numerical methods. In this article, we investigate whether these results carry over to the case in which the medium exhibits a jump discontinuity. Our numerical experiments suggest a positive answer. However, we also observe that the presence of discontinuities in the medium renders the computations far more demanding than in the homogeneous case.</description>

      <title>Elementary differentials from multi-indices to rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rooted trees are essential for describing numerical schemes via the so-called B-series. They have also been used extensively in rough analysis for expanding solutions of singular Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDEs). When one considers scalar-valued equations, the most efficient combinatorial set is multi-indices. In this paper, we investigate the existence of intermediate combinatorial sets that will lie between multi-indices and rooted trees. We provide a negative result stating that there is no combinatorial set encoding elementary differentials in dimension $d\neq 1$, and compatible with the rooted trees and the multi-indices aside from the rooted trees. This does not close the debate of the existence of such combinatorial sets, but it shows that it cannot be obtained via a naive and natural approach.</description>

Abstract: We develop numerical schemes and sensitivity methods for stochastic models of proton transport that couple energy loss, range straggling and angular diffusion. For the energy equation we introduce a logarithmic Milstein scheme that guarantees positivity and achieves strong order one convergence. For the angular dynamics we construct a Lie-group integrator. The combined method maintains the natural geometric invariants of the system.
  We formulate dose deposition as a regularised path-dependent functional, obtaining a pathwise sensitivity estimator that is consistent and implementable. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed schemes achieve the expected convergence rates and provide stable estimates of dose sensitivities.</description>

      <title>A Tensor Train-Based Isogeometric Solver for Large-Scale 3D Poisson Problems on Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional (3D) fully tensor train (TT)-assembled isogeometric analysis (IGA) framework, TT-IGA, for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on complex geometries. Our method reformulates IGA discrete operators into TT format, enabling efficient compression and computation while retaining geometric flexibility and accuracy. Unlike previous low-rank approaches that typically rely on structured domains, our framework accommodates general 3D geometries through low-rank TT representations of both the geometry mapping and the PDE discretization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TT-IGA framework on the 3D Poisson equation, achieving substantial reductions in memory usage and computational cost without compromising solution quality.</description>

      <title>A generalized reduction scheme for the Stochastic Weighted Particle Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stochastic Weighted Particle Method (SWPM) of Rjasanow and Wagner is a generalization of the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo method for computing the probability density function of the velocities of a system of interacting particles for applications that include rarefied gas dynamics and plasma processing systems. Key components of a SWPM simulation are a particle grouping technique and particle reduction scheme. These are periodically applied to reduce the computational cost of simulations due to the gradual increase in the number of stochastic particles. A general framework for designing particle reduction schemes is introduced that enforces the preservation of a prescribed set of moments of the distribution through the construction and explicit solution of a system of linear equations for particle weights in terms of particle velocities and the moments to be preserved. This framework is applied to preserve all moments of the distribution up to order three. Numerical simulations are performed to verify the scheme and quantify the degree to which even higher-order moments and tail functionals are preserved. These results reveal an unexpected trade off between the preservation of these higher-order moments and tail functionals.</description>

      <title>Forward Euler for Wasserstein Gradient Flows: Breakdown and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wasserstein gradient flows have become a central tool for optimization problems over probability measures. A natural numerical approach is forward-Euler time discretization. We show, however, that even in the simple case where the energy functional is the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence against a smooth target density, forward-Euler can fail dramatically: the scheme does not converge to the gradient flow, despite the fact that the first variation $\nabla\frac{\delta F}{\delta\rho}$ remains formally well defined at every step. We identify the root cause as a loss of regularity induced by the discretization, and prove that a suitable regularization of the functional restores the necessary smoothness, making forward-Euler a viable solver that converges in discrete time to the global minimizer.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernels via Parameter-Space Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator. We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.</description>

      <title>PBPK-iPINNs : Inverse Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic Brain Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) leverage machine learning with differential equations to solve direct and inverse problems, ensuring predictions follow physical laws. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling advances beyond classical compartmental approaches by using a mechanistic, physiology focused framework. A PBPK model is based on a system of ODEs, with each equation representing the mass balance of a drug in a compartment, such as an organ or tissue. These ODEs include parameters that reflect physiological, biochemical, and drug-specific characteristics to simulate how the drug moves through the body. In this paper, we introduce PBPK-iPINN, a method to estimate drug-specific or patient-specific parameters and drug concentration profiles in PBPK brain compartment models using inverse PINNs. We demonstrate that, for the inverse problem to converge to the correct solution, the loss function components (data loss, initial conditions loss, and residual loss) must be appropriately weighted, and parameters (including number of layers, number of neurons, activation functions, learning rate, optimizer, and collocation points) must be carefully tuned. The performance of the PBPK-iPINN approach is then compared with established traditional numerical and statistical methods.</description>

      <title>The Immersed Skeletal Finite Element Method for Elliptic Interface Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new immersed finite element scheme for solving elliptic interface problems on unfitted meshes by combining the skeletal finite element method (FEM) with the standard FEM. The skeletal FEM is used for the interface elements. In other words, we take piecewise functions as the unknowns inside the interface element and on its boundary. We employ the immersed finite element functions as interior functions that precisely satisfy the interface conditions. On the interface edges, we define two boundary functions to capture the discontinuity. The Lagrange element is used for the non-interface elements. The proposed scheme is simple and flexible. We prove that this scheme achieves optimal convergence orders in both the $H^1$ norm and $L^2$ norm. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>A locally-conservative proximal Galerkin method for pointwise bound constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first-order system proximal Galerkin (FOSPG) method, a locally mass-conserving, hybridizable finite element method for solving heterogeneous anisotropic diffusion and obstacle problems. Like other proximal Galerkin methods, FOSPG finds solutions by solving a recursive sequence of smooth, discretized, nonlinear subproblems. We establish the well-posedness and convergence of these nonlinear subproblems along with stability and error estimates under low regularity assumptions for the linearized equations obtained by solving each subproblem using Newton's method. The FOSPG method exhibits several advantages, including high-order accuracy, discrete maximum principle or bound-preserving discrete solutions, and local mass conservation. It also achieves prescribed solution accuracy within asymptotically mesh-independent numbers of subproblems and linear solves per subproblem iteration. Numerical experiments on benchmarks for anisotropic diffusion and obstacle problems confirm these attributes. Furthermore, an open-source implementation of the method is provided to facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Transition Density Expansion for Elliptic and Hypo-Elliptic SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a closed-form expansion for the transition density of elliptic and hypo-elliptic multivariate Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), over a period $\Delta\in (0,1)$, in terms of powers of $\Delta^{j/2}$, $j\ge 0$. Our methodology provides approximations of the transition density, easily evaluated via any software that performs symbolic calculations. A major part of the paper is devoted to an analytical control of the remainder in our expansion for fixed $\Delta\in(0,1)$. The obtained error bounds validate theoretically the methodology, by characterising the size of the distance from the true value. It is the first time that such a closed-form expansion becomes available for the important class of hypo-elliptic SDEs, to the best of our knowledge. For elliptic SDEs, closed-form expansions are available, with some works identifying the size of the error for fixed $\Delta$, as per our contribution. Our methodology allows for a uniform treatment of elliptic and hypo-elliptic SDEs, when earlier works are intrinsically restricted to an elliptic setting. We show numerical applications highlighting the effectiveness of our method, by carrying out parameter inference for hypo-elliptic SDEs that do not satisfy stated conditions. The latter are sufficient for controlling the remainder terms, but the closed-form expansion itself is applicable in general settings.</description>

Abstract: We present a structure-preserving and thermodynamically consistent numerical scheme for classical magnetohydrodynamics, incorporating viscosity, magnetic resistivity, heat transfer, and thermoelectric effect. The governing equations are shown to be derived from a generalized Hamilton's principle, with the resulting weak formulation being mimicked at the discrete level. The resulting numerical method conserves mass and energy, satisfies Gauss' magnetic law and magnetic helicity balance, and adheres to the Second Law of Thermodynamics, all at the fully discrete level. It is shown to perform well on magnetic Rayleigh-B\'enard convection.</description>

      <title>Pass-efficient Randomized Algorithms for Low-rank Approximation of Quaternion Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation of quaternion matrices have gained increasing attention in recent years. However, existing methods overlook pass efficiency, the ability to limit the number of passes over the input matrix-which is critical in modern computing environments dominated by communication costs. We address this gap by proposing a suite of pass-efficient randomized algorithms that let users directly trade pass budget for approximation accuracy. Our contributions include: (i) a family of arbitrary-pass randomized algorithms for low-rank approximation of quaternion matrices that operate under a user-specified number of matrix views, and (ii) a pass-efficient extension of block Krylov subspace methods that accelerates convergence for matrices with slowly decaying spectra. Furthermore, we establish spectral norm error bounds showing that the expected approximation error decays exponentially with the number of passes. Finally, we validate our framework through extensive numerical experiments and demonstrate its practical relevance across multiple applications, including quaternionic data compression, matrix completion, image super-resolution, and deep learning.</description>

      <title>AirBreath Sensing: Protecting Over-the-Air Distributed Sensing Against Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A distinctive function of sixth-generation (6G) networks is the integration of distributed sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) to enable intelligent perception of the physical world. This resultant platform, termed integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), is envisioned to enable a broad spectrum of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, including remote surgery, autonomous driving, and holographic telepresence. Recently, the communication bottleneck confronting the implementation of an ISEA system is overcome by the development of over-the-air computing (AirComp) techniques, which facilitate simultaneous access through over-the-air data feature fusion. Despite its advantages, AirComp with uncoded transmission remains vulnerable to interference. To tackle this challenge, we propose AirBreath sensing, a spectrum-efficient framework that cascades feature compression and spread spectrum to mitigate interference without bandwidth expansion. This work reveals a fundamental tradeoff between these two operations under a fixed bandwidth constraint: increasing the compression ratio may reduce sensing accuracy but allows for more aggressive interference suppression via spread spectrum, and vice versa. This tradeoff is regulated by a key variable called breathing depth, defined as the feature subspace dimension that matches the processing gain in spread spectrum. To optimally control the breathing depth, we mathematically characterize and optimize this aforementioned tradeoff by designing a tractable surrogate for sensing accuracy, measured by classification discriminant gain (DG). Experimental results on real datasets demonstrate that AirBreath sensing effectively mitigates interference in ISEA systems, and the proposed control algorithm achieves near-optimal performance as benchmarked with a brute-force search.</description>

      <title>Mesoscale FEM Model of Concrete: Statistical Assessment of Inherent Stress Concentrations in Dependence on Phase Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concrete heterogeneity originates from its production process, which involves bonding aggregates with a binder matrix. This study presents a mesoscale finite element model (MFEM) that offers detailed insights into the fracture process at the aggregate--cement matrix interface, focusing on one of concrete's key properties: its mechanical response. Unlike discrete models, which often average out critical stress concentrations within the mesostructure, the MFEM approach captures detailed stress distributions, revealing localized effects crucial for understanding damage evolution.
  Although computationally more demanding, the MFEM leverages modern high-performance computing (HPC) to provide a detailed description of the stress field and material damage across different phases and interfaces. The proposed modeling framework integrates a collision-checked aggregate generation procedure, Voronoi-based mesostructure construction, and adaptive 3D meshing, forming a reusable methodology for stress analysis in heterogeneous composites. This approach offers transparent, physically interpretable parameterization of phase properties in contrast to black-box discrete models.
  Another methodological contribution is the statistical post-processing of stress data using histogram-based analysis across cross-sectional planes. This enables quantitative evaluation of stress concentration distributions, providing valuable insights into the mesoscale mechanical response and serving as a useful visualization tool for researchers working on heterogeneous material modeling. Various matrix-to-aggregate stiffness ratios are considered to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on the stress field.</description>

      <title>Quantifying The Limits of AI Reasoning: Systematic Neural Network Representations of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic, tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning; e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly emulated by a NN.</description>

Abstract: Complex systems of interacting components often can be modeled by a simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ that consists of a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $m$ edges. Such a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A\in\R^{n\times n}$, whose $(ij)$th entry is one if there is an edge pointing from node $i$ to node $j$, and is zero otherwise. The matrix $A$ and its positive integer powers reveal important properties of the graph and allow the construction of the path length matrix $L$ for the graph. The $(ij)$th entry of $L$ is the length of the shortest path from node $i$ to node $j$; if there is no path between these nodes, then the value of the entry is set to $\infty$. We are interested in how well information flows via shortest paths of the graph. This can be studied with the aid of the path length matrix. The path length matrix allows the definition of several measures of communication in the network defined by the graph such as the global $K$-efficiency, which considers shortest paths that are made up of at most $K$ edges for some $K&lt;n$, as well as the number of such shortest paths. Novel notions of connectivity introduced in this paper help us understand the importance of specific edges for the flow of information through the graph. This is of interest when seeking to simplify a network by removing selected edges or trying to assess the sensitivity of the flow of information to changes due to exterior causes such as a traffic stoppage on a road network.</description>
