      <title>An inherent regularization approach to parameter-free preconditioning for nearly incompressible linear poroelasticity and elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inherent regularization strategy and block Schur complement preconditioning are studied for linear poroelasticity problems discretized using the lowest-order weak Galerkin FEM in space and the implicit Euler scheme in time. At each time step, the resulting saddle point system becomes nearly singular in the locking regime, where the solid is nearly incompressible. This near-singularity stems from the leading block, which corresponds to a linear elasticity system. To enable efficient iterative solution, this nearly singular system is first reformulated as a saddle point problem and then regularized by adding a term to the (2,2) block. This regularization preserves the solution while ensuring the non-singularity of the new system. As a result, block Schur complement preconditioning becomes effective. It is shown that the preconditioned MINRES and GMRES converge essentially independent of the mesh size and the locking parameter. Both two- and three-field formulations are considered for the iterative solution of the linear poroelasticity. The efficient solution of the two-field formulation builds upon the effective iterative solution of linear elasticity. For this case, MINRES and GMRES achieve parameter-free convergence when used with block Schur complement preconditioning, where the inverse of the leading block leverages efficient solvers for linear elasticity. The poroelasticity problem can also be reformulated as a three-field system by introducing a numerical pressure variable into the linear elasticity part. The inherent regularization strategy extends naturally to this formulation, and preconditioned MINRES and GMRES also show parameter-free convergence for the regularized system. Numerical experiments in both two and three dimensions confirm the effectiveness of the regularization strategy and the robustness of the block preconditioners.</description>

      <title>Pulsatile Flows for Simplified Smart Fluids with Variable Power-Law: Analysis and Numerics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fully-developed, time-periodic motion of a shear-dependent non-Newtonian fluid with variable exponent rheology through an infinite pipe $\Omega:= \mathbb{R}\times \Sigma\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \{2,3\}$, of arbitrary cross-section $\Sigma\subseteq \mathbb{R}^{d-1}$. The focus is on a generalized $p(\cdot)$-fluid model, where the power-law index is position-dependent (with respect to $\Sigma$), $\textit{i.e.}$, a function $p\colon \Sigma\to (1,+\infty)$. We prove the existence of time-periodic solutions with either assigned time-periodic flow-rate or pressure-drop, generalizing known results for the Navier-Stokes and for $p$-fluid equations.
  In addition, we identify explicit solutions, relevant as benchmark cases, especially for electro-rheological fluids or, more generally, $\textit{`smart fluids'}$. To support practical applications, we present a fully-constructive existence proof for variational solutions by means of a fully-discrete finite-differences/-elements discretization, consistent with our numerical experiments. Our approach, which unifies the treatment of all values of $p(\overline{x})\in (1,+\infty)$, $\overline{x}\in \Sigma$, without requiring an auxiliary Newtonian term, provides new insights even in the constant exponent case. The theoretical findings are reviewed by means of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A surrogate model for topology optimisation of elastic structures via parametric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A surrogate-based topology optimisation algorithm for linear elastic structures under parametric loads and boundary conditions is proposed. Instead of learning the parametric solution of the state (and adjoint) problems or the optimisation trajectory as a function of the iterations, the proposed approach devises a surrogate version of the entire optimisation pipeline. First, the method predicts a quasi-optimal topology for a given problem configuration as a surrogate model of high-fidelity topologies optimised with the homogenisation method. This is achieved by means of a feed-forward net learning the mapping between the input parameters characterising the system setup and a latent space determined by encoder/decoder blocks reducing the dimensionality of the parametric topology optimisation problem and reconstructing a high-dimensional representation of the topology. Then, the predicted topology is used as an educated initial guess for a computationally efficient algorithm penalising the intermediate values of the design variable, while enforcing the governing equations of the system. This step allows the method to correct potential errors introduced by the surrogate model, eliminate artifacts, and refine the design in order to produce topologies consistent with the underlying physics. Different architectures are proposed and the approximation and generalisation capabilities of the resulting models are numerically evaluated. The quasi-optimal topologies allow to outperform the high-fidelity optimiser by reducing the average number of optimisation iterations by $53\%$ while achieving discrepancies below $4\%$ in the optimal value of the objective functional, even in the challenging scenario of testing the model to extrapolate beyond the training and validation domain.</description>

      <title>A Structure-Preserving Rational Integrator for the Replicator Dynamics on the Probability Simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a quadratically convergent and dynamically consistent integrator specifically designed for the replicator dynamics. The proposed scheme combines a two-stage rational approximation with a normalization step to ensure confinement to the probability simplex and unconditional preservation of non-negativity, invariant sets and equilibria. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to establish the scheme's second-order accuracy, and an embedded auxiliary method is devised for adaptive time-stepping based on local error estimation. Furthermore, a discrete analogue of the quotient rule, which governs the evolution of component ratios, is shown to hold. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, illustrating the method's ability to reproduce complex dynamics and to outperform well-established solvers in particularly challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tropical solution of discrete best approximation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discrete best approximation problems in the setting of tropical algebra that is concerned with the theory and application of algebraic systems with idempotent operations. Given a set of input-output pairs of an unknown function defined on a tropical semifield, the problem is to determine an approximating rational function formed by two Puiseux polynomials as numerator and denominator. With specified numbers of monomials in both polynomials, the approximation aims at evaluating the exponent and coefficient for each monomial in the polynomials to fit the rational function to the data in the sense of a tropical distance function. To solve the problem, we transform it into approximation of a vector equation with unknown vectors on both sides, where one side corresponds to the numerator polynomial and the other side to the denominator. Each side involves a matrix with entries dependent on the unknown exponents, multiplied by the vector of unknown coefficients of monomials. We propose an algorithm that constructs a series of approximate solutions by alternately fixing one side of the equation to an already found result and leaving the other intact. Each equation obtained is approximated with respect to the vector of coefficients, which yields a vector of coefficients and approximation error both parameterized by the exponents. The exponents are found by minimizing the error with an optimization procedure based on agglomerative clustering technique. To illustrate, we present results for approximation problems in terms of max-plus algebra (a real semifield with addition defined as maximum and multiplication as arithmetic addition), which correspond to ordinary problems of piecewise linear approximation of real functions. As our numerical experience shows, the proposed algorithm converges in a finite number of steps and provides a reasonable solution to the problems considered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyse a new conforming space-time Galerkin discretisation of a semi-linear wave equation, based on a variational formulation derived from De Giorgi's elliptic regularisation viewpoint of the wave equation in second-order formulation. The method is shown to be well-posed through a minimisation approach, and also unconditionally stable for all choices of conforming discretisation spaces. Further, a priori error bounds are proven for sufficiently smooth solutions. Special attention is given to the conditioning of the method and its stable implementation. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz boundary integral methods and the pollution effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with solving the Helmholtz exterior Dirichlet and Neumann problems with large wavenumber $k$ and smooth obstacles using the standard second-kind boundary integral equations (BIEs) for these problems. We consider Galerkin and collocation methods - with subspaces consisting of $\textit{either}$ piecewise polynomials (in 2-d for collocation, in any dimension for Galerkin) $\textit{or}$ trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d) - as well as a fully discrete quadrature (a.k.a., Nystr\"om) method based on trigonometric polynomials (in 2-d).
  For each of these methods, we address the fundamental question: how quickly must $N$, the dimension of the approximation space, grow with $k$ to maintain accuracy as $k\to\infty$? For the methods involving piecewise-polynomials, we give sufficient conditions for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Galerkin method we prove that these are, in fact, necessary and sufficient. In particular, we prove that, when applied to the Neumann BIEs when the obstacle is a ball, the Galerkin method $\textit{suffers from the pollution effect}$; i.e., $N$ growing like $k^{d-1}$ is not sufficient for $k$-uniform quasi-optimality. For the Dirichlet BIEs, we prove that pollution occurs for the ball for certain choices of coupling parameter, and we give numerical experiments illustrating pollution for trapping domains with the standard coupling parameter. For all the methods involving trigonometric polynomials, we show that, up to potential factors of $k^\varepsilon$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, these methods do not suffer from the pollution effect (even for trapping obstacles).
  These are the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of collocation or Nystr\"om methods applied to the Dirichlet BIEs, and the first results about $k$-explicit convergence of any method used to solve the standard second-kind Neumann BIEs.</description>

      <title>Numerical Methods for Solving Nonlinearly Coupled Poisson Equations in Dual-Continuum Modeled Porous Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Porous electrodes are widely used in electrochemical systems, where accurately determining electric potentials, particularly overpotentials, is essential for understanding electrode behavior. At the macroscopic scale, porous electrodes are typically modeled using a dual-continuum approach, treating the porous solid phase and the liquid electrolyte as spatially superimposed domains. Determining potential distributions requires solving two Poisson equations that are nonlinearly coupled through Butler-Volmer kinetics under galvanostatic and potentiostatic operating modes. Under galvanostatic operation, these equations form an underconstrained singular system due to all-Neumann boundary conditions, posing numerical challenges. This paper systematically presents numerical methods for solving nonlinearly coupled Poisson equations in dual-continuum porous electrodes, with a particular focus on galvanostatic solutions. We mathematically establish solution uniqueness in terms of the potential difference between the electrode and electrolyte (or overpotential), as well as the individual potentials up to a shared constant shift. To resolve the nonuniqueness of the solution, we introduce three numerical approaches: (1) Lagrange Constrained Method (LCM), (2) Dirichlet Substitution Method (DSM), and (3) Global Constraining Method (GCM), where GCM enables solving the overpotential without imposing an explicit system reference potential. Additionally, we develop both decoupled and fully coupled nonlinear solution strategies and evaluate their computational performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous conductivity cases. The presented numerical methods are general for addressing similar underconstrained nonlinear systems. A Python implementation is provided at https://github.com/harrywang1129/porous_electrode_solver.</description>

      <title>Dynamic analysis of free-free Timoshenko beams on elastic foundation under transverse transient ground deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Underground infrastructure, such as pipelines and tunnels, can be vulnerable to the effect of transient ground deformation (TGD) caused by different vibration sources, including earthquakes and traffic loads. Current design methods are based on simple analytical models that idealize the soil movement as a traveling sinusoidal wave, neglecting both the system's inertia and the relative displacement at the soil-structure interface. However, this assumption may not be valid for buried large diameter pipelines and tunnels requiring accurate dynamic analysis. To analyse the dynamic response of a buried straight beam subjected to transverse TGD, this study develops a new semi-analytical model based on the Timoshenko beam on Winkler foundation theory. The closed-form analytical solution revealed that the vibration spectrum is divided in four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. Across each transition frequency, the oscillatory characteristics of the vibration modes change, significantly affecting the dynamic response of the system. To verify the validity of the proposed model, this work analyses the case study of a buried steel water pipeline of varying lengths and operating conditions, subjected to transverse TGD. Comparison of the obtained analytical solutions with the finite element analysis results showed excellent agreement between the two approaches. The frequency response analysis revealed dynamic amplification of the soil-structure interaction for forcing frequencies near the system's fundamental frequency. These may fall within the range of dominant frequencies characterizing seismic waves, requiring accurate dynamic analysis. The proposed methodology provides a robust analytical framework for evaluating the primary factors impacting the dynamic behavior of buried beams, giving a deeper understanding of the system response under various sources of ground vibration.</description>

      <title>Numerical Fredholm determinants for matrix-valued kernels on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a numerical method for computing Fredholm determinants of trace class and Hilbert Schmidt integral operators defined in terms of matrix-valued kernels on the entire real line. With this method, the Fredholm determinant is approximated by the determinant of a matrix constructed by truncating the kernel of the operator to a finite interval and then applying a quadrature rule. Under the assumption that the kernel decays exponentially, we derive an estimate relating the Fredholm determinant of the operator on the real line to that of its truncation to a finite interval. Then we derive a quadrature error estimate relating the Fredholm determinant of a matrix-valued kernel on a finite interval to its numerical approximation obtained via an adaptive composite Simpson's quadrature rule. These results extend the analysis of Bornemann which focused on Fredholm determinants of trace class operators defined by scalar-valued kernels on a finite interval. Numerical results are provided for a Birman-Schwinger operator that characterizes the stability of stationary solutions of nonlinear wave equations.</description>

      <title>Explaining Deep Network Classification of Matrices: A Case Study on Monotonicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a methodology for using deep learning to discover simple, practical criteria for classifying matrices based on abstract algebraic properties. By combining a high-performance neural network with explainable AI (XAI) techniques, we can distill a model's learned strategy into human-interpretable rules. We apply this approach to the challenging case of monotone matrices, defined by the condition that their inverses are entrywise nonnegative. Despite their simple definition, an easy characterization in terms of the matrix elements or the derived parameters is not known. Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first systematic machine-learning approach for deriving a practical criterion that distinguishes monotone from non-monotone matrices. After establishing a labelled dataset by randomly generated monotone and non-monotone matrices uniformly on $(-1,1)$, we employ deep neural network algorithms for classifying the matrices as monotone or non-monotone, using both their entries and a comprehensive set of matrix features. By saliency methods, such as integrated gradients, we identify among all features, two matrix parameters which alone provide sufficient information for the matrix classification, with $95\%$ accuracy, namely the absolute values of the two lowest-order coefficients, $c_0$ and $c_1$ of the matrix's characteristic polynomial. A data-driven study of 18,000 random $7\times7$ matrices shows that the monotone class obeys $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert\le0.18$ with probability $&gt;99.98\%$; because $\lvert c_{0}/c_{1}\rvert = 1/\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})$ for monotone $A$, this is equivalent to the simple bound $\mathrm{tr}(A^{-1})\ge5.7$.</description>

      <title>The eigenvalue decomposition of normal matrices by the skew-symmetric part</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12421v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method for computing the eigenvalue decomposition of a dense real normal matrix $A$ through the decomposition of its skew-symmetric part. The method relies on algorithms that are known to be efficiently implemented, such as the bidiagonal singular value decomposition and the symmetric eigenvalue decomposition. The advantages of this method stand for normal matrices with few real eigenvalues, such as orthogonal matrices. We provide a stability and a complexity analysis of the method. The numerical performance is compared with existing algorithms. In most cases, the method has the same operation count as the Hessenberg factorization of a dense matrix. Finally, we provide experiments for the application of computing a Riemannian barycenter on the special orthogonal group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel structure-preserving numerical method to solve random hyperbolic systems of conservation laws is presented. The method uses a concept of generalized, measure-valued solutions to random conservation laws. This yields a linear partial differential equation with respect to the Young measure and allows to compute the approximation based on linear programming problems. We analyze the structure-preserving properties of the derived numerical method and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Numerical results for one-dimensional Burgers equation and the isentropic Euler equations and comparisons with stochastic collocation method illustrate the behavior of the proposed numerical method.</description>

Abstract: Time-harmonic acoustic inverse scattering concerns the ill-posed and nonlinear problem of determining the refractive index of an inaccessible, penetrable scatterer based on far field wave scattering data. When the scattering is weak, the regularized inverse Born approximation provides a linearized model for recovering the shape and material properties of a scatterer. We propose two convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms to correct the traditional inverse Born approximation even when the scattering is not weak. These are denoted Born-CNN (BCNN) and CNN-Born (CNNB). BCNN applies a post-correction to the Born reconstruction, while CNNB pre-corrects the data. Both methods leverage the Born approximation's excellent fidelity in weak scattering, while extending its applicability beyond its theoretical limits. CNNB particularly exhibits a strong generalization to more complex out of distribution scatterers. Based on numerical tests and benchmarking against other standard approaches, our corrected Born models provide alternative data-driven methods for obtaining the refractive index, extending the utility of the Born approximation to regimes where the traditional method fails.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for numerical approximations of a nonlinear gradient flow model</title>

Abstract: We perform numerical analysis of a nonlinear gradient flow, which can be regarded as a parabolic minimal surface problem or a regularised total variation flow, using the gradient discretisation method (GDM).
  GDM is a unified convergence analysis framework that covers conforming and nonconforming numerical methods, for instance, conforming and nonconforming finite element, two-point flux approximation, etc..
  In this paper, a fully discretised implicit scheme of the model is proposed, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the scheme is proved, the stability and consistency of the scheme are analysed, and error estimates are established.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with just-in-time compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>
