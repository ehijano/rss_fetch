      <title>Convergence analysis of a third order semi-implicit projection method for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence analysis of a third-order scheme for the highly nonlinear Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with a non-convex constraint is considered. In this paper, we first present a fully discrete semi-implicit method for solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation based on the third-order backward differentiation formula and the one-sided extrapolation (using previous time-step numerical values). A projection step is further used to preserve the length of the magnetization. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the fully discrete numerical solution by the introduction of two sets of approximated solutions where one set of solutions solves the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation and the other is projected onto the unit sphere. Third-order accuracy in time and fourth order accuracy in space is obtained provided that the spatial step-size is the same order as the temporal step-size and slightly large damping parameter $\alpha$ (greater than $\sqrt{2}/2$). And also, the unique solvability of the numerical solution without any assumption for the step-size in both time and space is theoretically justified, using a monotonicity analysis. All these theoretical results are guaranteed by numerical examples in both 1D and 3D spaces.</description>

      <title>SLIPT for Underwater IoT: System Modeling and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified analytical framework for a two phase underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system that integrates Simultaneous Lightwave Information and Power Transfer (SLIPT) using a photovoltaic (PV) panel receiver. The proposed architecture enables self powered underwater sensor nodes by leveraging wide area and low cost PV panels for concurrent optical signal detection and energy harvesting. We develop a composite statistical channel that combines distance dependent absorption, turbulence induced fading characterized by the mixture Exponential Generalized Gamma (EGG )distribution, and beam misalignment due to pointing errors. Based on this model we derive closed form expressions for the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, the outage probability (OP), the average bit error rate, the ergodic capacity, and the harvested power using Meijer G and Fox H functions. Overall, the paper introduces a practical analytical framework that provides clear guidance for design, optimization, and operation of SLIPT based UWOC systems.</description>

      <title>Regularity and error estimates in physics-informed neural networks for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to its nonlinearity, bi-harmonic dissipation, and backward heat-like term in the absence of a divergence-free condition, the $2$-D/$3$-D Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation poses significant challenges for both mathematical analysis and numerical approximation. These difficulties motivate the development of methods that blend classical analysis with numerical approximation approaches embodied in the framework of the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). In addition, despite the extensive use of PINN frameworks for various linear and nonlinear PDEs, no study had previously established rigorous error estimates for the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation within a PINN setting. In this work, we overcome the inherent challenges, and establish several global regularity criteria based on space-time integrability conditions in Besov spaces. We then derive the first rigorous error estimates for the PINNs approximation of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and validate our theoretical error bounds through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Global iterative methods for sparse approximate inverses of symmetric positive-definite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear (preconditioned) conjugate gradient N(P)CG method and the locally optimal (preconditioned) minimal residual LO(P)MR method, both of which are used for the iterative computation of sparse approximate inverses (SPAIs) of symmetric positive-definite (SPD) matrices, are introduced and analyzed. The (preconditioned) conjugate gradient (P)CG method is also employed and presented for comparison. The N(P)CG method is defined as a one-dimensional projection with residuals made orthogonal to the current search direction, itself made $A$-orthogonal to the last search direction. The residual orthogonality, expressed via Frobenius inner product, actually holds against all previous search directions, making each iterate globally optimal, that is, that minimizes the Frobenius A-norm of the error over the affine Krylov subspace of $A^2$ generated by the initial gradient. The LO(P)MR method is a two-dimensional projection method that enriches iterates produced by the (preconditioned) minimal residual (P)MR method. These approaches differ from existing descent methods and aim to accelerate convergence compared to other global iteration methods, including (P)MR and (preconditioned) steepest descent (P)SD, previously used for SPAI computation. The methods are implemented with practical dropping strategies to control the growth of nonzero components in the approximate inverse. Numerical experiments are performed in which approximate inverses of several sparse SPD matrices are computed. N(P)CG provides a slight improvement over (P)SD, but remains generally less effective than (P)MR. On the other hand, while (P)CG does improve (P)MR, its convergence is more affected by the dropping of nonzero components, ill-conditioning, and small eigenvalues. LO(P)MR is more robust than (P)MR and (P)CG, consistently outperforms other methods, converging faster to better and often sparser approximations.</description>

      <title>A model-free method for discovering symmetry in differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry in differential equations reveals invariances and offers a powerful means to reduce model complexity. Lie group analysis characterizes these symmetries through infinitesimal generators, which provide a local, linear criterion for invariance. However, identifying Lie symmetries directly from scattered data, without explicit knowledge of the governing equations, remains a significant challenge. This work introduces a numerical scheme that approximates infinitesimal generators from data sampled on an unknown smooth manifold, enabling the recovery of continuous symmetries without requiring the analytical form of the differential equations. We employ a manifold learning technique, Generalized Moving Least Squares, to prolongate the data, from which a linear system is constructed whose null space encodes the infinitesimal generators representing the symmetries. Convergence bounds for the proposed approach are derived. Several numerical experiments, including ordinary and partial differential equations, demonstrate the method's accuracy, robustness, and convergence, highlighting its potential for data-driven discovery of symmetries in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Krylov-Regularization Solvers for Multiquadric RBF Discretizations of the 3D Helmholtz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meshless collocation with multiquadric radial basis functions (MQ-RBFs) delivers high accuracy for the three-dimensional Helmholtz equation but produces dense, severely ill-conditioned linear systems. We develop and evaluate three complementary methods that embed regularization in Krylov projections to overcome this instability at scale: (i) an inexpensive TSVD that replaces the full SVD by a short Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization and a small projected SVD, retaining the dominant spectral content at greatly reduced cost; (ii) classical Tikhonov regularization with principled parameter choice (GCV/L-curve), expressed in SVD form for transparent filtering; and (iii) a hybrid Krylov-Tikhonov (HKT) scheme that first projects with Golub-Kahan and then selects the regularization parameter on the reduced problem, yielding stable solutions in few iterations. Extensive tests on canonical domains (cube and sphere) and a realistic industrial pump-casing geometry demonstrate that HKT consistently matches or surpasses the accuracy of full TSVD/Tikhonov at a fraction of the runtime and memory, while inexpensive TSVD provides the fastest viable reconstructions when only the leading modes are needed. These results show that coupling Krylov projection with TSVD/Tikhonov regularization provides a robust, scalable pathway for MQ-RBF Helmholtz methods in complex three-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Randomized batch-sampling Kaczmarz methods for general linear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To conduct a more in-depth investigation of randomized solvers for general linear systems, we adopt a unified randomized batch-sampling Kaczmarz framework with per-iteration costs as low as cyclic block methods, and develop a general analysis technique to establish its convergence guarantee. With concentration inequalities, we derive new expected linear convergence rate bounds. The analysis applies to any randomized non-extended block Kaczmarz methods with static stochastic samplings. In addition, the new rate bounds are scale-invariant which eliminate the dependence on the magnitude of the data matrix. In most experiments, the new bounds are significantly tighter than existing ones and better reflect the empirical convergence behavior of block methods. Within this new framework, the batch-sampling distribution, as a learnable parameter, provides the possibility for block methods to achieve efficient performance in specific application scenarios, which deserves further investigation.</description>

      <title>Implicit Multiple Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, triple decomposition has attracted increasing attention for decomposing third-order tensors into three factor tensors. However, this approach is limited to third-order tensors and enforces uniformity in the lower dimensions across all factor tensors, which restricts its flexibility and applicability. To address these issues, we propose the Multiple decomposition, a novel framework that generalizes triple decomposition to arbitrary order tensors and allows the short dimensions of the factor tensors to differ. We establish its connections with other classical tensor decompositions. Furthermore, implicit neural representation (INR) is employed to continuously represent the factor tensors in Multiple decomposition, enabling the method to generalize to non-grid data. We refer to this INR-based Multiple decomposition as Implicit Multiple Tensor Decomposition (IMTD). Then, the Proximal Alternating Least Squares (PALS) algorithm is utilized to solve the IMTD-based tensor reconstruction models. Since the objective function in IMTD-based models often lacks the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) property, we establish a KL-free convergence analysis for the algorithm. Finally, extensive numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving and energy-conserving methods for a hyperbolic approximation of the BBM equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the hyperbolic approximation of the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equation proposed recently by Gavrilyuk and Shyue (2022). We develop asymptotic-preserving numerical methods using implicit-explicit (additive) Runge-Kutta methods that are implicit in the stiff linear part. The new discretization of the hyperbolization conserves important invariants converging to invariants of the BBM equation. We use the entropy relaxation approach to make the fully discrete schemes energy-preserving. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these discretizations.</description>

      <title>A Third-order Conservative Semi-Lagrangian Discontinuous Galerkin Scheme For the Transport Equation on Curvilinear Unstructured Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a third-order conservative semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (SLDG) scheme for solving linear transport equations on curvilinear unstructured triangular meshes, tailored for complex geometries. To ensure third-order spatial accuracy while strictly preserving mass, we develop a high-order conservative intersection-based remapping algorithm for curvilinear unstructured meshes, which enables accurate and conservative data transfer between distinct curvilinear meshes. Incorporating this algorithm, we construct a non-splitting high-order SLDG method equipped with weighted essentially non-oscillatory and positivity-preserving limiters to effectively suppress numerical oscillations and maintain solution positivity. For the linear problem, the semi-Lagrangian update enables large time stepping, yielding an explicit and efficient implementation. Rigorous numerical analysis confirms that our scheme achieves third-order accuracy in both space and time, as validated by consistent error analysis in terms of $L^1$ and $L^2$-norms. Numerical benchmarks, including rigid body rotation and swirling deformation flows with smooth and discontinuous initial conditions, validate the scheme's accuracy, stability, and robustness.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Serviceability-Based Design of Reinforced Concrete Rail Bridges under Geometric Uncertainties induced by unforeseen events: A Surrogate Modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforced concrete rail bridges are essential components of railway infrastructure, where reliability, durability, and adaptability are key design priorities. However, the design process is often complicated by uncertainties stemming from unforeseen construction constraints, such as the need to reposition piers or alter geometric characteristics. These design adaptations can lead to repeated redesigns, added costs, and project delays if not anticipated in the early design stages, as well as significant computational overhead when using traditional finite element (FE) simulations. To address this and anticipate such unexpected events, this study adopts surrogate modeling as an efficient probabilistic design approach. This methodology integrates key geometric parameters as random variables, capturing the uncertainties that may arise during the design and construction phases and propagating them on the bridge's performance functions. By doing so, we aim to enable the efficient exploration of a large number of design scenarios with minimal reliance on time-consuming finite element (FE) simulations, represent the performance functions of a reinforced concrete bridge as a function of our variable design parameters, and classify the overall design scenarios into failure and safe scenarios In this study, a four-span reinforced concrete bridge deck is modeled using a multi-fiber finite element approach in Cast3M software. This FE model is used to generate the required design of experiments to train the surrogate models. Within this framework, a comparative performance assessment is conducted to evaluate the performance of the Kriging surrogate against alternative methods, including polynomial chaos expansion (implemented in UQLab) and support vector regression (SVR). This methodology supports early-stage uncertainty-informed design, enhancing the robustness and adaptability of reinforced concrete rail bridges in the face of practical constraints and changing site conditions.</description>

      <title>Control strategies for magnetized plasma: a polar coordinates framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide an overview of various control strategies aimed at steering plasma toward desired configurations using an external magnetic field. From a modeling perspective, we focus on the Vlasov equation in a two-dimensional bounded domain, accounting for both a self-induced electric field and a strong external magnetic field. The results are presented in a polar coordinate framework, which is particularly well-suited for simulating toroidal devices such as Tokamaks and Stellarators. A key feature of the proposed control strategies is their feedback mechanism, which is based on an instantaneous prediction of the discretized system. Finally, different numerical experiments in the two-dimensional polar coordinate setting demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches.</description>

      <title>A Stabilized Unfitted Space-time Finite Element Method for Parabolic Problems on Moving Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a space-time finite element method (FEM) based on an unfitted mesh for solving parabolic problems on moving domains. Unlike other unfitted space-time finite element approaches that commonly employ the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for time-stepping, the proposed method employs a fully coupled space-time discretization. To stabilize the time-advection term, the streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) scheme is applied in the temporal direction. A ghost penalty stabilization term is further incorporated to mitigate the small cut issue, thereby ensuring the well-conditioning of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, an a priori error estimate is derived in a discrete energy norm, which achieves an optimal convergence rate with respect to the mesh size. In particular, a space-time Poincare-Friedrichs inequality is established to support the condition number analysis. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A novel mathematical and computational framework of amyloid-beta triggered seizure dynamics in Alzheimer's disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The association of epileptic activity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been increasingly reported in both clinical and experimental studies, suggesting that amyloid-$\beta$ accumulation may directly affect neuronal excitability. Capturing these interactions requires a quantitative description that bridges the molecular alterations of AD with the fast electrophysiological dynamics of epilepsy. We introduce a novel mathematical model that extends the Barreto-Cressman ionic formulation by incorporating multiple mechanisms of calcium dysregulation induced by amyloid-$\beta$, including formation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable pores, overactivation of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, and suppression of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive potassium currents. The resulting ionic model is coupled with the monodomain equation and discretized using a $p$-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method on polytopal meshes, providing an effective balance between efficiency and accuracy in capturing the sharp spatiotemporal electrical wavefronts associated with epileptiform discharges. Numerical simulations performed on idealized and realistic brain geometries demonstrate that progressive amyloid-\textbeta{} accumulation leads to severe alterations in calcium homeostasis, increased neuronal hyperexcitability, and pathological seizure propagation. Specifically, high amyloid-$\beta$ concentrations produce secondary epileptogenic sources and spatially heterogeneous wavefronts, indicating that biochemical inhomogeneities play a critical role in shaping seizure dynamics. These results illustrate how multiscale modeling provides new mechanistic insights into the interplay between neurodegeneration and epilepsy in Alzheimer's disease.</description>

Abstract: Complex physical systems which exhibit fluid-like behavior are often modeled as non-Newtonian fluids. A crucial element of a non-Newtonian model is the rheology, which relates inner stresses with strain-rates. We propose a framework for inferring rheological models from data that represents the fluid's effective viscosity with a neural network. By writing the rheological law in terms of tensor invariants and tailoring the network's properties, the inferred model satisfies key physical and mathematical properties, such as isotropic frame-indifference and existence of a convex potential of dissipation. Within this framework, we propose two approaches to learning a fluid's rheology: 1) a standard regression that fits the rheological model to stress data and 2) a PDE-constrained optimization method that infers rheological models from velocity data. For the latter approach, we combine finite element and machine learning libraries. We demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our method on land and sea ice rheologies which also depend on external parameters. For land ice, we infer the temperature-dependent Glen's law and, for sea ice, the concentration-dependent shear component of the viscous-plastic model. For these two models, we explore the effects of large data errors. Finally, we infer an unknown concentration-dependent model that reproduces Lagrangian ice floe simulation data. Our method discovers a rheology that generalizes well outside of the training dataset and exhibits both shear-thickening and thinning behaviors depending on the concentrations.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$-error rate for randomized quasi-Monte Carlo self-normalized importance sampling of unbounded integrands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) is a fundamental tool in Bayesian inference when the posterior distribution involves an unknown normalizing constant. Although $L_1$-error (bias) and $L_2$-error (root mean square error) estimates of SNIS are well established for bounded integrands, results for unbounded integrands remain limited, especially under randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling. In this work, we derive $L_p$-error rate $(p\ge1)$ for RQMC-based SNIS (RQMC-SNIS) estimators with unbounded integrands on unbounded domains. A key step in our analysis is to first establish the $L_p$-error rate for plain RQMC integration. Our results allow for a broader class of transport maps used to generate samples from RQMC points. Under mild function boundary growth conditions, we further establish \(L_p\)-error rate of order \(\mathcal{O}(N^{-\beta + \epsilon})\) for RQMC-SNIS estimators, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is arbitrarily small, $N$ is the sample size, and \(\beta \in (0,1]\) depends on the boundary growth rate of the resulting integrand. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Incremental Generation is Necessity and Sufficient for Universality in Flow-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.</description>

      <title>An inexact semismooth Newton-Krylov method for semilinear elliptic optimal control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inexact semismooth Newton method has been proposed for solving semi-linear elliptic optimal control problems in this paper. This method incorporates the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) method, a type of Krylov subspace method, to solve the Newton equations and utilizes nonmonotonic line search to adjust the iteration step size. The original problem is reformulated into a nonlinear equation through variational inequality principles and discretized using a second-order finite difference scheme. By leveraging slanting differentiability, the algorithm constructs semismooth Newton directions and employs GMRES method to inexactly solve the Newton equations, significantly reducing computational overhead. A dynamic nonmonotonic line search strategy is introduced to adjust stepsizes adaptively, ensuring global convergence while overcoming local stagnation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves superlinear convergence near optimal solutions when the residual control parameter $\eta_k$ approaches to 0. Numerical experiments validate the method's accuracy and efficiency in solving semilinear elliptic optimal control problems, corroborating theoretical insights.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.10496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The construction of low-discrepancy sets, used for uniform sampling and numerical integration, has recently seen great improvements based on optimization and machine learning techniques. However, these methods are computationally expensive, often requiring days of computation or access to GPU clusters. We show that simple gradient descent-based techniques allow for comparable results when starting with a reasonably uniform point set. Not only is this method much more efficient and accessible, but it can be applied as post-processing to any low-discrepancy set generation method for a variety of standard discrepancy measures.</description>

Abstract: Kirigami are part of the larger class of mechanical metamaterials, which exhibit exotic properties. This article focuses on rhombi-slits, which is a specific type of kirigami. A nonlinear kinematic model was previously proposed as a second order divergence-form PDE with a possibly degenerate, and sign-changing coefficient matrix. We first propose to study the existence of solutions to a regularization of this equation by using the limiting absorption principle. Then, we propose a finite element method with complex polynomials to approximate the solutions to the nonlinear equation. Finally, simulations are compared with experimental results.</description>

      <title>Randomized Strong Recursive Skeletonization: Simultaneous Compression and LU Factorization of Hierarchical Matrices using Matrix-Vector Products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hierarchical matrix framework partitions matrices into subblocks that are either small or of low numerical rank, enabling linear storage complexity and efficient matrix-vector multiplication. This work focuses on the $H^2$-matrix format constructed under the strong admissibility condition, which has two key properties: (1) a compressed representation that approximates far-field interactions with low-rank blocks while near-field interactions are stored densely, and (2) a nested basis structure that reuses basis matrices across hierarchy levels. Although these matrices support fast Cholesky and LU factorizations, implementing them - especially for 3D PDE discretizations - remains challenging due to the nested recursions and recompressions involved.
  This paper introduces an algorithm that simultaneously compresses and factorizes a general ${H}^{2}$ matrix, using only the action of the matrix and its adjoint on vectors. The number of required matrix-vector products is independent of the matrix size, and depends only on the problem geometry and a rank parameter. The resulting LU factorization is invertible and can serve as an approximate direct solver, with accuracy influenced by the spectral properties of the matrix.
  To achieve competitive sample complexity, the method employs dense Gaussian test matrices without explicitly encoding structured sparsity. Samples are drawn only once at the start of the algorithm; as the factorization proceeds, structure is dynamically introduced into the test matrices through efficient linear algebraic operations. Numerical experiments demonstrate robustness to indefiniteness and ill-conditioning, as well as the efficiency of the method for integral and differential equations in 2D and 3D.</description>

Abstract: Neural integral equations are deep learning models based on the theory of integral equations, where the model consists of an integral operator and the corresponding equation (of the second kind) which is learned through an optimization procedure. This approach allows to leverage the nonlocal properties of integral operators in machine learning, but it is computationally expensive. In this article, we introduce a framework for neural integral equations based on spectral methods that allows us to learn an operator in the spectral domain, resulting in a cheaper computational cost, as well as in high interpolation accuracy. We study the properties of our methods and show various theoretical guarantees regarding the approximation capabilities of the model, and convergence to solutions of the numerical methods. We provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the resulting model.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a nonconforming surface finite element was developed to discretize 3d vector-valued compressible flow problems arising in climate modeling. In this contribution we derive an error analysis for this approach on a vector-valued Laplace problem, which is an important operator for fluid-equations on the surface. In our setup, the problem is approximated via edge-integration on local flat triangles using the nonconforming linear Crouzeix-Raviart element. The latter is continuous at the midpoints of the edges in each vector component. This setup is numerically efficient and straightforward to implement. For this Crouzeix-Raviart discretization we introduce interpolation estimates, derive optimal error bounds in the H1-norm and L2-norm and present an estimate for the geometric error. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We introduce estimatable variation neural networks (EVNNs), a class of neural networks that allow a computationally cheap estimate on the $BV$ norm motivated by the space $BMV$ of functions with bounded M-variation. We prove a universal approximation theorem for EVNNs and discuss possible implementations. We construct sequences of loss functionals for ODEs and scalar hyperbolic conservation laws for which a vanishing loss leads to convergence. Moreover, we show the existence of sequences of loss minimizing neural networks if the solution is an element of $BMV$. Several numerical test cases illustrate that it is possible to use standard techniques to minimize these loss functionals for EVNNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06889v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a widely used technique for recovering the 3-D structure of biological molecules from a large number of experimentally generated noisy 2-D tomographic projection images of the 3-D structure, taken from unknown viewing angles. Through computationally intensive algorithms, these observed images are processed to reconstruct the 3-D structures. Many popular computational methods rely on estimating the unknown angles as part of the reconstruction process, which becomes particularly challenging at low signal-to-noise ratios. The method of moments (MoM) offers an alternative approach that circumvents the estimation of viewing orientations of individual projection images by instead estimating the underlying distribution of the viewing angles, and is robust to noise given sufficiently many images. However, the method of moments typically entails computing higher-order moments of the projection images, incurring significant computational and memory costs. To mitigate this, we propose a new approach called the subspace method of moments (SubspaceMoM), which compresses the first three moments using data-driven low-rank tensor techniques as well as expansion into a suitable function basis. The compressed moments can be efficiently computed from the set of projection images using numerical quadrature and can be employed to jointly reconstruct the 3-D structure and the distribution of viewing orientations. We illustrate the practical applicability of SubspaceMoM through numerical experiments using up to the third-order moment on synthetic datasets with a simplified cryo-EM image formation model, which significantly improves the reconstruction resolution compared to previous MoM approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-dimensional (0D) cardiovascular models are reduced-order models used to study global circulation dynamics and transport. They provide estimates of biomarkers (such as pressure, flow rates, and concentrations) for surgery planning and boundary conditions for high-fidelity 3D models. Although their computational cost is low, tasks like parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification require many model evaluations, making them computationally expensive. This motivates building metamodels. In this work, we propose a pipeline from 0D models to metamodel building for tasks such as sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and uncertainty quantification. Three strategies are explored: Neural Networks, Polynomial Chaos Expansion, and Gaussian Processes, applied to three different 0D models. The first model predicts portal vein pressure after surgery, considering liver hemodynamics and global circulation. The second simulates whole-body circulation under pulmonary arterial hypertension before and after shunt insertion. The third assesses organ blood perfusion after revascularization surgery, focusing on contrast agent transport, requiring specific metamodel treatment. Metamodels are trained and tested on synthetic data. Neural networks proved the most efficient in terms of result quality, computational time, and ease for parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and uncertainty quantification. Finally, we demonstrate the full pipeline with a neural network as the emulator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a localized consensus-based method for sampling from non-Gaussian distributions. This method arises from an alternative derivation of consensus-based sampling (CBS). Starting from ensemble-preconditioned Langevin dynamics, we approximate the potential with a Moreau envelope, replace the gradient in the Langevin equation with a proximal operator, and finally approximate this operator by a weighted mean. Under Gaussian initial and target distributions, this procedure recovers the standard CBS dynamics. In addition, when we retain only the approximations valid beyond the Gaussian case, we retrieve a refined variant of polarized CBS. The resulting algorithm, which we call localized consensus-based sampling, is affine-invariant, exact for Gaussian targets in the mean-field limit, and demonstrates improved robustness over polarized CBS in numerical experiments. Like other consensus-based methods, localized CBS is fully gradient-free and easily parallelizable.</description>

Abstract: Systems with infinite memory are typically characterized by equations involving infinite delays, and their numerical simulation is exceptionally challenging as it requires storage at an infinite number of time nodes. Many physical systems are modeled by nonlinear hybrid stochastic functional differential equations with infinite delays, and this paper focuses on the construction and convergence analysis of explicit numerical methods for them in finite and infinite time horizons. First, adapting both the space and time truncation techniques we propose an explicit numerical scheme that requires the storage of only a finite number of historical nodes. By leveraging the approximation theory for nonlinear stochastic differential equations with finite history information, we prove the boundedness of the $p$th moment of the numerical solutions and establish the convergence between the numerical and exact solutions. And under the condition of polynomially growing coefficients, the convergence rate of $1/2$ order between the numerical and exact solutions is obtained. Furthermore we improve the explicit scheme so that it has more refined properties. We proved that the numerical solution of the refined scheme realizes the underlying exponential stability of the exact solution including in moment and almost sure means. Finally, an example and some numerical experiments are given to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>High-order, Compact, and Symmetric Finite Difference Methods for a $d$-Dimensional Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents compact, symmetric, and high-order finite difference methods (FDMs) for the variable Poisson equation on a $d$-dimensional hypercube. Our scheme produces a symmetric linear system: an important property that does not immediately hold for a high-order FDM. Since the model problem is coercive, the linear system is in fact symmetric positive definite, and consequently many fast solvers are applicable. Furthermore, the symmetry combined with the minimum support of the stencil keeps the storage requirement minimal. Theoretically speaking, we prove that a compact, symmetric 1D FDM on a uniform grid can achieve arbitrary consistency order. On the other hand, in the $d$-dimensional setting, where $d \ge 2$, the maximum consistency order that a compact, symmetric FDM on a uniform grid can achieve is 4. If $d=2$ and the diffusion coefficient satisfies a certain derivative condition, the maximum consistency order is 6. Moreover, the finite compact, symmetric, 4th-order FDMs for $d\ge 3$, can be conveniently expressed as a linear combination of two types of FDMs: one that depends on partial derivatives along one axis, and the other along two axes. All finite difference stencils are explicitly provided for ease of reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Some p-robust a posteriori error estimates based on auxiliary spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops polynomial-degree-robust (p-robust) equilibrated a posteriori error estimates for $H(\rm curl)$, $H(\rm div)$ and $H(\rm divdiv)$ problems, based on $H^1$ auxiliary space decomposition. The proposed framework employs auxiliary space preconditioning and regular decompositions to decompose the finite element residual into $H^{-1}$ residuals that are further controlled by classical p-robust equilibrated a posteriori error analysis. As a result, we obtain novel and simple p-robust a posteriori error estimates of $H(\rm curl)$/$H(\rm div)$ conforming methods and mixed methods for the biharmonic equation. In addition, we prove guaranteed a posteriori upper error bounds under convex domains or certain boundary conditions. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and p-robustness of the proposed error estimators for the N\'ed\'elec edge element methods and the Hellan--Herrmann--Johnson methods.</description>

      <title>Unbiased estimators for the Heston model with stochastic interest rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine the unbiased estimators in Rhee and Glynn (Operations Research: 63(5), 1026-1043, 2015) and the Heston model with stochastic interest rates. Specifically, we first develop a semi-exact log-Euler scheme for the Heston model with stochastic interest rates. Then, under mild assumptions, we show that the convergence rate in the $L^2$ norm is $O(h)$, where $h$ is the step size. The result applies to a large class of models, such as the Heston-Hull-While model, the Heston-CIR model and the Heston-Black-Karasinski model. Numerical experiments support our theoretical convergence rate.</description>

      <title>E-PINNs: Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have demonstrated promise as a framework for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations. Despite recent progress in the field, it remains challenging to quantify uncertainty in these networks. While techniques such as Bayesian PINNs (B-PINNs) provide a principled approach to capturing epistemic uncertainty through Bayesian inference, they can be computationally expensive for large-scale applications. In this work, we propose Epistemic Physics-Informed Neural Networks (E-PINNs), a framework that uses a small network, the epinet, to efficiently quantify epistemic uncertainty in PINNs. The proposed approach works as an add-on to existing, pre-trained PINNs with a small computational overhead. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework in various test cases and compare the results with B-PINNs using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) posterior estimation and dropout-equipped PINNs (Dropout-PINNs). In our experiments, E-PINNs achieve calibrated coverage with competitive sharpness at substantially lower cost. We demonstrate that when B-PINNs produce narrower bands, they under-cover in our tests. E-PINNs also show better calibration than Dropout-PINNs in these examples, indicating a favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off.</description>

      <title>Impact of friction force and retrieval speed on in silico mechanical thrombectomies: a sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background: Mechanical Thrombectomy (MT) is a widely accepted first-line treatment for Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) and it has been studied using in vitro and in silico models. Thrombectomy outcomes have been performed for patient-specific cases using in silico models. However, until now, in vivo friction coefficients for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions are unknown, but in vitro experiments have been attempted with significant standard deviations. These interactions and friction coefficients have been considered an important aspect of thrombectomy success. Objectives: In the current study, we explored the influence of variation in friction forces for stent-vessel, stent-clot, and clot-vessel interactions using virtual mechanical thrombectomy (VMT). We have performed three simulations for each interaction and varied friction coefficients around the standard deviation observed in the past in vitro studies. Results: (i) clot-vessel friction: higher friction leads to clot fragmentation and VMT failure. (ii) stent-clot friction: it is susceptible to VMT outcomes, with lower values showing the slippage of the clot while higher values lead to fragmentation. (iii) stent-vessel friction: higher friction shows compression of the stent in curved vessels and dislodgment of clot from stent retriever (SR) due to its compression, which leads to VMT failure. (iv) retrieval speed (RS): higher RS (&gt;30 mm/s) leads to significant stent compression and unrealistic behavior of the SR. Conclusions: Analysis of results proposes the necessity for calculating accurate friction factor values and their implementation into in silico models, due to their sensitivity towards thrombectomy outcomes. Such in silico models mimic in vivo thrombectomy more closely and can be used in mechanical thrombectomy planning, management, and decision-making.</description>
