      <title>Projective Rectangles: The Graph of Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A projective rectangle is like a projective plane that may have different lengths in two directions. We develop properties of the graph of lines, in which adjacency means having a common point, especially its strong regularity and clique structure. The main construction of projective rectangles, stated in a previous paper, gives rectangles whose graph of lines is a known strongly regular bilinear forms graph. That fact leads to a proof that the main construction does produce projective rectangles, and also gives a new representation of bilinear forms graphs. We conclude by mentioning a few simple graph properties, such as the chromatic number, which is not known, and a partial geometry obtained from the graph.</description>

      <title>Degree-Similar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree matrix of a graph is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries equal to the degrees of the vertices of $X$. If $X_1$ and $X_2$ are graphs with respective adjacency matrices $A_1$ and $A_2$ and degree matrices $D_1$ and $D_2$, we say that $X_1$ and $X_2$ are degree similar if there is an invertible real matrix $M$ such that $M^{-1}A_1M=A_2$ and $M^{-1}D_1M=D_2$. If graphs $X_1$ and $X_2$ are degree similar, then their adjacency matrices, Laplacian matrices, unsigned Laplacian matrices and normalized Laplacian matrices are similar. We first show that the converse is not true. Then, we provide a number of constructions of degree-similar graphs. Finally, we show that the matrices $A_1-\mu D_1$ and $A_2-\mu D_2$ are similar over the field of rational functions $\mathbb{Q}(\mu)$ if and only if the Smith normal forms of the matrices $tI-(A_1-\mu D_1)$ and $tI-(A_2-\mu D_2)$ are equal.</description>

      <title>Splitting for integer tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider translational integer tilings by finite sets $A\subset\mathbb{Z}$. We introduce a new method based on \emph{splitting}, together with a new combinatorial interpretation of some of the main tools from our earlier work. We also use splitting to prove the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture for a new class of tilings $A\oplus B=\mathbb{Z}_M$. This includes tilings of period $M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}p_3^{n_3}$ with $p_1&gt;p_2^{n_2-1}p_3^{n_3-1}$, and tilings of period $M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^2p_3^2p_4^2$ with $p_1&gt;p_2p_3p_4$, where $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ are distinct primes and $n_1,n_2,n_3\in\mathbb{N}$.
  This is the second one of the two papers replacing version 1 of arXiv:2207.11809 (the first one is available as arXiv:2207.11809 v2). The main results of this paper (Theorem 1.2, Corollaries 1.4 and 1.5) and the intermediate results in Section 4.2 are all new and did not appear previously in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 or anywhere else. The material in Sections 3, 4.1, and 5 (splitting and the splitting formulation of the slab reduction) did appear in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 and has been removed from arXiv:2207.11809 v2. The results in Section 7 were included in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 and have been removed from arXiv:2207.11809 v2; the proofs are shorter and (we hope) more readable.</description>

      <title>Basic Tetravalent Oriented Graphs of Independent-Cycle Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family $\mathcal{OG}(4)$ consisting of graph-group pairs $(\Gamma, G)$, where $\Gamma$ is a finite, connected, 4-valent graph admitting a $G$-vertex-, and $G$-edge-transitive, but not $G$-arc-transitive action, has recently been examined using a normal quotient methodology. A subfamily of $\mathcal{OG}(4)$ has been identified as `basic', due to the fact that all members of $\mathcal{OG}(4)$ are normal covers of at least one basic pair. We provide an explicit classification of those basic pairs $(\Gamma, G)$ which have at least two independent cyclic $G$-normal quotients (these are $G$-normal quotients which are not extendable to a common cyclic normal quotient).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and probability $p$, we form the random subgraph $G_p$ by retaining each edge of $G$ independently with probability $p$. Given $d\in\mathbb{N}$ and constants $0&lt;c&lt;1, \varepsilon&gt;0$, we show that if every subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size exactly $\frac{c|V(G)|}{d}$ satisfies $|N(S)|\ge d|S|$ and $p=\frac{1+\varepsilon}{d}$, then the probability that $G_p$ does not contain a cycle of length $\Omega(\varepsilon^2c^2|V(G)|)$ is exponentially small in $|V(G)|$. As an intermediate step, we also show that given $k,d\in \mathbb{N}$ and a constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, if every subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ of size exactly $k$ satisfies $|N(S)|\ge kd$ and $p=\frac{1+\varepsilon}{d}$, then the probability that $G_p$ does not contain a path of length $\Omega(\varepsilon^2 kd)$ is exponentially small. We further discuss applications of these results to $K_{s,t}$-free graphs of maximal density.</description>

      <title>Wigglyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by categorical representation theory, we define the wiggly complex, whose vertices are arcs wiggling around $n+2$ points on a line, and whose faces are sets of wiggly arcs which are pairwise pointed and non-crossing. The wiggly complex is a $(2n-1)$-dimensional pseudomanifold, whose facets are wiggly pseudotriangulations. We show that wiggly pseudotriangulations are in bijection with wiggly permutations, which are permutations of $[2n]$ avoiding the patterns $(2j-1) \cdots i \cdots (2j)$ for $i &lt; 2j-1$ and $(2j) \cdots k \cdots (2j-1)$ for $k &gt; 2j$. These permutations define the wiggly lattice, an induced sublattice of the weak order. We then prove that the wiggly complex is isomorphic to the boundary complex of the polar of the wigglyhedron, for which we give explicit and simple vertex and facet descriptions. Interestingly, we observe that any Cambrian associahedron is normally equivalent to a well-chosen face of the wigglyhedron. Finally, we recall the correspondence of wiggly arcs with objects in a category, and we develop categorical criteria for a subset of wiggly arcs to form a face of the wiggly complex.</description>

      <title>Uniform exclude distributions of Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Sidon set $S$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a set such that the pairwise sums of distinct points are all distinct. The exclude points of a Sidon set $S$ are the sums of three distinct points in $S$, and the exclude multiplicity of a point in $\mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus S$ is the number of such triples in $S$ it is equal to. We call the function $d_S \colon \mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus S \to \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$ taking points in $\mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus S$ to their exclude multiplicity the exclude distribution of $S$. We say that $d_S$ is uniform on $\mathcal{P}$ if $\mathcal{P}$ is an equally-sized partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $\mathbb{F}_2^n \setminus S$ such that $d_S$ takes the same values an equal number of times on every element of $\mathcal{P}$. In this paper, we use APN plateaued functions with all component functions unbalanced to construct Sidon sets $S$ in $(\mathbb{F}_2^n)^2$ whose exclude distributions are uniform on natural partitions of $(\mathbb{F}_2^n)^2 \setminus S$ into $2^n$ elements. We use this result and a result of Carlet to determine exactly what values the exclude distributions of the graphs of the Gold and Kasami functions take and how often they take these values.</description>

      <title>Trace reconstruction of matrices and hypermatrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A \emph{trace} of a sequence is generated by deleting each bit of the sequence independently with a fixed probability. The well-studied \emph{trace reconstruction} problem asks how many traces are required to reconstruct an unknown binary sequence with high probability. In this paper, we study the multivariate version of this problem for matrices and hypermatrices, where a trace is generated by deleting each row/column of the matrix or each slice of the hypermatrix independently with a constant probability. Previously, Krishnamurthy et al. showed that $\exp(\widetilde{O}(n^{d/(d+2)}))$ traces suffice to reconstruct any unknown $n\times n$ matrix (for $d=2$) and any unknown $n^{\times d}$ hypermatrix. By developing a dimension reduction procedure and establishing a multivariate version of the Littlewood-type result, we improve this upper bound by showing that $\exp(\widetilde{O}(n^{3/7}))$ traces suffice to reconstruct any unknown $n\times n$ matrix, and $\exp(\widetilde{O}(n^{3/5}))$ traces suffice to reconstruct any unknown $n^{\times d}$ hypermatrix. This breaks the tendency to trivial $\exp(O(n))$ as the dimension $d$ grows.</description>

      <title>Shift-invariant functions and almost liftings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate shift-invariant vectorial Boolean functions on $n$~bits that are lifted from Boolean functions on $k$~bits, for $k\leq n$. We consider vectorial functions that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some sense, almost bijective. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a Boolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions of its lifted functions that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean function with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of collisions of its lifted functions is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we search for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good cryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major security weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\chi$ used in the Keccak hash function.</description>

      <title>On trilinear and quadrilinear equations associated with the lattice Gel'fand-Dikii hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Introduced in \cite{ZZN}, the trilinear Boussinesq equation is the natural form of the equation for the $\tau$-function of the lattice Boussinesq system. In this paper we study various aspects of this equation: its highly nontrivial derivation from the bilinear lattice AKP equation under dimensional reduction, a quadrilinear dual lattice equation, conservation laws, and periodic reductions leading to higher-dimensional integrable maps and their Laurent property. Furthermore, we consider a higher Gel'fand-Dikii lattice system, its periodic reductions and Laurent property. As a special application, from both a trilinear Boussinesq recurrence as well as a higher Gel'fand-Dikii system of three bilinear recurrences, we establish novel integer sequences, which are beyond the Somos class of sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For arbitrary Coxeter systems, we prove that inverse Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials satisfy a monotonicity property. This follows from the validity of Soergel's conjecture and the existence of injective morphisms between Rouquier complexes in the mixed perverse Hecke category. The monotonicity property is generalised to parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rational Betti numbers of real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra. We consider the poset topology of a specific poset induced from a chordal building set, and show its EL-shellability. Based on this, we present an explicit description using alternating $\mathcal{B}$-permutations for a chordal building set $\mathcal{B}$, transforming the computing Betti numbers into a counting problem. This approach allows us to compute the $a$-number of a finite simple graph through permutation counting when the graph is chordal. In addition, we provide detailed computations for specific cases such as real Hochschild varieties corresponding to Hochschild polytopes.</description>

      <title>Illuminating 1-unconditional convex bodies in ${\mathbb R}^3$ and ${\mathbb R}^4$, and certain cases in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We settle the Hadwiger-Boltyanski Illumination Conjecture for all 1-unconditional convex bodies in ${\mathbb R}^3$ and in ${\mathbb R}^4$. Moreover, we settle the conjecture for those higher-dimensional 1-unconditional convex bodies which have at least one coordinate hyperplane projection equal to the corresponding projection of the circumscribing rectangular box. Finally, we confirm the conjectured equality cases of the Illumination Conjecture within the subclass of 1-unconditional bodies which, just like the cube $[-1,1]^n$, have no extreme points on coordinate subspaces.
  Our methods are combinatorial, and the illuminating sets that we use consist primarily of small perturbations of the standard basis vectors. In particular, we build on ideas and constructions from [Sun-Vritsiou, "On the illumination of 1-symmetric convex bodies", preprint available at arXiv:2407.10314], and mainly on the notion of 'deep illumination' introduced there.</description>

      <title>On the Houdr\'e-Tetali conjecture about an isoperimetric constant of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Houdr\'e and Tetali defined a class of isoperimetric constants $\varphi_p$ of graphs for $0 \leq p \leq 1$, and conjectured a Cheeger-type inequality for $\varphi_\frac12$ of the form $$\lambda_2 \lesssim \varphi_\frac12 \lesssim \sqrt{\lambda_2}$$ where $\lambda_2$ is the second smallest eigenvalue of the normalized Laplacian matrix. If true, the conjecture would be a strengthening of the hard direction of the classical Cheeger's inequality. Morris and Peres proved Houdr\'e and Tetali's conjecture up to an additional log factor, using techniques from evolving sets. We present the following related results on this conjecture.
  - We provide a family of counterexamples to the conjecture of Houdr\'e and Tetali, showing that the logarithmic factor is needed.
  - We match Morris and Peres's bound using standard spectral arguments.
  - We prove that Houdr\'e and Tetali's conjecture is true for any constant $p$ strictly bigger than $\frac12$, which is also a strengthening of the hard direction of Cheeger's inequality.
  Furthermore, our results can be extended to directed graphs using Chung's definition of eigenvalues for directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Constant-Weight and Mixed-Weight Conflict-Avoiding Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conflict-avoiding code (CAC) is a deterministic transmission scheme for asynchronous multiple access without feedback. When the number of simultaneously active users is less than or equal to $w$, a CAC of length $L$ with weight $w$ can provide a hard guarantee that each active user has at least one successful transmission within every consecutive $L$ slots. In this paper, we generalize some previously known constructions of constant-weight CACs, and then derive several classes of optimal CACs by the help of Kneser's Theorem and some techniques in Additive Combinatorics. Another spotlight of this paper is to relax the identical-weight constraint in prior studies to study mixed-weight CACs for the first time, for the purpose of increasing the throughput and reducing the access delay of some potential users with higher priority. As applications of those obtained optimal CACs, we derive some classes of optimal mixed-weight CACs.</description>

      <title>On unboundedness of some invariants of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups in $\mathbb{N}^d$. We start with symmetric and almost symmetric $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and prove that these notions are independent of term orders. We further investigate the conductor and the Ap\'ery set of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup with respect to a minimal extremal ray. Building upon this, we extend the notion of reduced type to $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups and study its extremal behavior. For all $d$ and fixed $e \geq 2d$, we give a class of $\mathcal{C}$-semigroups of embedding dimension $e$ such that both the type and the reduced type do not have any upper bound in terms of the embedding dimension. We further explore irreducible decompositions of a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup and give a lower bound on the irreducible components in an irreducible decomposition. Consequently, we deduce that for each positive integer $k$, there exists a $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup $S$ such that the number of irreducible components of $S$ is at least $k$. A $\mathcal{C}$-semigroup is known as a generalized numerical semigroup when the rational cone spanned by the semigroup is full. We classify all the symmetric generalized numerical semigroups of embedding dimension $2d+1$. Consequently, when $d&gt;1$, we deduce that a generalized numerical semigroup of embedding dimension $2d+1$ is almost symmetric if and only if it is symmetric.</description>

      <title>Cumulants and Limit Theorems for $a$-step walks of random graphs of long-range percolation radius model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study cumulants of $q$-step closed and non-closed walks in the Erd\H os-R\'enyi-type random graphs of long-range percolation radius model in the limit when the number of vertices $N$, concentration $c$, and the interaction radius $R$ tend to infinity. These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of the free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in theoretical and mathematical physics. Using a diagram technique, we show that the leading term $F_k^{(q)}$ of the normalized cumulant of $k$-th order can be associated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of the asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for non-closed walks and $c^2R/N^2$ for closed walks, respectively. Adapting the Pr\"ufer codification procedure to such diagrams, we get explicit expressions for the number of tree-type diagrams of $k$ elements and show that in certain cases, $F_k^{(q)}$ can be bounded from above by the $k$-th moment of the sum of $k(q-1)+1$ independent Bernoulli random variables. These results allow us to prove Limit Theorems for the numbers of $q$-step walks in random graphs and to show that in the additional limiting transition of infinite $q$, the term $F_k^{(q)}$, considered for large values of $k$, admits an upper bound that asymptotically coincides with that of the $k$-th moment of the Compound Poisson distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The denominator conjecture, proposed by Fomin and Zelevinsky, says that for a cluster algebra, the cluster monomials are uniquely determined by their denominator vectors with respect to an initial cluster. In this paper, for a cluster algebra from a marked surface with at least three boundary marked points, we establish this conjecture with respect to a given strong admissible tagged triangulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works of the authors have demonstrated the usefulness of considering moduli spaces of Artinian reductions of a given ring when studying standard graded rings and their Lefschetz properties. This paper illuminates a key aspect of these works, the behaviour of the canonical module under deformations in this moduli space. We demonstrate that even when there is no natural geometry around, we can give a viewpoint that behaves like it, effectively constructing geometry out of nothing, giving interpretation to intersection numbers without cycles. Moreover, we explore some properties of this normalization.</description>

      <title>Identity between Restricted Cauchy Sums for the $q$-Whittaker and Skew Schur Polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.11913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Cauchy identities play an important role in the theory of symmetric functions. It is known that Cauchy sums for the $q$-Whittaker and the skew Schur polynomials produce the same factorized expressions modulo a $q$-Pochhammer symbol. We consider the sums with restrictions on the length of the first rows for labels of both polynomials and prove an identity which relates them. The proof is based on techniques from integrable probability: we rewrite the identity in terms of two probability measures: the $q$-Whittaker measure and the periodic Schur measure. The relation follows by comparing their Fredholm determinant formulas.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Lifting Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The `lifting` or `splitting-off` operation on graphs is performed by deleting two edges sv and sw having a common end s and adding a new edge between v and w. Such a lift is considered good if it preserves a certain local edge-connectivity between the pairs of vertices different from the vertex s at which lifting takes place. The operation is important for inductive proofs concerning edge-connectivity, and can be seen widely applied in the literature on connectivity augmentation, network design, orientation (of finite and infinite graphs), and edge-disjoint linkage. It was studied by Lovasz, who used the term splitting-off, and Mader, who used the term lifting. They proved the first two significant results on it, in 1976 and 1978 respectively, showing the existence of a good lift under certain conditions. Then it was used and studied by other researchers, through the 1980s, both for undirected and directed graphs. In particular, it was investigated further by Frank who proved in 1992 that there are floor of deg(s)/2 disjoint good lifts. Motivated by the applications, a new method for studying the operation was introduced by Jordan in the late 1990s. He defined and studied the structure of the `non-admissibility` graph, which is the complement of the lifting graph; the subject of this paper. He proved a number of significant structural results on it, which he applied to connectivity augmentation. Independently, in 2016, Thomassen defined the `lifting graph`, and called its complement the `bad graph`, to apply it in finding orientations of infinite graphs. Later in the same year, Thomassen with Ok and Richter extended the study, and applied their results to linkages in infinite graphs.
  Here we give a more comprehensive analysis of the structure of the lifting graph.</description>

      <title>Approximating branchwidth on parametric extensions of planarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04517v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The branchwidth of a graph has been introduced by Roberson and Seymour as a measure of the tree-decomposability of a graph, alternative to treewidth. Branchwidth is polynomially computable on planar graphs by the celebrated ``Ratcatcher''-algorithm of Seymour and Thomas. We investigate an extension of this algorithm to minor-closed graph classes, further than planar graphs, as follows: Let $H_{1}$ be a graph embeddable in the torus and $H_{2}$ be a graph embeddable in the projective plane. We prove that every $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graph $G$ contains a subgraph $G'$ where the difference between the branchwidth of $G$ and the branchwidth of $G'$ is bounded by some constant, depending only on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$. Moreover, the graph $G'$ admits a tree decomposition where all torsos are planar. This decomposition can be used for deriving a constant-additive approximation for branchwidth: For $\{H_{1},H_{2}\}$-minor free graphs, there is a constant $c$ (depending on $H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$) and an $\Ocal(|V(G)|^{3})$-time algorithm that, given a graph $G$, outputs a value $b$ such that the branchwidth of $G$ is between $b$ and $b+c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The skew Schur functions admit many determinantal expressions. Chief among them are the (dual) Jacobi-Trudi formula and the Lascoux-Pragacz formula, which is a skew analogue of the Giambelli identity. Comparatively, the skew characters of the symplectic and orthogonal groups, also known as the skew symplectic and orthogonal Schur functions, have received less attention in this direction. We establish analogues of the dual Jacobi-Trudi and Lascoux-Pragacz formulae for these characters. Our approach is entirely combinatorial, being based on lattice path descriptions of the tableaux models of Koike and Terada. Ordinary Jacobi-Trudi formulae are then derived in an algebraic manner from their duals.</description>

Abstract: The Eulerian polynomials enumerate permutations according to their number of descents. We initiate the study of descent polynomials over Cayley permutations, which we call Caylerian polynomials. Some classical results are generalized by linking Caylerian polynomials to Burge words and Burge matrices. The $\gamma$-nonegativity of the two-sided Eulerian polynomials is reformulated in terms of Burge structures. Finally, Cayley permutations with a prescribed ascent set are shown to be counted by Burge matrices with fixed row sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph burning is a natural discrete graph algorithm inspired by the spread of social contagion. Despite its simplicity, some open problems remain steadfastly unsolved, notably the burning number conjecture, which says that every connected graph of order $m^2$ has burning number at most $m$. Earlier, we showed that the conjecture also holds for a path forest, which is disconnected, provided each of its paths is sufficiently long. However, finding the least sufficient length for this to hold turns out to be nontrivial. In this note, we present our initial findings and conjectures that associate the problem to some naturally impossibly burnable path forests. It is noteworthy that our problem can be reformulated as a topic concerning sumset partition of integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unified framework for the Expander Mixing Lemma for irregular graphs using adjacency eigenvalues is presented, as well as two new versions of it. While the existing Expander Mixing Lemmas for irregular graphs make use of the notion of volume (the sum of degrees within a vertex set), we instead propose to use the Perron eigenvector entries as vertex weights, which is a way to regularise the graph. This provides a new application of weight partitions of graphs. The new Expander Mixing Lemma versions are then applied to obtain several eigenvalue bounds for NP-hard parameters such as the zero forcing number, the vertex integrity and the routing number of a graph.</description>

      <title>Minimal reconstructions of a coloring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coloring on a finite or countable set $X$ is a function $\varphi: [X]^{2} \to \{0,1\}$, where $[X]^{2}$ is the collection of unordered pairs of $X$. The collection of homogeneous sets for $\varphi$, denoted by $Hom(\varphi)$, consist of all $H \subseteq X$ such that $\varphi$ is constant on $[H]^2$; clearly, $Hom(\varphi) = Hom(1-\varphi)$. A coloring $\varphi$ is \textit{reconstructible} up to complementation from its homogeneous sets if, for any coloring $\psi$ on $X$ such that $Hom(\varphi) = Hom(\psi)$, either $\psi = \varphi$ or $\psi = 1-\varphi$. By $\mathcal{R}$ we denote the collection of all colorings reconstructible from their homogeneous sets. Let $\varphi$ and $\psi$ be colorings on $X$, and set \[ D(\varphi, \psi) = \{ \{x,y\} \in [X]^2: \; \psi\{x,y\} \neq \varphi\{x,y\}\}. \] If $\varphi\not\in \mathcal{R}$, let \[ r(\varphi) = \min\{|D(\varphi, \psi)|: \; Hom(\varphi) = Hom(\psi), \, \psi \neq \varphi, \, \psi \neq 1-\varphi\}. \] A coloring $\psi$ such that $Hom(\varphi)=Hom(\psi)$, $\varphi\neq \psi$ and $1-\varphi\neq \psi$ is called a {\em non trivial reconstruction} of $\varphi$. If, in addition, $r(\varphi) =|D(\varphi, \psi)|$, we call $\psi$ a {\em minimal reconstruction} of $\varphi$. The purpose of this article is to study the minimal reconstructions of a coloring. We show that, for large enough $X$, $r(\varphi)$ can only takes the values $1$ or $4$.</description>

Abstract: A projective rectangle is like a projective plane that has different lengths in two directions. We develop harmonic conjugation in projective rectangles. We construct projective rectangles in some harmonic matroids (matroids where harmonic conjugation is defined on every collinear point triple), such as Desarguesian projective planes of finite characteristic, by harmonic conjugation from extended lift matroids based on finite fields. Similar results follow for countable fields with characteristic $0$. We also show that projective rectangles are almost harmonic matroids.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we solve a classical counting problem for non-degenerate forms of symplectic and hermitian type defined on a vector space: given a subspace $\pi$, we find the number of non-singular subspaces that are trivially intersecting with $\pi$ and span a non-singular subspace with $\pi$. Lower bounds for the quantity of such pairs where $\pi$ is non-singular were first studied in ``Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Finite Fields Appl., 2022)'', which was later improved in ``Glasby, Ihringer, Mattheus (Des. Codes Cryptogr., 2023)'' and generalised in ``Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Linear Algebra Appl., 2022)''. In this paper, we derive explicit formulae, which allow us to give the exact proportion and improve the known lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa Dualities for Minors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\cal G}$ and ${\cal H}$ be minor-closed graph classes. The pair $({\cal H},{\cal G})$ is an Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa pair (EP-pair) if there is a function $f$ where, for every $k$ and every $G\in{\cal G},$ either $G$ has $k$ pairwise vertex-disjoint subgraphs not belonging to ${\cal H},$ or there is a set $S\subseteq V(G)$ where $|S|\leq f(k)$ and $G-S\in{\cal H}.$ The classic result of Erd\H{o}s and P\'osa says that if $\mathcal{F}$ is the class of forests, then $({\cal F},{\cal G})$ is an EP-pair for every ${\cal G}$. The class ${\cal G}$ is an EP-counterexample for ${\cal H}$ if ${\cal G}$ is minimal with the property that $({\cal H},{\cal G})$ is not an EP-pair. We prove that for every ${\cal H}$ the set $\mathfrak{C}_{\cal H}$ of all EP-counterexamples for ${\cal H}$ is finite. In particular, we provide a complete characterization of $\mathfrak{C}_{\cal H}$ for every ${\cal H}$ and give a constructive upper bound on its size. Each class ${\cal G}\in \mathfrak{C}_{\cal H}$ can be described as all minors of a sequence of grid-like graphs $\langle \mathscr{W}_{k} \rangle_{k\in \mathbb{N}}.$ Moreover, each $\mathscr{W}_{k}$ admits a half-integral packing: $k$ copies of some $H\not\in{\cal H}$ where no vertex is used more than twice. This gives a complete delineation of the half-integrality threshold of the Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors and yields a constructive proof of Thomas' conjecture on the half-integral Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa property for minors (recently confirmed, non-constructively, by Liu). Let $h$ be the maximum size of a graph in ${\cal H}.$ For every class ${\cal H},$ we construct an algorithm that, given a graph $G$ and a $k,$ either outputs a half-integral packing of $k$ copies of some $H \not\in {\cal H}$ or outputs a set of at most ${2^{k^{\cal O}_h(1)}}$ vertices whose deletion creates a graph in ${\cal H}$ in time $2^{2^{k^{{\cal O}_h(1)}}}\cdot |G|^4\log |G|.$</description>

Abstract: Given an irreducible well-generated complex reflection group, we construct an explicit basis for the module of vector fields with logarithmic poles along its reflection arrangement. This construction yields in particular a Hodge filtration of that module. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of a flat connection applied to the primitive vector field. This generalizes and unifies analogous results for real reflection groups.</description>

Abstract: We obtain sharp bounds for the size of the Schur multiplier of finite groups, which improves all existing bounds. Moreover, we also obtain sharp bounds for the second cohomology group $H^2(G,\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})$ of a $p$-group with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}.$</description>

      <title>Efficient computation of Katz centrality for very dense networks via negative parameter Katz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Katz centrality (and its limiting case, eigenvector centrality) is a frequently used tool to measure the importance of a node in a network, and to rank the nodes accordingly. One reason for its popularity is that Katz centrality can be computed very efficiently when the network is sparse, i.e., having only $O(n)$ edges between its $n$ nodes. While sparsity is common in practice, in some applications one faces the opposite situation of a very dense network, where only $O(n)$ potential edges are missing with respect to a complete graph. We explain why and how, even for very dense networks, it is possible to efficiently compute the ranking stemming from Katz centrality for unweighted graphs, possibly directed and possibly with loops, by working on the complement graph. Our approach also provides an interpretation, regardless of sparsity, of "Katz centrality with negative parameter" as usual Katz centrality on the complement graph. For weighted graphs, we provide instead an approximation method that is based on removing sufficiently many edges from the network (or from its complement), and we give sufficient conditions for this approximation to provide the correct ranking. We include numerical experiments to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach.</description>
