      <title>Student Explanation Strategies in Postsecondary Mathematics and Statistics Education: A Scoping Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This scoping review examines the use of student explanation strategies in postsecondary mathematics and statistics education. We analyzed 46 peer-reviewed articles published between 2014 and 2024, categorizing student explanations into three main types: self-explanation, peer explanation and explanation to fictitious others. The review synthesizes the theoretical underpinnings of these strategies, drawing on the retrieval practice hypothesis, generative learning hypothesis, and social presence hypothesis. Our findings indicate that while self-explanation and explaining to fictitious others foster individual cognitive processes enhancing generative thinking, peer explanation have the potential to combine these benefits with collaborative learning. However, explanation to fictitious others have the potential to mitigate some of the negative impacts that may occur in peer explanation, such as more knowledgeable students dominating peer discussions. The efficacy of the methods varies based on implementation, duration, and context. This scoping review contributes to the growing body of literature on generative learning strategies in postsecondary education and provides insights for optimizing the integration of student explanation techniques in mathematics and statistics.</description>

      <title>In Theodorus' Spiral no two hypothenusa lie on the same line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the rectangular triangle with sides with length 1 and 1, then the oblique side has length square root of 2. Now construct on top of the oblique side, a new rectangular triangle with the oblique side as rectangle side and a second rectangle side of length 1. Continue this process indefinitely, what you get is called "the spiral of Theodorus". Now the question is: Can there be two hypothenusa (oblique sides) which lie on the same line? Apparently there can't. A proof of this proposition was given in 1958, but to our knowledge no other proofs are available. Since we had no access to the journal, we wanted to prove it again.</description>
