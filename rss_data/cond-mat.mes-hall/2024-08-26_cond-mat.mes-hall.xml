      <title>Coexisting phases of individual VO$_2$ nanoparticles for multilevel nanoscale memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) has received significant interest in the context of nanophotonic metamaterials and memories owing to its reversible insulator-metal transition associated with significant changes in its optical and electronic properties. While the VO$_2$ transition has been extensively studied for several decades, the hysteresis dynamics of individual single-crystal VO$_2$ nanoparticles (NPs) remains largely unexplored. Here, employing transmission electron microscopy techniques, we investigate phase transitions of single VO$_2$ NPs in real time. Our analysis reveals the statistical distribution of the transition temperature and steepness and how they differ during forward (heating) and backward (cooling) transitions. We assess the stability of coexisting phases in individual NPs and prove the persistent multilevel memory at near-room temperatures using only a few VO$_2$ NPs. Our findings shed new light on the underlying physical mechanisms governing the hysteresis of VO$_2$ and establish VO$_2$ NPs as a promising component of optoelectronic and memory devices with enhanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Phonon-assisted Casimir interactions between piezoelectric materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong coupling between electromagnetic field and lattice oscillation in piezoelectric materials gives rise to phonon polariton excitations. Such quasiparticles open up new directions in modulating the ubiquitous Casimir force. Here by utilizing the generalized Born-Huang hydrodynamics model, three types of phonons in piezoelectrics are studied: longitudinal optical phonon, transverse optical phonon and phonon polariton. The phonon-electromagnetic coupling results in a complex set of Fresnel reflection matrices which prevents the utilization of the standard Lifshitz approach for calculating Casimir forces in the imaginary frequency domain. Our calculations are based on an approach within real frequency and finite temperatures, through which various regimes of the Casimir interaction are examined. Our study shows that piezoelectrics emerge as a set of materials where this ubiquitous force can be controlled via phonon properties for the first time. The Casimir interaction appears as a suitable means to distinguish between different types of surface phonon polaritons associated with different structural piezoelectric polytypes.</description>

      <title>Collective bistability of pyridine-furan nanosprings coupled by a graphene plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanometer-sized molecular structures exhibiting mechanical-like switching between discrete states are of great interest for their potential uses in nanotechnology and materials science. Designing such structures and understanding how they can be combined to operate synchronously is a key to creating nanoscale functional units. Notable examples recently discovered using atomistic simulations are pyridine-furan and pyridine-pyrrole nanosprings. When slightly stretched in aqueous or organic solutions, these nanosprings exhibit bistable dynamics akin to Duffing nonlinear oscillators. Based on these findings, we designed a hybrid system consisting of several pyridine furan nanosprings attached to a graphene plate in organic solvent and simulated the molecular dynamics of the construct. Our focus is on how the nanosprings coupled by a graphene plate work together, and whether such a design enables the nanosprings to respond synchronously to random perturbations and weak external stimuli. Molecular dynamics simulations of this specific construct are complemented by a theoretical model of coupled bistable systems to understand how the synchronization depends on coupling of bistable units.</description>

      <title>The St\v{r}eda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Ces\`aro Summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian. These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological characterization of interacting Floquet systems.</description>

      <title>Telecom light-emitting diodes based on nanoconfined self-assembled silicon-based color centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon color centers (SiCCs) have recently emerged as potential building blocks for light emitters in Si photonics, quantum emitters with spin storage capabilities, and Si-based quantum repeaters. We have recently developed a non-invasive method to engineer carbon-related SiCCs confined to ultra-thin nanolayers within a pristine crystalline environment, which is of utmost importance for the photostability of SiCCs. Here, we demonstrate embedding these C-doping-based SiCCs into the only 9 nm wide intrinsic region of a p-i-n diode using the epitaxial self-assembly of color centers. We report electrically-pumped light emission with an exponential increase in the intensity as a function of the driving current until saturation. We associate this property with the shift of quasi-Fermi-level position upon electrical driving, which simultaneously improves the spectral homogeneity of the engineered SiCCs. Our study demonstrates the electrical control and driving of near-infrared emitters in high-quality silicon diodes, an essential milestone for advancing classical and quantum optoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Charge Transfer Dynamics at the MoS$_2$/Au Interface Observed via Optical Spectroscopy under Ambient Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To take advantage of the exceptional properties of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) for advanced devices and catalysts, integration with metallic surfaces is an efficacious approach for facilitating charge carrier injection and extraction from TMDC monolayers. Light-matter interactions predominantly occur at the K point in TMDC monolayers, making the charge carrier dynamics at this point essential for their optimal performance. However, direct access to and comprehensive understanding of the charge carrier dynamics at the K point of TMDC monolayer on a metal substrate remains challenging. In this study, we employed azimuth- and polarization-dependent final-state sum frequency generation (FS-SFG) spectroscopy to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of charge transfer at the K point of a MoS$_2$ monolayer interfaced with an Au substrate. We observed an ultrafast injection (sub-20 fs) of photoexcited hot electrons from the Au substrate to the conduction band minimum (CBM) of the MoS$_2$ monolayer. Subsequently, driven by an internal electric field induced by charge redistribution, injected hot electrons in MoS$_2$ experience a relaxation and fast return ($\sim2$ ps) from the CBM and a trap state mediated slow return ($\sim60$ ps) process. The direct optical observation of the full electron dynamics at the K point of MoS$_2$ monolayer in ambient conditions provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of charge carrier transfer across the TMDC-metal interface, informing the design of advanced TMDC-based devices with enhanced charge transfer rates.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Analytical Solution of Spin-Orbit Torque Switched Nanoscale Perpendicular Ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scaling of magnetic memory into nanometer size calls for a theoretical model to accurately predict the switching current. Previous models show large discrepancy with experiments in studying the spin-orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnet. In this work, we find that the trajectory of magnetization shows a smooth transition during the switching. This contradicts the key assumption in previous models that magnetization needs to align to the spin polarization (\sigma) before the switching occurs. We demonstrate that aligning magnetization to \sigma requires a very large current, resulting in the unsatisfactory fitting between the previous models and experiments. In contrast, the smooth transition permits a lower switching current that is comparable to experiments. Guided by this refined physical picture, we pinpoint the reversal of precession chirality as a pivotal factor for achieving deterministic switching. This insight leads to the formulation of a new analytical model that demonstrates remarkable agreement with experimental data. Our work resolves an important issue confronting the experiment and theory. We provide a clear physical picture of the current-induced magnetization switching, which is invaluable in the development of spin-orbit torque magnetic random-access memory.</description>

      <title>The origins of noise in the Zeeman splitting of spin qubits in natural-silicon devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure and analyze noise-induced energy-fluctuations of spin qubits defined in quantum dots made of isotopically natural silicon. Combining Ramsey, time-correlation of single-shot measurements, and CPMG experiments, we cover the qubit noise power spectrum over a frequency range of nine orders of magnitude without any gaps. We find that the low-frequency noise spectrum is similar across three different devices suggesting that it is dominated by the hyperfine coupling to nuclei. The effects of charge noise are smaller, but not negligible, and are device dependent as confirmed from the noise cross-correlations. We also observe differences to spectra reported in GaAs {[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 177702 (2017), Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 236803 (2008)]}, which we attribute to the presence of the valley degree of freedom in silicon. Finally, we observe $T_2^*$ to increase upon increasing the external magnetic field, which we speculate is due to the increasing field-gradient of the micromagnet suppressing nuclear spin diffusion.</description>

      <title>Near-field radiative heat transfer between graphene-covered Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polariton manipulations introduce novel approaches to modulate the near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT). Our theoretical investigation in this study centers on NFRHT in graphene-covered Weyl semimetals (WSMs). Our findings indicate variable heat flux enhancement or attenuation, contingent on chemical potential of graphene. Enhancement or attenuation mechanisms stem from the coupling or decoupling of surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) in the graphene/WSM heterostructure. The graphene-covered WSM photon tunneling probabilities variation is demonstrated in detail. This research enhances our comprehension of SPPs within the graphene/WSM heterostructure and suggests methods for actively controlling NFRHT.</description>

      <title>Phonon-induced modification of polaritonic Rabi oscillations in the presence of the dark excitonic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically inactive (dark) excitons are characterized by relatively long life time, and therefore are desirable candidates for realizing collective excitonic phases. However, a detection of their coherence by light is problematic. Here we propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the interaction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion between bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the Rabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly modified. The analysis is conducted in the limit of weak interaction, and the perspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic effect is discussed.</description>

      <title>Grain boundary grooving in thin film under the influence of an external magnetic field: A phase-field study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a phase-field model, we study the surface diffusion-controlled grooving of a moving grain boundary under the influence of an external magnetic field in thin films of a nonmagnetic material. The driving force for the grain boundary motion comes from the anisotropic magnetic susceptibility of the material, leading to the free energy difference between differently oriented grains. We find that above a critical magnetic field the grain boundary motion is in a steady state, and under this condition, the mobile thermal groove exhibits a universal behavior scaled surface profiles are timeinvariant and independent of thermodynamic parameters. The simulated universal curve agrees well with Mullins theory of mobile grooves for any groove shape. We extend our study to a three-dimensional polycrystalline thin film with equalsized hexagonal grains. We observe a preferential grain growth depending on the applied magnetic field direction, which can be leveraged for field-assisted texture control of polycrystalline thin films. Our study reveals that keeping other conditions the same, the rate of pitting at the vertices of the hexagonal grains substantially decreases in the presence of the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Standing Light Waves in Continuous-Beam Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase-resolved imaging of confined light fields by homodyne detection is a cornerstone of metrology in nano-optics and photonics, but its application in electron microscopy has been limited so far. Here, we report the mapping of optical modes in a waveguide structure by illumination with femtosecond light pulses in a continuous-beam transmission electron microscope. Multi-photon photoemission results in a remanent charging pattern which we image by Lorentz microscopy. The resulting image contrast is linked to the intensity distribution of the standing light wave and quantitatively described within an analytical model. The robustness of the approach is showcased in a wider parameter range and more complex sample geometries including micro- and nanostructures. We discuss further applications of light-interference-based charging for electron microscopy with in-situ optical excitation, laying the foundation for advanced measurement schemes for the phase-resolved imaging of propagating light fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with switchable nanostructured surfaces enable optical and electronic functionalities beyond those of natural materials. Here we report the creation of self-organized, re-writable, laser-induced surface structures in single-crystalline vanadium dioxide. We discover anisotropic features caused by canalized surface plasmon polaritons that can only propagate along one crystal axis. The nanostructures remain single-crystalline and preserve the raw material's metal-to-insulator transition, enabling femtosecond switching by temperature or light.</description>

      <title>Holstein polaron in a pseudospin-$1$ quantum spin Hall system: first and second order topological phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose the occurrence of a quantum spin Hall (QSH) and a second order topological phase transition (TPT) driven by electron-phonon (e-p) coupling in a pseudospin-$1$ fermionic system on an $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice. Our model is formulated in the spirit of the Kane-Mele model modified by the Holstein Hamiltonian. The Lang-Firsov approach is employed to describe polarons reasonably well in the anti-adiabatic (high frequency) limit and to obtain an effective electronic Hamiltonian. It is shown that the system possesses topologically nontrivial phases up to a critical e-p coupling, $\lambda_c$ and are characterized by the helical QSH edge states along with a non-zero $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a certain range of $\alpha$. The topological phase vanishes beyond $\lambda_c$ and is accompanied by a bulk gap closing transition at $\lambda_c$, manifesting a TPT. We observe a more intriguing phenomenon for higher values of $\alpha$, where the system exhibits TPTs supported by two distinct gap closing transitions at $\lambda_{c_1}$ and $\lambda_{c_2}$, while a slim region at slightly lower values hosts a semi-metallic signature below $\lambda_{c_1}$. Subsequently, to explore more intricate features, we introduce a time reversal symmetry breaking magnetic field to trigger the formation of a second order topological phase. The magnetic field, by construction causes a boundary dependent gapping out of the edge states, consequently giving rise to robust corner modes in a tailored open boundary conditions. We justify the formation of the higher order phase by employing an appropriate invariant, namely the projected spin Chern number. Finally, we show that the e-p coupling significantly influences the corner modes (and also the real space energy bandstructure), corroborating a higher order TPT as we tune $\lambda$ beyond a critical value for a given value of $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Using a high-fidelity numerical model to infer the shape of a few-hole Ge quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of hole quantum dots in Ge are sensitive to their shape due to the interplay between strong spin-orbit coupling and confinement. We show that the split-off band, surrounding SiGe layers, and hole-hole interactions have a strong influence on calculations of the effective $g$ factor of a lithographic quantum dot in a Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Comparing predictions from a model including these effects to raw magnetospectroscopy data, we apply maximum-likelihood estimation to infer the shape of a quantum dot with up to four holes. We expect that methods like this will be useful in assessing qubit-to-qubit variability critical to further scaling quantum computing technologies based on spins in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Partitioning statistics of a correlated few-electron droplet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergence of universal collective behaviour from interactions in a sufficiently large group of elementary constituents is a fundamental scientific paradigm. In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can provide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined quark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate gases. Two-particle correlations in mesoscopic colliders have provided smoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as fractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet the gap between two-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of interacting particles grows is hard to address at the microscopic level. Here, we demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of up to $N = 5$ electron droplets driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a semiconductor. We show that the measured multivariate cumulants (of order $k = 2$ to $N$) of the electron droplet are accurately described by $k$-spin correlation functions of an effective Ising model below the N\'eel temperature and can be interpreted as a Coulomb liquid in the thermodynamic limit. Finite size scaling of high-order correlation functions provides otherwise inaccessible fingerprints of emerging order. Our demonstration of emergence in a simple correlated electron collider opens a new way to study engineered states of matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality is a property of a gapped phase of matter in two spatial dimensions that can be manifested through non-zero thermal or electrical Hall conductance. In this paper, we prove two no-go theorems that forbid such chirality for a quantum state in a finite dimensional local Hilbert space with strict area law entanglement entropies. As a crucial ingredient in the proofs, we introduce a new quantum information-theoretic primitive called instantaneous modular flow, which has many other potential applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the development of an all-optical approach that excites the fundamental compression mode in a diamond Lamb wave resonator with an optical gradient force and detects the induced vibrations via strain coupling to a silicon vacancy center, specifically, via phonon sidebands in the optical excitation spectrum of the silicon vacancy. Sideband optical interferometry has also been used for the detection of the in-plane mechanical vibrations, for which conventional optical interferometry is not effective. These experiments demonstrate a GHz fundamental compression mode with a Q-factor &gt;10^7 at temperatures near 7 K, providing a promising platform for reaching the quantum regime of spin mechanics, especially phononic cavity QED of electron spins.</description>

      <title>Superconductor to metal quantum phase transition with magnetic field in Josephson coupled lead islands on Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductor-to-metal transition with magnetic field and gate-voltage is studied in a Josephson junction array comprising of randomly distributed lead islands on exfoliated single-layer graphene with a back-gate. The low magnetic-field superconductivity onset temperature is fitted to the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg theory to model the temperature dependence of the upper critical field. The magnetoresistance in the intermediate temperature and field regime is described using thermally activated flux flow dictated by field dependent activation barrier. The barrier also depends on the gate voltage which dictates the inter-island Josephson coupling and disorder. The magnetoresistance near the upper critical field at low temperatures shows signatures of a gate dependent continuous quantum phase transition between superconductor and metal. The finite size scaling analysis shows that this transition belongs to the $(2+1)$D-XY universality class without disorder.</description>

      <title>Quantized Embedding Approaches for Collective Strong Coupling -- Connecting ab initio and macroscopic QED to Simple Models in Polaritonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective light-matter interactions have been used to control chemistry and energy transfer, yet accessible approaches that combine ab initio methodology with large many-body quantum optical systems are missing due to the fast increase in computational cost for explicit simulations. We introduce an accessible ab initio quantum embedding concept for many-body quantum optical systems that allows to treat the collective coupling of molecular many-body systems effectively in the spirit of macroscopic QED while keeping the rigor of ab initio quantum chemistry for the molecular structure. Our approach fully includes the quantum fluctuations of the polaritonic field and yet remains much simpler and more intuitive than complex embedding approaches such as dynamical mean-field theory. We illustrate the underlying assumptions by comparison to the Tavis--Cummings model. The intuitive application of the quantized embedding approach and its transparent limitations offer a practical framework for the field of ab initio polaritonic chemistry to describe collective effects in realistic molecular ensembles.</description>

      <title>Ultra-thin Carbon Biphenylene Network as an Anisotropic Thermoelectric Material with High Temperature Stability Under Mechanical Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon biphenylene network (C-BPN), which is an ultra-thin material consisting of carbon atoms arranged in square-hexagonal-octagonal (4-6-8) periodic rings, has intriguing properties for nano-scale device design due to its unique crystal structure. Here, using the Landauer formalism in combination with first-principles calculations, we show that C-BPN is a highly stable thermoelectric material at elevated temperatures under mechanical strain, where its thermoelectric efficiency can be anisotropically engineered. Transport calculations reveal that C-BPN's transmission spectrum has significant degrees of directional anisotropy and it undergoes a metal-insulator transition under strain, which leads to an increase in its Seebeck coefficient. C-BPN's lattice thermal conductance can be selectively tuned up to 35% bidirectionally at room temperature by strain engineering. Enhancement in its power factor and the suppression of its lattice thermal conductance improves the p-type figure of merit up to 0.31 and 0.76 at 300 and 1000~K, respectively. Our findings reveal that C-BPN has high potency to be used in thermoelectric nano devices with selective anisotropic properties at elevated temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of domain walls in a square of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) upon excitation with an oscillating magnetic field of 4 mT amplitude were recorded by pump-probe ptychography with X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the Ni L$_3$-edge. The 2.5 $\mu$m Py square of 160 nm thickness forms a vortex flux-closure pattern with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane magnetization states due to the interplay of in-plane shape and growth-induced perpendicular anisotropies. Dynamic modes of the domain wall structure were excitable along with the vortex core gyration with frequencies of 500 MHz and 1 GHz. Micromagnetic simulations served to corroborate the imaged domain wall motion.</description>

      <title>All-microwave readout, spectroscopy, and dynamic polarization of individual nuclear spins in a crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pushing the sensitivity of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to the single spin level would have a major impact in chemistry and biology and is the goal of intense research efforts. Individual nuclear spins have been detected via their hyperfine coupling to an individual electronic paramagnetic system, itself measured by optical or electrical means. These methods are however only applicable when suitable optical transitions or electron-spin-to-charge conversion mechanisms exist, and a more universal method is currently lacking. Here, we report spectroscopic measurements of individual $^{183}\mathrm{W}$ nuclear spins in a CaWO$_4$ crystal via their hyperfine interaction with a neighboring $\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$ ion detected by microwave photon counting at millikelvin temperatures. We observe real-time quantum jumps of the nuclear spin state, a proof of their individual nature. We perform single-spin ELDOR-detected NMR spectroscopy by microwave driving the zero- and double-quantum transitions of the $^{183}$W--Er$^{3+}$ coupled system. By repeated driving of these transitions, we also achieve single-spin solid-effect dynamical nuclear polarization. Relying exclusively on microwave driving and microwave detection, the methods reported here apply in principle to any nuclear spin coupled to a paramagnetic impurity, and therefore open the way to single-nuclear-spin spectroscopy in a large class of samples.</description>

      <title>Kagome bands and magnetism in MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kagome lattices facilitate various quantum phases, yet in bulk materials, their kagome flat-bands often interact with bulk bands, suppressing kagome electronic characteristics for hosting these phases. Here, we use density-functional-theory calculations to predict the geometric and electronic structures, as well as the topological and magnetic properties, of a series of MoTe$_{2-x}$ kagome monolayers formed by mirror-twin-boundary (MTB) loops. We analyze nine MTB-loop configurations of varying sizes and arrangements to assess their impact on various properties. Within the intrinsic bandgap of MoTe$_{2}$, we identify two sets of kagome bands, originating from in-plane and out-of-plane Te p-orbitals at MTB-loop edges and -vertices, respectively. Three configurations exhibit superior stability, while three others show comparable stability. Among these, four display bandgaps and potentially non-zero Z$_{2}$ topological invariants, suggesting possible topological phases, while the remaining two are metallic and feature Stoner magnetization. These findings guide the design of kagome-based two-dimensional materials with tunable electronic, topological, and magnetic properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultrafast magnetization dynamics of an epitaxial Fe/CoO bilayer on Ag(001) is examined in an element-resolved way by resonant soft-x-ray reflectivity. The transient magnetic linear dichroism at the Co L2 edge and the magnetic circular dichroism at the Fe L3 edge measured in reflection in a pump-probe experiment with 120 fs temporal resolution show the loss of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order in CoO and Fe, respectively, both within 300 fs after excitation with 60 fs light pulses of 800 and 400 nm wavelengths. Comparison to spin-dynamics simulations using an atomistic spin model shows that direct energy transfer from the laser-excited electrons in Fe to the magnetic moments in CoO provides the dominant demagnetization channel in the case of 800-nm excitation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) transport in a boundary driven one-dimensional fermionic lattice setup which is further subjected to particle loss. We analyze the system size scaling of conductance at zero temperature for different values of the chemical potential of the boundary reservoirs. We consider a variety of loss channel configurations: (i) single loss at the middle site of the lattice, (ii) multiple but nonextensive lossy channels, and (iii) extensive lossy channels. For the cases (i) and (ii), the conductance scaling with system size remains robust (i.e., same as the case with no loss) for chemical potential within and outside the lattice band, while at the band-edge rich anomalous conductance scaling emerges. For case (iii), the conductance scaling becomes ballistic in the thermodynamic limit for any value of chemical potential. We explain the emergence of these different system size scalings of conductance by analyzing the spectral properties of the associated non-hermitian transfer matrices of the underlying lattice. We demonstrate that the emergence of anomalous scaling is deeply connected to the existence of exceptional points of transfer matrices. Our study unravels that by carefully optimizing the loss mechanism configurations, one can in principle realize systems with rich transport properties in low-dimensional open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Design of Au-Based Alloys for Improved Plasmon Delivery and Nanoheating in Near-Field Transducers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic near-field transducers (NFTs) play a key role in administering nanoscale heating for a number of applications ranging from medical devices to next generation data processing technology. We present a novel multi-scale approach, combining quantum many-body perturbation theory with finite-element modelling, to predict the electric and thermal material parameters of various Au-based, noble metal (M) alloys. Specifically, we focus on modelling their performance within an NFT designed to focus high-intensity, sub-diffracted light for technologies such as nanoscale etching, manipulation, sensing, and heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). Elemental Au is the long-standing general-purpose NFT medium due its excellent plasmonic performance at relevant wavelengths. However, elemental Au is a soft, ductile material that tends to extrude and deform in response to extreme temperature gradients. Therefore, alloying Au with other noble metals such as Ag, Cu, Pd or Pt, has attracted considerable interest for improved mechanical and thermal robustness while reaching threshold plasmonic generation at standard optoelectronics operating wavelengths (e.g., $\approx 830$~nm) and approximate high-power NFT temperatures ($\approx 400$~K). We predict that certain Au-Ag alloys may offer improved thermal stability as whole-NFT media compared to elemental Au, alongside plasmonic figures of merit comparable to that of Au. Simulations of certain solid solution Au-Pd/Pt alloys enable us to predict significantly enhanced thermal conductivity. We predict that alloying with Pd at low concentrations $\sim 10\%$ may preserve the NFT performance of Au, while offering the benefits of improved thermal and mechanical stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that a nontrivial Chern number results in quantized Hall conductance. What is less known is that, generically, the Hall response can be dramatically different from its quantized value in materials with broken inversion symmetry. This stems from the leading Hall contribution beyond the linear order, known as the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). While the BCD is in principle always present, it is typically very small outside of a narrow window close to a topological transition and is thus experimentally elusive without careful tuning of external fields, temperature, or impurities. In this work, we transcend this challenge by devising optical driving and quench protocols that enable practical and direct access to large BCD and nonlinear Hall responses. Varying the amplitude of an incident circularly polarized laser drives a topological transition between normal and Chern insulator phases, and importantly allows the precise unlocking of nonlinear Hall currents comparable to or larger than the linear Hall contributions. This strong BCD engineering is even more versatile with our two-parameter quench protocol, as demonstrated in our experimental proposal. Our predictions are expected to hold qualitatively across a broad range of Hall materials, thereby paving the way for the controlled engineering of nonlinear electronic properties in diverse media.</description>

Abstract: The Anderson overlap catastrophe (AOC) is a many-body effect arising as a result of a shakeup of a Fermi sea due to an abrupt change of a local potential, leading to a power-law dependence of the density of states on energy. Here we demonstrate that a standard quantum-dot detector can be employed as a highly tuneable probe of the AOC, where the power law can be continuously modified by a gate voltage. We show that signatures of the AOC have already appeared in previous experiments, and give explicit predictions allowing to tune and pinpoint their non-perturbative aspects.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e superlattices of antimonene on a Bi(111) substrate with van Hove singularity and Rashba-type spin polarization</title>

Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices consisting of two-dimensional materials have attracted immense attention because of emergent phenomena such as flat band-induced Mott insulating states and unconventional superconductivity. However, the effects of spin-orbit coupling on these materials have not yet been fully explored. Here, we show that single- and double-bilayer antimony honeycomb lattices, referred to as antimonene, form moir\'e superlattices on a Bi(111) substrate due to lattice mismatch. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal the presence of spectral peaks near the Fermi level, which are spatially modulated with the moir\'e period. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with density functional theory calculations clarify the surface band structure with saddle points near the Fermi level, which allows us to attribute the observed STM spectral peaks to the van Hove singularity. Moreover, spin-resolved ARPES measurements reveal that the observed surface states are Rashba-type spin-polarized. The present work has significant implications in that Fermi surface instability and symmetry breaking may emerge at low temperatures, where the spin degree of freedom and electron correlation also play important roles.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase-field model of cavity electromagnonic systems</title>

Abstract: Cavity electromagnonic system, which simultaneously consists of cavities for photons, magnons (quanta of spin waves), and acoustic phonons, provides an exciting platform to achieve coherent energy transduction among different physical systems down to single quantum level. Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n=1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum beats of a macroscopic polariton condensate in real space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally observe harmonic oscillations in a bosonic condensate of exciton-polaritons confined within an elliptical trap. These oscillations arise from quantum beats between two size-quantized states of the condensate, split in energy due to the trap's ellipticity. By precisely targeting specific spots inside the trap with non-resonant laser pulses, we control the frequency, amplitude, and phase of these quantum beats. The condensate wavefunction dynamics are visualized on a streak camera and mapped to the Bloch sphere, demonstrating Hadamard and Pauli-Z operations. We conclude that a qubit based on a superposition of these two polariton states would exhibit a coherence time exceeding the lifetime of an individual exciton-polariton by at least two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong optomechanical coupling -- a regime where mechanical motion is damped by environmental radiation -- has traditionally required demanding experimental ingredients such as superconducting resonators, high-quality optical cavities, or large magnetic fields. Here we demonstrate a room temperature, cavity-free, all-electric device reaching this regime at radio frequencies, enabled by a mechanically compliant parallel-plate capacitor with a nanoscale plate separation and an aspect ratio exceeding 1,000. The device has four orders of magnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal, and achieves a position imprecision rivaling an optical interferometer. With the help of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of mechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load. This work provides a technologically accessible route to high-precision sensing, transduction, and signal processing.</description>

      <title>Thermal crossover from a Chern insulator to a fractional Chern insulator in pentalayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By theoretically analyzing the recent temperature dependent transport data in pentalayer graphene [Lu et al., arXiv:2408.10203], we establish that the experimentally observed transition from low-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect to higher-temperature fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect is a crossover phenomenon arising from the competition between interaction and disorder energy scales, with the likely zero temperature ground state of the system being either a localized insulator or a Chern insulator with a quantized anomalous Hall effect. In particular, the intriguing suppression of FQAHE in favor of QAHE with decreasing temperature is explained as arising from the low-temperature localization of the carriers where disorder overcomes the interaction effects. We provide a detailed analysis of the data in support of the crossover scenario.</description>

Abstract: Low-noise amplifiers are of great importance in the field of quantum technologies. We study a thermally driven parametric amplifier based on a superconductor-insulator-graphene-insulator-superconductor (SIGIS) junction coupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. The strong non-linearity in the temperature dependence of our device leads to thermal self-modulation that produces impedance oscillations at frequencies around twice the angular cavity resonance frequency $\omega_\mathrm{r}$. In particular, reactance modulation of the effective capacitance yields a gain of 18.6 dB over a frequency span of 125 kHz with a minimum noise temperature of $T_\mathrm{N} = 1.4$ K. Our theoretical modelling gives insight into the exact mixing processes, confirmation of the electron-phonon coupling parameter and possible improvements of the studied system.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay between measurement-induced dynamics and conditional unitary evolution in quantum systems. We numerically and analytically investigate commuting random measurement and feedforward (MFF) processes, and find a sharp transition in their ability to generate entanglement negativity as the number of MFF channels varies. We also establish a direct connection between these findings and transitions induced by random dephasing from an environment with broken time-reversal symmetry. In one variant of the problem, we employ free probability theory to rigorously prove the transition's existence. Furthermore, these MFF processes have dynamic circuit representations that can be experimentally explored on current quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Magnetization by Defect-Assisted Exciton Recombination in Atomically Thin CrCl$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two dimensional (2D) semiconductors present unique opportunities to intertwine optical and magnetic functionalities and to tune these performances through defects and dopants. Here, we integrate exciton pumping into a quantum sensing protocol on nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond to image the optically-induced transient stray fields in few-layer, antiferromagnetic CrCl$_3$. We discover that exciton recombination enhances the in-plane magnetization of the CrCl$_3$ layers, with a predominant effect in the surface monolayers. Concomitantly, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal that nonradiative exciton recombination intensifies in atomically thin CrCl$_3$ with tightly localized, nearly dipole-forbidden excitons and amplified surface-to-volume ratio. Supported by experiments under controlled surface exposure and density functional theory calculations, we interpret the magnetically enhanced state to result from a defect-assisted Auger recombination that optically activates electron transfer between water vapor related surface impurities and the spin-polarized conduction band. Our work validates defect engineering as a route to enhance intrinsic magnetism in single magnetic layers and opens a novel experimental platform for studying optically-induced, transient magnetism in condensed matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: (i) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; (ii) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Non-reciprocal dynamics and the non-Hermitian skin effect of repulsively bound pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10449v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a Bose-Hubbard model coupled to an engineered environment which in the non-interacting limit is described by the celebrated Hatano-Nelson model. At strong interactions, two bosons occupying the same site form a so-called repulsively bound pair, or doublon. Using tensor-network simulations, we clearly identify a distinct doublon lightcone and show that the doublon inherits non-reciprocity from that of single particles. Applying the idea of reservoir engineering at the level of doublons, we introduce a new set of dissipators and we analytically show that then the doublon dynamics are governed by the Hatano-Nelson model. This brings about an interaction-induced non-Hermitian skin effect and non-reciprocal doublon motion. Combining features of the two models we study, we show that single particles and doublons can be made to spread with opposite directionality, opening intriguing possibilities for the study of dynamics in interacting non-reciprocal models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor $8/17$, where signatures of incompressibility have been observed in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene. We propose an Abelian state described by the ``$\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$" parton wave function, where a parton itself forms an FQHE state. This state is topologically distinct from the $8/17$ Levin-Halperin state, a daughter state of the Moore-Read state. We carry out extensive numerical exact diagonalization of the Coulomb interaction at 8/17 in the zeroth Landau level of bilayer graphene but find that our results cannot conclusively determine the topological order of the underlying ground state. We work out the low-energy effective theory of the $\overline{(8/3)}\bar{2}1^{3}$ edge and make predictions for experimentally measurable properties of the state which can tell it apart from the 8/17 Levin-Halperin state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This topical review article reports rapid progress on the generalization and application of entanglement in non-Hermitian free-fermion quantum systems. We begin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the Lindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian free-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is provided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the correlation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus on how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their Hermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties that emerge. Finally, we highlight various concrete studies, demonstrating that entanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing non-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological characteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique non-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is concluded with several future directions. Through this review, we hope to provide a useful guide for researchers who are interested in entanglement in non-Hermitian quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have been used extensively for high-sensitivity nanoscale sensing, but conventional approaches use confocal microscopy to measure individual centers sequentially, limiting throughput and access to non-local physical properties. Here we design and implement a multiplexed NV sensing platform that allows us to read out many single NV centers simultaneously using a low-noise camera. Using this platform, we coherently manipulate and read out the spin states of hundreds of individual NV centers in parallel, achieving comparable magnetic field sensitivity to confocal measurements. We also implement a parallelized version of spin-to-charge-conversion readout for low NV center spin state readout noise and use it to demonstrate multiplexed covariance magnetometry, in which we measure six two-point magnetic field correlators from four NV centers simultaneously. The number of correlators we can measure is limited only by the available laser power, opening the door to massively multiplexed covariance magnetometry. Our platform significantly increases the throughput and broadens the applications of nanoscale sensing using diamond quantum sensors.</description>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs) have recently been investigated extensively at the single-particle level. When many-body interactions become dominant, novel non-Hermitian physical phenomena can emerge. In this work, we theoretically study NHSEs controlled by dissipation and interaction. We consider a 1D zigzag Bose-Hubbard lattice, subject to magnetic flux, staggered onsite single-particle loss, and uniform onsite two-particle loss. When the two-particle loss is small, two-body bound eigenstates (i.e., doublons) are all localized at the same boundary due to the interplay of the magnetic flux and staggered single-particle loss. While, for strong two-particle loss, the localization direction of doublons is unexpectedly reversed. This is attributed to the effective strong nonreciprocal hopping of doublons contributing from the virtual second-order and third-order hopping processes of particle pairs in combination with the magnetic flux, the strong two-particle loss, and the many-body interaction. Moreover, a two-particle gain can induce the same skin-localization of doublons, which can be utilized to dynamically observe the NHSE and its reversal of doublons controlled by interactions. Our results open up a new avenue for exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena in many-body systems.</description>
