      <title>A Composite Target of a Radium Salt and a Soft Metal Matrix for Production of Ac-225 with a Proton or Electron Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of 225Ac using either a proton or electron accelerator requires a target of 226Ra. Radium metal is difficult to work with and so a radium salt, such as radium carbonate, is preferred as a target material. Normally available as a powder, the average density of the powder is low and the thermal conductivity is poor, thus limiting the beam power that can be dissipated in the target. This work proposes the creation of a solid mixture of a radium salt powder with a metal matrix. Although aluminum powder has been used in similar applications, we suggest that indium powder is good choice for the metal matrix in the case of radioactive radium salts. The target can be formed with low die pressure without any need for heating, thus simplifying the hot-cell equipment needed for target preparation. We describe how the solid mixture can be formed, measure its thermal conductivity and compare the value to model estimates. We calculate the yield of 225Ac under different scenarios. Calculations show that the radioactive isotopes of indium produced during the irradiation should not produce significant handling challenges post-irradiation. For the proposed target geometry and beam parameters, thermal modelling indicates that the target temperature will be below the melting point of indium and the heat flux from the surfaces will be manageable. Thermal resistance at the target interfaces is shown to have a large effect on the target temperature. Using indium powder to form the mixture, occupying about 40 % of the target volume, we find that the yield of 225Ac is 80 GBq (2 Ci) for a 10-day irradiation with a 24 MeV, 3 kW proton beam and approximately the same for three milkings of 225Ra after a 10-day irradiation with a 25 MeV, 20 kW electron beam.</description>

      <title>TIGRE v3: Efficient and easy to use iterative computed tomographic reconstruction toolbox for real datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) has been widely adopted in medicine and it is increasingly being used in scientific and industrial applications. Parallelly, research in different mathematical areas concerning discrete inverse problems has led to the development of new sophisticated numerical solvers that can be applied in the context of CT. The Tomographic Iterative GPU-based Reconstruction (TIGRE) toolbox was born almost a decade ago precisely in the gap between mathematics and high performance computing for real CT data, providing user-friendly open-source software tools for image reconstruction. However, since its inception, the tools' features and codebase have had over a twenty-fold increase, and are now including greater geometric flexibility, a variety of modern algorithms for image reconstruction, high-performance computing features and support for other CT modalities, like proton CT. The purpose of this work is two-fold: first, it provides a structured overview of the current version of the TIGRE toolbox, providing appropriate descriptions and references, and serving as a comprehensive and peer-reviewed guide for the user; second, it is an opportunity to illustrate the performance of several of the available solvers showcasing real CT acquisitions, which are typically not be openly available to algorithm developers.</description>

      <title>Variable Stiffness &amp; Dynamic Force Sensor for Tissue Palpation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palpation of human tissue during Minimally Invasive Surgery is hampered due to restricted access. In this extended abstract, we present a variable stiffness and dynamic force range sensor that has the potential to address this challenge. The sensor utilises light reflection to estimate sensor deformation, and from this, the force applied. Experimental testing at different pressures (0, 0.5 and 1 PSI) shows that stiffness and force range increases with pressure. The force calibration results when compared with measured forces produced an average RMSE of 0.016, 0.0715 and 0.1284 N respectively, for these pressures.</description>

      <title>Conceptualization of ionization dose to water to quantify radiation therapy doses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: \emph{Objective.} This study conceptualizes the ionization dose to water as the dose absorbed to water and expended exclusively on ionization, which is essential for cancer treatment, and formulates its dosimetric procedures for high-energy photon, electron, proton, and ion beams. It also aims to design optimal ionization chambers to reduce the large dosimetric uncertainty for proton and ion beams. \emph{Approach.} Based on the international code of practice, the dosimetric procedure without $W$-value correction was formulated for all these beam types, and that without stopping-power-ratio correction was formulated for proton and ion beams. For the latter, water-equivalent gas was considered for gas-sealed ionization chambers. The proposed reference dosimetry was simulated for virtual test beams. \emph{Main results.} For photon and electron beams, the ionization dose was essentially equivalent to the absorbed dose. For proton and ion beams, the dosimetric uncertainty would be greatly reduced to \SI{0.7}{\%} and \SI{1.0}{\%}, respectively, with water-equivalent gas, for which nitrogen-based gas mixtures with helium, methane, and ethane were designed. Ionization dosimetry with the helium mixture was prone and sensitive to leakage, while the methane and ethane mixtures were flammable. \emph{Significance.} The ionization dose with minimal beam-quality correction represents radiation therapy doses of improved accuracy, especially for proton and ion beams, and will be advantageously applicable to non-reference conditions and complex clinical beams of various types.</description>
