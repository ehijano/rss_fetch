      <title>NiaAutoARM: Automated generation and evaluation of Association Rule Mining pipelines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Numerical Association Rule Mining paradigm that includes concurrent dealing with numerical and categorical attributes is beneficial for discovering associations from datasets consisting of both features. The process is not considered as easy since it incorporates several processing steps running sequentially that form an entire pipeline, e.g., preprocessing, algorithm selection, hyper-parameter optimization, and the definition of metrics evaluating the quality of the association rule. In this paper, we proposed a novel Automated Machine Learning method, NiaAutoARM, for constructing the full association rule mining pipelines based on stochastic population-based meta-heuristics automatically. Along with the theoretical representation of the proposed method, we also present a comprehensive experimental evaluation of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>An LLM-Empowered Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithm For Multi-Component Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) are widely used for searching optimal solutions in complex multi-component applications. Traditional MOEAs for multi-component deep learning (MCDL) systems face challenges in enhancing the search efficiency while maintaining the diversity. To combat these, this paper proposes $\mu$MOEA, the first LLM-empowered adaptive evolutionary search algorithm to detect safety violations in MCDL systems. Inspired by the context-understanding ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), $\mu$MOEA promotes the LLM to comprehend the optimization problem and generate an initial population tailed to evolutionary objectives. Subsequently, it employs adaptive selection and variation to iteratively produce offspring, balancing the evolutionary efficiency and diversity. During the evolutionary process, to navigate away from the local optima, $\mu$MOEA integrates the evolutionary experience back into the LLM. This utilization harnesses the LLM's quantitative reasoning prowess to generate differential seeds, breaking away from current optimal solutions. We evaluate $\mu$MOEA in finding safety violations of MCDL systems, and compare its performance with state-of-the-art MOEA methods. Experimental results show that $\mu$MOEA can significantly improve the efficiency and diversity of the evolutionary search.</description>

      <title>Design Optimizer for Soft Growing Robot Manipulators in Three-Dimensional Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft growing robots are novel devices that mimic plant-like growth for navigation in cluttered or dangerous environments. Their ability to adapt to surroundings, combined with advancements in actuation and manufacturing technologies, allows them to perform specialized manipulation tasks. This work presents an approach for design optimization of soft growing robots; specifically, the three-dimensional extension of the optimizer designed for planar manipulators. This tool is intended to be used by engineers and robot enthusiasts before manufacturing their robot: it suggests the optimal size of the robot for solving a specific task. The design process models a multi-objective optimization problem to refine a soft manipulator's kinematic chain. Thanks to the novel Rank Partitioning algorithm integrated into Evolutionary Computation (EC) algorithms, this method achieves high precision in reaching targets and is efficient in resource usage. Results show significantly high performance in solving three-dimensional tasks, whereas comparative experiments indicate that the optimizer features robust output when tested with different EC algorithms, particularly genetic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Nature-Inspired Algorithms for Autism Spectrum Disorder Detection Using 3D Video Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder symptoms of which includes repetitive behaviour and lack of social and communication skills. Even though these symptoms can be seen very clearly in social but a large number of individuals with ASD remain undiagnosed. In this paper, we worked on a methodology for the detection of ASD from a 3-dimensional walking video dataset, utilizing supervised machine learning (ML) classification algorithms and nature-inspired optimization algorithms for feature extraction from the dataset. The proposed methodology involves the classification of ASD using a supervised ML classification algorithm and extracting important and relevant features from the dataset using nature-inspired optimization algorithms. We also included the ranking coefficients to find the initial leading particle. This selection of particle significantly reduces the computation time and hence, improves the total efficiency and accuracy for ASD detection. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed methodology, we deployed various combinationsalgorithms of classification algorithm and nature-inspired algorithms resulting in an outstanding classification accuracy of $100\%$ using the random forest classification algorithm and gravitational search algorithm for feature selection. The application of the proposed methodology with different datasets would enhance the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methodology. Due to high accuracy and less total computation time, the proposed methodology will offer a significant contribution to the medical and academic fields, providing a foundation for future research and advancements in ASD diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous Multi-agent Zero-Shot Coordination by Coevolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating agents that can achieve zero-shot coordination (ZSC) with unseen partners is a new challenge in cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Recently, some studies have made progress in ZSC by exposing the agents to diverse partners during the training process. They usually involve self-play when training the partners, implicitly assuming that the tasks are homogeneous. However, many real-world tasks are heterogeneous, and hence previous methods may be inefficient. In this paper, we study the heterogeneous ZSC problem for the first time and propose a general method based on coevolution, which coevolves two populations of agents and partners through three sub-processes: pairing, updating and selection. Experimental results on various heterogeneous tasks highlight the necessity of considering the heterogeneous setting and demonstrate that our proposed method is a promising solution for heterogeneous ZSC tasks.</description>
