      <title>Comptage de fibr\'es de Hitchin pour le groupe $\mathrm{SL}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ and let $D$ be a divisor on $C$ of degree $&gt;2g-2$. We assume that the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ is sufficiently large. Let $n$ be an integer and let $\beta$ be a line bundle on $C$ of degree $e$, coprime to $n$. We give a formula for the number of stable ($D$-twisted) Hitchin bundles over $C$ of rank $n$ and determinant $\beta$ in terms of the number of stable Hitchin bundles over $C'$ of rank $n/d$ and degree $e$ where $C'$ ranges over cyclic covers $C'$ of $C$ of degree $d$ dividing $n$. Using a work by Mozgovoy-O'Gorman, we derive a closed formula for the following invariants of the moduli space of ($D$-twisted) Hitchin bundles over $C$ of rank $n$, trace $0$ and determinant $\beta$: its number of points over finite extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q$, its $\ell$-adic Poincar\'e polynomial and its Euler-Poincar\'e characteristic. Our main tools are the fundamental lemma of automorphic induction and a support theorem for the relative cohomology of a local system on the Hitchin fibration for the group $\mathrm{GL}(n)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define Stone $\delta$-rings as a new class of $\delta$-rings. Via Stone duality, we shows that $\delta$-rings relates light condensed mathematics, which is developed by Clausen-Scholze. Also, we examine some phenomena for this relationship, for example, we observe $\delta$-rings which corresponds to metrizable compact Hausdorff spaces.</description>

      <title>Quiver Schemes for Nongeneric Stability and Cornering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the Le Bruyn--Procesi theorem to prove several results on quiver schemes for nongeneric stability conditions: We show that the stability-zero finite-type Nakajima quiver schemes are reduced points and give an example of a closely related nonreduced quiver scheme. In broader generality, we prove that adding modules supported on stability-zero vertices induces closed embeddings of quiver schemes, and show how in many cases the quiver scheme associated with the cornered algebra defines a limit to this system of embeddings. As an application, we show that there is an isomorphism between the underlying reduced schemes of certain equivariant Quot schemes and Nakajima quiver varieties.</description>

      <title>The geometric K-theory of quotient stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a quotient of a regular noetherian separated algebraic space $X$ over a field by an affine algebraic group $G$ having finite stabilizers (with some mild technical conditions), G. Vezzosi and A. Vistoli defined the \emph{geometric part} of the rational equivariant K-theory $K(X,G)$ and conjectured that it is isomorphic to the rational K-theory of the quotient $X/G$. In this paper we refine the construction of geometric K-theory to the rational K-theory of a quotient stack $[X/G]$ over an arbitrary excellent base; we show that it is part of an intrinsic decomposition of the K-theory of the stack and prove many properties that make it amenable to computations.</description>

      <title>On a Riemann-Roch formula for stacks with finite cyclotomic inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B. Toen defined a Riemann-Roch map from the rational algebraic K-theory of a tame Deligne-Mumford quotient stack to the \'etale K-theory of its inertia. He proved that this map is an isomorphism and that it is covariant with respect to proper maps. Moreover G. Vezzosi and A. Vistoli proved a decomposition theorem for the equivariant K-theory of a noetherian scheme. In this paper we give a geometric definition of the Vezzosi-Vistoli decomposition, interpreting the pieces as corresponding to the components of the \emph{cyclotomic inertia}. When the map from the cyclotomic inertia to the stack is finite, we can define a Riemann-Roch map in Toen's style. We prove that this map is an isomorphism and it is covariant with respect to proper relatively tame maps; moreover in some favourable circumstances we explicitly compute its inverse map, and show that we can recover Toen's one when the stack is tame Deligne-Mumford.</description>

      <title>On Miyanishi conjecture for quasi-projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miyanishi conjecture claims that for any variety over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, any endomorphism of such a variety which is injective outside a closed subset of codimension at least $2$ is bijective. We prove Miyanishi conjecture for any quasi-projective variety $X$ which is a dense open subset of a $\mathbb{Q}$-factorial normal projective variety $\overline{X}$ such that codim $(\overline{X} \setminus X) \ge 2$ with the ample canonical divisor or the ample anti-canonical divisor. Also, we observe Miyanishi conjecture without the conditions of its canonical divisor by using minimal model program. In particular, we prove Miyanishi conjecture in the case that $\overline{X}$ has canonical singularities and $\overline{X}$ has the canonical model which is obtained by divisorial contractions.</description>

      <title>Descendability of Faithfully Flat Covers of Perfect Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1981, L. Gruson and C. U. Jensen gave a new proof of the fact that, over a ring which is either Noetherian of Krull dimension $n$ or of cardinality $&lt; \aleph_n$, the projective dimension of any flat module is at most $n$. In this short paper, we observe that their arguments apply to the setting of quasicoherent sheaves over perfect stacks. As a consequence, we show that for any perfect stack $\mathfrak{X}$ with a faithfully flat cover $p : \mathrm{Spec}(R) \to \mathfrak{X}$, where $R$ is a Noetherian $\mathbb{E}_{\infty}$-ring of finite Krull dimension or satisfies the cardinality bound $2^{|\pi_*(R)|} &lt; \aleph_{\omega}$, $p_*(\mathcal{O}_{\mathrm{Spec}(R)})$ is a descendable algebra in $\mathrm{QCoh}({\mathfrak{X}})$.</description>

Abstract: We compute arithmetic support of the formal deformations $D=P+tQ_1+t^2Q_2+...$ of the differential operator $P=(x\partial_x-r_1)...(x\partial_x-r_k)$, where $r_1,...,r_k\in\mathbb{Q}$ for sufficiently large primes $p$ in terms of the monodromy of $D$ in characteristic zero. An analog of these results is also provided in the case of $q$-difference operators.</description>

      <title>Wonderful embedding for group schemes in the Bruhat--Tits theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$ over a discretely valued Henselian field $k$, using valuations of root datum and concave functions, the Bruhat--Tits theory defines an important class of open bounded subgroups of $G(k)$ which are essential objects in representation theory and arithmetic geometry. Moreover, these subgroups are uniquely determined by smooth affine group schemes whose generic fibers are $G$ over the ring of integers of $k$. To study these group schemes, when $G$ is adjoint and quasi-split, we systematically construct wonderful embedding for these group schemes which are uniquely determined by a big cell structure. The way that we construct our wonderful embedding is different from classical methods in the sense that we avoid embedding a group scheme into an ambient space and taking closure. We use an intrinsic and functorial method which is a variant of Artin--Weil method of birational group laws. Beyond the quasi-split case, our wonderful embedding is constructed by \'etale descent. Moreover our wonderful embedding behaves in a similar way to the classical wonderful compactification of $G$. Our results can serve as a bridge between the theory of wonderful compactifications and the Bruhat--Tits theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the Kuznetsov--Polishchuk exceptional collections on rational homogeneous spaces of the symplectic groups $\mathrm{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{C})$ are full and consist of vector bundles. To achieve this, we construct several classes of complexes, which we call generalized staircase complexes, symplectic staircase complexes and secondary staircase complexes -- each of which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the normality of commuting scheme for general linear Lie algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commuting scheme $\mathfrak{C}^{d}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ for reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{K}$ is the subscheme of $\mathfrak{g}^{d}$ defined by quadratic equations, whose $\mathbb{K}$-valued points are $d$-tuples of commuting elements in $\mathfrak{g}$ over $\mathbb{K}$. There is a long-standing conjecture that the commuting scheme $\mathfrak{C}^{d}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ is reduced. Moreover, a higher dimensional analog of Chevalley restriction conjecture was conjectured by Chen-Ng\^{o}. We show that the commuting scheme of $\mathfrak{C}^{2}_{\mathfrak{g}l_{n}}$ is Cohen-Macaulay and normal. As a corollary, we prove a 2-dimensional Chevalley restriction theorem for general linear group in positive characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family of varieties, the Euler discriminant locus distinguishes points where Euler characteristic differs from its generic value. We introduce a hypergeometric system associated with a flat family of very affine locally complete intersection varieties. It is proven that the Euler discriminant locus is its singular locus and is purely one-codimensional unless it is empty. Of particular interest is a family of very affine hypersurfaces. We coin the term hypergeometric discriminant for the characteristic variety of the hypergeometric system and establish a formula in terms of likelihood equations.</description>

In particular, we study cubic fourfolds having a polar net with an irreducible 10-nodal discriminant curve. They form a divisor in the moduli space of cubic fourfolds which we prove is not a Noether-Lefschetz divisor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The signature of a path is a sequence of tensors which allows to uniquely reconstruct the path. By employing the geometric theory of nonlinear systems of ordinary differential equations, we find necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions on the signature tensors of a path to be a solution of a given system of ODEs. As an application, we describe in detail the systems of ODEs that describe the trajectories of a vector field, in particular a linear and Hamiltonian one.</description>

      <title>Learning on a Razor's Edge: the Singularity Bias of Polynomial Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks often infer sparse representations, converging to a subnetwork during the learning process. In this work, we theoretically analyze subnetworks and their bias through the lens of algebraic geometry. We consider fully-connected networks with polynomial activation functions, and focus on the geometry of the function space they parametrize, often referred to as neuromanifold. First, we compute the dimension of the subspace of the neuromanifold parametrized by subnetworks. Second, we show that this subspace is singular. Third, we argue that such singularities often correspond to critical points of the training dynamics. Lastly, we discuss convolutional networks, for which subnetworks and singularities are similarly related, but the bias does not arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let X be a compact Riemann surface equipped with a real-analytic K\"ahler form $\omega$ and let E be a holomorphic vector bundle over $X$ equipped with a real-analytic Hermitian metric $h$. Suppose that the curvature of $h$ is Griffiths-positive. We prove the existence of a global asymptotic expansion in powers of $k$ of the Bergman kernel associated to $(S^k E, S^k h)$ and $\omega$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a Belyi function $\beta:\mathbb C\mathbb P^1\rightarrow \mathbb C\mathbb P^1$ ramified only over the points $-1,1,\infty$, a corresponding ``dessin d'enfant'' $\mathcal D_{\beta}$ is defined as the set $\beta^{-1}([-1,1])$ considered as a bi-colored graph on the Riemann sphere whose white and black vertices are points of the sets $\beta^{-1}\{-1\}$ and $\beta^{-1}\{1\}$ correspondingly. Merely the set $\beta^{-1}([-1,1])$ without a graph structure is called a support of $\mathcal D_{\beta}$. In this note, we solve the following problem: under what conditions different dessins $\mathcal D_{\beta_1}$ and $\mathcal D_{\beta_2}$ have equal supports?</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spectral decomposition of singularities of integrals and their integrands. Our results apply to any integral of Euler-Mellin type, and thus especially to every scalar Feynman integral. Specifically we provide for both the integrand and integral respectively; two explicit constructions of the characteristic variety and characteristic cycle of the constructible function and $D$-module they are associated with. From this we also obtain the singular locus or Landau singularities of the integral. En route we give a simple procedure to compute the local Euler obstruction function of a variety, and using this, to compute the Euler characteristic of the complex link of a Whitney stratum.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the analogue of the Andr\'e--Pink--Zannier conjecture in characteristic $p$. Precisely, we prove it for ordinary function field-valued points with big monodromy, in Shimura varieties of Hodge type. We also prove an algebraic characteristic $p$ analogue of Hecke-equidistribution (as formulated by Mazur) for Shimura varieties of Hodge type. We prove our main results by a global and local analysis of prime-to-$p$ Hecke correspondences, and by showing that Weyl special points are abundant in positive characterstic.</description>

      <title>Diagonal orbits in the wonderful compactification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The various types of compactifications of symmetric spaces and locally symmetric spaces are well-studied. Among them, the De Concini-Procesi compactification, also known as the wonderful compactification, of symmetric varieties has been found to have many applications. Intuitively, this compactification provides information at infinity. The diagonal action also extends the conjugation action on semisimple groups, which has received considerable attention. In this work, we will first describe the classification of certain diagonal orbits in the wonderful compactification of a semisimple adjoint group $ G $. We will then study the compactification of the maximal torus through representations of the simply connected cover $ \tilde{G} $, which, in a sense, parameterizes these diagonal orbits. Finally, we will focus on constructing the family of closures of the Steinberg fiber. We will examine the limit of this family and show that it is a union of He-Lusztig's $ G $-stable pieces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using pseudo-holomorphic curves, we establish a new enumerativity result for the fixed domain Gromov-Witten invariants and prove a symplectic version of a conjecture of Lian and Pandharipande. The original conjecture, which asserts that these invariants are enumerative for projective Fano manifolds and high degree curves, was recently disproved by Beheshti et al. However, we show that it holds when a complex structure is replaced by a generic almost complex structure. Our result explains the integrality of the fixed domain Gromov-Witten invariants observed in examples by Buch and Pandharipande.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the moduli space of solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations with $N$ spinors on a compact Riemann surface. These moduli spaces arise in a program to define a new enumerative invariant of 3-manifolds. They are also of independent interest in the geometry of algebraic curves, as they parameterize generalized divisors in Brill-Noether theory for higher rank vector bundles. We compute the Euler characteristic of these spaces, completing a computation initiated by Doan, and then compute their rational homology using spectral curves and techniques of Fulton and Lazarsfeld.</description>

Abstract: The topological space of the stack of $G$-zips can be computed using a refinement process. We extend this refinement process to a more general framework and show that in many situations this process can be used to compute the equivalence classes of a certain equivalence relation, which in the case of $G$-zips is precisely the topological space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we give a different proof of Quillen's D\'evissage theorem using Barwick's theorem of the heart. The key ingredient is a certain short exact sequence of dg categories, which is closely related with the Auslander-type construction for nilpotent extensions which was used in the papers of Kuznetsov-Lunts \cite{KL15}, Land-Tamme \cite{LT19} and the author \cite{E20}.</description>

Abstract: A K3 surface over a number field has infinitely many rational points over a finite field extension. For K3 surfaces of degree 2, arising as double covers of $\mathbb{P}^2$ branched along a smooth sextic curve, we give a bound for the degree of such an extension. Moreover, using ideas of van Luijk and a surface constructed by Enselhans and Jahnel, we give an explicit family of K3 surfaces of degree 2 defined over $\mathbb{Q}$ with geometric Picard number 1 and infinitely many $\mathbb{Q}$-rational points that is Zariski dense in the moduli space of K3 surfaces of degree 2.</description>

As applications, we discuss the closedness of logarithmic forms, injectivity theorems and obtain a kind of degeneration of spectral sequence at $E_1$, and we also prove that the pair $(X,D)$ has unobstructed deformations for any smooth divisor $D\in|-2K_X|$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1901.07089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a klt projective variety with numerically trivial canonical divisor. A surjective endomorphism $f:X\to X$ is amplified (resp.~quasi-amplified) if $f^*D-D$ is ample (resp.~big) for some Cartier divisor $D$. We show that after iteration and equivariant birational contractions, an quasi-amplified endomorphism will descend to an amplified endomorphism.
  As an application, when $X$ is Hyperk\"ahler, $f$ is quasi-amplified if and only if it is of positive entropy. In both cases, $f$ has Zariski dense periodic points. When $X$ is an abelian variety, we give and compare several cohomological and geometric criteria of amplified endomorphisms and endomorphisms with countable and Zariski dense periodic points (after an uncountable field extension).</description>

Abstract: This is the first part in a series of papers on counting surfaces on Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Besides the Hilbert scheme of 2-dimensional subschemes, we introduce \emph{two} types of moduli spaces of stable pairs. We show that all three moduli spaces are related by GIT wall-crossing and parametrize stable objects in the bounded derived category.
  We construct \emph{reduced} Oh-Thomas virtual cycles on the moduli spaces via Kiem-Li cosection localization and prove that they are deformation invariant along Hodge loci. As an application, we show that the variational Hodge conjecture holds for any family of Calabi-Yau 4-folds supporting a non-zero reduced virtual cycle.</description>

Abstract: We describe the families of minimal rational curves on any complete symmetric variety, and the corresponding varieties of minimal rational tangents (VMRT). In particular, we prove that these varieties are homogeneous and that for non-exceptional irreducible wonderful varieties, there is a unique family of minimal rational curves, and hence a unique VMRT. We relate these results to the restricted root system of the associated symmetric space. In particular we answer by the negative a question of Hwang: for certain Fano wonderful symmetric varieties, the VMRT has two connected components.</description>

Abstract: We characterize adjoint ideal sheaves via ultraproducts and, utilizing this characterization, study their behavior under pure morphisms. In particular, given a pure morphism $f:Y \to X$ between normal quasi-projective complex varieties, a reduced divisor $D$ and an effective $\mathbb{Q}$-Weil divisor $\Gamma$ on $X$ without common components, we have the following result: if the cycle-theoretic pullback $E:=f^{\natural}D$ is reduced and $(Y, E+f^*\Gamma)$ is of plt type along $E$, then $(X, D+\Gamma)$ is of plt type along $D$. This provides an affirmative answer to a question posed by Z. Zhuang.</description>

      <title>The affine Grassmannian as a presheaf quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04314v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$ over a ring $A$, its affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ plays important roles in a wide range of subjects and is typically defined as the \'etale sheafification of the presheaf quotient $LG/L^+G$ of the loop group $LG$ by its positive loop subgroup $L^+G$. We show that the Zariski sheafification gives the same result. Moreover, for totally isotropic $G$ (for instance, for quasi-split $G$), we show that no sheafification is needed at all: $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ is already the presheaf quotient $LG/L^+G$, which seems new already in the classical case of $G$ over $\mathbb{C}$. For totally isotropic $G$, we also show that the affine Grassmannian may be formed using polynomial loops. We deduce all of these results from the study of $G$-torsors on $\mathbb{P}^1_A$ that is ultimately built on the geometry of $\mathrm{Bun}_G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore to what extent the existence of a Rost cycle module structure and a cycle complex associated with a homotopy invariant sheaf with transfers extends in the absence of homotopy invariance. We show that every reciprocity sheaf over a perfect field gives rise to a partial cycle premodule. We also show that the first cohomology group of a homotopy invariant \'etale sheaf has a partial cycle premodule structure, over a perfect field of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Singular plane curves: freeness and combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on various aspects of singular complex plane curves, mostly in the context of their homological properties and the associated combinatorial structures. We formulate some challenging open problems that can point to new directions in research, for example by introducing weak Ziegler pairs of curve arrangements. Moreover, we construct new examples of different Ziegler pairs, in both the classical and the weak sense, and present new geometric approaches to construction problems of singular plane curves.</description>

      <title>On Teissier's example of an equisingularity class that cannot be defined over the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A result of Teissier says that the cone over one of classical polygon examples in the real projective space gives, by complexification, a surface singularity which is not Whitney equisingular to a singularity defined over the field of rational numbers Q. In this note we correct the example and give a complete proof of Tesissier's result.</description>

      <title>Abhyankar-Moh Semigroups for arbitrary hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an arbitrary hypersurface singularity, we construct a family of semigroups associated with algebraically closed fields that arise as an infinite union of rings of series. These semigroups extend the value semigroup of a plane curve studied by Abhyankar and Moh. The algebraically closed fields under consideration possess a natural valuation that induces a corresponding value semigroup. We establish the necessary conditions under which these semigroups are independent of the choice of the root. Moreover, the extensions proposed by P. Gonz\'alez and Kiyek-Micus, where Gonz\'alez specifically addresses the case of quasi-ordinary singularities, and the extension introduced by Abbas-Assi, can be understood as particular instances within our constructed family.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine, up to exponentiating, the polar locus of the multivariable archimedean zeta function associated to a finite collection of polynomials F. The result is the monodromy support locus of F, a topological invariant. We give a relation between the multiplicities of the irreducible components of the monodromy support locus and the polar orders. These generalize results of Barlet for the case when F is a single polynomial. Our result determines the slopes of the polar locus of the zeta function of F, closing a circle of results of Loeser, Maisonobe, Sabbah. We apply our main result to elucidate the topological information contained by the oblique part of the zero locus of any ideal of Bernstein-Sato type.</description>

      <title>Invertible Morava motives in quadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We associate to any element in the Milnor K-theory of a field $k$ modulo 2 an invertible Morava K-theory motive over $k$. Specifically, for $\alpha$ in $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ we construct an invertible $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive $L_\alpha$ in a way that is natural in the base field and additive in $\alpha$. This can be seen as categorification of $\mathrm{K}^{\mathrm{M}}_{n+1}(k)/2$ in motives.
  The motives $L_\alpha$ are constructed as direct summands of the $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives of quadrics, and we develop the necessary framework for the study of the latter. We show that passing to the field of functions of quadrics of dimension greater than or equal to $2^{n+1}-1$ does not lose any information about the structure of $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives. This is based on the study of "decomposition of the diagonal" in Morava K-theory of quadrics.
  For quadrics of dimension less than $2^{n+1}-1$, we show that their Chow motives can be "reconstructed" from their $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motives, although the latter appear structurally simpler. Our proof of this result relies on the use of the unstable symmetric operations of Vishik on algebraic cobordism.
  The occurrence of the motive $L_\alpha$ as a direct summand of the $\mathrm{K}(n)$-motive of $X$ can be seen as evidence that $\alpha$ is a cohomological invariant of $X$. We study this occurrence for quadrics and relate it to Kahn's Descent conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We establish the geometric Bogomolov conjecture for semiabelian varieties over function fields. We show a closed subvariety contains Zariski dense sets of small points, if and only if, after modulo its stabilizer, it is a torsion translate of a constant variety. A new phenomenon is that a special subvariety may not have a Zariski dense set of points of height 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.09870v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the irreducible components of Igusa varieties for Shimura varieties of Hodge type under a mild condition and use that to compute the irreducible components of central leaves. In particular, we show that a strong version of the discrete Hecke orbit conjecture is false in general. Our method combines recent work of D'Addezio on monodromy groups of compatible local systems with a generalisation of a method of Hida, using the Honda--Tate theory for Shimura varieties of Hodge type developed by Kisin--Madapusi--Shin. We also determine the irreducible components of Newton strata in Shimura varieties of Hodge type by combining our methods with recent work of Zhou--Zhu.</description>

      <title>Semi-stable representations as limits of crystalline representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an explicit sequence $V_{k_n,a_n}$ of crystalline representations of exceptional weights converging to a given irreducible two-dimensional semi-stable representation $V_{k,{\mathcal{L}}}$ of $\mathrm{Gal}({\overline{\mathbb{Q}}}_p/{\mathbb{Q}}_p)$. The convergence takes place in the blow-up space of two-dimensional trianguline representations studied by Colmez and Chenevier. The process of blow-up is described in detail in the rigid analytic setting and may be of independent interest. Also, we recover a formula of Stevens expressing the ${\mathcal{L}}$-invariant as a logarithmic derivative.
  Our result can be used to compute the reduction of $V_{k,{\mathcal{L}}}$ in terms of the reductions of the $V_{k_n,a_n}$. For instance, using the zig-zag conjecture we recover (resp. extend) the work of Breuil-M\'ezard and Guerberoff-Park computing the reductions of the $V_{k,{\mathcal{L}}}$ for weights at most $p-1$ (resp. $p+1$), at least on the inertia subgroup. In the cases where zig-zag is known, we are further able to obtain some new information about the reductions for small odd weights. Finally, we explain some apparent violations to local constancy in the weight of the reductions of crystalline representations of small weight.</description>

Abstract: We describe symplectic mapping class relations between products of positive Dehn twists along Lagrangian spheres in Weinstein $4$-manifolds, all of which are affine $\mathbb{C}$ varieties. The relations are obtained by applying classification results for Fano $3$-folds and polarized $K3$ surfaces of small genus to a general methodology -- finding pencil pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study formal series which are invariants of plumbed 3-manifolds twisted by root lattices. These series extend the BPS $q$-series $\widehat{Z}(q)$ recently defined in Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park, and further refined in Ri. We show that the series $\widehat{Z}(q)$ is unique in an appropriate sense and decomposes as the average of related series which are themselves invariant under the five Neumann moves amongst plumbing trees. Explicit computations are presented in the case of Brieskorn spheres and a non-Seifert manifold.</description>

      <title>Closed real plane curves of hyperelliptic solutions of focusing gauged modified KdV equation of genus three</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The real and imaginary parts of the focusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (MKdV) equation defined over the complex field $\mathbb{C}$ give rise to the focusing gauged MKdV (FGMKdV) equations. As a generalization of Euler's elastica whose curvature obeys the focusing static MKdV (FSMKdV) equation, we study real plane curves whose curvature obeys the FGMKdV equation since the FSMKdV equation is a special case of the FGMKdV equation. In this paper, we focus on the hyperelliptic curves of genus three. By tuning some moduli parameters and initial conditions, we show closed real plane curves associated with the FGMKdV equation beyond Euler's figure-eight of elastica.</description>
