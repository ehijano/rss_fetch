      <title>Analysing the coverage of the University of Bologna's publication metadata in an existing source of open research information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study focuses on analysing the coverage of publications' metadata available in the Current Research Information System (CRIS) infrastructure of the University of Bologna (UNIBO), implemented by the IRIS platform, within an authoritative source of open research information, i.e. OpenCitations. The analysis considers data regarding the publication entities alongside the citation links. We precisely quantify the proportion of UNIBO IRIS publications included in OpenCitations, examine their types, and evaluate the number of citations in OpenCitations that involve IRIS publications. Our methodology filters and transforms data dumps of IRIS and OpenCitations, creating novel datasets used for the analysis. Our findings reveal that only 37.7% of IRIS is covered in OpenCitations, with journal articles exhibiting the highest coverage. We identified 4,290,096 citation links pointing to UNIBO IRIS publications. From a purely quantitative perspective, comparing our results with broader proprietary services like Scopus and Web of Science reveals a small gap in the average number of citations per bibliographic resource. However, further analysis with updated data is required to support this speculation.</description>

      <title>The \textit{Questio de aqua et terra}: A Computational Authorship Verification Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Questio de aqua et terra is a cosmological treatise traditionally attributed to Dante Alighieri. However, the authenticity of this text is controversial, due to discrepancies with Dante's established works and to the absence of contemporary references. This study investigates the authenticity of the Questio via computational authorship verification (AV), a class of techniques which combine supervised machine learning and stylometry. We build a family of AV systems and assemble a corpus of 330 13th- and 14th-century Latin texts, which we use to comparatively evaluate the AV systems through leave-one-out cross-validation. Our best-performing system achieves high verification accuracy (F1=0.970) despite the heterogeneity of the corpus in terms of textual genre. The key contribution to the accuracy of this system is shown to come from Distributional Random Oversampling (DRO), a technique specially tailored to text classification which is here used for the first time in AV.
  The application of the AV system to the Questio returns a highly confident prediction concerning its authenticity. These findings contribute to the debate on the authorship of the Questio, and highlight DRO's potential in the application of AV to cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>Datasheets for Healthcare AI: A Framework for Transparency and Bias Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of AI in healthcare has the potential to improve patient care, optimize clinical workflows, and enhance decision-making. However, bias, data incompleteness, and inaccuracies in training datasets can lead to unfair outcomes and amplify existing disparities. This research investigates the current state of dataset documentation practices, focusing on their ability to address these challenges and support ethical AI development. We identify shortcomings in existing documentation methods, which limit the recognition and mitigation of bias, incompleteness, and other issues in datasets. We propose the 'Healthcare AI Datasheet' to address these gaps, a dataset documentation framework that promotes transparency and ensures alignment with regulatory requirements. Additionally, we demonstrate how it can be expressed in a machine-readable format, facilitating its integration with datasets and enabling automated risk assessments. The findings emphasise the importance of dataset documentation in fostering responsible AI development.</description>
