      <title>Edge-state transport in gapped bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate electronic transport in gapped bilayer graphene (gBLG) devices. For certain edge terminations -typically a combination of zigzag, armchair, and bearded types - we observe edge state conduction within the band gap, which is opened by a potential bias between the two layers. The edge states can generate a non-local resistance, in line with recent experiments [1]. Band structure calculations of gBLG nanoribbons corroborate the existence of the edge states, whose edge localization can be switched by tuning the electron energy. Their existence strongly depends on the edge termination and does not originate from a topological bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform Thermal Conductivity in Nanoscale Multiple Hotspot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nanoscale hotspot thermal transport is crucial in electronic devices. Contrary to common perception, recent experiments show that closely spaced nanoscale multiple hotspots can enhance heat dissipation. Here, the thermal transport in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems is investigated by solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The local thermal conductivity is proposed to describe the non-uniform spatial distribution of heat transport capability in nanoscale multiple hotspot systems. The maximum value exceeds the uniform heating case by up to 27%, which is attributed to the spatially varying fraction of unscattered phonons emitted from hotspots. Moreover, the effects and mechanisms of hotspot spacing on thermal transport are investigated, showing that reducing the hotspot spacing can enhance the heat flux by up to 40%. This work challenges the conventional view that thermal transport capability is spatially uniform throughout the system and provides fundamental insights for thermal management in high-power-density integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Micrometer-Range Spin-Wave Transport in Artificial Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial spin ice (ASI) systems exhibit fascinating phenomena, such as frustration and the formation of magnetic monopole states, and Dirac strings. However, exploring the wave phenomena in these systems is elusive due to the weak dipolar coupling that governs their interactions. In this study, we demonstrate coherent spin-wave propagation in an hybrid ASI system, which is based on a multilayered ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and in-plane magnetized nanoelements embedded within it. We show that this system enables spin-wave transmission over a one-micrometer distance via exchange-mediated coupling between subsystems and evanescent spin-wave tunneling through the out-of-plane magnetized parts. This system overcomes the limitations of purely dipolar interactions in standard ASIs while preserving their fundamental properties. Thus, it provides a platform for studying spin-wave phenomena in frustrated ASI systems and paves the way for exploiting them in analog signal processing with spin waves.</description>

      <title>Torsion-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in helical magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that in magnets possessing an inversion center in the absence of deformations, a torsion-induced Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (tiDMI) can arise. A microscopic mechanism for this interaction is described, involving the transfer of angular momentum to the lattice upon electron reflection from the magnet's boundary. An estimate of the tiDMI constant is provided. It is demonstrated that tiDMI can lift the chiral degeneracy in helimagnets, and a way for experimentally observing this effect is proposed.</description>

      <title>Size optimization for observeing Majorana fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana fermions (zero modes) are predicted to emerge in nanowire-superconductor heterostructures. This theoretical prediction typically relies on an oversimplified model, where both the nanowire and the superconductor are idealized as one-dimensional systems. In reality, heterostructures have finite sizes that deviate from this idealization-and as a result, smoking-gun evidence confirming the existence of these zero modes remains elusive. Here, we investigate the finite-size effects of both the nanowire and the superconductor, and optimize their sizes to ensure that only one Majorana fermion exists at each end of the heterostructure. It is discovered that the optimal transverse sizes of the nanowire are less than 100nm in width and approximately 1nm in thickness. For the superconductor layer, its optimal thickness (a key aspect of its size) must exceed its coherence length. We also present the optimal sizes of the two types of materials used in the experiment in a quantitative manner. Notably, the identified optimal thickness of the superconductor (Al films, $\sim$1000nm)--a critical size parameter--is two orders of magnitude larger than the thickness of Al films currently utilized in experimental devices (e.g., InSb-Al and InAs-Al heterostructures). Our findings could explain why Majorana fermions have not been observed in current experiments, and offer guidance for the size selection of heterostructures to implement Majorana fermions in future studies.</description>

      <title>Enabling the bulk photovoltaic effect in centrosymmetric materials through an external electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a practical approach to electrically tuning the nonlinear photoresponse of two-dimensional semiconductors by explicitly incorporating a static out-of-plane electric field into the electronic ground state prior to optical excitation, as a gate bias. The method is implemented by dressing a Wannier-interpolated Hamiltonian with the field through its position matrix elements, which allows the gate bias to modify orbital hybridization and band dispersion beyond perturbative treatments. Within the independent-particle approximation, the resulting second-order (shift) conductivity is evaluated for both centrosymmetric and non-centrosymmetric layered systems. Applied to MoS$_2$, the approach captures the emergence of a finite shift current in centrosymmetric bilayers and the tunability of intrinsic responses in polar structures. The shift conductivity rises linearly at small fields and saturates at higher intensities, reflecting the competition between the growing shift vector and the weakening interband coupling as resonant transitions move away from high-symmetry valleys. A Taylor expansion of the field-dressed conductivity connects this behavior to the third-order optical response, revealing a unified picture of field-induced nonlinearities. These results establish field dressing of Wannier Hamiltonians as a practical route to model and predict nonlinear photocurrents in layered materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-hole pairs, are responsible for strong optical resonances near the bandgap in low-dimensional materials and wide-bandgap insulators. Although current ab initio methods can accurately determine exciton energies and eigenstates, their symmetries have been much less explored. In this work, we employ standard group-theory methods to analyse the transformation properties of excitonic states, obtained by solving the BSE, under crystal symmetry operations. We develop an approach to assign irreducible-representation labels to excitonic states, providing a state-of-the-art framework for analysing their symmetries and selection rules (including, for example, the case of exciton-phonon coupling). Complementary to the symmetry classification, we introduce the concept of total crystal angular momentum for excitons in the presence of rotational symmetries, allowing the derivation of conservation laws. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these symmetry properties can be exploited to greatly enhance the computational efficiency of exciton calculations with the BSE. We apply our methodology to three prototypical systems to understand the role of symmetries in different contexts: (i) For LiF, we present the symmetry analysis of the entire excitonic dispersion and examine the selection rules for optical absorption. (ii) In the calculation of resonant Raman spectra of monolayer MoSe2, we demonstrate how the conservation of total crystal angular momentum governs exciton-phonon interactions, leading to the observed resonant enhancement. (iii) In bulk hBN, we analyze the role of symmetries for the coupling of finite-momentum excitons to finite-momentum phonons and their manifestation in the phonon-assisted luminescence spectra. This work establishes a general and robust framework for understanding the symmetry properties of excitons in crystals, providing a foundation for future studies.</description>

      <title>Formation of Light-Emitting Defects in Ag-based Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical memristors are innovative devices that enable the integration of electro-optical functionalities - such as light modulation, multilevel optical memory, and nonvolatile reprogramming - into neuromorphic networks. Recently, their capabilities have expanded with the development of light-emitting memristors, which operate through various emission mechanisms. One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements. The findings provide valuable insights into controlling emission processes in memristors, paving the way for their integration as essential components in neuromorphic circuits.</description>

      <title>Phonon-tunable THz magnonic emission in multiferroic heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective excitations such as magnons and polar phonons provide natural access to the terahertz (THz) regime, but efficient generation and tunability remain elusive. Multiferroic BiFeO3 combines both orders at room temperature, offering a unique platform for narrowband THz emission. Here, we achieve efficient sub-bandgap optical rectification of coupled phonon-polaritons near 2 THz in bare epitaxial thin films. In Pt/BiFeO3 bilayers, we demonstrate that coupling the electromagnon branch with ultrafast strain waves, optically generated in Pt layers with various thicknesses, can produce tunable and narrowband emission between 0.4-0.8 THz. These results uncover the intertwined role of phonons, magnons, and magneto-acoustic dynamics in antiferromagnetic multiferroics, and establish these hybrid platforms as versatile engineered narrowband THz sources.</description>

      <title>Dichroism from Thermoelectric Chiral Drives: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under thermoelectric chiral drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</description>

      <title>Real-time Monitoring of Neon Film Growth for Electron-on-Neon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) charge states coupled to superconducting circuits are a promising platform for quantum computing. Control over the formation of these charge states requires techniques to track and control the growth of solid Ne films on the circuit surface. We demonstrate a real-time Ne film-growth monitor using high-transition-temperature (high-$T_c$) YBCO microwave resonators. The high $T_c$ enables tracking of the film thickness near Ne's triple temperature and below. Across more than 300 solidification experiments, we find that the final Ne thickness varies stochastically from a few nm to a few $\mu$m for films solidified from the liquid phase. By increasing the driving power in the resonator, we consistently reduce the final thickness to below 100 nm. These results represent an important step toward controlled formation of Ne films for eNe qubits and highlight the broader utility of high-$T_c$ resonators for hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Giant enhancement of transport driven by active fluctuations: impact of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a paradoxical effect has been demonstrated in which transport of a free Brownian particle driven by active fluctuations in the form of white Poisson shot noise can be significantly enhanced when it is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. This phenomenon can emerge in an overdamped system, but it may also be inertia-induced. Here, we considerably extend previous studies and comprehensively investigate the impact of inertia on the effect of free transport enhancement observed in the overdamped system. We detect that inertia can not only induce this phenomenon, but depending on a parameter regime, it may also strengthen, weaken, or even destroy it. We exemplify these different scenarios and explore the parameter space to identify the corresponding regions where they emerge. The variance of the active fluctuations amplitude distribution is a key determinant of the inertia influence on the effect of free transport amplification. Our results are relevant not only for microscopic physical systems but also for biological ones, such as, e.g., living cells, where fluctuations generated by metabolic activities are active by default.</description>

      <title>Mean-field Modelling of Moir\'e Materials: A User's Guide with Selected Applications to Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the theoretical modelling of moir\'e materials, focusing on various aspects of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MA-TBG) viewed through the lens of Hartree-Fock mean-field theory. We first provide an elementary introduction to the continuum modelling of moir\'e bandstructures, and explain how interactions are incorporated to study correlated states. We then discuss how to implement mean-field simulations of ground state structure and collective excitations in this setting. With this background established, we rationalize the power of mean-field approximations in MA-TBG, by discussing the idealized "chiral-flat" strong-coupling limit, in which ground states at electron densities commensurate with the moir\'e superlattice are exactly captured by mean-field ans\"atze. We then illustrate the phenomenological shortcomings of this limit, leading us naturally into a discussion of the intermediate-coupling incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) order and its origins in ever-present heterostrain. IKS and its placement within an expanded Hartree-Fock manifold form our first "case study". Our second case study involves time-dependence, and focuses on the collective modes of various broken-symmetry insulators in MA-TBG. As a third and final case study, we return to the strong-coupling picture, which can be stabilized by aligning MA-TBG to an hBN substrate. In this limit, we show how mean field theory can be adapted to the translationally non-invariant setting in order to quantitatively study the energetics of domain walls in orbital Chern insulating states. We close with a discussion of extensions and further applications. Used either as a standalone reference or alongside the accompanying open-source code, this review should enable readers with a basic knowledge of band theory and many-body physics to systematically build and analyze detailed models of generic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and extrinsic photogalvanic effects in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15005v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chiral lattice structure of twisted bilayer graphene with D6 symmetry allows for intrinsic photogalvanic effects only at off-normal incidence, while additional extrinsic effects are known to be induced by a substrate or a gate potential. In this work, we first compute the intrinsic effects and show they reverse sign at the magic angle, revealing a band inversion at the {\Gamma} point. We next consider different extrinsic effects, showing how they can be used to track the strengths of the substrate coupling or displacement field. We also show that the approximate particle-hole symmetry implies stringent constraints on the chemical potential dependence of all photocurrents. A detailed comparison of intrinsic vs. extrinsic photocurrents therefore reveals a wealth of information about the band structure and can also serve as a benchmark to constrain the symmetry breaking patterns of correlated states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic injection photocurrents in valley polarized states of twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene displays a complex phase diagram as a function of flat band filling, featuring compressibility cascade transitions and a variety of competing ground states with broken spin, valley and point group symmetries. Recent THz photocurrent spectroscopy experiments have shown a dependence on the filling which is not consistent with the simplest cascade picture of sequential filling of equivalent flat bands. In this work, we show that when time-reversal symmetry is broken due to valley polarization, a magnetic injection photocurrent develops which can be used to distinguish different spin-valley polarization scenarios. Using the topological heavy fermion model we compute both shift and injection currents as a function of filling and argue that current experiments can be used to determine the spontaneous valley polarization.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Electric conductivity of graphene: Kubo model versus a nonlocal quantum field theory model (arXiv:2403.02279v3)"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Rodriguez-Lopez, Wang, and Antezza [Phys. Rev. B v.111, 115428 (2025)] compared the theoretical descriptions of electric conductivity of graphene given by the Kubo model and quantum field theory in terms of the polarization tensor. According to this article, in the spatially nonlocal case, the quantum field theoretical description contains ``hard inconsistencies". By modifying the equality, which relates the conductivity and polarization expressions, the predictions of quantum field theory were revised and brought in agreement with those following from the nonrelativistic Kubo model. Here, it is shown that this modification violates the requirement of gauge invariance and, thus, is unacceptable. By comparing both theoretical approaches, we demonstrate that all the results obtained within quantum field theory are physically well justified whereas an application of the modified expression for the conductivity of graphene leads to the consequences of nonphysical character.</description>

      <title>Floquet-engineered Valley Topology with Anisotropic Response in 1T'-WSe$_2$ and Janus WSeTe monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Valley topology has emerged as a key concept for realizing new classes of quantum states. Here, we investigate Floquet-engineered topological phase transitions in anisotropic 1T'-WSe$_2$ and its Janus derivative WSeTe monolayers, which exhibit valley-degenerate and valley-polarized characteristics, respectively. In 1T'-WSe$_2$, a single topological-phase-transition (TPT) occurs from the quantum-spin-Hall state (QSH) to the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) state, involving one spin channel at both valleys simultaneously. In contrast, Janus WSeTe undergoes a two-stage Floquet-driven TPT that occurs within a single valley and sequentially involves two spin components. The intermediate phase manifests as a valley-polarized QAH (vp-QAH) state with a finite valley Chern number, while the final phase evolves into a high-Chern-number QAH state with distinct valley gaps. Furthermore, an in-plane anisotropic response of the TPTs is predicted under oblique light incidence, reflecting the intrinsic low-symmetry nature of the lattice. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of Floquet-engineered valley-based topological properties and offer guidance for designing light-controllable valleytronic and topological devices.</description>

      <title>Spectral Riemann Surface Topology of Gapped Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18616v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show topological configurations of the complex-valued spectra in gapped non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive EPs in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that is protected by an energy gap in the spectrum. Their presence or absence establishes topologically distinct configurations for fully non-degenerate systems and tuning between them requires a closing of the gap, forming exceptional point degeneracies. We provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Cascading Flat Bands in Breathing Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat bands have become a pillar of modern condensed matter physics and photonics owing to the vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states. Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Fractional Phases in Multi-Band Vortexable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study topological flat bands with distinct features that deviate from conventional Landau level behavior. We show that even in the ideal quantum geometry limit, moire flat band systems can exhibit physical phenomena fundamentally different from Landau levels without lattices. In particular, we find new fractional quantum Hall states emerging from multi-band vortexable systems, where multiple exactly flat bands appear at the Fermi energy. While the set of bands as a whole exhibits ideal quantum geometry, individual bands separately lose vortexability, and thus making them very different from a stack of Landau levels. At certain filling fractions, we find fractional states whose Hall conductivity deviates from the filling factor. Through careful numerical and analytical studies, we rule out all known mechanisms--such as fractional quantum Hall crystals or separate filling of trivial and topological bands--as possible explanations. Leveraging the exact solvability of vortexable systems, we use analytic Bloch wavefunctions to uncover the origin of these new fractional states, which arises from the commensurability between the moire unit cell and the magnetic unit cell of an emergent effective magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Trion quantum coherence in site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deterministically positioned pyramidal InGaAs quantum dots (QDs) exhibit exceptional quantum properties, making them highly promising candidates for scalable on-chip quantum information processing. In this work, we investigate the coherent dynamics of positively charged excitons under the influence of strong magnetic fields in the Faraday configuration. Pyramidal quantum dots exhibit a fourfold splitting of the charged excitons even in the Faraday configuration, giving rise to an optically addressable double-Lambda{\Lambda} system akin to self-assembled quantum dots in oblique magnetic fields. Here, we investigate ultrafast complete coherent control of the trion to ground state transition utilizing advanced optical resonant excitation techniques and we observe quantum coherence over timescales that are similar to other prominent quantum dot platforms. These results pave the way towards establishing site-controlled pyramidal InGaAs QDs as scalable platforms for quantum information processing, expanding the reach of coherent control to new quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Direct Thermal Imaging of Domain Wall Hot Spots in LiNbO3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain wall devices offer a promising route to low-voltage, reconfigurable nanoelectronics by confining currents to nanoscale conducting interfaces within an insulating bulk. However, the potential for resistive heating and unregulated temperature increases due to domain wall conduction remains unexplored. Here, scanning thermal microscopy is employed to directly image hot spots in thin-film lithium niobate domain wall devices. Piezoresponse force microscopy shows that the hot spots correlate with nanodomain structure, and thermal mapping reveals surface temperature rises of ~20 K at most, levels that are unlikely to negatively affect device performance. This is due to the moderate electrical conductivity of domain walls, their voltage-tunable erasure, and distributed current pathways, which inherently limit power dissipation and peak temperatures. Finite element electrothermal modelling indicates that domain walls behave as pseudo-planar heat sources, distinct from the filament-based heating typically observed in resistive switching oxides. These findings highlight the potential for domain wall devices as an energy-efficient, thermally stable platform for emerging memory and logic applications.</description>

Abstract: A quantum electrodynamical time-dependent density functional theory framework is applied to describe strongly coupled light--matter interactions in cavity environments. The formalism utilizes a tensor product approach, coupling real-space electronic wave functions with Fock space photonic states. Various molecular systems serve as test cases to examine how coupling parameters and cavity frequencies affect molecular geometry, polaritonic spectra, and intermolecular binding.</description>
