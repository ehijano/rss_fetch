      <title>Evolutionary dynamics of pairwise and group cooperation in heterogeneous social networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how cooperation evolves in structured populations remains a fundamental question across diverse disciplines. The problem of cooperation typically involves pairwise or group interactions among individuals. While prior studies have extensively investigated the role of networks in shaping cooperative dynamics, the influence of tie or connection strengths between individuals has not been fully understood. Here, we introduce a quenched mean-field based framework for analyzing both pairwise and group dilemmas on any weighted network, providing interpretable conditions required for favoring cooperation. Our theoretical advances further motivate us to find that the degree-inverse weighted social ties -- reinforcing tie strengths between peripheral nodes while weakening those between hubs -- robustly promote cooperation in both pairwise and group dilemmas. Importantly, this configuration enables heterogeneous networks to outperform homogeneous ones in fixation of cooperation, thereby adding to the conventional view that degree heterogeneity inhibits cooperative behavior under the local stochastic strategy update. We further test the generality of degree-inverse weighted social ties in promoting cooperation on 30,000 random networks and 13 empirical networks drawn from real-world systems. Finally, we unveil the underlying mechanism by examining the formation and evolution of cooperative ties under social ties with degree-inverse weights. Our systematic analyses provide new insights into how the network adjustment of tie strengths can effectively steer structured populations toward cooperative outcomes in biological and social systems.</description>

      <title>Evoluindo resili\^encia em rotas de \^onibus: Proposta de um m\'etodo para a maximiza\c{c}\~ao de acessibilidade em cen\'arios de incerteza por meio de algoritmo gen\'etico</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience has raised interest in transport planning as rare phenomena, such as fuel supply crises, have recently shown their potential to destabilize transport systems. However, the proposed methods for planning resilience in transit systems fail to consider the impact that bus frequency has on user accessibility. To address this gap, this paper proposes a bus allocation method aimed at maximizing accessibility in impact scenarios - where some bus routes have their frequency reduced - making use of a genetic algorithm. The method is applied in the city of S\~ao Paulo and the results show that evolving the system foreseeing moderate impacts not only contributes to reducing the negative effects of lower route frequency, but also improves its efficiency in normal conditions, showing the importance of the contribution of this research to the planning of efficient systems.</description>

      <title>A biophysical approach to the design of networks of communication systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the growth dynamics of the protist \textit{Physarum polycephalum}, we use a formalism that describes adaptive incompressible Hagen-Poiseuille flows on channel networks to identify graphs connecting different nodes within Euclidean space. These graphs are either suboptimal or optimal in terms of their length. Occasionally, we obtain graph tree configurations that are topologically equivalent to Steiner trees. This approach is employed to design communication systems, such as railway networks, motorways, or fibre webs. As a proof of concept, we explicitly apply this framework to the Portuguese railway network.</description>

      <title>Chimera games emerging from coevolutionary dynamics with endogenous feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From climate change to financial bubbles and wars, the rapid pace of change in our world clearly shows that the commonly adopted assumption of a static environment in evolutionary game-theoretic models is often unrealistic. In this work, we introduce a coevolutionary game model where the game environment and the strategy dynamics are mutually coupled. In particular, the game played at each time is endogenously defined as a convex combination of two social dilemmas, weighted by the current abundance of the cooperative individuals in the population. Depending on the nature of the underlying social dilemmas, emergent scenarios - denoted as Chimera games - can arise. In such games, the stable cooperation level reached at equilibrium would be unstable under standard evolutionary principles, despite identical game settings. Conversely, under different feedback specifications the opposite behavior can also occur, and the stable evolutionary equilibrium be disrupted. Our results open fundamental theoretical questions regarding the possibility of predicting and driving the dynamics of complex social systems through external policymaking interventions designed solely on local observations of the system's current state.</description>

      <title>The role of preprints in open science: Accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preprints have become increasingly essential in the landscape of open science, facilitating not only the exchange of knowledge within the scientific community but also bridging the gap between science and technology. However, the impact of preprints on technological innovation, given their unreviewed nature, remains unclear. This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive scientometric analysis of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints submitted between 2013 and 2021, measuring and accessing the contribution of preprints in accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology. Our findings reveal a growing trend of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints, with a notable surge in 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Preprints play a critical role in accelerating innovation, not only expedite the dissemination of scientific knowledge into technological innovation but also enhance the visibility of early research results in the patenting process, while journals remain essential for academic rigor and reliability. The substantial number of post-online-publication patent citations highlights the critical role of the open science model-particularly the "open access" effect of preprints-in amplifying the impact of science on technological innovation. This study provides empirical evidence that open science policies encouraging the early sharing of research outputs, such as preprints, contribute to more efficient linkage between science and technology, suggesting an acceleration in the pace of innovation, higher innovation quality, and economic benefits.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Advanced Nuclear Fission Technologies for Future Decarbonized Power Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15491v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced nuclear fission, which encompasses various innovative nuclear reactor designs, could contribute to the decarbonization of the United States electricity sector. However, little is known about how cost-competitive these reactors would be compared to other technologies, or about which aspects of their designs offer the most value to a decarbonized power grid. We employ an electricity system optimization model and a case study of a decarbonized U.S. Eastern Interconnection circa 2050 to generate initial indicators of future economic value for advanced reactors and the sensitivity of future value to various design parameters, the availability of competing technologies, and the underlying policy environment. These results can inform long-term cost targets and guide near-term innovation priorities, investments, and reactor design decisions. We find that advanced reactors should cost \$5.7-\$7.3/W to gain an initial market share (assuming 30 year asset life and 3.5-6.5% real weighted average cost of capital), while those that include thermal storage in their designs can cost up to \$6.0-\$7.7/W (not including cost of storage). Since the marginal value of advanced fission reactors declines as market penetration increases, break-even costs fall 32% at 100 GW of cumulative capacity and 51% at 300 GW. Additionally, policies that provide investment tax credits for nuclear energy create the most favorable environment for advanced nuclear fission. These findings can inform near-term resource allocation decisions by stakeholders, innovators and investors working in the energy technology sector.</description>

      <title>Block-corrected Modularity for Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unknown node attributes in complex networks may introduce community structures that are important to distinguish from those driven by known attributes. We propose a block-corrected modularity that discounts given block structures present in the network to reveal communities masked by them. We show analytically how the proposed modularity finds the community structure driven by an unknown attribute in a simple network model. Further, we observe that the block-corrected modularity finds the underlying community structure on a number of simple synthetic network models while methods using different null models fail. We develop an efficient spectral method as well as two Louvain-inspired fine-tuning algorithms to maximize the proposed modularity and demonstrate their performance on several synthetic network models. Finally, we assess our methodology on various real-world citation networks built using the OpenAlex data by correcting for the temporal citation patterns.</description>

      <title>Assessing Waste Heat Utilization in Power-to-Heat-to-Power Storage Systems for Cost-Effective Building Electrification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully electrifying the building sector requires not only the widespread adoption of photovoltaic (PV) self-consumption and heat pumps, but also the integration of cost-effective energy storage solutions. Hybridizing lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries with power to heat to power storage (PHPS) systems, thermal batteries capable of thermal-to-electric energy conversion, offers a promising and economically viable solution. PHPS systems dispatch combined heat and power by utilizing the low-temperature waste heat generated during the thermal to electric energy conversion process. This study investigates the technoeconomic impacts of waste heat use in PHPS systems integrated with Li-ion batteries and heat pumps to support the decarbonization of the building sector. Two distinct strategies are evaluated: direct use of waste heat to meet heating demands; and the use of waste heat to enhance the heat pump's coefficient of performance. Results show that supplying the waste heat at the demand setpoint temperature is the best solution to integrate PHPS cost-effectively, although enhancing the heat pump's COP with waste heat also yields notable economic gains. Additionally, leveraging waste heat significantly lowers the minimum thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency required for PHPS systems to achieve economic viability. Optimal PHPS designs enable large-scale energy storage and charging capacities, thereby enhancing PV self-consumption rates and reducing the levelized cost of energy. The analysis also reveals that hybridizing PHPS with Li-ion batteries may rise as the optimal solution for moderately priced PHPS systems, with the reduction in levelized cost being more pronounced in solar-dominated regions.</description>

      <title>Duality between controllability and observability for target control and estimation in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Output controllability and functional observability are properties that enable, respectively, the control and estimation of part of the state vector. These notions are of utmost importance in applications to high-dimensional systems, such as large-scale networks, in which only a target subset of variables (nodes) is sought to be controlled or estimated. Although the duality between full-state controllability and observability is well established, the characterization of the duality between their generalized counterparts remains an outstanding problem. Here, we establish both the weak and the strong duality between output controllability and functional observability. Specifically, we show that functional observability of a system implies output controllability of a dual system (weak duality), and that under a certain geometric condition the converse holds (strong duality). As an application of the strong duality, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for target control via static feedback. This allow us to establish a separation principle between the design of target controllers and the design of functional observers in closed-loop systems. These results generalize the classical duality and separation principles in modern control theory.</description>

      <title>On the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus tests for functional observability and output controllability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional observability and output controllability are properties that establish the conditions for the partial estimation and partial control of the system state, respectively. In the special case of full-state observability and controllability, the Popov-Belevitch-Hautus (PBH) tests provide conditions for the properties to hold based on the system eigenspace. Generalizations of the PBH test have been recently proposed for functional observability and output controllability, but thus far have only been proven valid for diagonalizable systems. Here, we rigorously establish the generalized PBH test for functional observability, extending its validity to a broader class of systems using Jordan decomposition. Likewise, we determine the class of systems under which the generalized PBH test is sufficient and necessary for output controllability. These results have immediate implications for observer and controller design, pole assignment, and optimal placement of sensors and drivers.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate is an evolving complex system with dynamic interactions and non-linear feedback mechanisms, shaping environmental and socio-economic outcomes. Crop production is highly sensitive to climatic fluctuations (and many other environmental, social and governance factors). This paper studies the price volatility of agricultural crops as influenced by meteorological variables, which is critical for agricultural planning, sustainable finance and policy-making. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states: Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal/Eggplant). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns from 2012 to 2024. We further explore the cross-correlations between price volatility and the meteorological variables followed by a Granger-causal test to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the volatility. The Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. Finally, to capture spatial dependencies in volatility across districts, we extend the analysis using a Conditional Autoregressive (CAR) model to construct monthly volatility surfaces that reflect both local price risk as well as geographic dependence. We believe, this paper will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, incorporating meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</description>
