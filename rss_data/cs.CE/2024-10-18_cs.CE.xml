      <description>arXiv:2410.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents FinGEITje, the first Dutch financial Large Language Model (LLM) specifically designed and optimized for various financial tasks. Together with the model, we release a specialized Dutch financial instruction tuning dataset with over 140,000 samples, constructed employing an automated translation and data processing method. The open-source data construction method is provided, facilitating the creation of financial instruction datasets in different languages. To evaluate model performance, the study introduces the first Dutch financial evaluation benchmark, along with an automated evaluation method that utilizes an LLM as an independent evaluator, reducing manual intervention in performance evaluation. The experimental results highlight the superior performance of FinGEITje across five critical Dutch and English financial tasks.</description>

      <title>Automated Reasoning in Systems Biology: a Necessity for Precision Medicine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in AI have reinvigorated pursuits to advance the (life) sciences using AI techniques, thereby creating a renewed opportunity to bridge different fields and find synergies. Headlines for AI and the life sciences have been dominated by data-driven techniques, for instance, to solve protein folding with next to no expert knowledge. In contrast to this, we argue for the necessity of a formal representation of expert knowledge - either to develop explicit scientific theories or to compensate for the lack of data. Specifically, we argue that the fields of knowledge representation (KR) and systems biology (SysBio) exhibit important overlaps that have been largely ignored so far. This, in turn, means that relevant scientific questions are ready to be answered using the right domain knowledge (SysBio), encoded in the right way (SysBio/KR), and by combining it with modern automated reasoning tools (KR). Hence, the formal representation of domain knowledge is a natural meeting place for SysBio and KR. On the one hand, we argue that such an interdisciplinary approach will advance the field SysBio by exposing it to industrial-grade reasoning tools and thereby allowing novel scientific questions to be tackled. On the other hand, we see ample opportunities to move the state-of-the-art in KR by tailoring KR methods to the field of SysBio, which comes with challenging problem characteristics, e.g. scale, partial knowledge, noise, or sub-symbolic data. We stipulate that this proposed interdisciplinary research is necessary to attain a prominent long-term goal in the health sciences: precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Development of a New Type of Vortex Bladeless Wind Turbine for Urban Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Innovation and development of renewable energy devices are crucial for reaching a sustainable and environmentally conscious future. This work focuses on the development of a new type of renewable energy devices in the context of Smart Garden at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, which aims to design a bladeless wind turbine for urban areas, addressing the pressing need for clean energy locally and globally. Traditional wind turbines have been widely adopted in recent decades, while bladeless wind turbines have also displayed their advantages and uniqueness in urban areas. A Vortex Bladeless Wind Turbine (VBWT) is modeled by using Fusion 360 to optimize wind energy generation in urban settings with limited space and buildings-dominated landscape. Optimal parameters of the VBWT were obtained by comparing the results of drag force, lift force and deflection, via the simulations in Ansys. Hardware of proposed bladeless wind turbine has been assembled and developed by 3-dimensional printing. Additional tests and adjustments on hardware further improve the performance of the developed wind turbine. The outcomes of this work have the potential to contribute to future renewable energy initiatives and devote the sustainability efforts in urban energy systems.</description>

      <title>Multimodal growth and development assessment model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of social economy and the improvement of people's attention to health, the growth and development of children and adolescents has become an important indicator to measure the level of national health. Therefore, accurate and timely assessment of children's growth and development has become increasingly important. At the same time, global health inequalities, especially child malnutrition and stunting in developing countries, urgently require effective assessment tools to monitor and intervene. In recent years, the rapid development of technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing, and the cross-integration of multiple disciplines such as biomedicine, statistics, and computer science have promoted the rapid development of large-scale models for growth and development assessment. However, there are still problems such as too single evaluation factors, inaccurate diagnostic results, and inability to give accurate and reasonable recommendations. The multi-modal growth and development assessment model uses the public data set of RSNA ( North American College of Radiology ) as the training set, and the data set of the Department of Pediatrics of Huaibei People's Hospital as the open source test set. The embedded ICL module enables the model to quickly adapt and identify the tasks that need to be done to ensure that under the premise of considering multiple evaluation factors, accurate diagnosis results and reasonable medical recommendations are given, so as to provide solutions to the above problems and promote the development of the medical field.</description>

      <title>DPFedBank: Crafting a Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework for Financial Institutions with Policy Pillars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the financial sector has faced growing pressure to adopt advanced machine learning models to derive valuable insights while preserving data privacy. However, the highly sensitive nature of financial data presents significant challenges to sharing and collaboration. This paper presents DPFedBank, an innovative framework enabling financial institutions to collaboratively develop machine learning models while ensuring robust data privacy through Local Differential Privacy (LDP) mechanisms. DPFedBank is designed to address the unique privacy and security challenges associated with financial data, allowing institutions to share insights without exposing sensitive information. By leveraging LDP, the framework ensures that data remains confidential even during collaborative processes, providing a crucial solution for privacy-aware machine learning in finance. We conducted an in-depth evaluation of the potential vulnerabilities within this framework and developed a comprehensive set of policies aimed at mitigating these risks. The proposed policies effectively address threats posed by malicious clients, compromised servers, inherent weaknesses in existing Differential Privacy-Federated Learning (DP-FL) frameworks, and sophisticated external adversaries. Unlike existing DP-FL approaches, DPFedBank introduces a novel combination of adaptive LDP mechanisms and advanced cryptographic techniques specifically tailored for financial data, which significantly enhances privacy while maintaining model utility. Key security enhancements include the implementation of advanced authentication protocols, encryption techniques for secure data exchange, and continuous monitoring systems to detect and respond to malicious activities in real-time.</description>

      <title>modOpt: A modular development environment and library for optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in computing hardware and modeling software have given rise to new applications for numerical optimization. These new applications occasionally uncover bottlenecks in existing optimization algorithms and necessitate further specialization of the algorithms. However, such specialization requires expert knowledge of the underlying mathematical theory and the software implementation of existing algorithms. To address this challenge, we present modOpt, an open-source software framework that facilitates the construction of optimization algorithms from modules. The modular environment provided by modOpt enables developers to tailor an existing algorithm for a new application by only altering the relevant modules. modOpt is designed as a platform to support students and beginner developers in quickly learning and developing their own algorithms. With that aim, the entirety of the framework is written in Python, and it is well-documented, well-tested, and hosted open-source on GitHub. Several additional features are embedded into the framework to assist both beginner and advanced developers. In addition to providing stock modules, the framework also includes fully transparent implementations of pedagogical optimization algorithms in Python. To facilitate testing and benchmarking of new algorithms, the framework features built-in visualization and recording capabilities, interfaces to modeling frameworks such as OpenMDAO and CSDL, interfaces to general-purpose optimization algorithms such as SNOPT and SLSQP, an interface to the CUTEst test problem set, etc. In this paper, we present the underlying software architecture of modOpt, review its various features, discuss several educational and performance-oriented algorithms within modOpt, and present numerical studies illustrating its unique benefits.</description>

      <title>Differential Shape Optimization with Image Representation for Photonic Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for differentiating shapes represented in binary images with respect to their parameters. This framework functions as an automatic differentiation tool for shape parameters, generating both binary density maps for optical simulations and computing gradients when the simulation provides a gradient of the density map. Our algorithm enables robust gradient computation that is insensitive to the image's pixel resolution and is compatible with all density-based simulation methods. We demonstrate the accuracy, effectiveness, and generalizability of our differential shape algorithm using photonic designs with different shape parametrizations across several differentiable optical solvers. We also demonstrate a substantial reduction in optimization time using our gradient-based shape optimization framework compared to traditional black-box optimization methods.</description>

      <title>Future of Algorithmic Organization: Large-Scale Analysis of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) resemble early online communities, particularly those centered around open-source projects, and present a potential empirical framework for complex social-computing systems by encoding governance rules within "smart contracts" on the blockchain. A key function of a DAO is collective decision-making, typically carried out through a series of proposals where members vote on organizational events using governance tokens, signifying relative influence within the DAO. In just a few years, the deployment of DAOs surged with a total treasury of $24.5 billion and 11.1M governance token holders collectively managing decisions across over 13,000 DAOs as of 2024. In this study, we examine the operational dynamics of 100 DAOs, like pleasrdao, lexdao, lootdao, optimism collective, uniswap, etc. With large-scale empirical analysis of a diverse set of DAO categories and smart contracts and by leveraging on-chain (e.g., voting results) and off-chain data, we examine factors such as voting power, participation, and DAO characteristics dictating the level of decentralization, thus, the efficiency of management structures. As such, our study highlights that increased grassroots participation correlates with higher decentralization in a DAO, and lower variance in voting power within a DAO correlates with a higher level of decentralization, as consistently measured by Gini metrics. These insights closely align with key topics in political science, such as the allocation of power in decision-making and the effects of various governance models. We conclude by discussing the implications for researchers, and practitioners, emphasizing how these factors can inform the design of democratic governance systems in emerging applications that require active engagement from stakeholders in decision-making.</description>

      <title>AgileRate: Bringing Adaptivity and Robustness to DeFi Lending Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) has revolutionized lending by replacing intermediaries with algorithm-driven liquidity pools. However, existing platforms like Aave and Compound rely on static interest rate curves and collateral requirements that struggle to adapt to rapid market changes, leading to inefficiencies in utilization and increased risks of liquidations. In this work, we propose a dynamic model of the lending market based on evolving demand and supply curves, alongside an adaptive interest rate controller that responds in real-time to shifting market conditions. Using a Recursive Least Squares algorithm, our controller estimates tracks the external market and achieves stable utilization, while also minimizing risk. We provide theoretical guarantees on the interest rate convergence and utilization stability of our algorithm. We establish bounds on the system's vulnerability to adversarial manipulation compared to static curves, while quantifying the trade-off between adaptivity and adversarial robustness. Our dynamic curve demand/supply model demonstrates a low best-fit error on Aave data, while our interest rate controller significantly outperforms static curve protocols in maintaining optimal utilization and minimizing liquidations.</description>

      <title>Automated Model Discovery for Tensional Homeostasis: Constitutive Machine Learning in Growth and Remodeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft biological tissues exhibit a tendency to maintain a preferred state of tensile stress, known as tensional homeostasis, which is restored even after external mechanical stimuli. This macroscopic behavior can be described using the theory of kinematic growth, where the deformation gradient is multiplicatively decomposed into an elastic part and a part related to growth and remodeling. Recently, the concept of homeostatic surfaces was introduced to define the state of homeostasis and the evolution equations for inelastic deformations.
  However, identifying the optimal model and material parameters to accurately capture the macroscopic behavior of inelastic materials can only be accomplished with significant expertise, is often time-consuming, and prone to error, regardless of the specific inelastic phenomenon. To address this challenge, built-in physics machine learning algorithms offer significant potential.
  In this work, we extend our inelastic Constitutive Artificial Neural Networks (iCANNs) by incorporating kinematic growth and homeostatic surfaces to discover the scalar model equations, namely the Helmholtz free energy and the pseudo potential. The latter describes the state of homeostasis in a smeared sense. We evaluate the ability of the proposed network to learn from experimentally obtained tissue equivalent data at the material point level, assess its predictive accuracy beyond the training regime, and discuss its current limitations when applied at the structural level.
  Our source code, data, examples, and an implementation of the corresponding material subroutine are made accessible to the public at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13946282.</description>

      <title>An Exposition of Pathfinding Strategies Within Lightning Network Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lightning Network is a peer-to-peer network designed to address Bitcoin's scalability challenges, facilitating rapid, cost-effective, and instantaneous transactions through bidirectional, blockchain-backed payment channels among network peers. Due to a source-based routing of payments, different pathfinding strategies are used in practice, trading off different objectives for each other such as payment reliability and routing fees. This paper explores differences within pathfinding strategies used by prominent Lightning Network node implementations, which include different underlying cost functions and different constraints, as well as different greedy algorithms of shortest path-type. Surprisingly, we observe that the pathfinding problems that most LN node implementations attempt to solve are NP-complete, and cannot be guaranteed to be optimally solved by the variants of Dijkstra's algorithm currently deployed in production. Through comparative analysis and simulations, we evaluate efficacy of different pathfinding strategies across metrics such as success rate, fees, path length, and timelock. Our experiments indicate that the strategies used by LND tend to be advantageous in terms of payment reliability, Eclair tends to result in paths with low fees, and that LDK exhibits average reliability with larger fee levels for smaller payment amounts; furthermore, CLN stands out for its minimal timelock paths. Additionally, we investigate the impact of Lightning node connectivity levels on routing efficiency. The findings of our analysis provide insights towards future improvements of pathfinding strategies and algorithms used within the Lightning Network.</description>

      <title>FairMindSim: Alignment of Behavior, Emotion, and Belief in Humans and LLM Agents Amid Ethical Dilemmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI alignment is a pivotal issue concerning AI control and safety. It should consider not only value-neutral human preferences but also moral and ethical considerations. In this study, we introduced FairMindSim, which simulates the moral dilemma through a series of unfair scenarios. We used LLM agents to simulate human behavior, ensuring alignment across various stages. To explore the various socioeconomic motivations, which we refer to as beliefs, that drive both humans and LLM agents as bystanders to intervene in unjust situations involving others, and how these beliefs interact to influence individual behavior, we incorporated knowledge from relevant sociological fields and proposed the Belief-Reward Alignment Behavior Evolution Model (BREM) based on the recursive reward model (RRM). Our findings indicate that, behaviorally, GPT-4o exhibits a stronger sense of social justice, while humans display a richer range of emotions. Additionally, we discussed the potential impact of emotions on behavior. This study provides a theoretical foundation for applications in aligning LLMs with altruistic values.</description>
