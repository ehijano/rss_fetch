      <title>Probing General Relativity on Cosmological Scales in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General relativity is exquisitely tested in strong-field regimes, yet its validity on cosmological scales remains largely unexplored. Upcoming wide and deep large-scale structure surveys will access the ultra-large, linear scales where relativistic effects - Doppler terms, gravitational redshift, lensing magnification, and potential evolution - leave significant imprints in the clustering of galaxies. These signatures represent unique probes of spacetime that are inaccessible to standard Newtonian analyses but increasingly important as survey volumes grow. We outline the scientific potential of next-generation facilities, such as those envisioned within ESO's Expanding Horizons programme, to deliver the first robust measurements of relativistic effects in large-scale structure through multi-tracer power spectra and the single-tracer bispectrum of high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. Detecting these contributions would open a new window on gravity, enabling precision tests of general relativity and its alternatives on cosmological scales in the 2040s.</description>

      <title>Kinematic lensing with high-resolution spectroscopic surveys. A unique opportunity for transformative cosmology at high redshifts in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a science case to perform high-redshift cosmic shear surveys for cosmology with next-generation spectroscopic instruments, such as the proposed MegaMapper and Wide-field Spectroscopic Telescope. We argue that by using the novel technique called 'kinematic lensing' (KL) it will be possible to obtain shear catalogues at redshifts between 2 and 5. We show that the signal-to-noise ratio of KL at such high redshifts is on average twice as much that expected from current weak lensing (WL) surveys such as Euclid or LSST, and several times that of the previous generation of WL surveys like DES and KiDS, even with very conservative assumptions about the fraction of spectroscopically-detected sources for which KL shear estimates will be available. This will allow cosmologists to perform joint galaxy clustering-cosmic shear analyses over unprecedented cosmic volumes and to probe the growth of structures deep in the matter-dominated era and across the onset of dark-energy domination, offering a unique opportunity to unveil the mystery of cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Empirical study of the Pantheon SNeIa Catalog within power-law cosmology and varying speed of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the kinematics of late-time acceleration within Dolgov's power-law cosmology $a=\left(t/t_{0}\right)^{\mu}$ [Phys. Rev. D 55, 5881 (1997)] and Barrow's varying speed of light $c=c_{0}\,a^{-\zeta}$ [Phys. Rev. D 59, 043515 (1999)]. In this cosmology, light traveling through an expanding universe undergoes an additional refraction caused by the varying $c$ along its path, resulting in a modified Lemaitre redshift formula $1+z=a^{-(1+\zeta)}$. The model achieves a high-quality fit to the Pantheon Catalog of Type Ia supernovae and exhibits a notable degeneracy along the locus $(1+\zeta)\,\mu=1$. This empirical relation indicates that $c=\mu^{-1}c_{0}\,t_{0}\,\frac{da}{dt}$, a characteristic that is not present in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We will discuss the implications of these findings in the context of (i) late-time acceleration; (ii) the horizon problem; (iii) Kolb's coasting universe model [Astrophys. J. 344, 543 (1989)]; (iv) a generalization of the cosmological principle to the time domain; and (v) the emergence of a novel conformally flat metric applicable to cosmology.</description>

      <title>A microphysically inspired approach to dark matter-dark energy interactions: first bounds on dark-sector scattering cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observational tension regarding the value of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) has motivated the exploration of alternative cosmological scenarios, including Interacting Dark Energy models. However, the majority of IDE models studied in the literature rely on phenomenological interaction terms proportional to the Hubble parameter (e.g., $Q\propto H\rho$), which lack a clear microphysical justification and often suffer from large-scale instabilities. In this work, we propose and investigate a "bottom-up" IDE model where the interaction is formulated directly from particle physics collision processes, taking the form $Q\propto\rho^2$. This interaction represents a reversible annihilation/creation process between Dark Matter and Dark Energy, motivated by the Boltzmann equation. We test this model against a combination of background cosmological data, Pantheon Plus, Cosmic Chronometers, DESI DR2, and CMB distance priors from Planck18. We find that the model is consistent with the data, yielding a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.71\pm0.65$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ for the combined analysis. The dimensionless interaction rate coefficients are constrained to be small, with upper limits of $A &lt; 7.586\times10^{-25}$ (for Dark Matter self annihilation) and $B &lt; 0.048$ (for Dark Energy self annihilation) at 95\% confidence level. Since the interaction model is parameterized by the expansion rate, these bounds on $H_0$, $A$, and $B$ directly translate into a strict limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section per unit of mass. The constraints on the coupling $A$ imply that, if such a collisional interaction exists, the effective dark-matter annihilation cross section per unit mass is highly suppressed relative to the cosmological expansion rate. In contrast, the corresponding dark-energy contribution, governed by $B$, is only constrained at the level of a few percent in dimensionless units.</description>

      <title>Marked statistics across the cosmic web: Environmental dependent clustering in modified gravity simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study environment-dependent clustering using the marked correlation function applied to Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ modified gravity simulations. This gravity theory enriches the structure formation by enhancing gravity in a scale-dependent form. By employing a multi-scale cosmic structure finder algorithm, we define the cosmic environments divided in: nodes, filaments, walls and voids. We find a stronger impact of modified gravity in nodes and filament, which together dominate the information content by more than a factor of four relative to other environments. Combining environmental information further enhances the expected signal-to-noise ratio for CMASS- and DESI-like mock samples, particularly in configurations including filaments. Overall, marked correlation functions that incorporate environmental structure increase the information content by about a factor of two compared to standard density-based marks applied to the full galaxy sample. These results demonstrate the importance of environmental information, especially from filaments, in improving the constraining power of galaxy clustering tests of modified gravity.</description>

      <title>The Linear Point Standard Ruler with DESI DR1 and DR2 Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear point, a purely geometric feature in the monopole of the two-point correlation function, has been proposed as an alternative standard ruler. Compared to the peak in the correlation function, it is more robust to late-time nonlinear effects at the percent level. In light of improved simulations and high quality data, we revisit the robustness of the linear point and use it as an alternative to template-based fitting approaches typically used in BAO analyses. We present the linear point measurements on galaxy samples from the first and second data releases (DR1 and DR2) of the DESI survey. We convert the linear point into a dimensionless parameter $\alpha_{iso,LP}$, defined as the ratio of the linear point in the fiducial cosmology and the observed value, analogous to the isotropic BAO scaling parameter $\alpha_{iso}$ used in previous BAO measurements. Using the 2nd generation of AbacusSummit mock catalogs, we find that linear point measurements are more precise when calculated in the post-reconstruction regime with 15-60% smaller uncertainties than those pre-reconstruction. We find a systematic shift in the linear point measurements compared against the isotropic BAO measurements in mocks; we attribute this to the isotropic damping parameter responsible for smearing the linear point in the nonlinear regime. We propose a sample-dependent correction that mitigates the impact of late-time nonlinear effects. While this introduces a cosmology dependence in an otherwise model-independent measurement, this is necessary given the sub-percent precision dictated by current cosmological surveys. Comparing $\alpha_{iso,LP}$ with isotropic BAO measurements made on the DESI DR1 and DR2 galaxy samples, we find excellent agreement after applying this correction, particularly post-reconstruction. We discuss future scope regarding cosmological inference with linear point measurements.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Expansion and Early Universe with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the next two decades, gravitational-wave (GW) observations are expected to evolve from a discovery-driven endeavour into a precision tool for astrophysics, cosmology, and fundamental physics. Current second-generation ground-based detectors have established the existence of compact-binary mergers and enabled GW multi-messenger astronomy, but they remain limited in sensitivity, redshift reach, frequency coverage, and duty cycle. These limitations prevent them from addressing many fundamental open questions in cosmology. By the 2040s, wide-field electromagnetic surveys will have mapped the luminous Universe with unprecedented depth and accuracy. Nevertheless, key problems including the nature of dark matter, the physical origin of cosmic acceleration, the properties of gravity on cosmological scales, and the physical conditions of the earliest moments after the Big Bang will remain only partially constrained by electromagnetic observations alone. Progress on these fronts requires access to physical processes and epochs that do not emit light. Gravitational waves provide a unique and complementary observational channel: they propagate over cosmological distances largely unaffected by intervening matter, probe extreme astrophysical environments, and respond directly to the geometry of spacetime. In this context, next-generation GW observatories such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will be transformative for European astronomy. Operating at sensitivities and frequencies beyond existing detectors, ET will observe binary black holes and neutron stars out to previously inaccessible redshifts, enable continuous high signal-to-noise monitoring of compact sources, and detect gravitational-wave backgrounds of astrophysical and cosmological origin. Together with space-based detectors, ET will play a central role in advancing our understanding of cosmic evolution and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Weak lensing of bright standard sirens: prospects for $\sigma_8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave events with electromagnetic counterparts provide direct measurements of the Hubble diagram. We demonstrate that incorporating weak lensing into bright standard siren analyses allows measurements of cosmological parameters that do not influence the mean luminosity distance-redshift relation but do impact the cosmic structures. In particular, we examine the prospects for measuring the standard deviation of matter perturbations $\sigma_8$, in addition to the Hubble constant and the matter abundance. We find that a $10\%$ measurement of $\sigma_8$ would be feasible with ET, provided a population of $300$ neutron star binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed. With LISA, the measurement of $\sigma_8$ would have $30\%$ accuracy, assuming a population of $12$ massive black hole binaries with electromagnetic counterparts is observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) may have formed in the early Universe and may account for all or part of the dark matter. In this review, we summarize the current observational constraints on PBHs across the full mass range, highlight potential evidence for their existence, and outline the prospects for future searches, particularly with gravitational-wave observatories. We also discuss different PBH formation scenarios, identify the corresponding mass functions, and present the observational constraints in each case.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating Dark Photon Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mechanism for the generation of gravitationally bound dark photon halos during the matter-dominated era. Coupled to an ultralight axion field through a parity-violating Chern-Simons term, dark photons can be produced by the tachyonic instability of axion coherent oscillation. The dark photons with a net helicity lead to a metric vorticity and can generate chiral substructures. For axion masses in the range $10^{-28} \, \mathrm{eV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-22} \, \mathrm{eV}$, the resulting inhomogeneities collapse to form halos with masses spanning $M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$ to $10^{11} \, M_{\odot}$, with halo sizes ranging from $O(1)$ to $O(10^{6}) \, \mathrm{pc}$. During halo collapse, the induced vorticity could mediate efficient angular-momentum transport, which enables monolithic collapse and provides primordial seeds for the early formation of supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic astrophysical uncertainties in the effective theory of dark matter direct detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of astrophysical uncertainties in direct detection searches can vary significantly across particle dark matter models and detector targets, due to the different velocity and momentum dependencies of the scattering cross section. We address these uncertainties for all operators of the non-relativistic effective field theory of dark matter-nucleon interactions, making use of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) information divergence to measure the deviation of the true dark matter velocity distribution from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form. This approach quantifies how astrophysical uncertainties affect each operator in the effective theory, without assuming any specific functional form for the velocity distribution. While for some operators the uncertainties are smaller than one order of magnitude for entropically-motivated deviations from the Maxwell-Boltzmann form, for other operators these uncertainties can be as large as three orders of magnitude near threshold. Furthermore, we identify the dependence of the scattering rate for various operators of the effective theory with different velocity-weighted moments of the velocity distribution, functionally analogous to the mean, variance, or skewness. This provides new analytic insight into which features of the velocity distribution are most relevant to detect a given particle dark matter model. Our technique is general and could be applied to a broader class of physics problems where a physical observable depends on the statistical moments of an uncertain theoretical distribution.</description>

      <title>Dipole Radiation and Kinetic Mixing from Dark Photon Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-like dark matter composed of spin-1 particles, known as dark photons, is theorized to form clumps called "vector solitons". These solitons are compact astrophysical objects that exhibit coherent oscillations and a high concentration relative to the local dark matter density. A significant portion of dark matter in galactic halos today may consist of these solitons. This study explores how photons can be produced from these vector solitons by the influence of external electromagnetic fields or charge densities, via a dimension-6 dark photon-photon coupling and a kinetic mixing, respectively. We further explore the astrophysical implications of these phenomena, highlighting a novel avenue for dark matter discovery that our research provides.</description>

      <title>Superluminous supernovae: diverse rise times explain diverse spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) are a diverse class of exceptionally bright massive star explosions, which typically exhibit absorption from ionised oxygen in their early spectra. While their photometric properties (luminosity and duration) both span an order of magnitude, population studies suggest that these distributions are continuous. However, spectroscopic samples have shown some indications of distinct sub-types, either through similarity to certain prototype objects, or in terms of their velocity evolution. Here we show that a well-observed SLSN, PTF12dam, completely changes its O II absorption profile as it rises to maximum light, moving from one proposed sub-type to another. This supports an interpretation where spectroscopic diversity is driven by the ejecta temperature at maximum light, rather than fundamental differences in the explosion or progenitor. Motivated by this, we develop a new diagnostic, the Brightness-Timescale-Temperature-Radius diagram, and a simple toy model for the evolution of the photospheric velocity, to show that diversity in the light curve rise time (likely due to differences in ejected mass) naturally explains why SLSNe with broader light curves generally have weaker O II lines, lower photospheric velocities after maximum, and slower changes in photospheric velocity over time. We show that the velocity distribution of the known SLSN population favours a relatively flat ejecta density profile, consistent with a hot bubble inflated by a central engine.</description>

      <title>I can see your halo: Constraining the Milky Way halo DM with FRB population studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) probe the electron column density along the line of sight and hence can be used to probe foreground structures. One such structure is the Galactic halo. In this work, we use a total of 98 high Galactic latitude ($|b| &gt; 20^\circ$) FRBs detected by ASKAP, Parkes, DSA and FAST with 32 associated redshifts to constrain the dispersion measure (DM) contribution from the Galactic halo. We simultaneously fit unknown FRB population parameters, which show correlations with the Galactic halo but are not completely degenerate. We primarily use an isotropic model for the halo, but find no evidence favouring a particular halo model. We find DM$_{\rm MW,halo}$=$68^{+27}_{-24}$pc/cm$^3$, which is in agreement with other results within the literature. Previous constraints on DM$_{\rm MW,halo}$ with FRBs have used a few, low-DM FRBs. However, this is highly subject to fluctuations between different lines of sight, and hence using a larger number of sightlines as we do is more likely to be representative of the true average contribution. Nevertheless, we show that individual FRBs can still skew the data significantly and hence will be important in the future for more precise results.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Gravitational Wave Predictions: Gauge-Invariant Nucleation in the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum decay in the early Universe should be gauge-invariant. In this work, we study the gauge dependence of the vacuum decay occurring through a first-order phase transition and the associated gravitational wave production. We investigate the gauge dependence of the bubble nucleation and phase transition parameters within the framework of the Standard model effective field theory in three dimension. By considering the power-counting and utilizing the Nielsen identity at finite temperature, we show that, depending on the power-counting scheme favored by the new physics scale, the perturbative computation methodology allow we get the gauge-independent nucleation rates and phase transition, this enables more accurate predictions of gravitational wave signatures.</description>

      <title>GlueNN: gluing patchwise analytic solutions with neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many problems in physics and engineering, one encounters complicated differential equations with strongly scale-dependent terms for which exact analytical or numerical solutions are not available. A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.</description>

      <title>Naturally small Dirac neutrino mass and $B-L$ dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the conventional gauged ${B-L}$ extension of the standard model, the $B-L$ charge of the singlet scalar $\chi$, responsible for the breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry, is taken to be 2 such that it can anchor type-I seesaw by giving Majorana masses to the right-handed neutrinos, $\nu_R$. In this paper, we consider instead the cases $\chi \sim 3$ or 4 under $B-L$, so that $\nu_R$ may not acquire any Majorana mass and neutrinos are Dirac fermions. We then consider a vector-like fermion $S$ with 2 units of $B-L$ charge, which becomes a good candidate for dark matter, either Dirac for $\chi \sim 3$ or Majorana for $\chi \sim 4$. In both cases, spontaneous $B-L$ breaking can induce a strong first-order phase transition, producing stochastic gravitational waves (GW) which can be tested at GW experiments. Moreover, the presence of light $\nu_R$s gives rise to an additional contribution to the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta{N}_{\rm eff}$, providing complementary constraints from current and upcoming CMB observations.</description>

      <title>Mimetic Dark Matter from Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of mimetic dark matter to the Gauss-Bonnet topological term in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We demonstrate that such interactions can naturally give rise to mimetic dark matter during the inflationary stage of the universe's evolution. By choosing an appropriate coupling between the mimetic field and the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that at the end of inflation, the correct amount of dust-like dark matter is produced, with its energy density expressible in terms of the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation. Furthermore, depending on the form of the coupling, the post matter-radiation equality behavior of mimetic dark matter can experience slight modifications.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Ionization by Schwarzschild Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are theorized to form from the collapse of overdensities in the very early Universe. PBHs in the asteroid-mass range $10^{17} \, {\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$ could serve as all or most of the dark matter today, but are particularly difficult to detect due to their modest rates of Hawking emission and sub-micron Schwarzschild radii. We consider whether the steep gradients of a PBH's gravitational field could generate tidal forces strong enough to disrupt atoms and nuclei. Such phenomena may yield new observables that could uniquely distinguish a PBH from a macroscopic object of the same mass. We first consider the gravitational ionization of ambient neutral hydrogen and evaluate prospects for detecting photon radiation from the recombination of ionized atoms. During the present epoch, this effect would be swamped by Hawking radiation -- which would itself be difficult to detect for PBHs at the upper end of the asteroid-mass window. We then consider the gravitational ionization and heating of neutral hydrogen immediately following recombination at $z\simeq1090$, and identify a broad class of PBH distributions with typical mass $5\times10^{21}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{23}\, {\rm g}$ within which gravitational interactions would have been the dominant form of energy deposition to the medium. We also identify conditions under which tidal forces from a transiting PBH could overcome the strong nuclear force, either by dissociating deuterons, which would be relevant during big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), or by inducing fission of heavy nuclei. We find that gravitational dissociation of deuterons dominates photodissociation rates due to Hawking radiation for PBHs with masses $10^{14}\,{\rm g}\lesssim M \lesssim 10^{16}\,{\rm g}$. We additionally identify the phenomenon of gravitationally induced fission of heavy nuclei via tidal deformation.</description>

      <title>Simulations of collision and sloshing in the galaxy group NGC 5098/5096</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of galaxy groups is essential to understanding the evolutionary history of large-scale structures in the Universe. These dense environments have a significant impact on galaxy evolution, influencing their gas content, morphology, and star formation activity. In this work we analyse in detail the system NGC~5098$/$5096 composed of two galaxy groups. We performed hydrodynamical $N$-body simulations of a galaxy group collision aimed at reproducing the gas sloshing and surface brightness distribution observed in X-ray data. We conducted a detailed X-ray analysis and generated mock image \textit{Chandra} observations from our simulations. The resulting corrected mock image surface brightness profiles show good agreement with the observed data. The relative line-of-sight velocity between NGC~5098 and NGC~5096 is $v_{\mathrm{los}} = 700$ km s$^{-1}$, with a projected separation of $d_{\mathrm{proj}} = 155$ kpc, suggesting that the collision occurs nearly in the line-of-sight. Our simulations were performed with an inclination angle of $80^\circ$ in order to reproduce the dynamical constraints. We also find a correlation between the dark matter and intragroup light distributions when comparing the residual dark matter map with the intragroup light morphology. Our best-fitting model is consistent with these observational constraints and provides a plausible dynamical scenario for the current state of the NGC~5098 group interaction with NGC 5096.</description>

Abstract: We present a joint analysis of the power spectra of the Planck Compton $y$-parameter map and the projected galaxy density field using the Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) all-sky survey. We detect the statistical correlation between WISE and Planck data (g$y$) with a significance of $21.8\,\sigma$. We also measure the auto-correlation spectrum for the tSZ ($yy$) and the galaxy density field maps (gg) with a significance of $150\,\sigma$ and $88\,\sigma$, respectively. We then construct a halo model and use the measured correlations $C^{\rm gg}_{\ell}$, $C^{yy}_{\ell}$ and $C^{{\rm g}y}_{\ell}$ to constrain the tSZ mass bias $B\equiv M_{500}/M^{\rm tSZ}_{500}$. We also fit for the galaxy bias, which is included with explicit redshift and multipole dependencies as $b_{\rm g}(z,\ell)=b_{\rm g}^0(1+z)^{\alpha}(\ell/\ell_0)^{\beta}$, with $\ell_0=117$. We obtain the constraints to be $B =1.50{\pm 0.07}\,(\textrm{stat}) \pm{0.34}\,(\textrm{sys})$, i.e. $1-b_{\rm H}=0.67\pm 0.03\,({\rm stat})\pm 0.16\,({\rm sys})$ (68\% confidence level) for the hydrostatic mass bias, and $b_{\rm g}^0=1.28^{+0.03}_{-0.04}\,(\textrm{stat}) \pm{0.11}\,(\textrm{sys})$, with $\alpha=0.20^{+0.11}_{-0.07}\,(\textrm{stat}) \pm{0.10}\,(\textrm{sys})$ and $\beta=0.45{\pm 0.01}\,(\textrm{stat}) \pm{0.02}\,(\textrm{sys})$ for the galaxy bias. Incoming data sets from future CMB and galaxy surveys (e.g. Rubin Observatory) will allow probing the large-scale gas distribution in more detail.</description>

      <title>A solution to the S8 tension through neutrino-dark matter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark matter (DM) are two of the least understood components of the Universe, yet both play crucial roles in cosmic evolution. Clues about their fundamental properties may emerge from discrepancies in cosmological measurements across different epochs of cosmic history. Possible interactions between them could leave distinctive imprints on cosmological observables, offering a rare window into dark sector physics beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework. We present compelling evidence that DM-neutrino interactions can resolve the persistent structure growth parameter discrepancy, $S_8 = \sigma_8\,\sqrt{\Omega_m/0.3}$, between early and late universe observations. By incorporating cosmic shear measurements from current Weak Lensing surveys, we demonstrate that an interaction strength of $u \sim 10^{-4}$ not only provides a coherent explanation for the high-multipole observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (\texttt{ACT}), but also alleviates the $S_8$ discrepancy. Combining early universe constraints with \texttt{DES Y3 cosmic shear} data yields a nearly $3\sigma$ preference for non-zero DM neutrino interactions. This strengthens previous observational claims and provides a clear path toward a significant breakthrough in cosmological research. Our findings challenge the standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm and highlight the potential of future large-scale structure surveys, which can rigorously test this interaction and unveil the fundamental properties of DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new pipeline designed for the robust inference of cosmological parameters using both second- and third-order shear statistics. We build a theoretical model for rapid evaluation of three-point correlations using our fastnc code and integrate it into the CosmoSIS framework. We measure the two-point functions $\xi_{\pm}$ and the full configuration-dependent three-point shear correlation functions across all auto- and cross-redshift bins. We compress the three-point functions into the mass aperture statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ for a set of 796 simulated shear maps designed to model the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Year 3 data. We estimate from it the full covariance matrix and model the effects of intrinsic alignments, shear calibration biases and photometric redshift uncertainties. We apply scale cuts to minimize the contamination from the baryonic signal as modeled through hydrodynamical simulations. We find a significant improvement of $83\%$ on the Figure of Merit in the $\Omega_{\rm m}$-$S_8$ plane when we add the $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ data to the $\xi_{\pm}$ information. We present our findings for all relevant cosmological and systematic uncertainty parameters and discuss the complementarity of third-order and second-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Imaging systematics induced by galaxy sub-sample fluctuation: new systematics at second order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09481v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaging systematics refers to the inhomogeneous distribution of a galaxy sample caused by varying observing conditions and astrophysical foregrounds. Current mitigation methods correct the galaxy density fluctuations caused by imaging systematics assuming that all galaxies in a sample have the same galaxy density fluctuations. Under this assumption, the corrected sample cannot perfectly recover the true correlation function. We name this effect sub-sample systematics. For a galaxy sample, even if its overall sample statistics (redshift distribution n(z), galaxy bias b(z)), are accurately measured, n(z), b(z) can still vary across the observed footprint. It makes the correlation function amplitude of galaxy clustering higher, while correlation functions for galaxy-galaxy lensing and cosmic shear do not have noticeable change. Such a combination could potentially degenerate with physical signals on small angular scales, such as the amplitude of galaxy clustering, the impact of neutrino mass on the matter power spectrum, etc. Sub-sample systematics cannot be corrected using imaging systematics mitigation approaches that rely on the cross-correlation signal between imaging systematics maps and the observed galaxy density field. In this paper, we derive formulated expressions of sub-sample systematics, demonstrating its fundamental difference with other imaging systematics. We also provide several toy models to visualize this effect. Finally, we discuss a potential method to estimate and mitigate sub-sample systematics by forward modeling its behavior using Synthetic Source Injection.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 Results: Cosmological constraints from second and third-order shear statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of the third-order aperture mass statistic using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) data. We perform a complete tomographic measurement of the three-point correlation function of the Y3 weak lensing shape catalog with the four fiducial source redshift bins. Building upon our companion methodology paper, we apply a pipeline that combines the two-point function $\xi_{\pm}$ with the mass aperture skewness statistic $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$, which is an efficient compression of the full shear three-point function. We use a suite of simulated shear maps to obtain a joint covariance matrix. By jointly analyzing $\xi_\pm$ and $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ measured from DES Y3 data with a $\Lambda$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.780\pm0.015$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.266^{+0.039}_{-0.040}$, yielding 111% of figure-of-merit improvement in $\Omega_m$-$S_8$ plane relative to $\xi_{\pm}$ alone, consistent with expectations from simulated likelihood analyses. With a $w$CDM model, we find $S_8=0.749^{+0.027}_{-0.026}$ and $w_0=-1.39\pm 0.31$, which gives an improvement of $22\%$ on the joint $S_8$-$w_0$ constraint. Our results are consistent with $w_0=-1$. Our new constraints are compared to CMB data from the Planck satellite, and we find that with the inclusion of $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ the existing tension between the data sets is at the level of $2.3\sigma$. We show that the third-order statistic enables us to self-calibrate the mean photometric redshift uncertainty parameter of the highest redshift bin with little degradation in the figure of merit. Our results demonstrate the constraining power of higher-order lensing statistics and establish $\langle M_{\rm ap}^3\rangle$ as a practical observable for joint analyses in current and future surveys.</description>

      <title>Protohalos and their connection to halo assembly, shape and structure</title>

Abstract: Protohalos, primordial regions in the initial cosmic density field that evolve into dark matter halos, are crucial for understanding cosmic structure formation. Motivated by the potential to reconstruct protohalo positions and shapes from observed galaxies using a novel approach grounded in optimal transport theory, we revisit the relationship between the structural properties of protohalos and the assembly histories, concentrations, and final morphologies of their associated dark matter halos. To better understand halo assembly, we introduce a new estimator defined by an integral over redshifts and compare its performance to $z_{50}$, the commonly used redshift at which half of the final halo mass is formed. We quantify protohalo structure using the three invariants of the inertia, deformation, and energy shear tensors. Although past research has correlated the first two invariants of the deformation and energy tensors with halo formation, our findings reveal that the third invariant also significantly correlates with halo assembly and final shape.</description>

      <title>Merger-induced disturbance and temporal signatures in galaxy clusters: a combined phase space and photometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a physically interpretable framework to quantify dynamical disturbances in galaxy clusters using projected two-dimensional phase-space information. Based on the TNG-Cluster simulation, we construct a disturbance score that captures merger-driven asymmetries through features such as velocity dispersion and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) peak fitting, which captures asymmetries indicative of dynamical disturbance. All features are derived from observable quantities and are intended to be measurable in future surveys.
  To enable observational application, we adopt a simplified estimator using aperture mass map statistics as a mass ratio proxy in TNG300-1, and validate its performance with weak lensing data from The Local Volume Complete Cluster Survey (LoVoCCS). While phase-space diagnostics reveal merger-driven asymmetries, they are not sensitive to whether the secondary progenitor is infalling or receding, and thus cannot distinguish future mergers from past mergers. To address this, we incorporate the star formation rate (SFR) from TNG-Cluster and propose the blue galaxy fraction as a promising observational tracer of merger timing.
  Finally, we construct mock Chandra X-ray images of TNG-Cluster halos at redshift $z=0.2$, and find that the offset between the X-ray peak and the position of the most massive black hole (used as a proxy for the Brightest Cluster Galaxy, BCG) correlates with our disturbance score, serving as a consistency check. We also perform case studies using LoVoCCS observational data, correlating the blue galaxy fraction with disturbance scores derived from the eROSITA morphology catalog.</description>

      <title>Is Chevallier-Polarski-Linder dark energy a mirage?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) raise doubts about the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, suggesting a preference for an inherently dynamical dark energy component. The Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization -- a widely used two-parameter model for the dark energy equation of state -- displays marked early-time phantom behavior and a recent crossing of the phantom divide. These features suggest the convenience to check observationally the robustness of such evolution. To address this, we design two alternative families of two-parameter dark energy parametrizations which remain close to the original CPL but aim to soften its phantom character. Specifically, these models reproduce CPL-like behavior at low redshift but mitigate early phantom behavior through the use of smooth sigmoid transitions, yielding a more gradual evolution. By combining recent DESI data with constraints from the cosmic microwave background and Type Ia supernovae, we assess the viability of these models. Our analysis shows that CPL remains a strong and competitive parametrization, with the proposed alternatives only marginally favored or disfavored. We conclude that current observational data lack the statistical precision to decisively distinguish between CPL and similarly constructed parametrizations across the redshift range probed by late-time observables.</description>

      <title>The AIDA-TNG project: 3D halo shapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. The shapes of dark matter halos can be used to constrain the fundamental properties of dark matter. In standard Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies, halos are typically triaxial, with a preference for prolate configurations, particularly at low masses and high redshift. Aims. We focus on the characterization of total matter 3D shape in alternative dark matter models, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). These scenarios predict different structural properties due to collisional effects or the suppression of small-scale power. Methods. We measure the different halo component shapes - dark matter, stars and gas - at various radii from the center in the AIDA-TNG (Alternative Interacting Dark Matter and Astrophysics - TNG), which is a suite of high-resolution cosmological simulations built upon the IllustrisTNG framework. The intent is to systematically study how different dark matter models - specifically, SIDM and WDM - affect galaxy formation and the structure of dark matter halos, when realistic baryonic physics is also included. Results. SIDM models tend to produce rounder and more isotropic halos, especially in the inner regions, as a result of momentum exchange between dark matter particles. WDM halos are also slightly more spherical than their CDM counterparts, and are typically less concentrated. In all cases, the inclusion of self-consistent baryonic physics makes the central regions of all halos rounder, while still revealing clear distinctions among the various dark matter models. Conclusions. The general framework presented in this work, based on the 3D halo shape, can be useful to interpret multi-wavelength data analyses of galaxies and clusters.</description>

      <title>A universal bound on the duration of a kination era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that primordial adiabatic curvature fluctuations generate an instability of the scalar field sourcing a kination era. We demonstrate that the generated higher Fourier modes constitute a radiation-like component dominating over the kination background after about $11$ e-folds of cosmic expansion. Current constraints on the extra number of neutrino flavors $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ thus imply the observational bound of approximately 10 e-folds, representing the most stringent bound to date on the stiffness of the equation of state of the pre-Big-Bang-Nucleosynthesis universe.</description>

      <title>New Source for QCD Axion Dark Matter Production: Curvature Induced</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a novel mechanism for generating dark matter from a fast-rolling scalar field, relevant for both inflation and rotating axion models, and apply it specifically to the (QCD) axion. Dark matter comes from scalar field fluctuations generated by the product of the curvature perturbation and the fast-rolling background field. These fluctuations can explain the totality of dark matter in a vast axion parameter space, particularly for the QCD axion, which will be targeted by upcoming experiments. We review the constraints on this mechanism and potential gravitational-wave signatures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Looking at infrared background radiation anisotropies with Spitzer II. Small scale anisotropies and their implications for new and upcoming space surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spitzer-based source-subtracted cosmic infrared background (CIB) fluctuations at arcminute-to-degree scales indicate the presence of new populations, whereas sub-arcminute power arises from known $z\lesssim 6$ galaxies. We reconstruct the evolution of the near-IR CIB anisotropies on sub-arcminute scales by known galaxy populations. This method is based on, and significantly advanced over, the empirical reconstruction by \cite{Helgason2012} which is combined with the halo model connecting galaxies to their host dark matter (DM) halos. The modeled CIB fluctuations from known galaxies produce the majority of the observed small-scale signal down to statistical uncertainties of $&lt; 10\%$ and we constrain the evolution of the halo mass regime hosting such galaxies. Thus the large-scale CIB fluctuations from new populations are produced by sources with negligible small-scale power. This appears to conflict with the presented Intra-halo light (IHL) models, but is accounted for if the new sources are at high $z$. Our analysis spanning several Spitzer datasets allows us to narrow the estimated contributions of remaining known galaxies to the CIB anisotropies to be probed potentially from surveys by new and upcoming space missions such as Euclid, SPHEREx, and Roman. Of these, the Roman surveys have the best prospects for measuring the source-subtracted CIB and probing the nature of the underlying new populations at $\lambda &lt;2\ \mu$m, followed by Euclid's surveys, while for SPHEREx the source-subtracted CIB signal from them appears significantly overwhelmed by the CIB from remaining known galaxies.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>
