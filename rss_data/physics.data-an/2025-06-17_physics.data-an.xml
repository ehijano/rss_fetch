      <title>Inferring Grain Size Distributions from Magnetic Hysteresis in M-type Hexaferrites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a stochastic-dynamic framework to infer latent grain size distribution from magnetic hysteresis data in M-type hexaferrite materials, offering an alternative to imaging-based characterization. A stochastic nucleation-growth process yields a Modified Lognormal Power-law grain size distribution. This is combined with Brown's relation to obtain a coercivity probability distribution, which is embedded within a dynamic magnetization model. A key feature is the joint estimation of microstructural parameters, including the critical grain radius, through inverse optimization of full hysteresis loops. Experimental validation on hydrothermally synthesized strontium hexaferrite subjected to nitrogen treatment and recalcination reveals interpretable trajectories of nucleation, growth, and structural memory encoded in the magnetic response.</description>

      <title>The Best Soules Basis for the Estimation of a Spectral Barycentre Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of this work is a fast algorithm to compute the barycentre of a set of networks based on a Laplacian spectral pseudo-distance. The core engine for the reconstruction of the barycentre is an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases, and returns a basis that yields a sparse approximation of the sample mean adjacency matrix. We prove that when the networks are random realizations of stochastic block models, then our algorithm reconstructs the population mean adjacency matrix. In addition to the theoretical analysis of the estimator of the barycentre network, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator. This work is significant because it opens the door to the design of new spectral-based network synthesis that have theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Stay Positive: Neural Refinement of Sample Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo simulations are an essential tool in particle physics data analysis. Events are typically generated alongside weights that redistribute the cross section of the simulated process across the phase space. These weights can be negative, and several post-hoc methods have been developed to eliminate or mitigate the negative values. All of these methods share the common strategy of approximating the average weight as a function of phase space. We introduce an alternative approach, which, instead of reweighting to the average, refines the initial weights with a scaling transformation, utilizing a phase space-dependent factor. Since this new refinement method does not need to model the full weight distribution, it can be more accurate. High-dimensional and unbinned phase space is processed using neural networks for the refinement method. In addition to the refinement method, we introduce a new resampling protocol, which can be used in conjunction with any weight transformation to not only preserve the average weight but also the statistical uncertainties of the initial distribution. Using both realistic and synthetic examples, we show that the new neural refinement method is able to match or exceed the accuracy of similar weight transformations and that the new resampling protocol is simpler in implementation than previous methods while exhibiting equivalent statistical properties.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</description>
