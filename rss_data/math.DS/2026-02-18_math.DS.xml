      <title>Time-Spectral Resolvent Analysis For Periodic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional resolvent analysis is a powerful framework for identifying the most amplified input-output structures in fluid flows from a stationary base state. Extending this resolvent analysis to periodic base flows poses computational challenges due to quasi-periodic responses and expensive linearization around a time-varying base flow. This work proposes a time-spectral resolvent operator formulated using the time-spectral method and Fourier collocation that operates directly in the time domain. Rather than mapping between truncated Fourier coefficients as in frequency-domain approaches, the proposed operator maps forcing and response envelopes defined on a discrete temporal grid, enabling direct Jacobian evaluation at collocation points without computing Fourier coefficients of the base flow. The time-spectral resolvent achieves spectral convergence and offers simplified implementation that integrates easily with existing scientific computing tools. The time-spectral resolvent method is validated numerically in three examples including the parametrically forced Mathieu oscillator, the autonomous van der Pol oscillator and the complex Ginzburg-Landau partial differential equation to show that the proposed method accurately predicts the maximum energy amplification and optimal response mode when the system is subject to optimal quasi-periodic forcing. The proposed framework provides a foundation for extending resolvent-based analysis and control to high-dimensional periodic dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A golden-ratio partition of information and the balance between prediction and surprise: a neuro-cognitive route to antifragility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive systems must strike a balance between prediction and surprise to thrive in uncertain environments. We propose an information-theoretic balance function, $ f(p) = -(1 - p)\ln(1 - p) + \ln p $, which quantifies the net informational gain from contrasting explained variance $p$ with unexplained novelty $(1 - p)$. This function is strictly concave on $(0,1)$ and reaches its unique maximum at $ p^* \approx 0.882$, revealing a regime where confidence is high but the residual uncertainty carries a disproportionate potential for surprise.
  Independently of this maximum, imposing a self-similarity condition between known, unknown and total information, $p : (1-p) = 1 : p$, leads to the golden-ratio reciprocal $p = 1/\varphi \approx 0.618$, where $ \varphi$ is the golden ratio. We interpret this value not as the maximizer of $f$, but as a structurally privileged \emph{partition} in which known and unknown are proportionally nested across scales.
  Embedding this dual structure into a Compute-Inference-Model-Action (CIMA) loop yields a dynamic process that maintains the system near a critical regime where prediction and surprise coexist. At this edge, neuronal dynamics exhibit power-law structure and maximal dynamic range, while the system's response to perturbations becomes convex at the level of its payoff function-fulfilling the formal definition of antifragility. We suggest that the golden-ratio partition is not merely a mathematical artifact, but a candidate design principle linking prediction, surprise, criticality, and antifragile adaptation across scales and domains, while the maximum of $f$ identifies the point of greatest informational vulnerability to being wrong.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of perturbed elliptical billiard tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical billiards consist of a particle on a two-dimensional table, bouncing elastically off a boundary curve. The state of the system is given by two numbers: one describing the location along the curve where the bounce occurs, and another describing the incoming angle of the bounce. Successive bounces define a two-dimensional area preserving map, and iterating this map gives a dynamical system first studied by Birkhoff. One of the simplest smooth table shapes is that of an ellipse, in which case the dynamics of the billiard map is completely integrable. The longstanding Birkhoff conjecture is that elliptical tables are the only smooth convex table for which complete integrability occurs. In this spirit, we present an implicit real analytic method for iterating billiard maps on perturbed elliptical tables. This method allows us to compute local stable and unstable manifolds of periodic orbits using the parameterization method. Globalizing these local manifolds numerically provides insight into the dynamics of the table.</description>

      <title>Tropical linearization and stability analysis of discrete dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tropical semiring is a semiring of extended real numbers, where the operations of `max' and `+' replace the usual addition and multiplication, respectively. Difference equations obtained from the ultradiscrete limit of discrete dynamical systems are described in terms of the tropical semiring. We propose a tropical linearization approach for the stability analysis of difference equations, including those describing ulradiscrete dynamical systems. We show that the fixed point at the tropical origin is asymptotically stable if the maximum eigenvalue of the tropical Jacobian matrix is negative. On the other hand, it is unstable if the maximum eigenvalue of the tropical Jacobian matrix is positive. Since $0$ is the tropical multiplicative identity, these results are analogous to those in the usual linearization process.</description>

      <title>On the intersections of projected Hamiltonian orbits in cotangent bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generic behavior of Hamiltonian trajectories on a regular level set in the cotangent bundle, after projection to the base. We prove that for a generic submersive level set, projected trajectories have discrete (self-)intersections. Additionally, fixing end-point fibers, we prove that all intersections can be perturbed away if the base has dimension at least three. In particular, this applies to periodic orbits, and both results hold for Reeb flows on fiber-wise star-shaped hypersurfaces, including non-reversible Finsler flows, which answers a question of Rademacher. In the proof we make use of a multi-jet transversality theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\phi_t)$ be an area-preserving smooth flow on a compact, connected, orientable surface $\mathcal M$ with at least one but finitely many fixed points. Assume that $(\phi_t)$ is analytic (up to a canonical change of coordinates) in the neighborhood of each saddle fixed point. We show that the flow $(\phi_t)$ is weakly mixing on each of its (finitely many) quasi-minimal components.</description>

      <title>On the efficiency of pairwise Hamiltonian control to desynchronize the higher-order Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is observed in many natural and engineered systems and emerges due to the interactions within the system. It can be both beneficial, e.g., in power grids, and harmful, e.g., in epileptic seizures. In the latter case, efficient control methods to desynchronize the systems are crucial. Recent studies have shown that interactions are not always pairwise, but higher-order, i.e., many-body, and this greatly affects the dynamics. For instance, higher-order interactions increase the linear stability of synchronized states but simultaneously shrink their attraction basin, with potentially opposite effects on control methods. Here, we use a minimally invasive pairwise control based on Hamiltonian control theory, and investigate its efficiency on phase oscillators with higher-order interactions. We show that, if the initial phases are close to the synchronized state, higher-order interactions make desynchronization more difficult to achieve. Otherwise, a non-monotonic effect appears: intermediate strengths of higher-order interactions impede desynchronization while larger ones facilitate it. In all cases, the control can desynchronize the system with a sufficient number of controlled nodes and intensity.</description>

      <title>Szemer\'edi's Theorem Along Cantor Sets of Integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal C= \{k_1&lt;k_2 &lt; \cdots\}$ be Cantor set of integers, that is a set of integers with restricted digits modulo a base $b$, and suppose $0$ is one of the restricted digits. We show that $$ \liminf_N \Expectation_{n\in [N]} m(A\cap T^{-k_n} A \cap \cdots
  \cap T^{-\ell k_n} A )&gt;0. $$ This is an extension of the IP Ergodic Theorem of Furstenberg and Katznelson, and a partial extension of recent work of Kra and Shalom. In particular, this implies that for any subset of integers $A$ of positive upper Banach density, there is a set $B$ of integers $n$ of positive lower Banach density such that $A$ contains an $\ell+1$ term progression, with step size $k_n$, where $n\in B$. This is a complement to recent results of Kra and Shalom, for IP Sets of integers, and Burgin, concerning Sarkozy's Theorem for Primes with restricted digits.</description>

      <title>A discrete gradient scheme for preserving QSR-dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of dissipative dynamical systems provides a formal description of processes that cannot generate energy internally. For these systems, changes in energy can only occur due to an external energy supply or dissipation effects. Unfortunately, dissipative properties tend to deteriorate in numerical computations, especially in nonlinear systems. Discrete gradient methods can help mitigate this problem. In this paper, we present a class of structure-preserving time discretization schemes based on discrete gradients for a special class of systems that are dissipative with respect to a quadratic supply rate.</description>

      <title>Household size can explain 40% of the variance in cumulative COVID-19 incidence across Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Household size impacts the spread of respiratory infectious diseases: Larger households tend to boost transmission by acquiring external infections more frequently and subsequently transmitting them back into the community. Furthermore, mandatory interventions primarily modulate contagion between households rather than within them. We developed an approach to quantify the role of household size in epidemics by separating within-household from out-household transmission, and found that household size explains 41% of the variability in cumulative COVID-19 incidence across 34 European countries (95% confidence interval: [15%, 46%]). The contribution of households to the overall dynamics can be quantified by a boost factor that increases with the effective household size, implying that countries with larger households require more stringent interventions to achieve the same levels of containment. This suggests that households constitute a structural (dis-)advantage that must be considered when designing and evaluating mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>Controlled oscillation modeling using port-Hamiltonian neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning dynamical systems through purely data-driven methods is challenging as they do not learn the underlying conservation laws that enable them to correctly generalize. Existing port-Hamiltonian neural network methods have recently been successfully applied for modeling mechanical systems. However, even though these methods are designed on power-balance principles, they usually do not consider power-preserving discretizations and often rely on Runge-Kutta numerical methods. In this work, we propose to use a second-order discrete gradient method embedded in the learning of dynamical systems with port-Hamiltonian neural networks. Numerical results are provided for three systems deliberately selected to span different ranges of dynamical behavior under control: a baseline harmonic oscillator with quadratic energy storage; a Duffing oscillator, with a non-quadratic Hamiltonian offering amplitude-dependent effects; and a self-sustained oscillator, which can stabilize in a controlled limit cycle through the incorporation of a nonlinear dissipation. We show how the use of this discrete gradient method outperforms the performance of a Runge-Kutta method of the same order. Experiments are also carried out to compare two theoretically equivalent port-Hamiltonian systems formulations and to analyze the impact of regularizing the Jacobian of port-Hamiltonian neural networks during training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse regression strategy for discovery of ordinary differential equations from incomplete and noisy data. Inference is performed over both equation parameters and state variables using a statistically motivated likelihood function. Sparsity is enforced by a selection algorithm which iteratively removes terms and compares models using statistical information criteria. Large scale optimization is performed using a second-order variant of the Levenberg-Marquardt method, where the gradient and Hessian are computed via automatic differentiation. The proposed method is illustrated and tested on several systems with varying levels of noisy and incomplete data. Comparisons are made to a state-of-the-art algorithm for system identification, demonstrating competitiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The $\beta$-transformation with a hole at $0$: the general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03516v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given $\beta&gt;1$, let $T_\beta$ be the $\beta$-transformation on the unit circle $[0,1)$, defined by $T_\beta(x)=\beta x-\lfloor \beta x\rfloor$. For each $t\in[0,1)$ let $K_\beta(t)$ be the survivor set consisting of all $x\in[0,1)$ whose orbit $\{T^n_\beta(x): n\ge 0\}$ never hits the interval $[0,t)$. Kalle et al.~[{\em Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems} {\bf 40} (2020), no.~9, 2482--2514] considered the case $\beta\in(1,2]$. They studied the set-valued bifurcation set $\mathscr{E}_\beta:=\{t\in[0,1): K_\beta(t')\ne K_\beta(t)~\forall t'&gt;t\}$ and proved that the Hausdorff dimension function $t\mapsto\dim_H K_\beta(t)$ is a non-increasing Devil's staircase. In a previous paper [{\em Ergodic Theory Dynam. Systems} {\bf 43} (2023), no.~6, 1785--1828] we determined, for all $\beta\in(1,2]$, the critical value $\tau(\beta):=\min\{t&gt;0: \eta_\beta(t)=0\}$. The purpose of the present article is to extend these results to all $\beta&gt;1$. In addition to calculating $\tau(\beta)$, we show that (i) the function $\tau: \beta\mapsto\tau(\beta)$ is left continuous on $(1,\infty)$ with right-hand limits everywhere, but has countably infinitely many discontinuities; (ii) $\tau$ has no downward jumps; and (iii) there exists an open set $O\subset(1,\infty)$, whose complement $(1,\infty)\backslash O$ has zero Hausdorff dimension, such that $\tau$ is real-analytic, strictly convex and strictly decreasing on each connected component of $O$. We also prove several topological properties of the bifurcation set $\mathscr{E}_\beta$. The key to extending the results from $\beta\in(1,2]$ to all $\beta&gt;1$ is an appropriate generalization of the Farey words that are used to parametrize the connected components of the set $O$. Some of the original proofs from the above-mentioned papers are simplified.</description>

      <title>Non-Birkhoff periodic orbits in symmetric billiards</title>

Abstract: We study non-Birkhoff periodic orbits in symmetric convex planar billiards. Our main result provides a quantitative criterion for the existence of such orbits with prescribed minimal period, rotation number, and spatiotemporal symmetry. We exploit this criterion to find sufficient conditions for a symmetric billiard to possess infinitely many non-Birkhoff periodic orbits. It follows that arbitrarily small analytical perturbations of the circular billiard have non-Birkhoff periodic orbits of any rational rotation number and with arbitrarily long periods. We also generalize a known result for elliptical billiards to other $\mathbb{D}_2$-symmetric billiards. Lastly, we provide Matlab codes which can be used to numerically compute and visualize the non-Birkhoff periodic orbits whose existence we prove analytically.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on density manifolds from reciprocal relations in hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrodynamics describes the evolution of macroscopic states in non--equilibrium thermodynamics. Following Onsager reciprocal relations, one can formulate a large class of hydrodynamic equations as gradient flows of free energies. In recent years, such Onsager gradient flows have been extensively investigated on optimal transport type metric spaces with nonlinear mobilities, known as hydrodynamical density manifolds. A typical example is the gradient--drift Fokker--Planck equation, which can be characterized as the gradient flow of the free energy in the Wasserstein-2 metric space. This paper studies geometric calculations on general hydrodynamical density manifolds. We first formulate the associated Levi--Civita connections, gradients, Hessians, and parallel transports, and then derive the corresponding Riemannian and sectional curvatures. Finally, we obtain closed-form formulas for sectional curvatures in one dimensional density manifolds, where the signs of the curvatures are determined by the convexity of the mobility functions. As illustrations, we present density manifolds and their sectional curvatures for several zero range models, including independent particle systems, simple exclusion processes, and Kipnis--Marchioro--Presutti models.</description>

      <title>Fractal closures of geodesic planes in Hitchin manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem implies topological rigidity of immersed totally geodesic subspaces of noncompact type in finite-volume locally symmetric spaces. In higher rank and infinite volume, however, counter-examples to this rigidity have remained elusive.
  We construct the first such examples using \emph{floating geodesic planes}. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma &lt; \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that the Hitchin manifold $\Gamma \backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R}) / \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains immersed floating geodesic planes whose closures are fractal, with non-integer Hausdorff dimensions accumulating at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Finte-size induced random switching of chimeras in a deterministic two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The two-population Kuramoto-Sakaguchi model for interacting populations of phase oscillators exhibits chimera states whereby one population is synchronised, and the other is desynchronised. Which of the two populations is synchronised depends on the initial conditions. We show that this deterministic model exhibits random switches of their chimera states, alternating between which of the two populations is synchronised and which is not. We show that these random switches are induced by the finite size of the network. We provide numerical evidence that the switches are governed by a Poisson process and that the time between switches grows exponentially with the system size, rendering switches unobservable for all practical purposes in sufficiently large networks. We develop a reduced stochastic model for the synchronised population, based on a central limit theorem controlling the collective effect of the desynchronised population on the synchronised one, and show that this stochastic model well reproduces the statistical behaviour of the full deterministic model. We further determine critical fluctuation sizes capable of inducing switches and provide estimates for the mean switching times from an associated Kramers problem.</description>

      <title>Chaotic discretization theorems for forced linear and nonlinear coupled oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10565v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODE systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external non-conservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we perform a bifurcation analysis of the system presenting 1D and 2D bifurcation diagrams, together with spectra of Lyapunov exponents and basins of attraction.</description>

      <title>Derivative free data-driven stabilization of continuous-time linear systems from input-output data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a data-driven framework for the design of stabilizing controllers from input-output data in the continuous-time, linear, and time-invariant domain. Rather than relying on measurements or reliable estimates of input and output time derivatives, the proposed approach uses filters to derive a parameterization of the system dynamics. This parameterization is amenable to the application of linear matrix inequalities enabling the design of stabilizing output feedback controllers from input-output data and the knowledge of the order of the system.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Minimizing Diffeomorphisms on a $G_2$-Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.07204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct infinitely many diffeomorphisms of a Joyce manifold $M$ which achieve Yomdin's homological lower bound for topological entropy, imitating a recent construction of Farb-Looijenga for K3 surfaces. Moreover, following a recent paper by Crowley-Goette-Hertl, we show these diffeomorphisms act freely on a connected component of the Teichm\"uller space of $G_2$ structures on $M$, and hence that the homotopy moduli space of $G_2$ structures on $M$ has infinite fundamental group. We also discuss a putative analogy between dynamics on a $G_2$ manifold and that of an algebraic surface, and prove a theorem about its limitations.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multi-Step Model Predictive Control for Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies consensus of discrete-time multi-agent systems under time-varying directed communication, state and input constraints using a distributed multi-step model predictive control (MPC) framework. Consensus is recast as stabilization of the agreement set, and a geometric viewpoint based on convex-hull invariance and strict interiority is adopted. Building on an existing geometric necessary and sufficient condition for agreement, we show that enforcing terminal inclusion in local neighbor convex hulls guarantees hull invariance but does not, in general, imply the strict relative-interior property required for convergence. An explicit counterexample demonstrates that strictness cannot be deduced from feasibility and contraction constraints alone.
  To resolve this issue without shrinking feasible sets or altering primary performance objectives, a lexicographic tie-breaking mechanism is introduced. Among optimal (or near-optimal) MPC solutions, the proposed secondary criterion selects trajectories maximizing an interiority measure with respect to the neighbor hull. It is shown that whenever an interior feasible terminal state exists, this selection rule enforces the strictness condition required for asymptotic consensus. Explicit horizon conditions are derived for single- and double-integrator agents with bounded inputs, ensuring feasibility and automatic existence of interior feasible terminal points. The resulting scheme provides a distributed and implementable route to consensus via finite-step set-Lyapunov contraction. Numerical simulations with distributed inter-process communication illustrate monotone diameter decay and report per-agent computational complexity.</description>
