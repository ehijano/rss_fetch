      <title>Microcontroller-Driven MPPT System for Enhanced Photovoltaic Efficiency: An Experimental Approach in Nepal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energy utilization in places like Nepal, is often obstructed by unpredicted environmental factors and existing technological barriers. The challenges encountered often result in fluctuating energy outputs, hindering the transition to greener energy solutions. To tackle these issues, this study introduces a custom-designed Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) controller, seamlessly incorporated into a microcontroller-based battery charging system. This approach seeks to enhance the efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) systems, aligning with the global shift towards renewables. The research's primary objective is to enhance PV module power yield employing MPPT techniques, thereby reducing dependency on non-renewable energy sources. Key goals include real-time MPP tracking for optimal power extraction from PV modules and the integration of a real-time monitoring mechanism for PV and battery states. Leveraging a coordinated interplay of sensors measuring temperature, voltage, and current, vital metrics are fed to the microcontroller. This, in turn, generates a precise Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal, fine-tuning the voltage regulation of the buck-boost converter Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (MOSFET) for optimal operation. The adopted approach emphasizes monitoring environmental metrics, overseeing power outputs, and generating PWM signals to adeptly manage the buck-boost converter MOSFET voltage. Concurrently, data is transmitted hourly to a cloud platform, facilitating real-time monitoring capabilities showcasing the IoT application. As a result of these integrations, an efficiency improvement of approximately 37.28% was observed. In essence, this research underscores the profound impact of merging advanced technologies within the renewable energy sector, offering a robust blueprint for enhancing energy stability and productivity.</description>

      <title>A Distributed Deep Koopman Learning Algorithm for Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed data-driven framework to address the challenge of dynamics learning from a large amount of training data for optimal control purposes, named distributed deep Koopman learning for control (DDKC). Suppose a system states-inputs trajectory and a multi-agent system (MAS), the key idea of DDKC is to assign each agent in MAS an offline partial trajectory, and each agent approximates the unknown dynamics linearly relying on the deep neural network (DNN) and Koopman operator theory by communicating information with other agents to reach a consensus of the approximated dynamics for all agents in MAS. Simulations on a surface vehicle first show that the proposed method achieves the consensus in terms of the learned dynamics and the learned dynamics from each agent can achieve reasonably small estimation errors over the testing data. Furthermore, simulations in combination with model predictive control (MPC) to drive the surface vehicle for goal-tracking and station-keeping tasks demonstrate the learned dynamics from DDKC are precise enough to be used for the optimal control design.</description>

      <title>Learning k-Inductive Control Barrier Certificates for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics Beyond Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time nonlinear systems beyond polynomials with unknown mathematical models using the notion of k-inductive control barrier certificates (k-CBCs). Conventional CBC conditions (with k=1) for ensuring safety over dynamical systems are often restrictive, as they require the CBCs to be non-increasing at every time step. Inspired by the success of k-induction in software verification, k-CBCs relax this requirement by allowing the barrier function to be non-increasing over k steps, while permitting k-1 (one-step) increases, each up to a threshold epsilon. This relaxation enhances the likelihood of finding feasible k-CBCs while providing safety guarantees across the dynamical systems. Despite showing promise, existing approaches for constructing k-CBCs often rely on precise mathematical knowledge of system dynamics, which is frequently unavailable in practical scenarios. In this work, we address the case where the underlying dynamics are unknown, a common occurrence in real-world applications, and employ the concept of persistency of excitation, grounded in Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma. This result implies that input-output data from a single trajectory can capture the behavior of an unknown system, provided the collected data fulfills a specific rank condition. We employ sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to synthesize the k-CBC as well as the safety controller directly from data while ensuring the safe behavior of the unknown system. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through a set of physical benchmarks with unknown dynamics, including a DC motor, an RLC circuit, a nonlinear nonpolynomial car, and a nonlinear polynomial Lorenz attractor.</description>

      <title>CEEMS: A Resource Manager Agnostic Energy and Emissions Monitoring Stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid acceleration of ML/AI research in the last couple of years, the energy consumption of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) domain has rapidly increased. As a major part of this energy consumption is due to users' workloads, it is evident that users need to be aware of the energy footprint of their applications. Compute Energy and Emissions Monitoring Stack (CEEMS) has been designed to address this issue. CEEMS can report energy consumption and equivalent emissions of user workloads in real time for HPC and cloud platforms alike. Besides CPU energy usage, it supports reporting energy usage of workloads on NVIDIA and AMD GPU accelerators. CEEMS has been built around the prominent open-source tools in the observability eco-system like Prometheus and Grafana. CEEMS has been designed to be extensible and it allows the Data Center (DC) operators to easily define the energy estimation rules of user workloads based on the underlying hardware. This paper explains the architectural overview of CEEMS, data sources that are used to measure energy usage and estimate equivalent emissions and potential use cases of CEEMS from operator and user perspectives. Finally, the paper will conclude by describing how CEEMS deployment on the Jean-Zay supercomputing platform is capable of monitoring more than 1400 nodes that have a daily job churn rate of around 20k jobs.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Observer-Parameterized Control Barrier Function with Adaptive Safety Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a nonlinear disturbance observer-parameterized control barrier function (DOp-CBF) designed for a robust safety control system under external disturbances. This framework emphasizes that the safety bounds are relevant to the disturbances, acknowledging the critical impact of disturbances on system safety. This work incorporates a disturbance observer (DO) as an adaptive mechanism of the safety bounds design. Instead of considering the worst-case scenario, the safety bounds are dynamically adjusted using DO. The forward invariance of the proposed method regardless of the observer error is ensured, and the corresponding optimal control formulation is presented. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated through simulations of a cruise control problem under varying road grades. The influence of road grade on the safe distance between vehicles is analyzed and managed using a DO. The results demonstrate the advantages of this approach in maintaining safety and improving system performance under disturbances.</description>

      <title>Little to lose: the case for a robust European green hydrogen strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The EU targets 10 Mt of green hydrogen production by 2030, but has not committed to targets for 2040. Green hydrogen competes with carbon capture and storage, biomass and imports in reaching emissions reductions; earlier studies have demonstrated the great uncertainty in future cost-optimal development of green hydrogen. In spite of this, we show that Europe risks little by setting green hydrogen production targets at around 25 Mt by 2040. Employing an extensive scenario analysis combined with novel near-optimal techniques, we find that this target results in systems that are within 10% of cost-optimal in most considered scenarios. Setting concrete targets is important in order to resolve significant uncertainty which hampers investments. Targeting green hydrogen reduces the dependence on carbon capture and storage and green fuel imports, making for a more robust European climate strategy.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Memory Control for Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the design of a memory-based dynamic event-triggered mechanisms (DETM) scheme for heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) characterized by interval type-2 Takagi-Sugeno (IT2 T-S) fuzzy models. To address the complex nonlinear uncertainties inherent in such systems, discrete IT2 T-S fuzzy models are employed to accurately capture system dynamics. In response to the limitations on communication resources and computational capabilities within MASs, this research introduces a distributed DETM approach based on a dynamic threshold method. This mechanism effectively minimizes unnecessary communication while maintaining robust performance. The proposed memory-based control strategy not only reduces the conservatism associated with controller design conditions but also enhances overall controller performance. Furthermore, leveraging a non-parallel distributed compensation (non-PDC) strategy, a novel derivation method is developed for controller design conditions that significantly decreases conservatism. This leads to sufficient conditions for the asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. The designed distributed event-triggered controllers improve the overall performance of MASs, as evidenced by numerical simulations that validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Overall, these findings advance the state-of-the-art in control strategies for heterogeneous MASs, offering practical solutions for real-world applications where resource constraints are critical.</description>

      <title>Fault Isolation for the Ink Deposition Process in High-End Industrial Printers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mathematical framework for modeling the dynamic effects of three fault categories and six fault variants in the ink channels of high-end industrial printers. It also introduces a hybrid approach that combines model-based and data-based methods to detect and isolate these faults effectively. A key challenge in these systems is that the same piezo device is used for actuation (generating ink droplets) and for sensing and, as a consequence, sensing is only available when there is no actuation. The proposed Fault Detection (FD) filter, based on the healthy model, uses the piezo self-sensing signal to generate a residual, while taking the above challenge into account. The system is flagged as faulty if the residual energy exceeds a threshold. Fault Isolation (FI) is achieved through linear regression or a k-nearest neighbors approach to identify the most likely fault category and variant. The resulting hybrid Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) method overcomes traditional limitations of model-based methods by isolating different types of faults affecting the same entries (i.e., equations) in the ink channel dynamics. Moreover, it is shown to outperform purely data-driven methods in fault isolation, especially when data is scarce. Experimental validation demonstrates superior FDI performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Joint Energy and Differentially-Private Smart Meter Data Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the vital role that smart meter data could play in handling uncertainty in energy markets, data markets have been proposed as a means to enable increased data access. However, most extant literature considers energy markets and data markets separately, which ignores the interdependence between them. In addition, existing data market frameworks rely on a trusted entity to clear the market. This paper proposes a joint energy and data market focusing on the day-ahead retailer energy procurement problem with uncertain demand. The retailer can purchase differentially-private smart meter data from consumers to reduce uncertainty. The problem is modelled as an integrated forecasting and optimisation problem providing a means of valuing data directly rather than valuing forecasts or forecast accuracy. Value is determined by the Wasserstein distance, enabling privacy to be preserved during the valuation and procurement process. The value of joint energy and data clearing is highlighted through numerical case studies using both synthetic and real smart meter data.</description>

      <title>Autonomy in the Real-World: Autonomous Trajectory Planning for Asteroid Reconnaissance via Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and evaluation of an optimization-based autonomous trajectory planning algorithm for the asteroid reconnaissance phase of a deep-space exploration mission. The reconnaissance phase is a low-altitude flyby to collect detailed information around a potential landing site. Although such autonomous deep-space exploration missions have garnered considerable interest recently, state-of-the-practice in trajectory design involves a time-intensive ground-based open-loop process that forward propagates multiple trajectories with a range of initial conditions and parameters to account for uncertainties in spacecraft knowledge and actuation. In this work, we introduce a stochastic trajectory optimization-based approach to generate trajectories that satisfy both the mission and spacecraft safety constraints during the reconnaissance phase of the Deep-space Autonomous Robotic Explorer (DARE) mission concept, which seeks to travel to and explore a near-Earth object autonomously, with minimal ground intervention. We first use the Multi-Spacecraft Concept and Autonomy Tool (MuSCAT) simulation framework to rigorously validate the underlying modeling assumptions for our trajectory planner and then propose a method to transform this stochastic optimal control problem into a deterministic one tailored for use with an off-the-shelf nonlinear solver. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithmic approach through extensive numerical experiments and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-practice benchmark used for representative missions.</description>

      <title>A Powered Prosthetic Hand with Vision System for Enhancing the Anthropopathic Grasp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The anthropomorphism of grasping process significantly benefits the experience and grasping efficiency of prosthetic hand wearers. Currently, prosthetic hands controlled by signals such as brain-computer interfaces (BCI) and electromyography (EMG) face difficulties in precisely recognizing the amputees' grasping gestures and executing anthropomorphic grasp processes. Although prosthetic hands equipped with vision systems enables the objects' feature recognition, they lack perception of human grasping intention. Therefore, this paper explores the estimation of grasping gestures solely through visual data to accomplish anthropopathic grasping control and the determination of grasping intention within a multi-object environment. To address this, we propose the Spatial Geometry-based Gesture Mapping (SG-GM) method, which constructs gesture functions based on the geometric features of the human hand grasping processes. It's subsequently implemented on the prosthetic hand. Furthermore, we propose the Motion Trajectory Regression-based Grasping Intent Estimation (MTR-GIE) algorithm. This algorithm predicts pre-grasping object utilizing regression prediction and prior spatial segmentation estimation derived from the prosthetic hand's position and trajectory. The experiments were conducted to grasp 8 common daily objects including cup, fork, etc. The experimental results presented a similarity coefficient $R^{2}$ of grasping process of 0.911, a Root Mean Squared Error ($RMSE$) of 2.47\degree, a success rate of grasping of 95.43$\%$, and an average duration of grasping process of 3.07$\pm$0.41 s. Furthermore, grasping experiments in a multi-object environment were conducted. The average accuracy of intent estimation reached 94.35$\%$. Our methodologies offer a groundbreaking approach to enhance the prosthetic hand's functionality and provides valuable insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Safe Non-Stochastic Control of Control-Affine Systems: An Online Convex Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16817v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to safely control nonlinear control-affine systems that are corrupted with bounded non-stochastic noise, i.e., noise that is unknown a priori and that is not necessarily governed by a stochastic model. We focus on safety constraints that take the form of time-varying convex constraints such as collision-avoidance and control-effort constraints. We provide an algorithm with bounded dynamic regret, i.e., bounded suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows the realization of the noise a prior. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where robots will autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unpredictable disturbances such as wind gusts. To develop the algorithm, we capture our problem as a sequential game between a controller and an adversary, where the controller plays first, choosing the control input, whereas the adversary plays second, choosing the noise's realization. The controller aims to minimize its cumulative tracking error despite being unable to know the noise's realization a prior. We validate our algorithm in simulated scenarios of (i) an inverted pendulum aiming to stay upright, and (ii) a quadrotor aiming to fly to a goal location through an unknown cluttered environment.</description>

      <title>Resource and Mobility Management in Hybrid LiFi and WiFi Networks: A User-Centric Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid light fidelity (LiFi) and wireless fidelity (WiFi) networks (HLWNets) are an emerging indoor wireless communication paradigm, which combines the advantages of the capacious optical spectra of LiFi and ubiquitous coverage of WiFi. Meanwhile, load balancing (LB) becomes a key challenge in resource management for such hybrid networks. The existing LB methods are mostly network-centric, relying on a central unit to make a solution for the users all at once. Consequently, the solution needs to be updated for all users at the same pace, regardless of their moving status. This would affect the network performance in two aspects: i) when the update frequency is low, it would compromise the connectivity of fast-moving users; ii) when the update frequency is high, it would cause unnecessary handovers as well as hefty feedback costs for slow-moving users. Motivated by this, we investigate user-centric LB which allows users to update their solutions at different paces. The research is developed upon our previous work on adaptive target-condition neural network (ATCNN), which can conduct LB for individual users in quasi-static channels. In this paper, a deep neural network (DNN) model is designed to enable an adaptive update interval for each individual user. This new model is termed as mobility-supporting neural network (MSNN). Associating MSNN with ATCNN, a user-centric LB framework named mobility-supporting ATCNN (MS-ATCNN) is proposed to handle resource management and mobility management simultaneously. Results show that at the same level of average update interval, MS-ATCNN can achieve a network throughput up to 215\% higher than conventional LB methods such as game theory, especially for a larger number of users. In addition, MS-ATCNN costs an ultra low runtime at the level of 100s $\mu$s, which is two to three orders of magnitude lower than game theory.</description>

      <title>Learning and steering game dynamics towards desirable outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Game dynamics, which describe how agents' strategies evolve over time based on past interactions, can exhibit a variety of undesirable behaviours including convergence to suboptimal equilibria, cycling, and chaos. While central planners can employ incentives to mitigate such behaviors and steer game dynamics towards desirable outcomes, the effectiveness of such interventions critically relies on accurately predicting agents' responses to these incentives -- a task made particularly challenging when the underlying dynamics are unknown and observations are limited. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Side Information Assisted Regression with Model Predictive Control (SIAR-MPC) framework. We extend the recently introduced SIAR method to incorporate the effect of control, enabling it to utilize side-information constraints inherent to game-theoretic applications to model agents' responses to incentives from scarce data. MPC then leverages this model to implement dynamic incentive adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SIAR-MPC in guiding systems towards socially optimal equilibria, stabilizing chaotic and cycling behaviors. Notably, it achieves these results in data-scarce settings of few learning samples, where well-known system identification methods paired with MPC show less effective results.</description>

      <title>Learning Stable and Passive Neural Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel class of neural differential equation, which are intrinsically Lyapunov stable, exponentially stable or passive. We take a recently proposed Polyak Lojasiewicz network (PLNet) as an Lyapunov function and then parameterize the vector field as the descent directions of the Lyapunov function. The resulting models have a same structure as the general Hamiltonian dynamics, where the Hamiltonian is lower- and upper-bounded by quadratic functions. Moreover, it is also positive definite w.r.t. either a known or learnable equilibrium. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on a damped double pendulum system.</description>

      <title>Parallel Batch Scheduling With Incompatible Job Families Via Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. Existing constraint programming (CP) models for this problem fail to synchronize the processing of the jobs within their batch, resulting in batch interruptions. In the context of the diffusion area in the semiconductor manufacturing process, these interrupted solutions would disrupt the thermal stability required for a uniform dopant distribution on the wafers. This paper proposes three new CP models that directly tackle these interruptions in the formulation, including two adaptions of existing models and a novel Redundant Synchronized (RS) model. These existing and novel models are compared on standard test cases, demonstrating the superiority of the RS model in finding optimal or near-optimal solutions quickly.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Safety in Target Pursuit Control: A CBF-Safe Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the target-pursuit problem, aiming to ensure each pursuer's safety regarding collision avoidance, sensing range, and input saturation. An input-constrained CBF is proposed to dynamically regulate the pursuer's control, ensuring effective target pursuit even when the target performs evasive maneuvers. To further ensure safety, two sets of CBF constraints are designed to regulate the pursuer's position, enabling it to keep the target within the sensing range while avoiding collision in complex environments with external disturbances. These three CBFs collectively form our safety filter, which filters unsafe outputs from RL by solving a Quadratic Program (QP). Finally, the safety filter, combined with a switch strategy that enhances the feasibility of solving its QP, constitutes the Control Barrier Function (CBF)-Safe Reinforcement Learning (CSRL) algorithm, whose solutions are proven to satisfy the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for all safety constraints. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the CSRL algorithm, demonstrating its ability to handle complex pursuit scenarios while maintaining safety and improving control performance.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Learning of Stochastic Differential Equations with Non-asymptotic Fast Rates of Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.</description>

      <title>On the Reachability of 3-Dimensional Paths with a Prescribed Curvature Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept of an equivalence relation between the set of optimal control problems. By leveraging this concept, we show that the boundary of the reachability set can be constructed by the solutions of time optimal problems. Alongside, a more generalized equivalence theorem is presented together. The findings facilitate the use of solution structures from a certain class of optimal control problems to address problems in corresponding equivalent classes. As a byproduct, we state and prove the construction methods of the reachability sets of three-dimensional curves with prescribed curvature bound. The findings are twofold: Firstly, we prove that any boundary point of the reachability set, with the terminal direction taken into account, can be accessed via curves of H, CSC, CCC, or their respective subsegments, where H denotes a helicoidal arc, C a circular arc with maximum curvature, and S a straight segment. Secondly, we show that any boundary point of the reachability set, without considering the terminal direction, can be accessed by curves of CC, CS, or their respective subsegments. These findings extend the developments presented in literature regarding planar curves, or Dubins car dynamics, into spatial curves in $\mathbb{R}^3$. For higher dimensions, we confirm that the problem of identifying the reachability set of curvature bounded paths subsumes the well-known Markov-Dubins problem. These advancements in understanding the reachability of curvature bounded paths in $\mathbb{R}^3$ hold significant practical implications, particularly in the contexts of mission planning problems and time optimal guidance.</description>

      <title>Neo-FREE: Policy Composition Through Thousand Brains And Free Energy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally composing a set of primitives to tackle control tasks. To address this problem, we introduce Neo-FREE: a control architecture inspired by the Thousand Brains Theory and Free Energy Principle from cognitive sciences. In accordance with the neocortical (Neo) processes postulated by the Thousand Brains Theory, Neo-FREE consists of functional units returning control primitives. These are linearly combined by a gating mechanism that minimizes the variational free energy (FREE). The problem of finding the optimal primitives' weights is then recast as a finite-horizon optimal control problem, which is convex even when the cost is not and the environment is nonlinear, stochastic, non-stationary. The results yield an algorithm for primitives composition and the effectiveness of Neo-FREE is illustrated via in-silico and hardware experiments on an application involving robot navigation in an environment with obstacles.</description>
