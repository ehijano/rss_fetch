      <title>Randomization of a Laser Wavefront by the Turbulent Gas-Puff Z-Pinch Plasma Column</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first direct experimental evidence supported by numerical modeling of a turbulent plasma column formed during a gas-puff z-pinch implosion generated by COBRA current. Utilizing an imaging refractometer, we show a significant decrease in spatial autocorrelation of the laser field and the appearance of a laser speckle pattern shortly before stagnation. The intensity distribution of the speckles measured during different shot campaigns while employing long and short COBRA pulses follows the speckle statistics satisfactorily. The imaging refractometer data is proportional to the integral over electron density gradients; hence, the measured phase randomization of the individual plane waves comprising the laser field implies random density distribution. To validate this, the Beam Propagation Method code simulates the laser beam propagation through different artificial density distributions with various average fluctuation scales and generates synthetic imaging refractometer data. The results reproduce similar trends in the experimental data, such as the increasing vertical width for the decreasing average spatial scale of the fluctuations and decreasing spatial correlation length of the laser field. Therefore, during the gas-puff z-pinch implosion process, it is likely that the plasma flow is almost always turbulent with the average spatial scale of the turbulent density fluctuations decreasing towards stagnation.</description>

      <title>Direct comparison of the energization of self-consistent charged particles vs test particles in a turbulent plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The test particle approach is a widely used method for studying the dynamics of charged particles in complex electromagnetic fields and has been successful in explaining particle energization in turbulent plasmas. However, this approach is fundamentally not self-consistent, as test particles do not generate their own electromagnetic fields and therefore do not interact with their surroundings realistically. In this work, we compare the energization of a population of test protons in a magnetofluid to that of a plasma composed of self-consistent particles. We use a compressible Hall magnetohydrodynamic (CHMHD) model for the test particle case and a hybrid particle-in-cell (HPIC) approach for the self-consistent case, conducting both 2D and 3D simulations. We calculate the rate of energization and conversion to thermal energy in both models, finding a higher temperature for the test particle case. Additionally, we examine the distribution of suprathermal particles and find that, in the test particle scenario, these particles eventually occupy the entire domain, while in the self-consistent case, suprathermal particles are confined to specific regions. We conclude that while test particles capture some qualitative features of their self-consistent counterparts, they miss finer phenomena and tend to overestimate energization.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric model for 1-color laser filament THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A 3D axisymmetric model for laser beam propagation in air is proposed for use with THz emission calculations. The model accounts for nonlinear propagation of the femtosecond pulse that generates the filament (Kerr self-focusing and plasma defocusing). The formalism proposed is quite general and can be applied across a broad range of experimental parameters - focal lengths, beam profiles, and intensities. We adapt existing models of 1-color THz emission for use with the beam propagation model to calculate THz emission signatures. Two THz emission models are used, a 1D model and a more detailed 3D axisymmetric model. For the 3D axisymmetric model, simplified current source terms are derived by applying the slowly-varying amplitude envelope approximation. The two models give consistent results for the THz emission signal. For the test case considered, nonlinear propagation dynamics have a large impact on the amplitude of the THz signal, but only a minimal impact on the frequency content and angular distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>On Density Limit of Lower Hybrid Current Drive caused by Parametric Decay Instability in Tokamak Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The density limit of lower hybrid current drive (LHCD) is scaled by coupling the saturation process of parametric decay instability induced by LH waves in the scrape off layer (SOL) plasma to the propagation of waves. It is shown that the density limit of LHCD satisfies $n_\text{lim}\propto L_y^{2/3} P_0^{-2/3}\omega_0^{2}B_0^{2/3}T_e$, which is consistent with results of simulations and previous experiments. Both theoretical analysis and simulation results indicate that the density limit is far from being reached for ITER baseline profile. Therefore, the density limit phenomena will not prevent LHCD from being a promising method of driving plasma current at ITER and future tokamaks.</description>

      <title>Intermittency assessed through a model of kurtosis-skewness relation in MHD in fast dynamo regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermittency as it occurs in fast dynamos in the MHD framework is evaluated through the examination of relations between normalized moments at third order (skewness S) and fourth order (kurtosis K) for both the velocity and magnetic field, and for their local dissipations. As investigated by several authors in various physical contexts such as fusion plasmas (Krommes (2008)), climate evolution (Sura &amp; Sardeshmukh (2008)), fluid turbulence or rotating stratified flows (Pouquet et al. (2023)), approximate parabolic K(S) ~ alpha laws emerge whose origin may be related to the applicability of intermittency models to their dynamics. The results analyzed herein are obtained through direct numerical simulations of MHD flows for both Taylor-Green and Beltrami ABC forcing at moderate Reynolds numbers, and for up to 314000 turn-over times. We observe for the dissipation 0.2 &lt; alpha &lt;3.0, an evaluation that varies with the field, the forcing, and when filtering for high-skewness intermittent structures. When using the She &amp; Leveque (1994) intermittency model, one can compute alpha analytically; we then find alpha = 2.5, clearly differing from a (strict) parabolic scaling, a result consistent with the numerical data.</description>

      <title>Construction and analysis of guiding center distributions for tokamak plasmas with ambient radial electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution of a time-independent toroidally-symmetric radial electric field $E_r$ is implemented in VisualStart [Comp. Phys. Comm. 275 (2022) 108305; arXiv:2111.08224], a code whose purposes include the construction of guiding center (GC) drift orbit databases for the study of plasma instabilities in tokamaks. $E_r$ is important for the thermal part of the velocity distribution and for fast particle resonances in the kHz frequency range. KSTAR, JT-60U and ITER tokamak cases are used as working examples to test our methods and discuss practical issues connected with $E_r$. Two points are worth noting: First, the GC orbit space is sampled in the magnetic midplane as before, and we find that in the presence of $E_r$, midplane-based coordinates are not only equivalent but superior to conventional constants of motion, allowing to attain high numerical accuracy and efficiency with a relatively simple mesh. Second, the periodic parallel acceleration and deceleration of GCs via the mirror force is modulated by $E_r$. Although this parallel electric acceleration averages to zero during a poloidal transit (or bounce) period, it has important consequences, one being the known shift of the trapped-passing boundary. Another consequence is that electric frequency shifts depend on the chosen reference point, so that some care is required when evaluating the $E_r$-dependence of transit frequencies for resonance analyses.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>A study of particles acceleration, heating, power deposition, and the damping length of kinetic Alfv\'en waves in non-Maxwellian coronal plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The heating of the solar corona and solar wind, through suprathermal particles and kinetic Alfv\'en waves within the 0 - 10 $R_{\rm Sun}$ range, has been a subject of great interest for many decades. This study investigates the acceleration and heating of charged particles and the role of KAWs in the solar corona. We investigate how KAWs transport energy and accelerate/heat the charged particles, focusing on the behavior of perturbed EM fields, Poynting flux vectors, net power transfer, resonant particle speed, group speed, and the damping length of KAWs. The study examines how these elements are influenced by suprathermal particles \kappa and the electron-to-ion temperature $T_e/T_i$. We use kinetic plasma theory coupled with the Vlasov-Maxwell model to investigate the dynamics of KAWs and particles. We assume a collisionless, homogeneous, and low-beta electron-ion plasma in which Alfv\'en waves travel in the kinetic limits. The results show the perturbed EM fields are significantly influenced by $\kappa$ and $T_e/T_i$. We evaluate both the parallel and perpendicular Poynting fluxes and find that the parallel Poynting flux dissipates gradually for lower \kappa values. The perpendicular flux dissipates quickly over shorter distances. Power deposition in solar flux tubes is significantly influenced by \kappa and Te/Ti. We find that particles can heat the solar corona over long distances in the parallel direction and short distances in the perpendicular direction. The group velocity of KAWs increases for lower \kappa values, and the damping length is enhanced under lower \kappa, suggesting longer energy transport distances. These findings offer a comprehensive understanding of particle-wave interactions in the solar corona and wind, with potential applications for missions such as the Parker Solar Probe (PSP), and can also apply to other environments.</description>

      <title>Night-Side Relativistic Electron Precipitation Bursts in the Outer Radiation Belt: Insights from ELFIN and THEMIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic whistler-mode waves play a crucial role in the acceleration and precipitation of radiation belt electrons. Statistical surveys of wave characteristics suggest that these waves should preferentially scatter and precipitate relativistic electrons on the day side. However, the night-side region is expected to be primarily associated with electron acceleration. The recent low-altitude observations reveal relativistic electron precipitation in the night-side region. In this paper, we present statistical surveys of night-side relativistic electron losses due to intense precipitation bursts. We demonstrate that such bursts are associated with storm time substorm injections and are likely related to relativistic electron scattering by ducted whistler-mode waves. We also speculate on the role of injections in creating conditions favorable for relativistic electron precipitation.</description>

      <title>Solving the Nonlinear Vlasov Equation on a Quantum Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mapping of the nonlinear, electrostatic Vlasov equation with Krook type collision operators, discretized on a (1 + 1) dimensional grid, onto a recent Carleman linearization based quantum algorithm for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with quadratic nonlinearities. We show that the quantum algorithm is guaranteed to converge only when the plasma parameters take unphysical values. This is due to the high level of dissipation in the ODE system required for convergence, that far exceeds the physical dissipation effect provided by the Krook operator. Additionally, we derive upper bounds for the query- and gate complexities of the quantum algorithm in the limit of large grid sizes. We conclude that these are polynomially larger than the time complexity of the corresponding classical algorithms. We find that this is mostly due to the dimension, sparsity and norm of the Carleman linearized evolution matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new scale decomposition method to investigate turbulence in wavenumber-frequency space. Using 3D magnetohydrodynamic turbulence simulations, we show that magnetic fluctuations with time scales longer than the nonlinear time exhibit an inverse cascade toward even smaller frequencies. Low frequency magnetic fluctuations support turbulence, acting as an energy reservoir that is converted into plasma kinetic energy, the latter cascading toward large wavenumbers and frequencies, where it is dissipated. Our results shed new light on the spatio-temporal properties of turbulence, potentially explaining the origin and role of low frequency turbulent fluctuations in the solar wind.</description>

Abstract: We study the collapse of an attractive Bose-Einstein condensate, where an unstable system evolves towards a singularity, by numerically solving the underlying cubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We find good agreement between our simulations and the atom-loss measurements with a $^{39}$K condensate. Our simulations reveal an interplay of weak collapse and the propensity of the system to form a hotspot, and we uncover new scaling laws that govern this behavior. We also identify promising signatures of the theoretically predicted, but so far experimentally elusive, elastic three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Saturation of the compression of two interacting magnetic flux tubes evidenced in the laboratory</title>

Abstract: Interactions between magnetic fields advected by matter play a fundamental role in the Universe at a diverse range of scales. A crucial role these interactions play is in making turbulent fields highly anisotropic, leading to observed ordered fields. These in turn, are important evolutionary factors for all the systems within and around. Despite scant evidence, due to the difficulty in measuring even near-Earth events, the magnetic field compression factor in these interactions, measured at very varied scales, is limited to a few. However, compressing matter in which a magnetic field is embedded, results in compression up to several thousands. Here we show, using laboratory experiments and matching three-dimensional hybrid simulations, that there is indeed a very effective saturation of the compression when two independent parallel-oriented magnetic fields regions encounter one another due to plasma advection. We found that the observed saturation is linked to a build-up of the magnetic pressure, which decelerates and redirects the inflows at their encounter point, thereby stopping further compression. Moreover, the growth of an electric field, induced by the incoming flows and the magnetic field, acts in redirecting the inflows transversely, further hampering field compression.</description>

Abstract: An integrated modeling framework for investigating the application of solid boron powder injection for real-time surface conditioning of plasma-facing components in tokamak environments is presented. Utilizing the DIII-D impurity powder dropper setup, this study simulates B powder injection scenarios ranging from mg/s to tens of mg/s, corresponding to B flux rates of $10^{20}-10^{21}$ B/s in standard L-mode conditions. The comprehensive modeling approach combines EMC3-EIRENE for simulating the D plasma background and DIS for the ablation and transport of the B powder particles. The results show substantial transport of B to the inboard lower divertor, predominantly influenced by the main ion plasma flow. The dependency on powder particle size (5-250 $\mu$m) was found to be insignificant for the scenario considered. The effects of erosion and redeposition were considered to reconcile the discrepancies with experimental observations, which saw substantial deposition on the outer divertor PFCs. For this purpose, the WallDYN3D code was updated to include B sources within the plasma domain and integrated into the modeling framework. The mixed-material migration modeling shows evolving B deposition patterns, suggesting the formation of mixed B-C layers or predominantly B coverage depending on the powder mass flow rate. While the modeling outcomes at lower B injection rates tend to align with experimental observations, the prediction of near-pure B layers at higher rates has yet to be experimentally verified in the C environment of the DIII-D tokamak. The extensive reach of B layers found in the modeling suggests the need for modeling that encompasses the entire wall geometry for more accurate experimental correlations. This integrated approach sets a precedent for analyzing and applying real-time in-situ boron coating techniques in advanced tokamak scenarios, potentially extendable to ITER.</description>

Abstract: Resistive wall tearing modes (RWTM) can cause major disruptions. A signature of RWTMs is that the rational surface is sufficiently close to the wall. For $(m,n) = (2,1)$ modes, at normalized minor radius $\rho = 0.75$, the value of $q$ is $q_{75} &lt; 2.$ This is confirmed in simulations and theory and in a DIII-D locked mode disruption database. The $q_{75} &lt; 2$ criterion is valid at high $\beta$ as well as at low $\beta.$ A very important feature of RWTMs is that they produce major disruptions only when the $q_{75} &lt; 2$ criterion is satisfied. If it is not satisfied, or if the wall is ideally conducting, then the mode does not produce a major disruption, although it can produce a minor disruption. Feedback, or rotation of the mode at the wall by complex feedback, can emulate an ideal wall, preventing major disruptions. The $q_{75}$ criterion is analyzed in a linear simulations, and a simple geometric model is given.</description>

      <title>Uniform Field in Microwave Cavities Through the Use of Effective Magnetic Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wire media (WM) resonators have emerged as promising realization for plasma haloscopes -- devices designed to detect axions, a potential component of dark matter. Key factors influencing the detection probability include cavity volume, resonance quality factor, and form factor. While the form factor has been explored for resonant frequency tuning, its optimization for axion detection remains unexplored. In this work, we present a novel approach to significantly enhance the form factor of WM plasma haloscopes. By shifting the metal walls of the resonator by a quarter wavelength, we effectively convert an electric wall boundary condition into a magnetic wall one, allowing for an almost uniform mode. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations confirm that this modification improves the electric field profile and boosts the form factor. We validate these findings through experimental results from two prototype resonators: one with a standard geometry and another with a quarter-wave air gap between the WM and the walls. Additionally, our method provides a simple way to control the field profile within WM cavities, which can be explored for further applications.</description>
