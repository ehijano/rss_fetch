      <title>Universal Workflow Language and Software Enables Geometric Learning and FAIR Scientific Protocol Reporting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modern technological landscape has trended towards increased precision and greater digitization of information. However, the methods used to record and communicate scientific procedures have remained largely unchanged over the last century. Written text as the primary means for communicating scientific protocols poses notable limitations in human and machine information transfer. In this work, we present the Universal Workflow Language (UWL) and the open-source Universal Workflow Language interface (UWLi). UWL is a graph-based data architecture that can capture arbitrary scientific procedures through workflow representation of protocol steps and embedded procedure metadata. It is machine readable, discipline agnostic, and compatible with FAIR reporting standards. UWLi is an accompanying software package for building and manipulating UWL files into tabular and plain text representations in a controlled, detailed, and multilingual format. UWL transcription of protocols from three high-impact publications resulted in the identification of substantial deficiencies in the detail of the reported procedures. UWL transcription of these publications identified seventeen procedural ambiguities and thirty missing parameters for every one hundred words in published procedures. In addition to preventing and identifying procedural omission, UWL files were found to be compatible with geometric learning techniques for representing scientific protocols. In a surrogate function designed to represent an arbitrary multi-step experimental process, graph transformer networks were able to predict outcomes in approximately 6,000 fewer experiments than equivalent linear models. Implementation of UWL and UWLi into the scientific reporting process will result in higher reproducibility between both experimentalists and machines, thus proving an avenue to more effective modeling and control of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning and Prompt Engineering with Cognitive Knowledge Graphs for Scholarly Knowledge Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing amount of published scholarly articles, exceeding 2.5 million yearly, raises the challenge for researchers in following scientific progress. Integrating the contributions from scholarly articles into a novel type of cognitive knowledge graph (CKG) will be a crucial element for accessing and organizing scholarly knowledge, surpassing the insights provided by titles and abstracts. This research focuses on effectively conveying structured scholarly knowledge by utilizing large language models (LLMs) to categorize scholarly articles and describe their contributions in a structured and comparable manner. While previous studies explored language models within specific research domains, the extensive domain-independent knowledge captured by LLMs offers a substantial opportunity for generating structured contribution descriptions as CKGs. Additionally, LLMs offer customizable pathways through prompt engineering or fine-tuning, thus facilitating to leveraging of smaller LLMs known for their efficiency, cost-effectiveness, and environmental considerations. Our methodology involves harnessing LLM knowledge, and complementing it with domain expert-verified scholarly data sourced from a CKG. This strategic fusion significantly enhances LLM performance, especially in tasks like scholarly article categorization and predicate recommendation. Our method involves fine-tuning LLMs with CKG knowledge and additionally injecting knowledge from a CKG with a novel prompting technique significantly increasing the accuracy of scholarly knowledge extraction. We integrated our approach in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), thus enabling precise access to organized scholarly knowledge, crucially benefiting domain-independent scholarly knowledge exchange and dissemination among policymakers, industrial practitioners, and the general public.</description>

      <title>Exploring the applicability of Large Language Models to citation context analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike traditional citation analysis -- which assumes that all citations in a paper are equivalent -- citation context analysis considers the contextual information of individual citations. However, citation context analysis requires creating large amounts of data through annotation, which hinders the widespread use of this methodology. This study explored the applicability of Large Language Models (LLMs) -- particularly ChatGPT -- to citation context analysis by comparing LLMs and human annotation results. The results show that the LLMs annotation is as good as or better than the human annotation in terms of consistency but poor in terms of predictive performance. Thus, having LLMs immediately replace human annotators in citation context analysis is inappropriate. However, the annotation results obtained by LLMs can be used as reference information when narrowing the annotation results obtained by multiple human annotators to one, or LLMs can be used as one of the annotators when it is difficult to prepare sufficient human annotators. This study provides basic findings important for the future development of citation context analyses.</description>

      <title>Past, Present, and Future of Citation Practices in HCI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16526v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is a complex system comprised of many scientists who individually make collective decisions that, due to the size and nature of the academic system, largely do not affect the system as a whole. However, certain decisions at the meso-level of research communities, such as the Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) community, may result in deep and long-lasting behavioral changes in scientists. In this article, we provide evidence on how a change in editorial policies introduced at the ACM CHI Conference in 2016 launched the CHI community on an expansive path, denoted by a year-by-year increase in the mean number of references included in CHI articles. If this near-linear trend continues undisrupted, an article in CHI 2030 will include on average almost 130 references. The trend towards more citations reflects a citation culture where quantity is prioritized over quality, contributing to both author and peer reviewer fatigue. This article underscores the profound impact that meso-level policy adjustments have on the evolution of scientific fields and disciplines, urging stakeholders to carefully consider the broader implications of such changes.</description>
