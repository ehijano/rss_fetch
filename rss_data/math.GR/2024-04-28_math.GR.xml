      <title>Conjugacy geodesics and growth in dihedral Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe conjugacy geodesic representatives in any dihedral Artin group $G(m)$, $m\geq 3$, which we then use to calculate asymptotics for the conjugacy growth of $G(m)$, and show that the conjugacy growth series of $G(m)$ with respect to the `free product' generating set $\{x, y\}$ is transcendental. This, together with recent results on Artin groups and contracting elements, implies that all Artin groups of XXL-type have transcendental conjugacy growth series for some generating set.
  We prove two additional properties of $G(m)$ that connect to conjugacy, namely that the permutation conjugator length function is constant, and that the falsification by fellow traveler property (FFTP) holds with respect to $\{x, y\}$. These imply that the language of all conjugacy geodesics in $G(m)$ with respect to $\{x, y\}$ is regular.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of parafermion vertex operator algebras: general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete the program for determining the full automorphism groups of all parafermion vertex operator algebras associated with simple Lie algebras and positive integral levels. We show that the full automorphism group of the parafermion vertex operator algebra is isomorphic to the automorphism group of the associated root system for the remaining cases: (i) the level is at least $3$; (ii) the level is $2$ and the simple Lie algebra is non simply laced.</description>

      <title>Spread-out percolation on transitive graphs of polynomial growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a vertex-transitive graph of superlinear polynomial growth. Given $r&gt;0$, let $G_r$ be the graph on the same vertex set as $G$, with two vertices joined by an edge if and only if they are at graph distance at most $r$ apart in $G$. We show that the critical probability $p_c(G_r)$ for Bernoulli bond percolation on $G_r$ satisfies $p_c(G_r) \sim 1/\mathrm{deg}(G_r)$ as $r\to\infty$. This extends work of Penrose and Bollob\'as-Janson-Riordan, who considered the case $G=\mathbb{Z}^d$.
  Our result provides an important ingredient in parallel work of Georgakopoulos in which he introduces a new notion of dimension in groups. It also verifies a special case of a conjecture of Easo and Hutchcroft.</description>

      <title>A Notion of Dimension based on Probability on Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce notions of dimension of an infinite group, or more generally, a metric space, defined using percolation. Roughly speaking, the percolation dimension $pdim(G)$ of a group $G$ is the fastest rate of decay of a symmetric probability measure $\mu$ on $G$, such that Bernoulli percolation on $G$ with connection probabilities proportional to $\mu$ behaves like a Poisson branching process with parameter 1 in a sense made precise below. We show that $pdim(G)$ has several natural properties: it is monotone decreasing with respect to subgroups and quotients, and coincides with the growth rate exponent for several classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Filtered Boolean powers of finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{A}$ be a finite simple non-abelian Mal'cev algebra (e.g. a group, loop, ring). We investigate the Boolean power $\mathbf{D}$ of $\mathbf{A}$ by the countable atomless Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$ filtered at some idempotents $e_1,\dots,e_n$ of $\mathbf{A}$. When $e_1,\dots,e_n$ are all idempotents of $\mathbf{A}$ we establish two concrete representations of $\mathbf{D}$: as the Fra\"iss\'e limit of the class of finite direct powers of $\mathbf{A}$, and as congruence classes of the countable free algebra in the variety generated by $\mathbf{A}$. Further, for arbitrary $e_1,\dots,e_n$, we show that $\mathbf{D}$ is $\omega$-categorical and that its automorphism group has the small index property, strong uncountable cofinality and the Bergman property. As necessary background we establish some general properties of congruences and automorphisms of filtered Boolean powers of $\mathbf{A}$ by any Boolean algebra $\mathbf{B}$, including a semidirect decomposition for their automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Topological finiteness properties of monoids. Part 2: special monoids, one-relator monoids, amalgamated free products, and HNN extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.03413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how topological methods developed in a previous article can be applied to prove new results about topological and homological finiteness properties of monoids. A monoid presentation is called special if the right-hand side of each relation is equal to $1$. We prove results which relate the finiteness properties of a monoid defined by a special presentation with those of its group of units. Specifically we show that the monoid inherits the finiteness properties $F_n$ and $FP_n$ from its group of units. We also obtain results which relate the geometric and cohomological dimensions of such a monoid to those of its group of units. We apply these results to prove a Lyndon's Identity Theorem for one-relator monoids of the form $\langle A \mid r=1 \rangle$. In particular we show that all such monoids are of type $F_{\infty}$ (and $FP_{\infty}$), and that when $r$ is not a proper power, then the monoid has geometric and cohomological dimension at most $2$. The first of these results resolves an important case of a question of Kobayashi from 2000 on homological finiteness properties of one-relator monoids. We also show how our topological approach can be used to prove results about the closure properties of various homological and topological finiteness properties for amalgamated free products and HNN-extensions of monoids. To prove these results we introduce new methods for constructing equivariant classifying spaces for monoids, as well as developing a Bass-Serre theory for free constructions of monoids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2010.07205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we prove that if a finitely generated amenable group admits a regular map to a direct product of a hyperbolic space and a euclidean space, then it must be virtually nilpotent. We deduce that an amenable group regularly embeds into a hyperbolic group if and only if it is virtually nilpotent, answering a question of Hume and Sisto. We describe an application to Lorentz geometry due to Charles Frances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.06674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Helfgott on the structure of sets of bounded tripling in bounded rank, which states the following. Let $A$ be a finite symmetric subset of $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbf{F})$ for any field $\mathbf{F}$ such that $|A^3| \leq K|A|$. Then there are subgroups $H \trianglelefteq \Gamma \trianglelefteq \langle A \rangle$ such that $A$ is covered by $K^{O_n(1)}$ cosets of $\Gamma$, $\Gamma/H$ is nilpotent of step at most $n-1$, and $H$ is contained in $A^{O_n(1)}$. This theorem includes the Product Theorem for finite simple groups of bounded rank as a special case. As an application of our methods we also show that the diameter of sufficiently quasirandom finite linear groups is poly-logarithmic.</description>

      <title>A Class of Rearrangement Groups that are not Invariably Generated</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A group $G$ is invariably generated if there exists a subset $S \subseteq G$ such that, for every choice $g_s \in G$ for $s \in S$, the group $G$ is generated by $\{ s^{g_s} \mid s \in S \}$. In [GGJ16] Gelander, Golan and Juschenko showed that Thompson groups $T$ and $V$ are not invariably generated. Here we generalize this result to the larger setting of rearrangement groups, proving that any subgroup of a rearrangement group that has a certain transitive property is not invariably generated.</description>

      <title>On metric approximate subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group with a metric $\mathrm{d}$ invariant under left and right translations, and let $\bar{\mathbb{D}}_r$ be the ball of radius $r$ around the identity. A $(k,r)$-metric approximate subgroup is a symmetric subset $X$ of $G$ such that the pairwise product set $XX$ is covered by at most $k$ translates of $X\bar{\mathbb{D}}_r$. This notion was introduced in arXiv:math/0601431 along with the version for discrete groups (approximate subgroups). In arXiv:0909.2190, it was shown for the discrete case that, at the asymptotic limit of $X$ finite but large, the "approximateness" (or need for more than one translate) can be attributed to a canonically associated Lie group. Here we prove an analogous result in the metric setting, under a certain finite covering assumption on $X$ replacing finiteness. In particular, if $G$ has bounded exponent, we show that any $(k,r)$-metric approximate subgroup is close to a $(1,r')$-metric approximate subgroup for an appropriate $r'$.</description>

      <title>Maximal subgroups of finitely presented special inverse monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.04204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the maximal subgroups (also known as group $\mathcal{H}$-classes) of finitely presented special inverse monoids. We show that the maximal subgroups which can arise in such monoids are exactly the recursively presented groups, and moreover every such maximal subgroup can also arise in the $E$-unitary case. We also prove that the possible groups of units are exactly the finitely generated recursively presented groups; this improves upon a result of, and answers a question of, the first author and Ru\v{s}kuc. These results give the first significant insight into the maximal subgroups of such monoids beyond the group of units, and the results together demonstrate that it is possible for the subgroup structure to have a complexity which significantly exceeds that of the group of units. We also observe that a finitely presented special inverse monoid (even an $E$-unitary one) may have infinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic maximal subgroups.</description>

      <title>Generalisations of Thompson's group V arising from purely infinite groupoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of generalisations of Thompson's group $V$ arising naturally as topological full groups of purely infinite, minimal groupoids. In the process, we show that the derived subgroup of such a group is 2-generated whenever it is finitely generated and has no proper characters in full generality. We characterise this class of groupoids through a number of group-theoretic conditions on their full groups including vigor, the existence of suitable embeddings of $V$, and compressibility. We moreover give a complete abstract characterisation of those groups that arise as either topological full groups or derived subgroups of purely infinite, minimal groupoids. As an application, we describe all proper characters of the Brin-Higman-Thompson groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there is no finitely presented group for which the Dehn function lies asymptotically strictly between linear and quadratic functions. This work presents an example of a semigroup that has Dehn function equivalent to $n \log n$, thus it lies strictly inside the said gap. The example is obtained by symmetrizing the rewriting rules of a particular semi-Thue system, which has the derivational complexity function $n \log n$. We also show that such connection is not universal by providing a semi-Thue system, for which the Dehn function of the symmetrized semigroup asymptotically differs from the derivational complexity of the initial system.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of normal subgroups determined from character tables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gcharacter tables of a finite group G were defined before. These tables can be very useful to obtain certain structural information of a normal subgroup from the character table of G. We analyze certain structural properties of normal subgroups which can be determined using their Gcharacter tables. For instance, we prove an extension of the Thompsons theorem from minimal Ginvariant characters of a normal subgroup. We also obtain a variation of Taketas theorem for hypercentral normal subgroups considering their minimal G-invariant characters. This generalization allows us to introduce a new class of nilpotent groups, the class of nMIgroups, whose members verify that its nilpotency class is bounded by the number of irreducible character degrees of the group.</description>

Abstract: Given a finite group $G$, a group $X$ is called a dihedral-product group of $G$ if $X=GD$ where $D$ is a finite dihedral group. In particular, it is called a dihedral-skew product group of $G$ if $G\cap D=1$ and $D$ has a trivial core in $X$. In this paper, dihedral-skew product groups of all nonabelian simple groups are classified and dihedral-product groups of all nonabelian simple groups are characterized.</description>
