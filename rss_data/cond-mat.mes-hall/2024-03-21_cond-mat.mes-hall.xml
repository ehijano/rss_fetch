      <title>Topological Dipole Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand the concept of two-dimensional topological insulators to encompass a novel category known as topological dipole insulators (TDIs), characterized by conserved dipole moments along the $x$-direction in addition to charge conservation. By generalizing Laughlin's flux insertion argument, we prove a no-go theorem and predict possible edge patterns and anomalies in a TDI with both charge $U^e(1)$ and dipole $U^d(1)$ symmetries. The edge of a TDI is characterized as a quadrupolar channel that displays a dipole $U^d(1)$ anomaly. A quantized amount of dipole gets transferred between the edges under the dipolar flux insertion, manifesting as `quantized quadrupolar Hall effect' in TDIs. A microscopic coupled-wire Hamiltonian realizing the TDI is constructed by introducing a mutually commuting pair-hopping terms between wires to gap out all the bulk modes while preserving the dipole moment. The effective action at the quadrupolar edge can be derived from the wire model, with the corresponding bulk dipolar Chern-Simons response theory delineating the topological electromagnetic response in TDIs. Finally, we enrich our exploration of topological dipole insulators to the spinful case and construct a dipolar version of the quantum spin Hall effect, whose boundary evidences a mixed anomaly between spin and dipole symmetry. Effective bulk and the edge action for the dipolar quantum spin Hall insulator are constructed as well.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium quantum heat transport between structured environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the hierarchical equations of motion technique to analyzing nonequilibrium heat transport in a spin-boson type model, whereby heat transfer through a central spin is mediated by an intermediate pair of coupled harmonic oscillators. The coupling between each pair of oscillators is shown to introduce a localized gap into the effective spectral densities characterizing the system-oscillator-reservoir interactions. Compared to the case of a single mediating oscillator, we find the heat current to be drastically modified at weak system-bath coupling. In particular, a second-order treatment fails to capture the correct steady-state behavior in this regime, which stems from the $\lambda^4$-scaling of the energy transfer rate to lowest order in the coupling strength $\lambda$. This leads naturally to a strong suppression in the steady-state current in the asymptotically weak coupling limit. On the other hand, the current noise follows the same scaling as in the single oscillator case in accordance with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Additionally, we find the heat current to be consistent with Fourier's law even at large temperature bias. Our analysis highlights a novel mechanism for controlling heat transport in nanoscale systems based on tailoring the spectral properties of thermal environments.</description>

      <title>Needle in a haystack: efficiently finding atomically defined quantum dots for electrostatic force microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ongoing development of single electron, nano and atomic scale semiconductor devices would benefit greatly from a characterization tool capable of detecting single electron charging events with high spatial resolution, at low temperature. In this work, we introduce a novel Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) instrument capable of measuring critical device dimensions, surface roughness, electrical surface potential, and ultimately the energy levels of quantum dots and single electron transistors in ultra miniaturized semiconductor devices. Characterization of nanofabricated devices with this type of instrument presents a challenge: finding the device. We therefore also present a process to efficiently find a nanometre size quantum dot buried in a $10 \times 10~\text{mm}^2$ silicon sample using a combination of optical positioning, capacitive sensors and AFM topography in vacuum.</description>

      <title>Emission of fast-propagating spin waves by an antiferromagnetic domain wall driven by spin current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antiferromagnets (AFMs) have great benefits for spintronic applications such as high frequencies (up to THz), high speeds (up to tens of km/s) of magnetic excitations, and field-free operation. Advanced devices will require high-speed propagating spin waves (SWs) as signal carriers, i.e., SWs with high k-vectors, the excitation of which remains challenging. We show that a domain wall (DW) in anisotropic AFM driven by the spin current can be a source of such propagating SWs with high frequencies and group velocities. In the proposed generator, the spin current, with polarization directed along the easy anisotropy axis, excites the precession of the N\'eel vector within the DW. The threshold current is defined by the value of the anisotropy in the hard plane, and the frequency of the DW precession is tuneable by the strength of the spin current. We show that the above precession of spins inside the DW leads to robust emission of high-frequency propagating SWs into the AFM strip with very short wavelengths comparable to the exchange length, which is hard to achieve by any other method.</description>

      <title>Epitaxially defined Luttinger liquids on MoS$_2$ bicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mirror twin boundary (MTB) in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayer can host one-dimensional electron liquid of a topological nature with tunable interactions. Unfortunately, the electrical characterization of such boundaries has been challenging due to the paucity of samples with large enough size and high quality. Here, we report an epitaxial growth of monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) bicrystals with well-isolated MTBs that are tens of micrometers long. Conductance measurements of these MTBs exhibit power-law behaviors as a function of temperature and bias voltage up to room temperature, consistent with electrons tunneling into a Luttinger liquid. Transport measurements of two distinct types of MTBs reveal the critical role of the atomic-scale defects. This study demonstrates that MTBs in TMD monolayers provide an exciting new platform for studying the interplay between electronic interactions and topology.</description>

      <title>Evolution of flat band and role of lattice relaxations in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits correlated phenomena such as superconductivity and Mott insulating state related to the weakly dispersing flat band near the Fermi energy. Beyond its moir\'e period, such flat band is expected to be sensitive to lattice relaxations. Thus, clarifying the evolution of the electronic structure with twist angle is critical for understanding the physics of MATBG. Here, we combine nanospot angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy to resolve the fine electronic structure of the flat band and remote bands, and their evolution with twist angles from 1.07$^\circ$ to 2.60$^\circ$. Near the magic angle, dispersion is characterized by a flat band near the Fermi energy with a strongly reduced bandwidth. Moreover, near 1.07$^\circ$, we observe a spectral weight transfer between remote bands at higher binding energy and extract the modulated interlayer spacing near the magic angle. Our work provides direct spectroscopic information on flat band physics and highlights the role of lattice relaxations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial quantum systems have emerged as indispensable platforms to realize exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). We engineered with atomic precision both topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution. The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states, topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of interacting spins.</description>

      <title>Tunable band gap in twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At large commensurate angles, twisted bilayer graphene which holds even parity under sublattice exchange exhibits a tiny gap. Here, we point out a way to tune this tiny gap into a large gap. We start from comprehensive understanding of the physical origin of gap opening by density functional theory calculations. We reveal that the effective inter-layer hopping, intra-layer CDW, or inter-layer charge imbalance favors a gap. Then, on the basis of tight-binding calculations, we suggest that a periodic transverse inhomogeneous pressure, which can tune inter-layer hoppings in specific regions of the moi$\rm\acute{r}$e supercell, may open a gap of over $100$~meV, which is further confirmed by first-principles calculations. Our results provide a theoretical guidance for experiments to open a large gap in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Band gap formation in commensurate twisted bilayer graphene/hBN moir\'e lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the investigation of periodic superstructures in twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) van-der-Waals heterostructures, where one of the graphene layers is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Our theoretical simulations reveal that if the ratio of the resulting two moir\'e unit cell areas is a simple fraction, the graphene/hBN moir\'e lattice acts as a staggered potential, breaking the degeneracy between tBLG AA sites. This leads to additional band gaps at energies where a subset of tBLG AA sites is fully occupied. These gaps manifest as Landau fans in magnetotransport, which we experimentally observe in an aligned tBLG/hBN heterostructure. Our study demonstrates the identification of commensurate tBLG/hBN van-der-Waals heterostructures by magnetotransport, highlights the persistence of moir\'e effects on length scales of tens of nanometers, and represents an interesting step forward in the ongoing effort to realise designed quantum materials with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Moir\'e-modulated band gap and van Hove singularities in twisted bilayer germanene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twisting bilayers of two-dimensional topological insulators has the potential to create unique quantum states of matter. Here, we successfully synthesized a twisted bilayer of germanene on Ge2Pt(101) with a 21.8$^o$ degrees twist angle, corresponding to a commensurate ($\sqrt{7} \times \sqrt{7}$) structure. Using scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we unraveled the structural and electronic properties of this configuration, revealing a moir\'e-modulated band gap and a well-defined edge state. This band gap opens at AB/BA stacked sites and closes at AA stacked sites, a phenomenon attributed to the electric field induced by the scanning tunneling microscopy tip. Our study further revealed two van Hove singularities at -0.8 eV and +1.04 eV, resulting in a Fermi velocity of $(8 \pm 1) \times 10^5$ m/s. Our tight-binding results uncover a unique quantum state, where the topological properties could be regulated through an electric field, potentially triggering two topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>From Local to Emergent Altermagnetism: Footprints of Free Fermions Band Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are crystallographic rotational symmetry breaking spin-ordered states, possessing a net zero magnetization despite manifesting Kramers non-degenerate bands. Here, we show that momentum-independent local spin nematic orders in monolayer, Bernal bilayer and rhombohedral trilayer graphene give rise to $p$-wave, $d$-wave and $f$-wave altermagnets, respectively, thereby inheriting the free-fermion topology of linear, bi-quadratic and bi-cubic band touchings that are also described in terms of angular momentum $\ell=1,\; 2$ and $3$ spherical harmonics in the reciprocal space. The same conclusions also hold inside a nematic spin-triplet superconductor, featuring Majorana altermagnets. Altogether, these findings highlight the importance of electronic band structure in identifying such exotic magnetic orders in real materials. We depict the effects of in-plane magnetic fields on altermagnets, and showcase a novel spin-disordered alter-valleymagnet phase.</description>

      <title>Direct Probe of Topology and Geometry of Quantum States on IBM Q</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concepts of topology and geometry are of critical importance in exploring exotic phases of quantum matter. Though they have been investigated on various experimental platforms, to date a direct probe of topological and geometric properties on a universal quantum computer even for a minimum model is still in vain. In this work, we first show that a density matrix form of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) can be explicitly re-constructed from Pauli operator measurements on a quantum circuit. We then propose two algorithms, suitable for IBM quantum computers, to directly probe QGT. The first algorithm is a variational quantum algorithm particularly suitable for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era devices, whereas the second one is a pure quantum algorithm based on quantum imaginary time evolution. Explicit results obtained from IBM Q simulating a Chern insulator model are presented and analysed. Our results indicate that transmon qubit-based universal quantum computers have the potential to directly simulate and investigate topological and geometric properties of a quantum system.</description>

      <title>Binding zero modes with fluxons in Josephson junctions of time-reversal invariant topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the joint dynamics of the phase bias $\phi$ and the propagating Majorana fermions of the edge modes in Josephson junctions containing 2D time-reversal invariant topological superconductors (TRITOPS). We consider TRITOPS-TRITOPS junctions, as well as junctions between topological and non-topological superconductors (TRITOPS-S). Both types of junctions are described by effective Dirac Hamiltonians with a $\phi$-dependent mass. We analyze the effect of the phase fluctuations in the junction, as well as solitonic solutions of $\phi$ generated by fluxons trapped in the junction. We show that these solitons generate a spatial-dependent mass with a sign change akin to the Jackiw-Rebbi model. This enables the formation of zero-energy fermionic states localized at the fluxon. For the TRITOPS-TRITOPS junction these consist of a Kramers pair of Majorana modes, while for the TRITOPS-S one, there is a single Majorana fermion. The localized bound states hybridize in soliton-antisoliton configurations. Depending on the occupation state, these modes generate an effective attraction or repulsion in the dynamics of the soliton-antisoliton collision.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Van der Waals electrodynamics: polaritons and electron scattering from plasmons and phonons in BN-capped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmons and polar phonons are elementary electrodynamic excitations of matter. In 2d and at long wavelengths, they couple to light and act as the system polaritons. They also dictate the scattering of charged carriers. Van der Waals heterostructures offer the opportunity to couple excitations from different layers via long-range Coulomb interactions, modifying both their dispersion and their scattering of electrons. Even when the excitations do not couple, they are still influenced by the screening from all layers, leading to complex dynamical interactions between electrons, plasmons and polar phonons. We develop an efficient ab initio model to solve the dynamical electric response of Van der Waals heterostructures, accompanied by a formalism to extract relevant spectroscopic and transport quantities. Notably, we obtain scattering rates for electrons of the heterostructure coupling remotely with electrodynamic excitations. We apply those developments to BN-capped graphene, in which polar phonons from BN couple to plasmons in graphene. We study the nature of the coupled excitations, their dispersion and their coupling to graphene's electrons. Regimes driven by either phonons or plasmons are identified, as well as a truly hybrid regime at long wavelengths. Those are studied as a function of the graphene's Fermi level and the number of BN layers. In contrast with descriptions in terms of surface-optical phonons, we find that the electron-phonon interaction stems from different modes. Moreover, the dynamical screening of the coupling between BN's LO phonons and graphene's electrons crosses over from inefficient to metal-like depending on the relative value of the phonons' frequency and the energetic onset of interband transitions. While the coupling is significant in general, the associated scattering of graphene's carriers is found to be negligible in the context of electronic transport.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Drain Noise in High Electron Mobility Transistors: Thermal and Hot Electron Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the on-wafer characterization of $S$-parameters and microwave noise temperature ($T_{50}$) of discrete metamorphic InGaAs high electron mobility transistors (mHEMTs) at 40 K and 300 K and over a range of drain-source voltages ($V_{DS}$). From these data, we extract a small-signal model and the drain (output) noise current power spectral density ($S_{id}$) at each bias and temperature. This procedure enables $S_{id}$ to be obtained while accounting for the variation of small-signal model, noise impedance match, and other parameters under the various conditions. We find that the thermal noise associated with the channel conductance can only account for a portion of the measured output noise. Considering the variation of output noise with physical temperature and bias and prior studies of microwave noise in quantum wells, we hypothesize that a hot electron noise source based on real-space transfer of electrons from the channel to the barrier could account for the remaining portion of $S_{id}$. We suggest further studies to gain insights into the physical mechanisms. Finally, we calculate that the minimum HEMT noise temperature could be reduced by up to $\sim 50$% and $\sim 30$% at cryogenic temperature and room temperature, respectively, if the hot electron noise could be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Activating non-Hermitian skin modes by parity-time symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry is a cornerstone of non-Hermitian physics as it ensures real energies for stable experimental realization of non-Hermitian phenomena. In this work, we propose $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry as a paradigm for designing rich families of higher-dimensional non-Hermitian states with unique bulk, surface, hinge or corner dynamics. Through systematically breaking or restoring $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry in different sectors of a system, we can selectively activate or manipulate the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) in both the bulk and topological boundary states. Some fascinating phenomena include the directional toggling of the NHSE, and the flow of boundary states without chiral or dynamical pumping, developed from selective boundary NHSE. Our results extend richly into 3D or higher, with more sophisticated interplay with selective bulk and boundary NHSE and charge-parity ($\mathcal{CP}$) symmetry. Based on non-interacting lattices, $\mathcal{PT}$-activated NHSEs can be observed in various optical, photonic, electric and quantum platforms that admit gain/loss and non-reciprocity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscous flow of interacting electrons in two dimensional materials features a bunch of exotic effects. A model resembling the Navier-Stokes equation for classical fluids accounts for them in the so called hydrodynamic regime. We performed a detailed analysis of the physical conditions to achieve electron hydrodynamic transport and found three new alternative routes: favouring frequent inelastic collisions, the application of a magnetic field or a high-frequency electric field. As a mayor conclusion, we show that the conventional requirement of frequent electron-electron collisions is too restrictive and, as a consequence, materials and phenomena to be described using hydrodynamics are widened. In view of our results, we discuss recent experimental evidence on viscous flow and point out alternative avenues to reduce electric dissipation in optimized devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16548v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified model for a three-terminal quantum thermocouple consisting of two strongly-coupled quantum dots. To elucidate spin-dependent Seebeck and Peltier effects, we employ a microscopic Hamiltonian and map the Lindblad master equation onto a quantum transition network, capturing the key working principles for both reciprocal effects. Our analysis reveals quantum thermodynamic networks encompassing both Coulomb interaction and spin-flipping processes, lead to the emergence of spin-thermolectric effects. Using algebraic graph theory, we recover the phenomenological law of irreversible thermodynamics from the stochastic version of the entropy production rate expressed in terms of cycle flux and cycle forces. Remarkably, Onsager reciprocity and Kelvin relation for transport coefficients find their premises in the properties of cycle flux trajectories within the quantum transition network. This underscores the universal generality of thermodynamic principles across classical and quantum realms, despite their fundamentally different basis from classical laws of irreversible thermodynamics relying on local equilibrium assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We study a moving adsorbate interacting with a metal electrode immersed in a solvent using the time-dependent Newns-Anderson-Schmickler model Hamiltonian. We have adopted a semiclassical trajectory treatment of the adsorbate to discuss the electron and energy transfers that occur between the adsorbate and the electrode. Using the Keldysh Green's function scheme, we found a non-adiabatically suppressed electron transfer caused by the motion of the adsorbate and coupling with bath phonons that model the solvent. The energy is thus dissipated into electron-hole pair excitations, which are hindered by interacting with the solvent modes and facilitated by the applied electrode potential. The average energy transfer rate was discussed in terms of the electron friction coefficient and given an analytical expression in the slow-motion limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stacking of intrinsically magnetic van der Waals materials provides a fertile platform to explore tunable transport effects of magnons, presenting significant prospects for spintronic applications. The possibility of having topologically nontrivial magnons in these systems can further expand the scope of exploration. In this work, we consider a bilayer system with intralayer ferromagnetic exchange and a weak interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange, and study the topological magnon-polaron excitations induced by magnetoelastic couplings. Under an applied magnetic field, the system features a metamagnetic transition, where the magnetic ground state changes from antiparallel layers to parallel. We show that the metamagnetic transition is accompanied by a transition of the topological structure of the magnon polarons, which results in discernible changes in the topology induced transport effects. The magnetic-field dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity and spin Nernst coefficient is analyzed with linear response theories.</description>

      <title>Probing Chiral-Symmetric Higher-Order Topological Insulators with Multipole Winding Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between crystalline symmetry and band topology gives rise to unprecedented lower-dimensional boundary states in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs). However, the measurement of the topological invariants of HOTIs remains a significant challenge. Here, we define a {multipole winding number} (MWN) for chiral-symmetric HOTIs by applying a corner twisted boundary condition. The MWN, arising from both bulk and boundary states, accurately captures the bulk-corner correspondence including boundary-obstructed topological phases. To address the measurement challenge, we leverage the perturbative nature of the corner twisted boundary condition and develop a real-space approach for determining the MWN in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. The real-space formula provides an experimentally viable strategy for directly probing the topology of chiral-symmetric HOTIs through dynamical evolution. Our findings not only highlight the twisted boundary condition as a powerful tool for investigating HOTIs, but also establish a paradigm for exploring real-space formulas for the topological invariants of HOTIs.</description>

      <title>Topology reconstruction for asymmetric systems by isomorphic mapping or perturbation approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The systems without symmetries, e.g. the internal or spatial symmetry, are generally thought to be improper for topological study and no conventional integral topological invariant can be well defined. In this work, with multi-band asymmetric Rice-Mele-like systems as examples, we show that the topology of all gaps can be reconstructed by two general methods and a new integral topological invariant, i.e. the renormalized real-space winding number, can properly characterise the topology of such systems. For the first method, an isomorphic mapping relationship between a Rice-Mele-like system and its chiral counterpart is constructed, which accounts for the topology reconstruction at half-filling gaps. For the second method, the Hilbert space of asymmetric systems could be reduced into degenerate subspaces by perturbation approximation, so that the topology in subspaces accounts for the topology reconstruction at fractional-filling gaps. The perturbation-based topology exhibits extraordinary robustness since it even exists beyond the weak perturbation limit. We also show that both methods can be widely used for other asymmetric systems, e.g. the two-dimensional (2D) Rice-Mele systems and the superconductor systems. At last, for the asymmetric photonic systems, we predict different topological edge states by our topology-reconstruction theory and experimentally observe them in the laboratory, which agree with each other very well. Our findings open a door for investigating new topological phenomena in asymmetric systems by various topological reconstruction methods which should greatly expand the category of topology study.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced transition in quantum many-body detection probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01586v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the advent of digital and analog quantum simulation experiments, it is now possible to experimentally simulate dynamics of quantum many-body lattice systems and make site-resolved measurements. These experiments make it pertinent to consider the probability of getting any specific measurement outcome, which we call the `signal', on placing multiple detectors at various sites while simulating dynamics of a quantum many-body lattice system. In this work, we formulate and investigate this problem, introducing the concept of quantum many-body detection probability (QMBDP), which refers to the probability of detecting a chosen signal at least once in a given time. We show that, on tuning some Hamiltonian parameters, there can be sharp transition from a regime where QMBDP $\approx 1$, to a regime, where QMBDP $\approx 0$. Most notably, the effects of such a transition can be observed at a single trajectory level. This is not a measurement-induced transition, but rather a non-equilibrium transition reflecting opening of a specific type of gap in the many-body spectrum. We demonstrate this in a single-impurity non-integrable model, where changing the many-body interaction strength brings about such a transition. Our findings suggest that instead of measuring expectation values, single-shot stroboscopic measurements could be used to observe non-equilibrium transitions.</description>

Abstract: Following a theoretical proposal on multi-impurity charge Kondo circuits [T. K. T. Nguyen and M. N. Kiselev, Phys. Rev. B {\bf 97}, 085403 (2018)] and the experimental breakthrough in fabrication of the two-site Kondo simulator [W. Pouse {\it et al}, Nat. Phys. (2023)] we investigate a thermoelectric transport through a double-dot charge Kondo quantum nano-device in the strong coupling operational regime. We focus on the fingerprints of the non-Fermi liquid and its manifestation in the charge and heat quantum transport. We construct a full-fledged quantitative theory describing crossovers between different regimes of the multi-channel charge Kondo quantum circuits and discuss possible experimental realizations of the theory.</description>

      <title>Absence of a dissipative quantum phase transition in Josephson junctions: Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the reduced density matrix of a resistively shunted Josephson junction (RSJ), using the stochastic Liouville equation method in imaginary time - an exact numerical scheme based on the Feynman-Vernon influence functional. For all parameters investigated, we find that shunting a junction makes it more superconducting. We find no trace of the Schmid superconducting-insulating quantum phase transition long believed to occur in the RSJ. This work confirms theoretically a similar conclusion drawn in 2020 by Murani et al., based on experimental observations. We reveal that resistors with no UV cutoff always yield a fully localized phase and we explain how previous works predicting an insulating state came to obtain a contrary result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic Casimir effect has a fermionic counterpart in topological insulators: Zero-point fluctuations of a massless Dirac fermion field mediate a force between magnetic scatterers. The Casimir force is insensitive to disorder that preserves the topological protection of an unpaired Dirac cone. The protection may be broken if the Dirac equation is discretized, and an exponential suppression of the Casimir effect will result if a gap opens at the Dirac point. Here we show how this lattice artefact may be avoided, by applying a recently developed local discretization of the Euclidean action that does not suffer from the fermion-doubling obstruction of local discretizations of the Hamiltonian.</description>

Abstract: A central paradigm of non-equilibrium physics concerns the dynamics of heterogeneity and disorder, impacting processes ranging from the behavior of glasses to the emergent functionality of active matter. Understanding these complex mesoscopic systems requires probing the microscopic trajectories associated with irreversible processes, the role of fluctuations and entropy growth, and the timescales on which non-equilibrium responses are ultimately maintained. Approaches that illuminate these processes in model systems may enable a more general understanding of other heterogeneous non-equilibrium phenomena, and potentially define ultimate speed and energy cost limits for information processing technologies. Here, we apply ultrafast single shot x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy to resolve the non-equilibrium, heterogeneous, and irreversible mesoscale dynamics during a light-induced phase transition. This approach defines a new way of capturing the nucleation of the induced phase, the formation of transient mesoscale defects at the boundaries of the nuclei, and the eventual annihilation of these defects, even in systems with complex polarization topologies. A non-equilibrium response spanning &gt;10 orders of magnitude in timescales is observed, with multistep behavior similar to the plateaus observed in supercooled liquids and glasses. We show how the observed time-dependent long-time correlations can be understood in terms of the stochastic dynamics of domain walls, encoded in effective waiting-time distributions with power-law tails. This work defines new possibilities for probing the non-equilibrium and correlated dynamics of disordered and heterogeneous media.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The phase transition of confined fluids in mesoporous materials deviates from that of bulk fluids due to the interactions with the surrounding heterogeneous structure. For example, adsorbed fluids in metal-organic-frameworks (MOFs) have atypical phase characteristics such as capillary condensation and higher-order phase transitions due to a strong heterogeneous field. Considering a many-body problem in the presence of a nonuniform external field, we model the host-guest and guest-guest interactions in MOFs. To solve the three-dimensional Ising model, we use the mean-field theory to approximate the guest-guest interactions and Mayer's f-functions to describe the host-guest interactions in a unit cell. Later, using Hill's theory of nanothermodynamics, we define differential thermodynamic functions to understand the distribution of intensive properties and integral thermodynamic functions to explain the phase transition in confined fluids. The investigation reveals a distinct behavior where fluids confined in larger pores undergo a discontinuous (first-order) phase transition, whereas those confined in smaller pores experience a continuous (higher-order) phase transition. Furthermore, the results indicate that the free-energy barrier for phase transitions is lower in confined fluids than in bulk fluids giving rise to a lower condensation pressure relative to the bulk saturation pressure. Finally, the integral thermodynamic functions are succinctly presented in the form of a phase diagram, marking an initial step toward a more practical approach for understanding the phase behavior of confined fluids.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and having potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. We also propose a correlated quantum nanowire model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>
