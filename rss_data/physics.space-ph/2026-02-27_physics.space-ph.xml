      <title>Fluctuating polytropic processes, turbulence, and heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes and their connection to turbulence. It is shown that random fluctuations of polytropic processes produce a nonzero overall heating of a particle system, e.g., solar wind plasma flowing out through the heliosphere; while any nonturbulent heating can be thermodynamically described by typical nonfluctuating polytropic processes, turbulent heating can be thermodynamically described through fluctuating polytropic processes. First, we derive the expression of the overall process and find that polytropic fluctuations lead to heat entering the system even if the respective nonfluctuating process is adiabatic. The temperature of the solar wind plasma protons decreases with heliospheric distance less than the adiabatic cooling, again, similar to when heating enters the system; this subadiabatic cooling is proportional to the variance of the fluctuations. We derive the heliospheric radial profiles of the thermodynamic expressions of the polytropic index, temperature, and heating rates. Then, we show that the analytical profiles of heating of fluctuating polytropic processes and of turbulent heating are identical, suggesting that turbulence heats plasma particle populations by fluctuating their polytropic processes. We apply the thermodynamics of fluctuating polytropic processes to the energy transfer from pickup ions (PUIs) to solar wind plasma protons, and derive the analytical expressions of PUI turbulent and nonturbulent heating rates, which are well fitted to the respective observations. Finally, we apply the thermodynamic model to the radial profile of PUI energy transfer to the solar wind plasma protons, where we derive the portion of PUI turbulent vs. nonturbulent heating rates.</description>

      <title>Anomalous cosmic rays within the inner heliosphere: Observations of helium by the High Energy Telescope onboard Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radial gradients of cosmic rays are key parameters for understanding the transport of particles in space. Solar Orbiter, launched on 2020 February 10, approaches the Sun approximately every half year, with a closest perihelion distance of 0.29 au after the end of 2022 during the nominal mission phase. The two double-ended high energy telescopes(HET)onboard the Solar Orbiter measure energetic particles in the energy range between a few MeV/nuc and a few hundred MeV/nuc, which are dominated by anomalous cosmic rays (ACRs) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) during solar quiet times. By obtaining the radial gradient of the ACR helium in the inner heliosphere, we advance our understanding of how the transport of the cosmic rays is affected by the particle drift effect and the large-scale magnetic field. The helium observations at Solar Orbiter/HET between 11.1 and 49 MeV/nuc are analyzed. Since we focus on quiet time measurements, we remove the periods of solar energetic particle (SEP) events. The intensities are averaged over the Carrington rotation period. The helium observations from the Proton and Helium Instrument(EPHIN)onboard SOHO were utilized as the baseline to correct the long-term variation caused by the solar modulations. We present the first observation of ACR helium at Solar Orbiter/HET between 2020 February and 2022 July in the inner heliosphere before the sun became fully active. We derive the radial gradient of the ACR helium between 0.3 and 1 au. The averaged radial gradient between 11.1 and 49MeV/nuc is about 22$\pm$4%/au and the averaged value between 11.1 and 41.2MeV/nuc is raised to 32$\pm$8%/au after removing the GCR contribution, which is estimated by a GCR model. In addition, the temporal variation of radial gradients indicates that the gradients are increasing with the enhancement of the solar modulation and the increased tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet.</description>

      <title>Investigating potential benefits of future sub-L1 missions with STEREO-A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first statistical study of geomagnetic storm forecasting using in situ data from the STEREO-A spacecraft as a sub-L1 monitor. Between November 2022 and June 2024, STEREO-A crossed the Sun-Earth line, covering longitudinal and radial separations of +/-15{\deg} from the Sun-Earth line and 0.01-0.06 au from Earth. This passage provides a unique opportunity to assess future sub-L1 mission concepts by ESA, such as HENON and SHIELD. We identify 32 coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed by both STEREO-A and L1 spacecraft. Eight of these 32 CME events are first detected at L1, indicating that radial spacecraft separations of up to ~0.05 au do not always yield lead time advantages. Furthermore, we find greater (smaller) gains in lead time when STEREO-A is east (west) of the Sun-Earth line. We develop a baseline methodology for the use of future sub-L1 in situ data to enable time-shifting and real-time modeling of the geomagnetic SYM-H index. This is run continuously over the entire time period, therefore modeling the geomagnetic response of all solar wind structures. Our methodology is empirically motivated and should be considered a first approach in addressing the use of sub-L1 data. Following this methodology, 26 of 47 observed geomagnetic storms are correctly identified from STEREO-A data. Intense events (82%, SYM-H&lt;-100 nT) are well detected, most of which are also associated with an identified CME event. Most SYM-H minima are predicted later (72%) and stronger (58%) than those observed due to biases introduced by our methodology.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits on QBER and Distance in Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) enables information-theoretic secure communication, yet its ultimate tolerance to noise and achievable transmission distance remain fundamentally constrained. We establish the maximum quantum bit error rate (QBER) compatible with secure QKD and derive corresponding upper bounds on communication distance. Our results follow from a fundamental capacity threshold for qubit Pauli channels and apply to protocols based on two or more mutually unbiased bases, using either single-photon or weak coherent sources. By connecting information-theoretic limits to realistic physical noise models, we obtain universal bounds on achievable distances in fiber and free-space links, including diffraction-limited constraints relevant to deep-space quantum communications. These findings clarify the ultimate noise robustness of QKD and delineate the fundamental boundaries of secure quantum communication.</description>

      <title>GIC--Related Observations During the May 2024 Geomagnetic Storm in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07009v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The May 2024 geomagnetic storm was one of the most severe in the past 20~years. Understanding how large geomagnetic disturbances (GMDs) impact geomagnetically induced currents (GICs) within electrical power grid networks is key to ensuring their resilience. We have assembled and synthesized a large and unique set of GMD-related data, compared model predictions with measurements, and identified empirical relationships for GICs in the contiguous United States for this storm. Measurement data include GIC data from $47$ sites and magnetometer data from $17$ sites. Model data include GIC computed by the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) power system operators at $4$ sites, GIC computed using a reference model at $47$ sites, and the difference in the surface magnetic field from a baseline ($\Delta \mathbf{B}$) computed at $12$ magnetometer sites from three global magnetospheric models -- the Multiscale Atmosphere-Geospace Environment Model (MAGE), Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF), and Open Geospace General Circulation Model (OpenGGCM). GIC measured and computed by TVA had a correlation coefficient $\text{r}&gt;0.8$ and a prediction efficiency between 0.4 and 0.7. The horizontal magnetic field perturbation from a baseline, $\Delta B_H$, computed by MAGE, SWMF, and OpenGGCM had a correlation r from $0.21$ to $0.65$. Two empirical relationships were considered: (1) how the correlation between measured GIC site pairs depended on differences in site separation distance, $\beta$ scaling factor (related to ground conductivity), and geomagnetic latitude; and (2) a regression model for the maximum $\mbox{GIC}$ magnitude at each site given the product of $\alpha$ (related to magnetic latitude) and $\beta$.</description>
