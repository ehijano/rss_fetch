      <title>Fair Quantitative Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine two-player games over finite weighted graphs with quantitative (mean-payoff or energy) objective, where one of the players additionally needs to satisfy a fairness objective. The specific fairness we consider is called 'strong transition fairness', given by a subset of edges of one of the players, which asks the player to take fair edges infinitely often if their source nodes are visited infinitely often.
  We show that when fairness is imposed on player 1, these games fall within the class of previously studied omega-regular mean-payoff and energy games. On the other hand, when the fairness is on player 2, to the best of our knowledge, these games have not been previously studied.
  We provide gadget-based algorithms for fair mean-payoff games where fairness is imposed on either player, and for fair energy games where the fairness is imposed on player 1. For all variants of fair mean-payoff and fair energy (under unknown initial credit) games, we give pseudo-polynomial algorithms to compute the winning regions of both players. Additionally, we analyze the strategy complexities required for these games. Our work is the first to extend the study of strong transition fairness, as well as gadget-based approaches, to the quantitative setting. We thereby demonstrate that the simplicity of strong transition fairness, as well as the applicability of gadget-based techniques, can be leveraged beyond the omega-regular domain.</description>

      <title>Optimal Utility Design with Arbitrary Information Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider multi-agent systems with general information networks where an agent may only observe a subset of other agents. A system designer assigns local utility functions to the agents guiding their actions towards an outcome which determines the value of a given system objective. The aim is to design these local utility functions such that the Price of Anarchy (PoA), which equals the ratio of system objective at worst possible outcome to that at the optimal, is maximized. Towards this, we first develop a linear program (LP) that characterizes the PoA for any utility design and any information network. This leads to another LP that optimizes the PoA and derives the optimal utility design. Our work substantially generalizes existing approaches to the utility design problem. We also numerically show the robustness of proposed framework against unanticipated communication failures.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Extensive-Form Game Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for translating game descriptions in natural language into extensive-form representations in game theory, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and in-context learning. Given the varying levels of strategic complexity in games, such as perfect versus imperfect information, directly applying in-context learning would be insufficient. To address this, we introduce a two-stage framework with specialized modules to enhance in-context learning, enabling it to divide and conquer the problem effectively. In the first stage, we tackle the challenge of imperfect information by developing a module that identifies information sets along and the corresponding partial tree structure. With this information, the second stage leverages in-context learning alongside a self-debugging module to produce a complete extensive-form game tree represented using pygambit, the Python API of a recognized game-theoretic analysis tool called Gambit. Using this python representation enables the automation of tasks such as computing Nash equilibria directly from natural language descriptions. We evaluate the performance of the full framework, as well as its individual components, using various LLMs on games with different levels of strategic complexity. Our experimental results show that the framework significantly outperforms baseline models in generating accurate extensive-form games, with each module playing a critical role in its success.</description>

      <title>Solving Urban Network Security Games: Learning Platform, Benchmark, and Challenge for AI Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the great achievement of solving two-player zero-sum games, more and more AI researchers focus on solving multiplayer games. To facilitate the development of designing efficient learning algorithms for solving multiplayer games, we propose a multiplayer game platform for solving Urban Network Security Games (\textbf{UNSG}) that model real-world scenarios. That is, preventing criminal activity is a highly significant responsibility assigned to police officers in cities, and police officers have to allocate their limited security resources to interdict the escaping criminal when a crime takes place in a city. This interaction between multiple police officers and the escaping criminal can be modeled as a UNSG. The variants of UNSGs can model different real-world settings, e.g., whether real-time information is available or not, and whether police officers can communicate or not. The main challenges of solving this game include the large size of the game and the co-existence of cooperation and competition. While previous efforts have been made to tackle UNSGs, they have been hampered by performance and scalability issues. Therefore, we propose an open-source UNSG platform (\textbf{GraphChase}) for designing efficient learning algorithms for solving UNSGs. Specifically, GraphChase offers a unified and flexible game environment for modeling various variants of UNSGs, supporting the development, testing, and benchmarking of algorithms. We believe that GraphChase not only facilitates the development of efficient algorithms for solving real-world problems but also paves the way for significant advancements in algorithmic development for solving general multiplayer games.</description>

      <title>Coalitional Control: Cooperative game theory and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of information and communication technologies has yielded the means of sharing measurements and other information in an efficient and flexible way, which has enabled the size and complexity of control applications to increase. At the same time, the improvements in the computational and communicational capabilities of control devices have fostered the development of noncentralized control architectures, already motivated by the inherent structural constraints of large-scale systems. Computer-based control approaches such as model predictive control (MPC) are visible beneficiaries of these advances and have registered a significant growth regarding both theoretical and applied fields. Coalitional control focuses on the local interests that motivate the controllers to assemble, an aspect so far rarely contemplated in the distributed control literature. This article presents the main concepts and challenges in coalitional control, and the links with cooperative network game theory.</description>

      <title>Coalitional control: a bottom-up approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent major developments in information technologies have opened interesting possibilities for the effective management of multi-agent systems. In many cases, the important role of central control nodes can now be undertaken by several controllers in a distributed topology that suits better the structure of the system. This opens as well the possibility to promote cooperation between control agents in competitive environments, establishing links between controllers in order to adapt the exchange of critical information to the degree of subsystems' interactions. In this paper a bottom-up approach to coalitional control is presented, where the structure of each agent's model predictive controller is adapted to the time-variant coupling conditions, promoting the formation of coalitions - clusters of control agents where communication is essential to ensure the cooperation - whenever it can bring benefit to the overall system performance.</description>

      <title>Nested Removal of Strictly Dominated Strategies in Infinite Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare two procedures for the iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies. In the nested procedure, a strategy of a player is removed only if it is dominated by an unremoved strategy. The universal procedure is more comprehensive for it allows the removal of strategies that are dominated by previously removed ones. Outside the class of finite games, the two procedures may lead to different outcomes in that the universal one is always order independent while the other is not. Here we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two procedures. The conditions we give are variations of the bounded mechanisms from the literature on full implementation. The two elimination procedures are shown to be equivalent in quasisupermodular games as well as in games with compact strategy spaces and upper semicontinuous payoff functions. We show by example that order independence of the nested procedure is not sufficient for its being equivalent to the universal one.</description>

      <title>Look-ahead Search on Top of Policy Networks in Imperfect Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search in test time is often used to improve the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms. Performing theoretically sound search in fully adversarial two-player games with imperfect information is notoriously difficult and requires a complicated training process. We present a method for adding test-time search to an arbitrary policy-gradient algorithm that learns from sampled trajectories. Besides the policy network, the algorithm trains an additional critic network, which estimates the expected values of players following various transformations of the policies given by the policy network. These values are then used for depth-limited search. We show how the values from this critic can create a value function for imperfect information games. Moreover, they can be used to compute the summary statistics necessary to start the search from an arbitrary decision point in the game. The presented algorithm is scalable to very large games since it does not require any search during train time. We evaluate the algorithm's performance when trained along Regularized Nash Dynamics, and we evaluate the benefit of using the search in the standard benchmark game of Leduc hold'em, multiple variants of imperfect information Goofspiel, and Battleships.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of No-Regret Dynamics in Information Retrieval Games with Proportional Ranking Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11517v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Publishers who publish their content on the web act strategically, in a behavior that can be modeled within the online learning framework. Regret, a central concept in machine learning, serves as a canonical measure for assessing the performance of learning agents within this framework. We prove that any proportional content ranking function with a concave activation function induces games in which no-regret learning dynamics converge. Moreover, for proportional ranking functions, we prove the equivalence of the concavity of the activation function, the social concavity of the induced games and the concavity of the induced games. We also study the empirical trade-offs between publishers' and users' welfare, under different choices of the activation function, using a state-of-the-art no-regret dynamics algorithm. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the choice of the ranking function and changes in the ecosystem structure affect these welfare measures, as well as the dynamics' convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Interference Among First-Price Pacing Equilibria: A Bias and Variance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online A/B testing is widely used in the internet industry to inform decisions on new feature roll-outs. For online marketplaces (such as advertising markets), standard approaches to A/B testing may lead to biased results when buyers operate under a budget constraint, as budget consumption in one arm of the experiment impacts performance of the other arm. To counteract this interference, one can use a budget-split design where the budget constraint operates on a per-arm basis and each arm receives an equal fraction of the budget, leading to ``budget-controlled A/B testing.'' Despite clear advantages of budget-controlled A/B testing, performance degrades when budget are split too small, limiting the overall throughput of such systems. In this paper, we propose a parallel budget-controlled A/B testing design where we use market segmentation to identify submarkets in the larger market, and we run parallel experiments on each submarket.
  Our contributions are as follows: First, we introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of the parallel budget-controlled A/B test design with submarkets in a large online marketplace environment. Second, we formally define market interference in first-price auction markets using the first price pacing equilibrium (FPPE) framework. Third, we propose a debiased surrogate that eliminates the first-order bias of FPPE, drawing upon the principles of sensitivity analysis in mathematical programs. Fourth, we derive a plug-in estimator for the surrogate and establish its asymptotic normality. Fifth, we provide an estimation procedure for submarket parallel budget-controlled A/B tests. Finally, we present numerical examples on semi-synthetic data, confirming that the debiasing technique achieves the desired coverage properties.</description>

      <title>AdaSociety: An Adaptive Environment with Social Structures for Multi-Agent Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03865v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional interactive environments limit agents' intelligence growth with fixed tasks. Recently, single-agent environments address this by generating new tasks based on agent actions, enhancing task diversity. We consider the decision-making problem in multi-agent settings, where tasks are further influenced by social connections, affecting rewards and information access. However, existing multi-agent environments lack a combination of adaptive physical surroundings and social connections, hindering the learning of intelligent behaviors. To address this, we introduce AdaSociety, a customizable multi-agent environment featuring expanding state and action spaces, alongside explicit and alterable social structures. As agents progress, the environment adaptively generates new tasks with social structures for agents to undertake. In AdaSociety, we develop three mini-games showcasing distinct social structures and tasks. Initial results demonstrate that specific social structures can promote both individual and collective benefits, though current reinforcement learning and LLM-based algorithms show limited effectiveness in leveraging social structures to enhance performance. Overall, AdaSociety serves as a valuable research platform for exploring intelligence in diverse physical and social settings. The code is available at https://github.com/bigai-ai/AdaSociety.</description>
