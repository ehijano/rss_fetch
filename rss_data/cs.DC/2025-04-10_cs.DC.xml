      <title>Parallel GPU-Enabled Algorithms for SpGEMM on Arbitrary Semirings with Hybrid Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse General Matrix Multiply (SpGEMM) is key for various High-Performance Computing (HPC) applications such as genomics and graph analytics. Using the semiring abstraction, many algorithms can be formulated as SpGEMM, allowing redefinition of addition, multiplication, and numeric types. Today large input matrices require distributed memory parallelism to avoid disk I/O, and modern HPC machines with GPUs can greatly accelerate linear algebra computation. In this paper, we implement a GPU-based distributed-memory SpGEMM routine on top of the CombBLAS library. Our implementation achieves a speedup of over 2x compared to the CPU-only CombBLAS implementation and up to 3x compared to PETSc for large input matrices. Furthermore, we note that communication between processes can be optimized by either direct host-to-host or device-to-device communication, depending on the message size. To exploit this, we introduce a hybrid communication scheme that dynamically switches data paths depending on the message size, thus improving runtimes in communication-bound scenarios.</description>

      <title>ICPS: Real-Time Resource Configuration for Cloud Serverless Functions Considering Affinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serverless computing, with its operational simplicity and on-demand scalability, has become a preferred paradigm for deploying workflow applications. However, resource allocation for workflows, particularly those with branching structures, is complicated by cold starts and network delays between dependent functions, significantly degrading execution efficiency and response times. In this paper, we propose the Invocation Concurrency Prediction-Based Scaling (ICPS) algorithm to address these challenges. ICPS employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict function concurrency, dynamically pre-warming function instances, and an affinity-based deployment strategy to co-locate dependent functions on the same worker node, minimizing network latency. The experimental results demonstrate that ICPS consistently outperforms existing approaches in diverse scenarios. The results confirm ICPS as a robust and scalable solution for optimizing serverless workflow execution.</description>

      <title>Buffer Centering for bittide Synchronization via Frame Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maintaining consistent time in distributed systems is a fundamental challenge. The bittide system addresses this by providing logical synchronization through a decentralized control mechanism that observes local buffer occupancies and controls the frequency of an oscillator at each node. A critical aspect of bittide's stability and performance is ensuring that these elastic buffers operate around a desired equilibrium point, preventing data loss due to overflow or underflow. This paper introduces a novel method for centering buffer occupancies in a bittide network using a technique we term frame rotation. We propose a control strategy utilizing a directed spanning tree of the network graph. By adjusting the frequencies of nodes in a specific order dictated by this tree, and employing a pulsed feedback controller that targets the buffer occupancy of edges within the spanning tree, we prove that all elastic buffers in the network can be driven to their desired equilibrium. This ordered adjustment approach ensures that prior centering efforts are not disrupted, providing a robust mechanism for managing buffer occupancy in bittide synchronized systems.</description>

      <title>Federated Neural Architecture Search with Model-Agnostic Meta Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often struggles with data heterogeneity due to the naturally uneven distribution of user data across devices. Federated Neural Architecture Search (NAS) enables collaborative search for optimal model architectures tailored to heterogeneous data to achieve higher accuracy. However, this process is time-consuming due to extensive search space and retraining. To overcome this, we introduce FedMetaNAS, a framework that integrates meta-learning with NAS within the FL context to expedite the architecture search by pruning the search space and eliminating the retraining stage. Our approach first utilizes the Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization to facilitate relaxation of the mixed operations in the search space. We then refine the local search process by incorporating Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning, where a task-specific learner adapts both weights and architecture parameters (alphas) for individual tasks, while a meta learner adjusts the overall model weights and alphas based on the gradient information from task learners. Following the meta-update, we propose soft pruning using the same trick on search space to gradually sparsify the architecture, ensuring that the performance of the chosen architecture remains robust after pruning which allows for immediate use of the model without retraining. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FedMetaNAS significantly accelerates the search process by more than 50\% with higher accuracy compared to FedNAS.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Error-Bounded Lossy Compression for Scientific Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been effective in significantly reducing the data storage/transfer burden while preserving the reconstructed data fidelity very well. Many error-bounded lossy compressors have been developed for a wide range of parallel and distributed use cases for years. They are designed with distinct compression models and principles, such that each of them features particular pros and cons. In this paper we provide a comprehensive survey of emerging error-bounded lossy compression techniques. The key contribution is fourfold. (1) We summarize a novel taxonomy of lossy compression into 6 classic models. (2) We provide a comprehensive survey of 10 commonly used compression components/modules. (3) We summarized pros and cons of 46 state-of-the-art lossy compressors and present how state-of-the-art compressors are designed based on different compression techniques. (4) We discuss how customized compressors are designed for specific scientific applications and use-cases. We believe this survey is useful to multiple communities including scientific applications, high-performance computing, lossy compression, and big data.</description>

      <title>MoC-System: Efficient Fault Tolerance for Sparse Mixture-of-Experts Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As large language models continue to scale up, distributed training systems have expanded beyond 10k nodes, intensifying the importance of fault tolerance. Checkpoint has emerged as the predominant fault tolerance strategy, with extensive studies dedicated to optimizing its efficiency. However, the advent of the sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model presents new challenges due to the substantial increase in model size, despite comparable computational demands to dense models.
  In this work, we propose the Mixture-of-Checkpoint System (MoC-System) to orchestrate the vast array of checkpoint shards produced in distributed training systems. MoC-System features a novel Partial Experts Checkpointing (PEC) mechanism, an algorithm-system co-design that strategically saves a selected subset of experts, effectively reducing the MoE checkpoint size to levels comparable with dense models. Incorporating hybrid parallel strategies, MoC-System involves fully sharded checkpointing strategies to evenly distribute the workload across distributed ranks. Furthermore, MoC-System introduces a two-level checkpointing management method that asynchronously handles in-memory snapshots and persistence processes.
  We build MoC-System upon the Megatron-DeepSpeed framework, achieving up to a 98.9% reduction in overhead for each checkpointing process compared to the original method, during MoE model training with ZeRO-2 data parallelism and expert parallelism. Additionally, extensive empirical analyses substantiate that our methods enhance efficiency while maintaining comparable model accuracy, even achieving an average accuracy increase of 1.08% on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Orchestrate Multimodal Data with Batch Post-Balancing to Accelerate Multimodal Large Language Model Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as GPT-4o, are garnering significant attention. During the exploration of MLLM training, we identified Modality Composition Incoherence, a phenomenon that the proportion of a certain modality varies dramatically across different examples. It exacerbates the challenges of addressing mini-batch imbalances, which lead to uneven GPU utilization between Data Parallel (DP) instances and severely degrades the efficiency and scalability of MLLM training, ultimately affecting training speed and hindering further research on MLLMs.
  To address these challenges, we introduce OrchMLLM, a comprehensive framework designed to mitigate the inefficiencies in MLLM training caused by Modality Composition Incoherence. First, we propose Batch Post-Balancing Dispatcher, a technique that efficiently eliminates mini-batch imbalances in sequential data. Additionally, we integrate MLLM Global Orchestrator into the training framework to orchestrate multimodal data and tackle the issues arising from Modality Composition Incoherence. We evaluate OrchMLLM across various MLLM sizes, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability. Experimental results reveal that OrchMLLM achieves a Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) of $41.6\%$ when training an 84B MLLM with three modalities on $2560$ H100 GPUs, outperforming Megatron-LM by up to $3.1\times$ in throughput.</description>

      <title>Towards Federated RLHF with Aggregated Client Preference for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03038v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) fine-tunes a pretrained large language model (LLM) using user preference data, enabling it to generate content aligned with human preferences. However, due to privacy concerns, users may be reluctant to share sensitive preference data. To address this, we propose utilizing Federated Learning (FL) techniques, allowing large-scale preference collection from diverse real-world users without requiring them to transmit data to a central server. Our federated RLHF methods (i.e., FedBis and FedBiscuit) encode each client's preferences into binary selectors and aggregate them to capture common preferences. In particular, FedBiscuit overcomes key challenges, such as preference heterogeneity and reward hacking, through innovative solutions like grouping clients with similar preferences to reduce heterogeneity and using multiple binary selectors to enhance LLM output quality. To evaluate the performance of the proposed methods, we establish the first federated RLHF benchmark with a heterogeneous human preference dataset. Experimental results show that by integrating the LLM with aggregated client preferences, FedBis and FedBiscuit significantly enhance the professionalism and readability of the generated content.</description>

      <title>PARDON: Privacy-Aware and Robust Federated Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) shows promise in preserving privacy and enabling collaborative learning. However, most current solutions focus on private data collected from a single domain. A significant challenge arises when client data comes from diverse domains (i.e., domain shift), leading to poor performance on unseen domains. Existing Federated Domain Generalization approaches address this problem but assume each client holds data for an entire domain, limiting their practicality in real-world scenarios with domain-based heterogeneity and client sampling. In addition, certain methods enable information sharing among clients, raising privacy concerns as this information could be used to reconstruct sensitive private data.
  To overcome this, we introduce FISC, a novel FedDG paradigm designed to robustly handle more complicated domain distributions between clients while ensuring security. FISC enables learning across domains by extracting an interpolative style from local styles and employing contrastive learning. This strategy gives clients multi-domain representations and unbiased convergent targets. Empirical results on multiple datasets, including PACS, Office-Home, and IWildCam, show FISC outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our method achieves accuracy on unseen domains, with improvements ranging from 3.64% to 57.22% on unseen domains. Our code is available at https://github.com/judydnguyen/PARDON-FedDG.</description>

      <title>Corrected with the Latest Version: Make Robust Asynchronous Federated Learning Possible</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As an emerging paradigm of federated learning, asynchronous federated learning offers significant speed advantages over traditional synchronous federated learning. Unlike synchronous federated learning, which requires waiting for all clients to complete updates before aggregation, asynchronous federated learning aggregates the models that have arrived in realtime, greatly improving training speed. However, this mechanism also introduces the issue of client model version inconsistency. When the differences between models of different versions during aggregation become too large, it may lead to conflicts, thereby reducing the models accuracy. To address this issue, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning version correction algorithm based on knowledge distillation, named FedADT. FedADT applies knowledge distillation before aggregating gradients, using the latest global model to correct outdated information, thus effectively reducing the negative impact of outdated gradients on the training process. Additionally, FedADT introduces an adaptive weighting function that adjusts the knowledge distillation weight according to different stages of training, helps mitigate the misleading effects caused by the poorer performance of the global model in the early stages of training. This method significantly improves the overall performance of asynchronous federated learning without adding excessive computational overhead. We conducted experimental comparisons with several classical algorithms, and the results demonstrate that FedADT achieves significant improvements over other asynchronous methods and outperforms all methods in terms of convergence speed.</description>
