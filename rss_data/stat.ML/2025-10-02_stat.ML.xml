      <title>Private Realizable-to-Agnostic Transformation with Near-Optimal Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realizable-to-agnostic transformation (Beimel et al., 2015; Alon et al., 2020) provides a general mechanism to convert a private learner in the realizable setting (where the examples are labeled by some function in the concept class) to a private learner in the agnostic setting (where no assumptions are imposed on the data). Specifically, for any concept class $\mathcal{C}$ and error parameter $\alpha$, a private realizable learner for $\mathcal{C}$ can be transformed into a private agnostic learner while only increasing the sample complexity by $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$, which is essentially tight assuming a constant privacy parameter $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. However, when $\varepsilon$ can be arbitrary, one has to apply the standard privacy-amplification-by-subsampling technique (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011), resulting in a suboptimal extra sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2\varepsilon)$ that involves a $1/\varepsilon$ factor.
  In this work, we give an improved construction that eliminates the dependence on $\varepsilon$, thereby achieving a near-optimal extra sample complexity of $\widetilde{O}(\mathrm{VC}(\mathcal{C})/\alpha^2)$ for any $\varepsilon\le 1$. Moreover, our result reveals that in private agnostic learning, the privacy cost is only significant for the realizable part. We also leverage our technique to obtain a nearly tight sample complexity bound for the private prediction problem, resolving an open question posed by Dwork and Feldman (2018) and Dagan and Feldman (2020).</description>

      <title>Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion model for Categorical Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard discrete diffusion models treat all unobserved states identically by mapping them to an absorbing [MASK] token. This creates an 'information void' where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion (CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage (generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise outputs) behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate CADD improves generative quality over mask-based diffusion across text generation, image synthesis, and code modeling, with consistent gains on both qualitative and quantitative metrics against strong discrete baselines.</description>

      <title>Risk Phase Transitions in Spiked Regression: Alignment Driven Benign and Catastrophic Overfitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the generalization error of minimum-norm interpolating solutions in linear regression using spiked covariance data models. The paper characterizes how varying spike strengths and target-spike alignments can affect risk, especially in overparameterized settings. The study presents an exact expression for the generalization error, leading to a comprehensive classification of benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting regimes based on spike strength, the aspect ratio $c=d/n$ (particularly as $c \to \infty$), and target alignment. Notably, in well-specified aligned problems, increasing spike strength can surprisingly induce catastrophic overfitting before achieving benign overfitting. The paper also reveals that target-spike alignment is not always advantageous, identifying specific, sometimes counterintuitive, conditions for its benefit or detriment. Alignment with the spike being detrimental is empirically demonstrated to persist in nonlinear models.</description>

      <title>AI Foundation Model for Time Series with Innovations Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an Artificial Intelligence (AI) foundation model for time series in engineering applications, where causal operations are required for real-time monitoring and control. Since engineering time series are governed by physical, rather than linguistic, laws, large-language-model-based AI foundation models may be ineffective or inefficient. Building on the classical innovations representation theory of Wiener, Kallianpur, and Rosenblatt, we propose Time Series GPT (TS-GPT) -- an innovations-representation-based Generative Pre-trained Transformer for engineering monitoring and control. As an example of foundation model adaptation, we consider Probabilistic Generative Forecasting, which produces future time series samples from conditional probability distributions given past realizations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TS-GPT in forecasting real-time locational marginal prices using historical data from U.S. independent system operators.</description>

      <title>A reproducible comparative study of categorical kernels for Gaussian process regression, with new clustering-based nested kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing categorical kernels is a major challenge for Gaussian process regression with continuous and categorical inputs. Despite previous studies, it is difficult to identify a preferred method, either because the evaluation metrics, the optimization procedure, or the datasets change depending on the study. In particular, reproducible code is rarely available. The aim of this paper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing categorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also propose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which provide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our results on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of categorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform all competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior knowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using target encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of datasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this estimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Deep Hedging Under Non-Convexity: Limitations and a Case for AlphaZero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines replication portfolio construction in incomplete markets - a key problem in financial engineering with applications in pricing, hedging, balance sheet management, and energy storage planning. We model this as a two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the $Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations - converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in data-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.</description>

      <title>Precise Dynamics of Diagonal Linear Networks: A Unifying Analysis by Dynamical Mean-Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagonal linear networks (DLNs) are a tractable model that captures several nontrivial behaviors in neural network training, such as initialization-dependent solutions and incremental learning. These phenomena are typically studied in isolation, leaving the overall dynamics insufficiently understood. In this work, we present a unified analysis of various phenomena in the gradient flow dynamics of DLNs. Using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT), we derive a low-dimensional effective process that captures the asymptotic gradient flow dynamics in high dimensions. Analyzing this effective process yields new insights into DLN dynamics, including loss convergence rates and their trade-off with generalization, and systematically reproduces many of the previously observed phenomena. These findings deepen our understanding of DLNs and demonstrate the effectiveness of the DMFT approach in analyzing high-dimensional learning dynamics of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Uniform-in-time convergence bounds for Persistent Contrastive Divergence Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a continuous-time formulation of persistent contrastive divergence (PCD) for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of unnormalised densities. Our approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously.
  From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter. This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced, leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Kernel Selection for Stein Variational Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in Bayesian inference is efficiently approximating posterior distributions. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular variational inference method which transports a set of particles to approximate a target distribution. The SVGD dynamics are governed by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and are highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel function, which directly influences both convergence and approximation quality. The commonly used median heuristic offers a simple approach for setting kernel bandwidths but lacks flexibility and often performs poorly, particularly in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for adaptively choosing kernel parameters over an abstract family of kernels. Recent convergence analyses based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD) suggest that optimizing the kernel parameters by maximizing the KSD can improve performance. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a method that alternates between updating the particles via SVGD and adaptively tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on the KSD. We provide a simplified theoretical analysis that extends existing results on minimizing the KSD for fixed kernels to our adaptive setting, showing convergence properties for the maximal KSD over our kernel class. Our empirical results further support this intuition: Ad-SVGD consistently outperforms standard heuristics in a variety of tasks.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Data Augmentation for Precision Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting. For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Physics-ML Framework for Pan-Arctic Permafrost Infrastructure Risk at Record 2.9-Million Observation Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arctic warming threatens over 100 billion in permafrost-dependent infrastructure across Northern territories, yet existing risk assessment frameworks lack spatiotemporal validation, uncertainty quantification, and operational decision-support capabilities. We present a hybrid physics-machine learning framework integrating 2.9 million observations from 171,605 locations (2005-2021) combining permafrost fraction data with climate reanalysis. Our stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Histogram Gradient Boosting + Elastic Net) achieves R2=0.980 (RMSE=5.01 pp) with rigorous spatiotemporal cross-validation preventing data leakage. To address machine learning limitations in extrapolative climate scenarios, we develop a hybrid approach combining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physical permafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over 10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median: -20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage point loss. Infrastructure risk classification identifies 15% high-risk zones (25% medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty maps. Our framework represents the largest validated permafrost ML dataset globally, provides the first operational hybrid physics-ML forecasting system for Arctic infrastructure, and delivers open-source tools enabling probabilistic permafrost projections for engineering design codes and climate adaptation planning. The methodology is generalizable to other permafrost regions and demonstrates how hybrid approaches can overcome pure data-driven limitations in climate change applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Probabilistic Visualization of Local Divergence of 2D Vector Fields with Independent Gaussian Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on visualizing uncertainty of local divergence of two-dimensional vector fields. Divergence is one of the fundamental attributes of fluid flows, as it can help domain scientists analyze potential positions of sources (positive divergence) and sinks (negative divergence) in the flow. However, uncertainty inherent in vector field data can lead to erroneous divergence computations, adversely impacting downstream analysis. While Monte Carlo (MC) sampling is a classical approach for estimating divergence uncertainty, it suffers from slow convergence and poor scalability with increasing data size and sample counts. Thus, we present a two-fold contribution that tackles the challenges of slow convergence and limited scalability of the MC approach. (1) We derive a closed-form approach for highly efficient and accurate uncertainty visualization of local divergence, assuming independently Gaussian-distributed vector uncertainties. (2) We further integrate our approach into Viskores, a platform-portable parallel library, to accelerate uncertainty visualization. In our results, we demonstrate significantly enhanced efficiency and accuracy of our serial analytical (speed-up up to 1946X) and parallel Viskores (speed-up up to 19698X) algorithms over the classical serial MC approach. We also demonstrate qualitative improvements of our probabilistic divergence visualizations over traditional mean-field visualization, which disregards uncertainty. We validate the accuracy and efficiency of our methods on wind forecast and ocean simulation datasets.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Summarization via Uncertainty Quantification and Risk Awareness in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the reliability of automatic summarization in high-risk scenarios and proposes a large language model framework that integrates uncertainty quantification and risk-aware mechanisms. Starting from the demands of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts. Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity. This research provides a systematic solution for trustworthy summarization and demonstrates both scalability and practical value at the methodological level.</description>

      <title>Efficient Uncertainty Estimation for LLM-based Entity Linking in Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linking textual values in tabular data to their corresponding entities in a Knowledge Base is a core task across a variety of data integration and enrichment applications. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown State-of-The-Art performance in Entity Linking (EL) tasks, their deployment in real-world scenarios requires not only accurate predictions but also reliable uncertainty estimates, which require resource-demanding multi-shot inference, posing serious limits to their actual applicability. As a more efficient alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows. The method offers a practical way to incorporate uncertainty estimation into EL workflows with limited computational overhead.</description>

      <title>AdaDetectGPT: Adaptive Detection of LLM-Generated Text with Statistical Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.</description>

      <title>Safe Reinforcement Learning-Based Vibration Control: Overcoming Training Risks with LQR Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks, including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification. This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However, during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.</description>

      <title>Low Rank Gradients and Where to Find Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates low-rank structure in the gradients of the training loss for two-layer neural networks while relaxing the usual isotropy assumptions on the training data and parameters. We consider a spiked data model in which the bulk can be anisotropic and ill-conditioned, we do not require independent data and weight matrices and we also analyze both the mean-field and neural-tangent-kernel scalings. We show that the gradient with respect to the input weights is approximately low rank and is dominated by two rank-one terms: one aligned with the bulk data-residue , and another aligned with the rank one spike in the input data. We characterize how properties of the training data, the scaling regime and the activation function govern the balance between these two components. Additionally, we also demonstrate that standard regularizers, such as weight decay, input noise and Jacobian penalties, also selectively modulate these components. Experiments on synthetic and real data corroborate our theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>On the Identifiability of Latent Action Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the identifiability of latent action policy learning (LAPO), a framework introduced recently to discover representations of actions from video data. We formally describe desiderata for such representations, their statistical benefits and potential sources of unidentifiability. Finally, we prove that an entropy-regularized LAPO objective identifies action representations satisfying our desiderata, under suitable conditions. Our analysis provides an explanation for why discrete action representations perform well in practice.</description>

      <title>LVTINO: LAtent Video consisTency INverse sOlver for High Definition Video Restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational imaging methods increasingly rely on powerful generative diffusion models to tackle challenging image restoration tasks. In particular, state-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled text-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy and perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending these advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant challenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing subtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply image-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally inconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent diffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal causality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot or plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with priors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for automatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong measurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames. Extensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show significant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that apply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both reconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>To Augment or Not to Augment? Diagnosing Distributional Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-aware methods for machine learning, such as data augmentation and equivariant architectures, encourage correct model behavior on all transformations (e.g. rotations or permutations) of the original dataset. These methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or "important", under the test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets, and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent: equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for M-posteriors: frequentist guarantees and robustness properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework for a wide class of generalized posteriors that can be viewed as the natural Bayesian posterior counterpart of the class of M-estimators in the frequentist world. We call the members of this class M-posteriors and show that they are asymptotically normally distributed under mild conditions on the M-estimation loss and the prior. In particular, an M-posterior contracts in probability around a normal distribution centered at an M-estimator, showing frequentist consistency and suggesting some degree of robustness depending on the reference M-estimator. We formalize the robustness properties of the M-posteriors by a new characterization of the posterior influence function and a novel definition of breakdown point adapted for posterior distributions. We illustrate the wide applicability of our theory in various popular models and illustrate their empirical relevance in some numerical examples.</description>

      <title>DiffKnock: Diffusion-based Knockoff Statistics for Neural Networks Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce DiffKnock, a diffusion-based knockoff framework for high-dimensional feature selection with finite-sample false discovery rate (FDR) control. DiffKnock addresses two key limitations of existing knockoff methods: preserving complex feature dependencies and detecting non-linear associations. Our approach trains diffusion models to generate valid knockoffs and uses neural network--based gradient and filter statistics to construct antisymmetric feature importance measures. Through simulations, we showed that DiffKnock achieved higher power than autoencoder-based knockoffs while maintaining target FDR, indicating its superior performance in scenarios involving complex non-linear architectures. Applied to murine single-cell RNA-seq data of LPS-stimulated macrophages, DiffKnock identifies canonical NF-$\kappa$B target genes (Ccl3, Hmox1) and regulators (Fosb, Pdgfb). These results highlight that, by combining the flexibility of deep generative models with rigorous statistical guarantees, DiffKnock is a powerful and reliable tool for analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data, as well as high-dimensional and structured data in other domains.</description>

      <title>Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.</description>

      <title>Scalable Asynchronous Federated Modeling for Spatial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial data are central to applications such as environmental monitoring and urban planning, but are often distributed across devices where privacy and communication constraints limit direct sharing. Federated modeling offers a practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely, high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments. This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior robustness and scalability.</description>

      <title>Predictively Oriented Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for a new statistical principle that combines the most desirable aspects of both parameter inference and density estimation. This leads us to the predictively oriented (PrO) posterior, which expresses uncertainty as a consequence of predictive ability. Doing so leads to inferences which predictively dominate both classical and generalised Bayes posterior predictive distributions: up to logarithmic factors, PrO posteriors converge to the predictively optimal model average at rate $n^{-1/2}$. Whereas classical and generalised Bayes posteriors only achieve this rate if the model can recover the data-generating process, PrO posteriors adapt to the level of model misspecification. This means that they concentrate around the true model at rate $n^{1/2}$ in the same way as Bayes and Gibbs posteriors if the model can recover the data-generating distribution, but do \textit{not} concentrate in the presence of non-trivial forms of model misspecification. Instead, they stabilise towards a predictively optimal posterior whose degree of irreducible uncertainty admits an interpretation as the degree of model misspecification -- a sharp contrast to how Bayesian uncertainty and its existing extensions behave. Lastly, we show that PrO posteriors can be sampled from by evolving particles based on mean field Langevin dynamics, and verify the practical significance of our theoretical developments on a number of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounds on Adversarial Robustness for Multiclass Classification with General Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider adversarially robust classification in a multiclass setting under arbitrary loss functions and derive dual and barycentric reformulations of the corresponding learner-agnostic robust risk minimization problem. We provide explicit characterizations for important cases such as the cross-entropy loss, loss functions with a power form, and the quadratic loss, extending in this way available results for the 0-1 loss. These reformulations enable efficient computation of sharp lower bounds for adversarial risks and facilitate the design of robust classifiers beyond the 0-1 loss setting. Our paper uncovers interesting connections between adversarial robustness, $\alpha$-fair packing problems, and generalized barycenter problems for arbitrary positive measures where Kullback-Leibler and Tsallis entropies are used as penalties. Our theoretical results are accompanied with illustrative numerical experiments where we obtain tighter lower bounds for adversarial risks with the cross-entropy loss function.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Heterogeneous Mixtures of Normalising Flows for Robust Variational Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Normalising-flow variational inference (VI) can approximate complex posteriors, yet single-flow models often behave inconsistently across qualitatively different distributions. We propose Adaptive Mixture Flow Variational Inference (AMF-VI), a heterogeneous mixture of complementary flows (MAF, RealNVP, RBIG) trained in two stages: (i) sequential expert training of individual flows, and (ii) adaptive global weight estimation via likelihood-driven updates, without per-sample gating or architectural changes. Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons, rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD), indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.</description>

      <title>Inferring Optical Tissue Properties from Photoplethysmography using Hybrid Amortized Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smart wearables enable continuous tracking of established biomarkers such as heart rate, heart rate variability, and blood oxygen saturation via photoplethysmography (PPG). Beyond these metrics, PPG waveforms contain richer physiological information, as recent deep learning (DL) studies demonstrate. However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning, creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters. Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast, robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.</description>

      <title>Ensemble Threshold Calibration for Stable Sensitivity Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise recall control is critical in large-scale spatial conflation and entity-matching tasks, where missing even a few true matches can break downstream analytics, while excessive manual review inflates cost. Classical confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly. Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys, Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting, then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Action-Triggered Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\widetilde O(\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the feature dimension, and $\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation constraints.</description>

      <title>Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks, in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to significantly flatter minima.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Transformers for Imputation: Statistical Efficiency and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently, diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches. Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Generating Correlated Sample Paths from Multi-step Time Series Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Drop-Muon: Update Less, Converge Faster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom in deep learning optimization dictates updating all layers at every step-a principle followed by all recent state-of-the-art optimizers such as Muon. In this work, we challenge this assumption, showing that full-network updates can be fundamentally suboptimal, both in theory and in practice. We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\times$ faster in wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.</description>

      <title>Test-Time Anchoring for Discrete Diffusion Posterior Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of posterior sampling using pretrained discrete diffusion foundation models, aiming to recover images from noisy measurements without retraining task-specific models. While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models and the Manifold Hypothesis: Log-Domain Smoothing is Geometry Adaptive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating remarkable generalisation capabilities across diverse domains. However, the mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of online algorithms for vector-valued kernel regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07779v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the regression function $f_\mu:\, \Omega \to Y$ from noisy $\mu$-distributed vector-valued data $(\omega_m,y_m)\in\Omega\times Y$ by an online learning algorithm using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space $H$ (RKHS) as prior. In an online algorithm, i.i.d. samples become available one by one via a random process and are successively processed to build approximations to the regression function. Assuming that the regression function essentially belongs to $H$ (soft learning scenario), we provide estimates for the expected squared error in the RKHS norm of the approximations $f^{(m)}\in H$ obtained by a standard regularized online approximation algorithm. In particular, we show an order-optimal estimate $$ \mathbb{E}(\|\epsilon^{(m)}\|_H^2)\le C (m+1)^{-s/(2+s)},\qquad m=1,2,\ldots, $$ where $\epsilon^{(m)}$ denotes the error term after $m$ processed data, the parameter $0&lt;s\leq 1$ expresses an additional smoothness assumption on the regression function, and the constant $C$ depends on the variance of the input noise, the smoothness of the regression function, and other parameters of the algorithm. The proof, which is inspired by results on Schwarz iterative methods in the noiseless case, uses only elementary Hilbert space techniques and minimal assumptions on the noise, the feature map that defines $H$ and the associated covariance operator.</description>

Abstract: Finding the parameters of a latent variable causal model is central to causal inference and causal identification. In this article, we show that existing graphical structures that are used in causal inference are not stable under marginalization of Gaussian Bayesian networks, and present a graphical structure that faithfully represent margins of Gaussian Bayesian networks. We present the first duality between parameter optimization of a latent variable model and training a feed-forward neural network in the parameter space of the assumed family of distributions. Based on this observation, we develop an algorithm for parameter optimization of these graphical structures based on a given observational distribution. Then, we provide conditions for causal effect identifiability in the Gaussian setting. We propose an meta-algorithm that checks whether a causal effect is identifiable or not. Moreover, we lay a grounding for generalizing the duality between a neural network and a causal model from the Gaussian to other distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformers have a remarkable ability to learn and execute tasks based on examples provided within the input itself, without explicit prior training. It has been argued that this capability, known as in-context learning (ICL), is a cornerstone of Transformers' success, yet questions about the necessary sample complexity, pretraining task diversity, and context length for successful ICL remain unresolved. Here, we provide a precise answer to these questions in an exactly solvable model of ICL of a linear regression task by linear attention. We derive sharp asymptotics for the learning curve in a phenomenologically-rich scaling regime where the token dimension is taken to infinity; the context length and pretraining task diversity scale proportionally with the token dimension; and the number of pretraining examples scales quadratically. We demonstrate a double-descent learning curve with increasing pretraining examples, and uncover a phase transition in the model's behavior between low and high task diversity regimes: In the low diversity regime, the model tends toward memorization of training tasks, whereas in the high diversity regime, it achieves genuine in-context learning and generalization beyond the scope of pretrained tasks. These theoretical insights are empirically validated through experiments with both linear attention and full nonlinear Transformer architectures.</description>

      <title>Policy-Oriented Binary Classification: Improving (KD-)CART Final Splits for Subpopulation Targeting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Policymakers often use recursive binary split rules to partition populations based on binary outcomes and target subpopulations whose probability of the binary event exceeds a threshold. We call such problems Latent Probability Classification (LPC). Practitioners typically employ Classification and Regression Trees (CART) for LPC. We prove that in the context of LPC, classic CART and the knowledge distillation method, whose student model is a CART (referred to as KD-CART), are suboptimal. We propose Maximizing Distance Final Split (MDFS), which generates split rules that strictly dominate CART/KD-CART under the unique intersect assumption. MDFS identifies the unique best split rule, is consistent, and targets more vulnerable subpopulations than CART/KD-CART. To relax the unique intersect assumption, we additionally propose Penalized Final Split (PFS) and weighted Empirical risk Final Split (wEFS). Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed methods predominantly outperform CART/KD-CART. When applied to real-world datasets, MDFS generates policies that target more vulnerable subpopulations than the CART/KD-CART.</description>

      <title>Golden Ratio Weighting Prevents Model Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies identified an intriguing phenomenon in recursive generative model training known as model collapse, where models trained on data generated by previous models exhibit severe performance degradation. Addressing this issue and developing more effective training strategies have become central challenges in generative model research. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon within a novel framework, where generative models are iteratively trained on a combination of newly collected real data and synthetic data from the previous training step. To develop an optimal training strategy for integrating real and synthetic data, we evaluate the performance of a weighted training scheme in various scenarios, including Gaussian distribution estimation, generalized linear models, and nonparametric estimation. We theoretically characterize the impact of the mixing proportion and weighting scheme of synthetic data on the final model's performance. Our key finding is that, across different settings, the optimal weighting scheme under different proportions of synthetic data asymptotically follows a unified expression, revealing a fundamental trade-off between leveraging synthetic data and model performance. In some cases, the optimal weight assigned to real data corresponds to the reciprocal of the golden ratio. Finally, we validate our theoretical results on extensive simulated datasets and a real tabular dataset.</description>

      <title>Online Multivariate Regularized Distributional Regression for High-dimensional Probabilistic Electricity Price Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic electricity price forecasting (PEPF) is vital for short-term electricity markets, yet the multivariate nature of day-ahead prices - spanning 24 consecutive hours - remains underexplored. At the same time, real-time decision-making requires methods that are both accurate and fast. We introduce an online algorithm for multivariate distributional regression models, allowing an efficient modelling of the conditional means, variances, and dependence structures of electricity prices. The approach combines multivariate distributional regression with online coordinate descent and LASSO-type regularization, enabling scalable estimation in high-dimensional covariate spaces. Additionally, we propose a regularized estimation path over increasingly complex dependence structures, allowing for early stopping and avoiding overfitting. In a case study of the German day-ahead market, our method outperforms a wide range of benchmarks, showing that modeling dependence improves both calibration and predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we analyse the trade-off between predictive accuracy and computational costs for batch and online estimation and provide an high-performing open-source Python implementation in the ondil package.</description>

      <title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>

      <title>SIM-Shapley: A Stable and Computationally Efficient Approach to Shapley Value Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) is essential for trustworthy machine learning (ML), particularly in high-stakes domains such as healthcare and finance. Shapley value (SV) methods provide a principled framework for feature attribution in complex models but incur high computational costs, limiting their scalability in high-dimensional settings. We propose Stochastic Iterative Momentum for Shapley Value Approximation (SIM-Shapley), a stable and efficient SV approximation method inspired by stochastic optimization. We analyze variance theoretically, prove linear $Q$-convergence, and demonstrate improved empirical stability and low bias in practice on real-world datasets. In our numerical experiments, SIM-Shapley reduces computation time by up to 85% relative to state-of-the-art baselines while maintaining comparable feature attribution quality. Beyond feature attribution, our stochastic mini-batch iterative framework extends naturally to a broader class of sample average approximation problems, offering a new avenue for improving computational efficiency with stability guarantees.

      <title>WWAggr: A Window Wasserstein-based Aggregation for Ensemble Change Point Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Change Point Detection (CPD) aims to identify moments of abrupt distribution shifts in data streams. Real-world high-dimensional CPD remains challenging due to data pattern complexity and violation of common assumptions. Resorting to standalone deep neural networks, the current state-of-the-art detectors have yet to achieve perfect quality. Concurrently, ensembling provides more robust solutions, boosting the performance. In this paper, we investigate ensembles of deep change point detectors and realize that standard prediction aggregation techniques, e.g., averaging, are suboptimal and fail to account for problem peculiarities. Alternatively, we introduce WWAggr -- a novel task-specific method of ensemble aggregation based on the Wasserstein distance. Our procedure is versatile, working effectively with various ensembles of deep CPD models. Moreover, unlike existing solutions, we practically lift a long-standing problem of the decision threshold selection for CPD.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Robust Simulation-Based Inference under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is transforming experimental sciences by enabling parameter estimation in complex non-linear models from simulated data. A persistent challenge, however, is model misspecification: simulators are only approximations of reality, and mismatches between simulated and real data can yield biased or overconfident posteriors. We address this issue by introducing Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>A fast and effective kernel two-sample test for large-scale data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.03118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel two-sample tests have been widely used, and the development of efficient methods for high-dimensional, large-scale data is receiving increasing attention in the big data era. However, existing methods, such as the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) and recently proposed kernel-based tests for large-scale data, are computationally intensive and/or ineffective for some common alternatives in high-dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a new test that exhibits high power across a wide range of alternatives. Furthermore, the new test is more robust to high dimensions than existing methods and does not require optimization procedures for choosing kernel bandwidth and other parameters through data splitting. Numerical studies demonstrate that the new approach performs well on both synthetic and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Weighted Sequential Bayesian Inference for Non-Stationary Linear Contextual Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-stationary linear contextual bandits through the lens of sequential Bayesian inference. Whereas existing algorithms typically rely on the Weighted Regularized Least-Squares (WRLS) objective, we study Weighted Sequential Bayesian (WSB), which maintains a posterior distribution over the time-varying reward parameters. Our main contribution is a novel concentration inequality for WSB posteriors, which introduces a prior-dependent term that quantifies the influence of initial beliefs. We show that this influence decays over time and derive tractable upper bounds that make the result useful for both analysis and algorithm design. Building on WSB, we introduce three algorithms: WSB-LinUCB, WSB-RandLinUCB, and WSB-LinTS. We establish frequentist regret guarantees: WSB-LinUCB matches the best-known WRLS-based guarantees, while WSB-RandLinUCB and WSB-LinTS improve upon them, all while preserving the computational efficiency of WRLS-based algorithms.</description>

      <title>AutoScale: Scale-Aware Data Mixing for Pre-Training LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20177v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Domain reweighting is an emerging research area aimed at adjusting the relative weights of different data sources to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of LLM pre-training. We show that data mixtures that perform well at smaller scales may not retain their advantage at larger scales, challenging the existing practice of determining competitive mixtures in small-scale experiments and directly applying them at much larger scales. To address this, we propose AutoScale, a two-stage, scale-aware data composition framework. First, AutoScale fits a parametric model that predicts the model's loss under different data compositions, then uses it to find an approximate best allocation at smaller, more manageable budgets. Next, leveraging a novel theoretical analysis of how optimal compositions evolve with scale, AutoScale extrapolates that composition to larger budgets without further retraining. Empirically, AutoScale accelerates convergence and improves downstream performance. For instance, when pre-training GPT-2 Large, it achieves a 28% faster perplexity reduction than baselines and up to a 38% speed-up over unweighted training, while yielding best-average results on various downstream tasks. Overall, our findings illustrate how domain importance shifts with training scale, underscoring the need for scale-dependent data curation in LLM training. Our code is open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Gradient Normalization and Independent Sampling for (Stochastic) Generalized-Smooth Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that many nonconvex machine learning problems satisfy a generalized-smooth condition that extends beyond traditional smooth nonconvex optimization. However, the existing algorithms are not fully adapted to such generalized-smooth nonconvex geometry and encounter significant technical limitations on their convergence analysis. In this work, we first analyze the convergence of adaptively normalized gradient descent under function geometries characterized by generalized-smoothness and generalized P{\L} condition, revealing the advantage of adaptive gradient normalization. Our results provide theoretical insights into adaptive normalization across various scenarios.For stochastic generalized-smooth nonconvex optimization, we propose \textbf{I}ndependent-\textbf{A}daptively \textbf{N}ormalized \textbf{S}tochastic \textbf{G}radient \textbf{D}escent algorithm, which leverages adaptive gradient normalization, independent sampling, and gradient clipping to achieve an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-4})$ sample complexity under relaxed noise assumptions. Experiments on large-scale nonconvex generalized-smooth problems demonstrate the fast convergence of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Provable Calibration in High-Dimensional Binary Classification: Angular Calibration and Platt Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15131v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of calibrating a linear binary classifier of the form $\sigma(\hat{w}^\top x)$, where the feature vector $x$ is Gaussian, $\sigma$ is a link function, and $\hat{w}$ is an estimator of the true linear weight $w^\star$. By interpolating with a noninformative $\textit{chance classifier}$, we construct a well-calibrated predictor whose interpolation weight depends on the angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ between the estimator $\hat{w}$ and the true linear weight $w_\star$. We establish that this angular calibration approach is provably well-calibrated in a high-dimensional regime where the number of samples and features both diverge, at a comparable rate. The angle $\angle(\hat{w}, w_\star)$ can be consistently estimated. Furthermore, the resulting predictor is uniquely $\textit{Bregman-optimal}$, minimizing the Bregman divergence to the true label distribution within a suitable class of calibrated predictors. Our work is the first to provide a calibration strategy that satisfies both calibration and optimality properties provably in high dimensions. Additionally, we identify conditions under which a classical Platt-scaling predictor converges to our Bregman-optimal calibrated solution. Thus, Platt-scaling also inherits these desirable properties provably in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Gaussian DP for Reporting Differential Privacy Guarantees in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current practices for reporting the level of differential privacy (DP) protection for machine learning (ML) algorithms such as DP-SGD provide an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of the privacy guarantees. For instance, if only a single $(\varepsilon,\delta)$ is known about a mechanism, standard analyses show that there exist highly accurate inference attacks against training data records, when, in fact, such accurate attacks might not exist. In this position paper, we argue that using non-asymptotic Gaussian Differential Privacy (GDP) as the primary means of communicating DP guarantees in ML avoids these potential downsides. Using two recent developments in the DP literature: (i) open-source numerical accountants capable of computing the privacy profile and $f$-DP curves of DP-SGD to arbitrary accuracy, and (ii) a decision-theoretic metric over DP representations, we show how to provide non-asymptotic bounds on GDP using numerical accountants, and show that GDP can capture the entire privacy profile of DP-SGD and related algorithms with virtually no error, as quantified by the metric. To support our claims, we investigate the privacy profiles of state-of-the-art DP large-scale image classification, and the TopDown algorithm for the U.S. Decennial Census, observing that GDP fits their profiles remarkably well in all cases. We conclude with a discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of this approach, and discuss which other privacy mechanisms could benefit from GDP.</description>

      <title>Optimal Denoising in Score-Based Generative Models: The Role of Data Regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models achieve state-of-the-art sampling performance by denoising a distribution perturbed by Gaussian noise. In this paper, we focus on a single deterministic denoising step, and compare the optimal denoiser for the quadratic loss, we name ''full-denoising'', to the alternative ''half-denoising'' introduced by Hyv{\"a}rinen (2024). We show that looking at the performances in term of distance between distribution tells a more nuanced story, with different assumptions on the data leading to very different conclusions. We prove that half-denoising is better than full-denoising for regular enough densities, while full-denoising is better for singular densities such as mixtures of Dirac measures or densities supported on a low-dimensional subspace. In the latter case, we prove that full-denoising can alleviate the curse of dimensionality under a linear manifold hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Sample Complexities of Divergence-based S-rectangular Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust reinforcement learning (DR-RL) has recently gained significant attention as a principled approach that addresses discrepancies between training and testing environments. To balance robustness, conservatism, and computational traceability, the literature has introduced DR-RL models with SA-rectangular and S-rectangular adversaries. While most existing statistical analyses focus on SA-rectangular models, owing to their algorithmic simplicity and the optimality of deterministic policies, S-rectangular models more accurately capture distributional discrepancies in many real-world applications and often yield more effective robust randomized policies. In this paper, we study the empirical value iteration algorithm for divergence-based S-rectangular DR-RL and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds of $\widetilde{O}(|\mathcal{S}||\mathcal{A}|(1-\gamma)^{-4}\varepsilon^{-2})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the target accuracy, $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{A}|$ denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces, and $\gamma$ is the discount factor. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first sample complexity results for divergence-based S-rectangular models that achieve optimal dependence on $|\mathcal{S}|$, $|\mathcal{A}|$, and $\varepsilon$ simultaneously. We further validate this theoretical dependence through numerical experiments on a robust inventory control problem and a theoretical worst-case example, demonstrating the fast learning performance of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear TD($\lambda$) is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning algorithms for policy evaluation. Previously, convergence rates are typically established under the assumption of linearly independent features, which does not hold in many practical scenarios. This paper instead establishes the first $L^2$ convergence rates for linear TD($\lambda$) operating under arbitrary features, without making any algorithmic modification or additional assumptions. Our results apply to both the discounted and average-reward settings. To address the potential non-uniqueness of solutions resulting from arbitrary features, we develop a novel stochastic approximation result featuring convergence rates to the solution set instead of a single point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24076v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture density.</description>
