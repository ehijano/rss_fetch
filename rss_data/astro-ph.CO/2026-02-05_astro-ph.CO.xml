      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: Constraints on Local Non-Gaussianity from the ACT Cluster Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive constraints on local-type primordial non-Gaussianity using the ACT DR6 Sunyaev--Zel'dovich cluster catalog. Modeling the redshift- and mass-dependent number counts of 1,201 clusters in the 10,347~deg$^2$ Legacy region, and accounting for survey completeness, intrinsic SZ scatter, and a weak-lensing-calibrated mass bias, we compute theoretical abundances using the Log--Edgeworth halo mass function. Assuming $\Lambda$CDM with well-motivated external priors, we obtain $f_{\rm NL} = 55 \pm 125$ (68% CL), consistent with Gaussian initial conditions. These constraints probe comoving scales of $5$--$10~{\rm Mpc}~h^{-1}$, complementing CMB bispectrum and scale-dependent bias measurements, which do not reach such small scales. We also find evidence for a 16.4% residual mass bias, which, although heavily informed by our adopted priors, plays a key role in matching observed and predicted counts but has negligible effect on $f_{\rm NL}$ constraints. We briefly discuss robustness of the results under relaxed priors and the prospects for next-generation SZ and lensing surveys to strengthen cluster-based tests of primordial non-Gaussianity.</description>

      <title>An emulator for the ionizing photon mean free path in ultra-high resolution simulations: the implications of mean free path measurements for the reionization history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the mean free path of ionizing photons from high-redshift quasar spectra at $z \sim 5$-$6$ constrain the reionization history, but interpreting them requires modeling the kiloparsec-scale clumping that large-volume reionization simulations cannot resolve. We present a deep learning emulator for the mean free path (MFP) trained on high-resolution cosmological radiative transfer simulations of ionization fronts sweeping through small 2 comoving~Mpc/h volumes. Using a residual multi-layer perceptron neural network, we predict the MFP at a given redshift as a function of the reionization redshift, photoionization rate, wavelength, and box-scale density, achieving a median relative error of 1.6\% across nearly four orders of magnitude in MFP. Integrating its predictions over box-scale overdensity and an extended reionization history allows the emulator to predict the global MFP. We apply the emulator to extended reionization histories constrained by observed photoionization rates, finding that models prefer late reionization with substantial neutral fractions persisting at $z \lesssim 6$. Fitting a parametric ionization history yields a midpoint of reionization of $z_{\rm re} = 6.8\pm 1.2$ for reionization durations consistent with Planck and kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich constraints, and the universe being $10\%$ neutral still at $z_{\rm re} &lt; 5.8 ~(6.3)$ at 1~(2)$\sigma$. Global ionizing emissivity inferences using measurements of the photoionization rate and MFP plus our emulator, which avoids common power-law assumptions, suggest a factor of $2-3$ decline between $z = 6$ and $4.8$, in agreement with previous studies. Our method provides an efficient (and more converged) alternative to large-volume radiative-hydrodynamic simulations of reionization for interpreting MFP measurements, and can also serve as a subgrid prescription for the ionizing opacity within such simulations.</description>

      <title>The local void model for the Hubble and BAO tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inconsistency between the locally inferred Hubble constant and the value inferred from the cosmic microwave background assuming the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model has persisted, turning into an important problem. An emergent underlying trend is that this Hubble tension is driven by data confined to the very low-redshift Universe (typically $z &lt; 0.15$). Most intermediate-redshift measurements remain mutually consistent with $H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$, the $\Lambda$CDM expectation anchored by the CMB. This Perspective examines if a large local void can explain the Hubble tension and its appearance only at low $z$. For an observer residing within a large underdensity, such as the Milky Way inside the claimed KBC void, gravitationally induced outflows and redshift can inflate the locally inferred recession scale $cz'$ despite having $H_0 = H_0^\mathrm{CMB}$. We summarise evidence suggestive of a local underdensity from multi-wavelength galaxy number counts, discuss the dynamical requirements implied by the amplitude of inferred bulk flows, and connect the solution to the emerging low-redshift BAO distance anomaly ($\alpha_{\mathrm{iso}} &lt; 1$). Previously published semi-analytic void models anticipated the observed redshift dependence of BAO deviations and predict a rapid convergence to CMB-consistent expansion for $z \gtrsim 0.2$, aligning with reconstructions of $H_0(z)$ from BAO plus uncalibrated Type Ia supernovae. We conclude by looking to future tests, including improved mapping of the local density and velocity field, fits to galaxy distance catalogues at the field level, kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich constraints on coherent outflows, fast radio bursts, and the long-term prospect of redshift drift measurements as a direct probe of time-varying non-cosmological redshift contributions.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Forward modeling KiDS-1000 redshift distributions using realistic galaxy populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of the cosmological constraints from Stage~IV galaxy surveys will be limited by how well the galaxy redshift distributions can be inferred. We have addressed this challenging problem for the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) cosmic shear sample by developing a forward-modeling framework with two main ingredients: (1) the \texttt{pop-cosmos} generative model for the evolving galaxy population, calibrated on \textit{Spitzer} IRAC $\textit{Ch.\,1}&lt;26$ galaxies from COSMOS2020; and (2) a data model for noise and selection, machine-learned from the SURFS-based KiDS-Legacy-Like Simulations (SKiLLS). Applying KiDS tomographic binning to our synthetic photometric data, we infer redshift distributions in each of five bins directly from the population and data models, bypassing the need for spectroscopic reweighting. Keeping the data model fixed, we compare results using two different galaxy population models: \texttt{pop-cosmos}; and \texttt{shark}, the semi-analytic galaxy formation model used in SKiLLS. In the first ($0.1&lt;z&lt;0.3$) and last ($0.9&lt;z&lt;1.2$) tomographic bins we find systematic differences in the mean redshifts of $\Delta z\sim0.05$-$0.1$, comparable to the reported uncertainties from spectroscopic reweighting methods. This work paves the way for accurate redshift distribution calibration for Stage~IV surveys directly through forward modeling, thus providing an independent cross-check on spectroscopic-based calibrations which avoids their selection biases and incompleteness. We will use the \texttt{pop-cosmos} redshift distributions in an upcoming full KiDS cosmology reanalysis.</description>

      <title>A simple mechanism for the enhancement of the inflationary power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The background evolution in two-field inflation can feature two distinct stages, corresponding to the evolution along two successive field directions. When the second stage occurs at a significantly lower energy scale, the inflationary trajectory includes a sharp transition, accompanied by a series of rapid turns in field space. Fluctuations crossing the Hubble horizon during this turning phase can experience amplification by several orders of magnitude. This mechanism is very intuitive and can be implemented even in simple two-field models. It produces a peak in the scalar power spectrum that can lead to significant abundances of primordial black holes and secondary gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>From Nonparametric Distance Reconstruction to Testing the Etherington Relation and Cosmic Curvature Using 2D and 3D BAO Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint test of cosmic curvature, $\Omega_{k0}$, and the cosmic distance-duality relation (CDDR) using the Etherington relation, which connects the luminosity and angular diameter distances at the same redshift. In this work, we combine the angular diameter distance measurements from recent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) observations with luminosity distances reconstructed from Cosmic Chronometers data of Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using a non-parametric technique, Gaussian Process. A key part of our analysis is the systematic comparison of different BAO measurements (2D BAO, 3D BAO, and 3D DESI BAO) to determine whether any potential tension between angular and anisotropic BAO data affects constraints on the distance duality parameter $\eta(z)$ and $\Omega_{k0}$. We adopt four representative parameterizations of $\eta(z)$ to examine the correlation between $\eta(z)$ and $\Omega_{k0}$. Our results show no evidence for violation of the CDDR, with $\eta(z)$ consistent with unity at the 99\% confidence level for all BAO datasets and parameterizations. In all scenarios, the best-fit values of $\Omega_{k0}$ mildly favor a non-flat universe, although a spatially flat universe remains compatible at the 95\% confidence level. The constraints on $\eta_1$ and $\Omega_{k0}$ indicate slight variations across different BAO datasets, but the discrepancies between the 2D and 3D BAO measurements do not introduce any significant bias, and no statistically meaningful tension is observed. Our work provides robust constraints on cosmic curvature and the validity of the CDDR based on non-parametric distance reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Parametric Resonance and Backreaction Effects in Magnetogenesis from Ultralight Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take a more detailed look at the recently proposed magnetogenesis mechanism triggered by ultralight dark matter coupled to electromagnetism. The proposed mechanism made use of a tachyonic resonance channel which leads to the exponential amplification of infrared modes. Here, we first investigate a possible narrow band parametric resonance channel which can produce photons at higher frequencies. Secondly, we estimate the effects of back-reaction on terminating the resonance. We find that there is indeed a narrow resonance channel. It is characterized by a Floquet exponent which is slightly smaller than the corresponding exponent for the tachyonic resonance. However, there is a region of parameter space (corresponding to a very small coupling constant) for which the tachyonic resonance is ineffective. In this case, the narrow resonance will dominate, and it will still be sufficiently strong to generate the observed magnetic fields on cosmological scales. Our analytical treatment of the back-reaction effects considered here indicates that a fraction of order one of the initial dark matter density can flow into the gauge fields. Hence, our magnetogenesis scenario appears to be robust to back-reaction effects.</description>

      <title>Large-scale halo velocity correlations and the impact of finite simulation volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The velocity correlation functions directly measured from the peculiar velocity field of dark matter in numerical simulations are known to have an amplitude lower than that predicted by theoretical models at large scales. The trend persists for dark-matter halos or galaxies that are more closely related to the observables. We investigate the impact of the finite simulation box sizes on the measured velocity correlation functions of halos, utilizing N-body simulations with different box sizes. We measure the halo velocity correlations from N-body simulations with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$ and $2{\rm Gpc}/h$, confirming the former is more suppressed compared to the linear theory prediction on large scales due to the lack of large-scale modes beyond the box size. In contrast, even though we subdivide the larger-box simulations into those with side lengths of $1{\rm Gpc}/h$, the amount of the suppression is the same as that from the original boxes, as the large-scale modes are already imprinted. Introducing the lower limit of the integral in the Hankel transform, $k_{\rm min}$, as a free parameter and marginalizing it over, we find that the constrained growth rate parameter, $f(z)\sigma_8(z)$, returns the correct value assumed in the simulations. However, when we ignore the effect and set $k_{\rm min}=0$, the constraint on $f\sigma_8$ is significantly biased if the correlation between different separation bins is also ignored. Furthermore, we find that the suppression of the velocity correlation amplitude on large scales depends on halo mass, with more massive halos exhibiting a systematically stronger suppression. These results highlight the importance of accounting for missing long-wavelength modes when developing simulation-based modeling of velocity statistics, such as emulators.</description>

      <title>A model-independent measurement of the Hubble constant from gravitational-wave standard sirens and electromagnetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension is one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. Developing new approaches to estimate the Hubble constant is therefore crucial, and in this work, we employ a Gaussian process, a fully model-independent method that relies solely on observational data. To determine the Hubble constant, we use not only electromagnetic observations but also include gravitational-wave standard siren data from GWTC3. Our measurements of the Hubble constant are strongly consistent with the SH0ES result, with tensions less than $2\sigma$, indicating no statistically significant discrepancy. This approach quantifies the impact of gravitational-wave data on the determination of the Hubble constant, examines its consistency with electromagnetic measurements, and explores its potential role in addressing the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Weak Lensing Low Multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the low-multipole components of the weak-lensing convergence field in a FLRW universe. The low-multipole convergence field, encodes the largest-angle coherent potential gradients, essential for assessment of large-angle features in data. To study this large angle signal, we perform a combined analytical, numerical and observational study. Starting from exact analytical expressions for the convergence power spectrum, we quantify how the dipole, quadrupole and octupole build up with source redshift and show that, in $\Lambda$CDM, they saturate at an amplitude of order $10^{-4}$. We then use full-sky, horizon-scale $N$-body simulations (Quijote) to explore the dependence of this signal on the observer's environment, comparing random observers to ``Milky Way-like'' observers. In parallel, we reconstruct the convergence field due to our local Universe with the 2MASS Redshift Survey (2MRS), with proper treatment of incompleteness and galaxy bias. We find that the observed low multipoles from observation is above the $\Lambda$CDM mean predictions, but in full agreement with Milky Way-like observers in the simulation. Finally, by converting the convergence dipole into a number-count dipole, we test whether weak lensing can contribute to the cosmic dipole anomaly, an idea motivated by its natural alignment with the CMB dipole and by the fact that lensing, unlike clustering, cannot be removed by cross-matching surveys and thus survives in all high-redshift catalogues. We show that weak lensing by local structure contributes at most a few percent to this observed anomaly.</description>

      <title>Separation of polarized dust emission in Planck observations with Scattering Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarized dust emission is a major astrophysical foreground contaminant of the cosmic microwave background polarization (CMB), which must be accurately measured to look for the faint primordial polarization B-modes of inflationary origin. The available maps to date, obtained from Planck space mission data, are noise-dominated in the high Galactic latitude regions that are most relevant for CMB observations. The goal of this work is to obtain better dust polarization maps from Planck observations, by exploiting both the dependence between polarization and total intensity, as well as the non-Gaussian filamentary structure of the dust emission. To this end, we use scattering transforms, which provide a stable and interpretable representation of complex non-Gaussian textures, allowing for a data-driven analysis approach requiring no explicit priors on dust. The analysis is performed locally on Cartesian patches of sky, where Stokes linear polarization parameters, redefined in a local reference frame, are modeled as the sum of a signal of interest and a nuisance term. Using multiple realizations of the random nuisance term, we recover the polarized dust maps by minimizing a composite objective function that enforces multiple statistical constraints in scattering space. The proposed algorithm reconstructs maps of polarized dust emission whose statistics are consistent with those expected from the Planck data once random nuisance realizations are added. This is confirmed in a validation test using a high signal-to-noise sky region as a test case. Comparisons with existing dust polarization maps and models show that our approach better recovers small-scale polarized dust emission, and that our reconstructed power and cross-spectra closely match those of the dust polarization maps. A second set of maps that deterministically reproduce the features of the dust polarized emission is also produced.</description>

      <title>The Standard siren tests of viable $f(R)$ cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We constrain the Hu-Sawicki and Starobinsky $f(R)$ gravity models utilizing current electromagnetic (PP+CC, Planck and DESI2) datasets and simulate standard siren catalogs based on the resulting best-fit parameters. We demonstrate that the simulated SS data provide complementary sensitivity to the modified gravitational wave propagation friction term, thereby enhancing the discriminating power between $f(R)$ gravity and the $\Lambda$CDM model. However, we note that standard sirens do not offer a viable resolution to the Hubble tension in this analysis, as the inferred constraints are predominantly driven by the fiducial cosmologies adopted in the simulations. Regarding the specific models, we find that for the Hu-Sawicki scenario, several data combinations favor $F_{RR0}&lt;0$, implying potential theoretical instabilities. And, for the Starobinsky model, while EM-only constraints are nearly symmetric between the two parameter branches ($b&lt;0$ and $b&gt;0$), the inclusion of SS constraints introduces mild asymmetries, revealing the sensitivity of SS observables to the curvature dependence of the theory. Future truly independent standard siren observations would be crucial for a definitive assessment of $f(R)$ gravity as an alternative to $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>Unclustered tracers remain unclustered: the lack of primordial non-Gaussianity response of bias-zero tracers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining primordial non-Gaussianities (PNG) is one of the main goals of new-generation large-scale galaxy surveys. It had been proposed that unclustered tracers (with bias $b_1=0$) could be optimal for PNG studies, and that these could be found by selecting galaxies in bins of their local density. Here, we test this hypothesis in state-of-the-art simulations from the PNG-UNITsim suite with local $f_{\rm NL}=100$ and $f_{\rm NL}=-20$. We consider different parent tracer catalogues: all halos together, halos in large mass bins, and HOD models for LRGs and QSO. We then classify these tracers by their local density ($\delta_{t,R}$) and measure the linear bias ($b_1$) and PNG-response ($b_\phi$). Most $\delta_{t,R}$ bins show a PNG-response compatible with $b_\phi=0$ for all halos or the low-mass bin (log$M&lt;11$). For high-mass halos (log$M&gt;$12), QSO or LRG, we recover a trend closer to the universality relation ($b_\phi = 2 \delta_{\rm crit}(b_1-1)$) for $b_1&gt;1$, but the $b_\phi(b_1)$ curve flattens to 0 below $\vert b_1\lvert&lt;1$. Hence, we find $b_\phi\approx0$ for all bias-zero tracers considered. The complex $\delta_{t,R}$-based selection causes their clustering to strongly deviate from simple assumptions, namely the universality relation and Poisson shot noise, hindering their capability to constrain PNG.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Hubble constant using the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Gold galaxy catalog and the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave standard sirens enable independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. In the absence of electromagnetic counterparts, the "dark siren" method statistically correlates GW events with potential host galaxies. We present a measurement of $H_0$ using 142 compact binary coalescences from the fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4.0) combined with the Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Gold photometric galaxy catalog. Using the gwcosmo pipeline, we jointly infer cosmological and GW population parameters. We analyze the impact of galaxy catalog properties on the inference, identifying significant features in the galaxy redshift distribution which can introduce biases. By restricting the galaxy catalog to $0.05&lt;z&lt;0.35$ to maintain consistency with a uniform in comoving volume galaxy distribution, we obtain a result of $H_0 = 70.9^{+22.3}_{-18.6}\;\text{km}\;\text{s}^{-1}\;\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ from dark sirens and $H_0=73.1^{+11.7}_{-8.6}\;\text{km}\;\text{s}^{-1}\;\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ when combined with the bright siren GW170817. This study demonstrates the adaptation of deep galaxy catalogs for GW cosmology, highlighting key challenges and methodologies essential for maximizing the potential of next-generation galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>pop-cosmos: Redshifts and physical properties of KiDS-1000 galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principled Bayesian inference of galaxy properties has not previously been performed for wide-area weak lensing surveys with millions of sources. We address this gap by applying the pop-cosmos generative model to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting for 4 million KiDS-1000 galaxies. Calibrated on deep COSMOS2020 photometric data, pop-cosmos specifies a physically-motivated prior over the galaxy population up to $z \simeq 6$ in stellar population synthesis (SPS) parameter space. Using the Speculator SPS emulator with GPU-accelerated MCMC sampling, we perform full posterior inference at 6.5 GPU seconds per galaxy, obtaining joint constraints on galaxy redshifts and physical properties. We validate photometric redshifts against $\sim\!185,\!000$ KiDS galaxies cross-matched to DESI DR1 spectroscopic samples, achieving low bias ($3\times10^{-3}$), scatter ($\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.04$), and outlier fraction (3.7%) for the Bright Galaxy Survey, with comparable performance (bias $3\times10^{-2}$, $\sigma_{\mathrm{MAD}}=0.05$, 1.3% outliers) for luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Within the LRG sample, we identify massive, dusty, star-forming contaminants at $z \simeq 0.4$ satisfying standard colour selections for quenched populations. We infer trends in stellar mass, star formation, metallicity, and dust across five tomographic redshift bins consistent with established scaling relations. Using specific star formation rate constraints, we identify $\sim$10% of KiDS-1000 galaxies as quenched, versus 37% implied by conservative colour cuts. This enables the construction of weak lensing samples defined by physical properties while mitigating intrinsic alignment systematics and preserving statistical power. Our analysis validates pop-cosmos out-of-sample, establishing it as a scaleable approach for galaxy evolution and cosmological analyses in photometric surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.03933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Maxwell electrodynamics with a Chern--Simons coupling to a dark sector top form sourced by domain walls. Electromagnetic fields which cross such domain walls exhibit optical activity. We outline the parameter space where the theory satisfies the observational bounds from domain wall nucleation rates and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. In this regime, the discretely evanescent dark energy walls can produce a polarization rotation of cosmic microwave background by $\Delta\vartheta \sim 10^{-3} ~{\rm radians}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Systematics on Time Delay Lenses and the Impact on the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While time-delay lenses can be an independent probe of $H_0$ the estimates are degenerate with the convergence of the lens near the Einstein radius. Velocity dispersions, $\sigma$, can be used to break the degeneracy, with uncertainties $\Delta H/H_0 \propto \Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ ultimately limited by the systematic uncertainties in the kinematic measurements - measuring $H_0$ to 2% requires $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ &lt; 2%. Here we explore a broad range of potential systematic uncertainties contributing to eight time-delay lenses used in cosmological analyses. We find that: (1) The characterization of the PSF both in absolute scale and in shape is important, with biases in $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2$ up to 1-6%, depending on the lens system. Small slit miscenterings of the lens are less important. (2) The difference between the measured velocity dispersion and the mean square velocity needed for the Jeans equations is important, with up to $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 3-8%. (3) The choice of anisotropy models is important with maximum changes of $\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 5-18% and the frequently used Osipkov-Merritt models do not produce $h_4$ velocity moments typical of early-type galaxies. (4) Small differences between the true stellar mass distribution and the model light profile matter ($\Delta\sigma^2/\sigma^2 \sim$ 5-40%), with radial color gradients further complicating the problem. Finally, we discuss how the homogeneity of the early-type galaxy population means that many dynamically related parameters must be marginalized over the lens sample as a whole and not over individual lenses.</description>

      <title>Ultralight time-oscillating scalars from magnetized compact stars: electrophilic radiation and photon propagation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars with electrophilic couplings to the time-dependent Goldreich-Julian charge density of magnetized compact stars can be radiated from their magnetospheres, contributing to pulsar spin-down. Coupling to the time-independent component of the charge density instead generates a quadrupolar scalar field profile, which may influence the orbital dynamics of binary systems. Such scalars can also interact with the time-varying electromagnetic fields of magnetized stars, modifying photon propagation and inducing observable effects in the redshift and residual time-delay measurements, as well as corrections to the background electromagnetic fields. We investigate these phenomena for the Crab pulsar, SGR 1806-20, and GRB 080805A. Using spectral and timing observations, we derive constraints on the scalar-electron and scalar-photon couplings. While the bounds obtained on the scalar-electron coupling from pulsar spin-down are weaker than existing limits, electromagnetic radiation measurements yield the strongest astrophysical constraints to date on the scalar-photon coupling. Compact stars with stronger surface magnetic fields and observations at lower photon frequencies can improve these bounds by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Impact of Higher-Order Modes on Eccentricity Measurement in Binary Black Hole Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the systematic biases in measuring orbital eccentricity for binary black hole (BBH) mergers that arise when higher-order modes (HOMs) of gravitational waves are neglected in waveform modeling. Using Bayesian inference with the state-of-the-art eccentric, spin-aligned, higher-mode effective-one-body model SEOBNRv5EHM, we reanalyze six previously suggested eccentric gravitational-wave events--GW190521, GW190620, GW190701, GW191109, GW200129, and GW200208\_222617. Comparing results with its dominant-mode-only counterpart SEOBNRv5E, we find no statistically significant HOM-induced bias in eccentricity for any of these events, including GW190521, whose eccentricity has been debated in the literature. To identify parameter regimes vulnerable to HOM omission, we perform a broad zero-noise injection campaign varying detector-frame total mass, mass ratio, eccentricity, inclination, and network SNR. We find that significant systematic biases ($\Delta_e/\sigma &gt; 1$) arise predominantly in systems with high total mass ($M^{\rm det}\gtrsim120M_\odot$), highly asymmetric mass ratios ($q \gtrsim 4$), near edge-on orientations ($\theta_\textrm{JN} \gtrsim 30^\circ$), and high SNRs ($\rho^N_\textrm{mf}\approx50$). Notably, for quasi-circular BBHs with $M^{\rm det}\gtrsim140M_\odot$, neglecting HOMs may lead to strong false-positive evidence for nonzero eccentricity. By contrast, for lower-mass systems ($M^{\rm det}\sim100 M_\odot$), HOM exclusion produces negligible eccentricity biases. Our results demonstrate that although current eccentric candidates are not impacted by HOM omission, future eccentricity measurements--particularly for massive, asymmetric, or edge-on systems--require HOM-inclusive waveforms to avoid substantial systematic errors.</description>

      <title>Near-Resonant Thermal Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study leptogenesis in the quasi-degenerate but non-resonant regime. Expanding the CP asymmetry parameter near degeneracy and imposing the conservative non-resonance condition that the mass splitting must be much greater than the right-handed neutrino decay rates $\Delta M &gt; 100\Gamma_i$, yields the universal upper bound $\epsilon \leq 1/200$, independent of both the effective neutrino masses and the right-handed neutrino mass. We investigate vanilla and flavoured near-resonant leptogenesis and find that successful leptogenesis by right-handed neutrino decays can occur for $M \gtrsim 100~\mathrm{GeV}$ independent of washout regime, extending the viable parameter space of thermal leptogenesis down to the electroweak scale without invoking resonance. We also analyse near-resonant thermal leptogenesis during reheating and show that successful baryon asymmetry generation is compatible with reheating temperatures as low as $T_{RH}\simeq 10\rm GeV$ without relying on non-thermal production. Finally, we present a consistent framework for incorporating flavour effects in near-resonant leptogenesis during reheating. Overall, near-resonant thermal leptogenesis offers a controlled alternative regime to resonant leptogenesis, lowering the leptogenesis scale to the electroweak scale, without reliance on a disputed regulator used in resonant leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic accelerators of light dark matter: Novel direct detection constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current multiton dark matter (DM) detectors are largely incapable of detecting light dark matter from the Galactic halo due to the energy threshold limitations of their recoil measurements. However, primordial black holes (PBHs) can evaporate via Hawking radiation to particles whose energies are set by the black hole temperature. Consequently, weakly interacting light dark matter (or dark radiation) particles produced in this manner can reach the Earth with sufficient flux and kinetic energy above the experimental thresholds. This opens up a novel avenue to probe the light dark sector in terrestrial experiments. In this work, we explore this possibility by considering fermionic DM produced through PBH evaporation and investigate its electron recoil signatures in direct detection experiments. We analyze both energy independent (constant) and energy dependent (scalar and vector mediated) DM-electron interactions, highlighting the strong dependence of the recoil spectra on the underlying Lorentz structure of the interaction. In addition, we also account for the attenuation effects due to loss of kinetic energy while DM traverses through Earth's crust, which can significantly modify the incoming DM flux. Incorporating these effects carefully, we place constraints on light DM using the electron recoil data from XENONnT, LZ, and PandaX-4T. Finally, we also discuss the detection prospects of such dark matter in current and future generation neutrino detectors, such as Super Kamiokande and Hyper Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Stacking as a Line Intensity Mapping Statistic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Line-intensity mapping (LIM) is a growing technique that measures the integrated spectral-line emission from unresolved galaxies over a three-dimensional region of the Universe. Although LIM experiments ultimately aim to provide powerful cosmological constraints via auto-correlation, many LIM experiments are also designed to take advantage of overlapping galaxy surveys, enabling joint analyses of the two datasets. We introduce a flexible simulation pipeline that can generate mock galaxy surveys and mock LIM data simultaneously for the same population of simulated galaxies. Using this pipeline, we explore a simple joint analysis technique: three-dimensional co-addition (stacking) of LIM data on the positions of galaxies from a traditional galaxy catalogue. We test how the output of this technique reacts to changes in experimental design of both the LIM experiment and the galaxy survey, its sensitivity to various astrophysical parameters, and its susceptibility to common systematic errors. We find that an ideal catalogue for a stacking analysis targets as many high-mass dark matter halos as possible. We also find that the signal in a LIM stacking analysis originates almost entirely from the large-scale clustering of halos around the catalogue objects, rather than the catalogue objects themselves. While stacking is a sensitive and conceptually simple way to achieve a LIM detection, thus providing a valuable way to validate a LIM auto-correlation detection, it will likely require a full cross-correlation to achieve further characterization of the galaxy tracers involved, as the cosmological and astrophysical parameters we explore here have degenerate effects on the stack.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with inter-species interactions, mass segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central densities and gravothermal evolution. We demonstrate that models with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between species, can connect several small-scale observations while remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables core formation in dwarf halos, where the presence of baryons increases the inner densities and enhances the predicted strong lensing signatures. Using cosmological and controlled simulations alongside an accurate parametric model, we present proof-of-principle examples showing that this framework can explain the structure of dark perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and can enhance the efficiency of small-scale lenses by a factor of a few, in line with the excess reported in galaxy-galaxy strong-lensing observations. Importantly, mass segregation can enhance the Einstein radii of SIDM halos relative to their cold dark matter (CDM) counterparts, overcoming a key challenge in one-component SIDM scenarios. Our results present mass segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent, testable framework with the potential to address multiple small-scale challenges in structure formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) passing through the Earth cause a correlated pattern of time-dependent deflections of the apparent position of astronomical sources. We build upon standard lensing reconstruction techniques to develop a new time-dependent quadratic estimator, providing a novel technique to search for the deflections produced by GWs using observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We find that the time-dependent deflection reconstruction is many orders of magnitude more sensitive than the ordinary static lensing estimator, and it can be employed with the data collected by existing and future CMB surveys, without requiring any modification to the experimental or survey design. We demonstrate that CMB surveys offer sensitivity to GWs across a broad frequency range: while the sensitivity will not be competitive over the frequency range covered by pulsar timing arrays, it does extend coverage to both lower and higher frequencies. Finally, we discuss how our methods can be extended to search for other time-varying signals, and also how it can be applied to surveys at other wavelengths.</description>

      <title>QUIJOTE scientific results XIX. New constraints on the synchrotron spectral index using a semi-blind component separation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to estimate the spectral index, $\beta_s$, of polarised synchrotron emission, combining the moment expansion of CMB and the constrained-ILC. We reconstructed the maps of the first two synchrotron moments, combining multi-frequency data, and applied the `T-T plot' technique between two moment maps to estimate the synchrotron spectral index. This approach offers a new technique for mapping the foreground spectral parameters, complementing the model-based parametric component separation methods. Applying this technique, we derived a new constraint on the spectral index of polarised synchrotron emission using QUIJOTE MFI wide-survey 11 and 13 GHz data, Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe data at K and Ka bands, and Planck LFI 30 GHz data. In the Galactic plane and North Polar Spur regions, we obtained an inverse-variance-weighted mean synchrotron index of $\beta_s = -3.11$ with a standard deviation of $0.21$ due to intrinsic scatter, consistent with previous results based on parametric methods using the same dataset. We find that the inverse-variance-weighted mean spectral index, including both statistical and systematic uncertainties, is $\beta_s^{\rm plane} = -3.05 \pm 0.01$ in the Galactic plane and $\beta_s^{\rm high\text{-}lat} = -3.13 \pm 0.02$ at high latitudes, indicating a moderate steepening of the spectral index from low to high Galactic latitudes. Our analysis indicates that, within the current upper limit on the Anomalous Microwave Emission polarisation fraction, our results are not subject to any appreciable bias. Furthermore, we infer the spectral index over the entire QUIJOTE survey region, partitioning the sky into 21 patches. This technique can be further extended to constrain the synchrotron spectral curvature by reconstructing higher-order moments when better-quality data become available.</description>

      <title>Unbiased analysis of primordial non-Gaussianity: the multipoles of the full relativistic power spectrum</title>

Abstract: A major goal of ongoing and future cosmological surveys of the large-scale structure is to measure local type primordial non-Gaussianity in the galaxy power spectrum through the scale-dependent bias. General relativistic effects have been shown to be degenerate with this measurement, therefore requiring a non-Newtonian approach. In this work, we develop a consistent framework to compute integrated effects, including lensing convergence, time delay, and integrated Sachs--Wolfe, along with the local relativistic projection and wide-separation corrections in the multipoles of the power spectrum. We show that, for a \textit{Euclid}-like H$\alpha$-line galaxy survey and a MegaMapper-like Lyman-break galaxy survey, ignoring these effects leads to a bias on the best fit measurement of the amplitude of primordial non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm NL}$, of around $ 3\,\sigma$ and $ 20 \, \sigma$ respectively. When we include these corrections, the uncertainty in our knowledge of the luminosity function leads to further uncertainty in our measurement of $f_{\rm NL}$. In this work, we show that this degeneracy can be partly mitigated by using a bright-faint multi-tracer analysis, where the observed galaxy sample is subdivided into two separate populations based on luminosity, which provides a $15$--$20\%$ improvement on the forecasted constraints of local type $f_{\rm NL}$. In addition, we present a novel calculation of the full multi-tracer covariance with the inclusion of wide-separation corrections~-- all of these results are implemented in the \textit{Python} code \textsc{CosmoWAP}.</description>

      <title>Deep Chandra Observations of the z = 1.16 Relaxed, Cool-core Galaxy Cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537</title>

Abstract: Galaxy clusters serve as a unique and valuable laboratory for probing cosmological models and understanding astrophysics at the high-mass limit of structure formation. Clusters that are dynamically relaxed are especially useful targets of study because of their morphological and dynamical simplicity. However, at redshifts z &gt; 1, very few such clusters have been identified. We present results from new Chandra observations of the cluster SPT-CL J2215-3537 (hereafter SPT J2215), at z = 1.16, the second most distant relaxed, cool-core cluster identified to date. We place constraints on the cluster's total mass profile and investigate its thermodynamic profiles, scaling relations (gas mass, average temperature, and X-ray luminosity), and metal enrichment, resolving the cool core and providing essential context for the massive starburst seen in its central galaxy. We contextualize the thermodynamic and cosmological properties of the cluster within a sample of well-studied, lower-redshift relaxed systems. In this way, SPT J2215 serves as a powerful high-redshift benchmark for understanding the formation of cool cores and the evolution of massive clusters of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Data-driven modeling of rotation curves with artificial neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galactic rotation curves are crucial for understanding the distribution of mass in galaxies. Despite advances in precision observations, there are discrepancies between the inferred mass from luminosity and the observed rotational velocities, often attributed to dark matter. While traditional parametric models provide valuable insights, they struggle with complex galactic features like prominent bulges and non-circular motions. In this study, we apply artificial neural networks to generate robust, data-driven models, tailored to each galaxy, for the rotation curves of spiral galaxies using high-quality observational data. Our approach demonstrates that neural networks can effectively capture the intricate structure of rotation curves without relying on predefined astrophysical assumptions. By comparing the data-based models with the Navarro-Frenk-White model under two different assumptions for the stellar component, we classify galaxies based on the model that best fits their rotation curves, offering insights into the limitations and strengths of both theoretical and data-based methods. This work highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in identifying galaxies whose dynamics are not well captured by standard theoretical models, pointing to the need for more refined physical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Inference on inner galaxy structure via gravitational waves from supermassive binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05906v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of a stochastic gravitational wave background by pulsar-timing arrays indicates the presence of a population of supermassive black hole binaries. Although the observed spectrum generally matches predictions for orbital evolution driven by gravitational-wave emission in circular orbits, there is a preference for a spectral turnover at the lowest observed frequencies, which may point to substantial hardening during a transition from early environmental influences to later stages dominated by emission. In the vicinity of these binaries, the ejection of stars or dark matter particles through gravitational three-body slingshots efficiently extracts orbital energy, leading to a low-frequency turnover in the spectrum. Here we model how the gravitational-wave spectrum depends on the initial inner galactic profile before scouring by binary ejections while accounting for a range of initial binary eccentricities. By analysing the NANOGrav 15-year data, we find that a parsec-scale galactic-centre density of around $10^6 M_{\odot} \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ is favoured across most of the parameter space, thus shedding light on the environmental effects that shape black hole evolution and the combined matter density near galaxy centres.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing early universe evolution with gravitational waves from supercooled phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gravitational waves from supercooled cosmological first-order phase transitions. If such a transition is followed by inefficient reheating, the evolution history of the universe is modified by a period of early matter domination. This leaves an imprint on the predicted gravitational-wave spectra. Using Fisher analysis we show the parameter space in reach of upcoming gravitational wave observatories where reheating can be probed due to its impact on the stochastic background produced by the transition. We use both the simplified geometric parametrisation and the thermodynamical one explicitly including the decay rate of the field undergoing the transition as a parameter determining the spectrum. We show the expansion history following the transition can be probed provided the transition is very strong which is naturally realised in classically scale invariant models generically predicting supercooling. Moreover, in such a scenario the decay rate of the scalar undergoing the phase transition, a parameter most likely inaccessible to accelerators, can be determined through the spectrum analysis.</description>

      <title>Novel method to trace the dark matter density profile around supermassive black holes with AGN reverberation mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to determine the dark matter density profile in the vicinity of distant supermassive black holes (SMBH) using reverberation mapping (RM) measurements of active galactic nuclei (AGN). The mapping of multiple emission lines allows the measurement of the enclosed mass within different radii from the central SMBH, which can be used to infer or constrain the dark matter density profile on sub-parsec scales. We apply a toy model based on this method to a sample of fourteen AGN to test its feasibility based on current measurements. We find that for five objects, the observed enclosed mass does grow with radii, hinting towards the presence of a dark matter component at the 1-2 $\sigma$ level. For these sources, we find global evidence for a universal dark matter profile with a preferred radial steepness of index $\gamma \sim 1.6$, consistent with the scenario expected for a dark matter spike mildly relaxed by stellar heating processes. The enclosed dark matter mass, however, is found to be significantly larger than expected. We show that the current RM based mass measurements suffer from large systematic uncertainties, that limit the effectiveness of our method. Our work emphasizes the importance of applying the recent developments in mass determination techniques to target multiple emission lines with future RM and interferometry campaigns. This provides the most direct way of constraining the dark matter density in the sub-parsec regions around extragalactic SMBHs, which is crucial to our understanding of the dynamics and nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Reheating and relic gravitational waves as remedies for degeneracies of non-canonical natural inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, a natural non-canonical inflationary model based on a power-law Lagrangian is investigated. We analyze the scalar spectral index $n_{\rm s}$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of the model and identify their degeneracies with respect to the free parameters. Notably, $n_{\rm s}$ and $r$ show effective independence from the model parameters due to degeneracies in the slow-roll parameters that leads to unresolved parameter degeneracies. Employing the constraints on reheating parameters such as the reheating duration $N_{\rm{reh}}$, the reheating temperature $T_{\rm{reh}}$, and the equation of state parameter $\omega_{\rm{reh}}$, is found to be insufficient to fully break these degeneracies. However, the relic gravitational wave spectrum provides a way to break degeneracy with respect to the non-canonical parameter $\alpha$, degeneracy with respect to the potential parameter $f$ persist. Finally, we specify the allowed ranges for the inflationary duration $N$ and the parameter $\alpha$, in light of the latest observational data. These results highlight the role of relic gravitational waves in refining inflationary models and illustrate the challenges in fully resolving parameter degeneracies.</description>

      <title>Systematic effect induced by misalignment in a Reflective Polarization Modulator for CMB, and application to the LiteBIRD case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] The LiteBIRD mission aims to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) polarization with unprecedented precision, targeting the detection of primordial B modes and a precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. A central component of LiteBIRD are the polarization modulators based on Half-Wave Plates (HWP). In this work, we investigate systematic effects caused by a small, constant misalignment between the reflective HWP's rotation axis and optical axis, which mimics a wedge-like effect. This effect can introduce HWP-synchronous pointing errors, biasing polarization measurements and generating spurious B modes. Using the LiteBIRD simulation framework, we implement this wedge-like misalignment in time-ordered data and evaluate its impact on reconstructed maps and angular power spectra. Our results show that the contamination predominantly mimics lensing B modes rather than primordial tensor modes, and its impact is reduced when increasing the number of detectors. By estimating the resulting error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we set constraints on the maximum allowable wedge angle to ensure systematic effects remain below mission requirements. This study emphasizes the critical importance of precise optical alignment in CMB polarization experiments. Future work will address the additional effects of time-dependent HWP wobbling and more realistic scenarios with non-ideal detector pairs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bumblebee models, a class of vector-tensor theories in which a vector field acquires a nonzero vacuum expectation value that spontaneously breaks spacetime symmetries, are ubiquitous in the literature. By constructing the most general bumblebee action from all diffeomorphism-invariant marginal operators together with a general potential, aiming to cover all the bumblebee models studied in the literature, we perform a complete linear perturbation analysis on a spatially flat FLRW background. We show that for generic marginal couplings, the scalar sector propagates extra degrees of freedom beyond the single scalar expected for a massive vector. Enforcing the correct number of propagating modes in a cosmological setup forces degeneracy relations between the marginal couplings, which in turn completely fix the potential at the background level and render the remaining scalar infinitely strongly coupled already at linear order of perturbations. We establish a no-go theorem stating that the following conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied: (i) the most general marginal action, (ii) a homogeneous and isotropic background, (iii) no extra propagating degrees of freedom around a spatially flat FLRW background, and (iv) healthy cosmological perturbations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from two scalar fields unifying the dark sector with inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21200v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational-wave background predicted by a two-scalar-field cosmological model that aims to unify primordial inflation with the dark sector, namely late-time dark energy and dark matter, in a single and self-consistent theoretical framework. The model is constructed from an action inspired by several extensions of general relativity and string-inspired scenarios and features a non-minimal interaction between the two scalar fields, while both remain minimally coupled to gravity. In this context, we derive the gravitational-wave energy spectrum over wavelengths ranging from today's Hubble horizon to those at the end of inflation. We employ the continuous Bogoliubov coefficient formalism, originally introduced to describe particle creation in an expanding Universe, in analogy to the well-established mechanism of gravitational particle production and, in particular, generalized to gravitons. Using this method, which enables an accurate description of graviton creation across all cosmological epochs, we find that inflation provides the dominant gravitational-wave contribution, while subdominant features arise at the inflation-radiation, radiation-matter, and matter-dark energy transitions, i.e., epochs naturally encoded inside our scalar field picture. The resulting energy density spectrum is thus compared with the sensitivity curves of the planned next-generation ground- and space-based gravitational-wave observatories. The comparison identifies frequency bands where the predicted signal could be probed, providing those windows associated with potentially detectable signals, bounded by our analyses. Consequences of our recipe are thus compared with numerical outcomes and the corresponding physical properties discussed in detail.</description>

Abstract: We study the gravitational microlensing of various static and spherically symmetric non-singular black holes (and horizonless, non-singular compact objects of similar size). For pointlike sources we extend the parametrized post-Newtonian lensing framework to fourth order, whereas for extended sources we develop a ray tracing approach via a simple radiative transfer model. Modelling non-relativistic proper motion of the lens in front of a background star we record the apparent brightness as a function of time, resulting in a photometric lightcurve. Taking the star radius to smaller values, our numerical results approach the theoretical predictions for point-like sources. Compared to the Schwarzschild metric in an otherwise unmodified lensing geometry, we find that non-singular black hole models (and their horizonless, non-singular counterparts) both at finite size and for point lenses tend to feature larger magnifications in microlensing lightcurves.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational waves can be gravitationally lensed by massive objects along their path. Depending on the lens mass and the lens--source geometry, this can lead to the observation of a single distorted signal or multiple repeated events with the same frequency evolution. We present the results for gravitational-wave lensing searches on the data from the first part of the fourth LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA observing run (O4a). We search for strongly lensed events in the newly acquired data by (1) searching for an overall phase shift present in an image formed at a saddle point of the lens potential, (2) looking for pairs of detected candidates with consistent frequency evolution, and (3) identifying sub-threshold counterpart candidates to the detected signals. Beyond strong lensing, we also look for lensing-induced distortions in all detected signals using an isolated point-mass model. We do not find evidence for strongly lensed gravitational-wave signals and use this result to constrain the rate of detectable strongly lensed events and the merger rate density of binary black holes at high redshift. In the search for single distorted lensed signals, we find one outlier: GW231123_135430, for which we report more detailed investigations. While this event is interesting, the associated waveform uncertainties make its interpretation complicated, and future observations of the populations of binary black holes and of gravitational lenses will help determine the probability that this event could be lensed.</description>

Abstract: In this work we estimate the parameters of several astrophysical black holes hosted at the core of active galactic nuclei by studying the kinematics of test objects in their accretion disk. First, we derive expressions for the redshift and blueshift of photons emitted by a massive particle circularly orbiting a Schwarzschild-de Sitter black hole, and detected by a distant receding observer. The frequency-shift depends on the mass and distance of the black hole, the orbital radius of the photon source, as well as the Hubble constant, directly relating these quantities to astrophysical observables, namely, the redshift and the angular position of the emitting particle on the sky. We apply for the first time this theoretical model, which accounts for the universe expansion through the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, to real astrophysical systems using megamaser galaxies within the Hubble flow, namely UGC 3789, NGC 5765b, NGC 6264, NGC 6323, and CGCG 074-064. Bayesian inference based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods is employed to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio, the product of the Hubble constant with the distance, and the black hole angular position. Additionally, by assuming a Gaussian prior on the Hubble constant, the mass, distance, and the Hubble constant are also estimated. Furthermore, we find that cosmic expansion is embedded in the gravitational contribution of the frequency-shift within this spacetime metric. Therefore, our results introduce a general relativistic framework that accounts for cosmic expansion and differs from the standard empirical Hubble law.</description>
