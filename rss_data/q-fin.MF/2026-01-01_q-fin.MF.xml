      <title>Utility Maximisation with Model-independent Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an agent who has access to a financial market, including derivative contracts, who looks to maximise her utility. Whilst the agent looks to maximise utility over one probability measure, or class of probability measures, she must also ensure that the mark-to-market value of her portfolio remains above a given threshold. When the mark-to-market value is based on a more pessimistic valuation method, such as model-independent bounds, we recover a novel optimisation problem for the agent where the agents investment problem must satisfy a pathwise constraint.
  For complete markets, the expression of the optimal terminal wealth is given, using the max-plus decomposition for supermartingales. Moreover, for the Black-Scholes-Merton model the explicit form of the process involved in such decomposition is obtained, and we are able to investigate numerically optimal portfolios in the presence of options which are mispriced according to the agent's beliefs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic factors can matter: improving robust growth under ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drifts of asset returns are notoriously difficult to model accurately and, yet, trading strategies obtained from portfolio optimization are very sensitive to them. To mitigate this well-known phenomenon we study robust growth-optimization in a high-dimensional incomplete market under drift uncertainty of the asset price process $X$, under an additional ergodicity assumption, which constrains but does not fully specify the drift in general. The class of admissible models allows $X$ to depend on a multivariate stochastic factor $Y$ and fixes (a) their joint volatility structure, (b) their long-term joint ergodic density and (c) the dynamics of the stochastic factor process $Y$. A principal motivation of this framework comes from pairs trading, where $X$ is the spread process and models with the above characteristics are commonplace. Our main results determine the robust optimal growth rate, construct a worst-case admissible model and characterize the robust growth-optimal strategy via a solution to a certain partial differential equation (PDE). We demonstrate that utilizing the stochastic factor leads to improvement in robust growth complementing the conclusions of the previous study by Itkin et. al. (arXiv:2211.15628 [q-fin.MF], forthcoming in $\textit{Finance and Stochastics}$), which additionally robustified the dynamics of the stochastic factor leading to $Y$-independent optimal strategies. Our analysis leads to new financial insights, quantifying the improvement in growth the investor can achieve by optimally incorporating stochastic factors into their trading decisions. We illustrate our theoretical results on several numerical examples including an application to pairs trading.</description>

      <title>Minimal Solutions to the Skorokhod Reflection Problem Driven by Jump Processes and an Application to Reinsurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a reflected process in the positive orthant driven by an exogenous jump process. For a given input process, we show that there exists a unique minimal strong solution to the given particle system up until a certain maximal stopping time, which is stated explicitly in terms of the dual formulation of a linear programming problem associated with the state of the system. We apply this model to study the ruin time of interconnected insurance firms, where the stopping time can be interpreted as the failure time of a reinsurance agreement between the firms. Our work extends the analysis of the particle system in Baker, Hambly, and Jettkant (2025) to the case of jump driving processes, and the existence result of Reiman (1984) beyond the case of sub-stochastic reflection matrices.</description>

      <title>Lambda Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lambda Value-at-Risk (Lambda$-VaR) is a generalization of the Value-at-Risk (VaR), which has been actively studied in quantitative finance. Over the past two decades, the Expected Shortfall (ES) has become one of the most important risk measures alongside VaR because of its various desirable properties in the practice of optimization, risk management, and financial regulation. Analogously to the intimate relation between ES and VaR, we introduce the Lambda Expected Shortfall (Lambda-ES), as a generalization of ES and a counterpart to Lambda-VaR. Our definition of Lambda-ES has an explicit formula and many convenient properties, and we show that it is the smallest quasi-convex and law-invariant risk measure dominating Lambda-VaR under mild assumptions. We examine further properties of Lambda-ES, its dual representation, and related optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Robust Asset-Liability Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How should financial institutions hedge their balance sheets against interest rate risk when managing long-term assets and liabilities? We address this question by proposing a bond portfolio solution based on ambiguity-averse preferences, which generalizes classical immunization and accommodates arbitrary liability structures, portfolio constraints, and interest rate perturbations. In a further extension, we show that the optimal portfolio can be computed as a simple generalized least squares problem, making the solution both transparent and computationally efficient. The resulting portfolio also reduces leverage by implicitly regularizing the portfolio weights, which enhances out-of-sample performance. Numerical evaluations using both empirical and simulated yield curves support the feasibility and accuracy of our approach relative to existing methods.</description>
