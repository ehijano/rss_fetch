      <title>Percentage Coefficient (bp) -- Effect Size Analysis (Theory Paper 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Percentage coefficient (bp) has emerged in recent publications as an additional and alternative estimator of effect size for regression analysis. This paper retraces the theory behind the estimator. It's posited that an estimator must first serve the fundamental function of enabling researchers and readers to comprehend an estimand, the target of estimation. It may then serve the instrumental function of enabling researchers and readers to compare two or more estimands. Defined as the regression coefficient when dependent variable (DV) and independent variable (IV) are both on conceptual 0-1 percentage scales, percentage coefficients (bp) feature 1) clearly comprehendible interpretation and 2) equitable scales for comparison. Thus, the coefficient (bp) serves both functions effectively and efficiently, thereby serving some needs not completely served by other indicators such as raw coefficient (bw) and standardized beta. Another fundamental premise of the functionalist theory is that "effect" is not a monolithic concept. Rather, it is a collection of compartments, each of which measures a component of the conglomerate that we call "effect." A regression coefficient (b), for example, measures one aspect of effect, which is unit effect, aka efficiency, as it indicates the unit change in DV associated with a one-unit increase in IV. Percentage coefficient (bp) indicates the change in DV in percentage points associated with a whole scale increase in IV. It is meant to be an all-encompassing indicator of the all-encompassing concept of effect, but rather an interpretable and comparable indicator of efficiency, one of the key components of effect.</description>

      <title>Guidelines for the Creation of Analysis Ready Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Globally, there is an increased need for guidelines to produce high-quality data outputs for analysis. No framework currently exists that provides guidelines for a comprehensive approach to producing analysis ready data (ARD). Through critically reviewing and summarising current literature, this paper proposes such guidelines for the creation of ARD. The guidelines proposed in this paper inform ten steps in the generation of ARD: ethics, project documentation, data governance, data management, data storage, data discovery and collection, data cleaning, quality assurance, metadata, and data dictionary. These steps are illustrated through a substantive case study that aimed to create ARD for a digital spatial platform: the Australian Child and Youth Wellbeing Atlas (ACYWA).</description>
