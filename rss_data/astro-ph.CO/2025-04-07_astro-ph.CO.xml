      <title>The ISW-Lensing Bispectrum &amp; Trispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization fluctuations are correlated with the gravitational lensing potential. Famously, this induces a CMB three-point function, whose shape can be used to constrain dark energy and modifications to gravity. An analogous effect occurs at higher-order, producing an ISW-lensing trispectrum whose amplitude is hitherto unconstrained. We present a detailed discussion of this effect, and define minimum-variance estimators for the ISW-lensing three- and four-point functions. These are implemented within the PolySpec code, and bear strong similarities to the quadratic estimators used in lensing analyses. Applying these tools to Planck, we obtain strong detections of the bispectrum amplitude (consistent with previous works), but find only weak constraints on the trispectrum, due to a strong cancellation between the various ISW-induced contributions. We additionally forecast the constraints from future datasets, finding that (a) simple estimators for the ISW-lensing bispectrum will be severely limited by non-Gaussian modifications to the covariance, and (b) the ISW-lensing trispectrum will be very challenging to detect even with high-resolution future experiments. We finally consider the induced bias on primordial non-Gaussianity amplitudes (and lensing itself), which we show to be large for the bispectrum (as expected) but negligible for the trispectrum.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Constraints and Joint Cosmological Inference from Mutually Inconsistent Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results regarding dark energy are mutually inconsistent under the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, hinting at the possibility of undiscovered physics. However, the currently accepted cosmological parameters come from a joint inference between observational data sets, a process that is formally invalid for inconsistent observations. We will show that many problems can arise when using joint inference on disagreeing observations such as significantly overestimated margins of error, high dependencies on priors, and sensitivities to boundary constraints. Because we do not know if these inconsistencies arise due to errors in observation, poor statistical techniques, or an improper model, it is difficult to fix these problems. We will discuss each scenario in which the analysis method breaks and explore an alternative resampling technique, developing methods that may make determining the sources of tensions in cosmological parameters easier.</description>

      <title>Retrieving the hot CGM physics from the X-ray radial profile from eROSITA with an IlustrisTNG-based forward model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent eROSITA measurements of the radial profiles of the hot CGM in the Milky-Way stellar mass (MW-mass) regime provide us with a new benchmark to constrain the hot gas around MW-mass central and satellite galaxies and their halo mass distributions. Modelling this rich data set with state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations is required to further our understanding of the shortcomings in the current paradigm of galaxy formation and evolution models. We develop forward models for the stacked X-ray radial surface brightness profile measured by eROSITA around MW-mass galaxies. Our model contains two emitting components: hot gas (around central galaxies and satellite galaxies hosted by more massive halos) and X-ray point sources (X-ray binaries and Active Galactic Nuclei). We model the hot gas profile using the TNG300-based products. We generate mock observations with our TNG300-based model (matching stellar mass and redshift with observations) with different underlying halo mass distributions. We show that for the same mean stellar mass, a factor 2x increase in the mean value of the underlying halo mass distribution results in a ~4x increase in the stacked X-ray luminosity from the hot CGM. The point sources are described by a simple point-spread-function (PSF) of eROSITA, and we fit their normalization in this work. Using empirical models to derive a permissible range of AGN and XRB luminosities in the MW-mass X-ray galaxy stack, we choose our forward model best describing the hot CGM for the eROSITA observations. We find that at &lt; 40 kpc from the galaxy centre, the hot CGM from central galaxies and the X-ray point sources emission each account for 40-50% of the total X-ray emission budget. In summary, we show that the gas physics driving the shape of the observed hot CGM (in stellar-mass-selected samples) is tightly correlated by the underlying halo-mass distribution (abridged).</description>

      <title>Large-scale surveys of the quasar proximity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The UV radiation from high redshift quasars causes a local deficit in the neutral hydrogen absorption (Lyman-alpha forest) in their spectra, known as the proximity effect. Measurements from small samples of tens to hundreds of quasars have been used to constrain the global intensity of the UV background radiation, but so far the power of large-scale surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey has not been used to investigate the UV background in more detail. We develop a CDM-based halo model of the quasar proximity effect, which accounts by construction for the fact that quasars reside in overdense regions. We test this model on quasar Lyman-alpha spectra from the ASTRID cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, which includes self-consistent formation of quasar black holes and the intergalactic medium surrounding them. Fitting the model to individual quasar spectra, we constrain two parameters, r_eq (the radius at which the local quasar radiation intensity equals the background), and the quasar bias b_q (related to host halo mass). We find that r_eq can be recovered in an unbiased fashion with a statistical uncertainty of 25-50% from a single quasar spectrum. Applying such fitting to samples of millions of spectra from e.g., DESI would allow measurement of the UVBG intensity and its evolution with redshift with high precision. We use another, larger-scale, lower resolution simulation (Uchuu) to test how such a large sample of proximity effect measurements could be used to probe the spatial fluctuations in the intergalactic radiation field. We find that the large-scale structure of the UV radiation intensity could be mapped and its power spectrum measured on 100-1000 Mpc/h scales. This could allow the large-scale radiation field to join the density field as a dataset for constraining cosmology and the sources of radiation.</description>

      <title>Energy conditions in $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are experiencing a golden age of experimental cosmology, with exact and accurate observations being used to constrain various gravitational theories like never before. Alongside these advancements, energy conditions play a crucial theoretical role in evaluating and refining new proposals in gravitational physics. We investigate the energy conditions (WEC, NEC, DEC, and SEC) for two $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity models using the FLRW metric in a flat geometry. Model 1, $f(Q, L_m) = -\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, features linear parameter dependence, satisfying most energy conditions while selectively violating the SEC to explain cosmic acceleration. The EoS parameter transitions between quintessence, a cosmological constant, and phantom energy, depending on $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Model 2, $f(Q, L_m) = -\alpha Q + \lambda (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, introduces nonlinearities, ensuring stronger SEC violations and capturing complex dynamics like dark energy transitions. While Model 1 excels in simplicity, Model 2's robustness makes it ideal for accelerated expansion scenarios, highlighting the potential of $f(Q, L_m)$ gravity in explaining cosmic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Emission line stacking of 21cm intensity maps with MeerKLASS: Inference pipeline and application to the L-band deep-field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel analysis of observational systematics through the emission line stacking of the MeerKLASS L-band deep-field intensity maps, following the detection reported in arXiv:2407.21626. A stacking signal is obtained by stacking the 21cm intensity map cubelets around the galaxy positions from the GAMA survey at $0.39\lesssim z \lesssim 0.46$. An extensive simulation framework is built to study the viability of the stacking detection, the covariance estimation, and the model inference, which are then applied to the data. The statistical significance of the detection is $8.66\sigma$ when averaged into an angular map, and $7.45\sigma$ when averaged into a spectrum. The stacked spectrum exhibits an oscillating component of systematics, and we provide evidence that the systematics is a convolutional effect on the map data. The frequency of the oscillation matches the diffraction from the secondary reflector into the primary beam of the MeerKAT telescope. Bayesian inference can be used to constrain the systematics and the average HI emission of the galaxies. The fitting of the parameters gives a constraint on the systematics frequency $\nu_{\rm sys}\,[{\rm MHz}] = 17.90^{+6.53}_{-4.27}$. The amplitude of the systematics is $&gt;6.71\%$ at the 95\% confidence level. A tentative measurement of the average HI mass of the sources is achieved at ${\rm log}_{10}[\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle/M_\odot ]=9.84^{+0.48}_{-0.59}$, limited by the narrow redshift bin of the data, the existence of the systematics, and the low-density galaxy sample. These shortfalls will be resolved for future MeerKLASS data to enable accurate measurements of the HI density through stacking of 21cm intensity maps.</description>

      <title>SageNet: Fast Neural Network Emulation of the Stiff-amplified Gravitational Waves from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of the inflationary gravitational waves (GWs) requires time-consuming, iterative numerical integrations of differential equations to take into account their backreaction on the expansion history. To improve computational efficiency while preserving accuracy, we present SageNet (Stiff-Amplified Gravitational-wave Emulator Network), a deep learning framework designed to replace conventional numerical solvers. SageNet employs a Long Short-Term Memory architecture to emulate the present-day energy density spectrum of the inflationary GWs with possible stiff amplification, $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$. Trained on a data set of 25,689 numerically generated solutions, SageNet allows accurate reconstructions of $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$ and generalizes well to a wide range of cosmological parameters; 89.3% of the test emulations with randomly distributed parameters exhibit errors of under 4%. In addition, SageNet demonstrates its ability to learn and reproduce the artificial, adaptive sampling patterns in numerical calculations, which implement denser sampling of frequencies around changes of spectral indices in $\Omega_\mathrm{GW}(f)$. The dual capability of learning both physical and artificial features of the numerical GW spectra establishes SageNet as a robust alternative to exact numerical methods. Finally, our benchmark tests show that SageNet reduces the computation time from tens of seconds to milliseconds, achieving a speed-up of ~$10^4$ times over standard CPU-based numerical solvers with the potential for further acceleration on GPU hardware. These capabilities make SageNet a powerful tool for accelerating Bayesian inference procedures for extended cosmological models. In a broad sense, the SageNet framework offers a fast, accurate, and generalizable solution to modeling cosmological observables whose theoretical predictions demand costly differential equation solvers.</description>

      <title>Joint Analysis of Constraints on f(R) Parametrization from Recent Cosmological Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we present constraints on the parameters of three well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, viz. (i) Hu-Sawicki, (ii) Starobinsky, and (iii) ArcTanh by using a joint analysis of recent cosmological observations. We drive the analytical approximations for the Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, and cosmological distances in terms of the Hubble constant $(H_0)$, matter density $(\Omega_{m0})$, and a deviation parameter $b$ for each model. Our analysis uses data from four cosmological observations: (a) Hubble parameter measurements (Cosmic Chronometers), (b) Type Ia Supernovae (Union 3.0), (c) Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (DESI-2024), and (d) Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). We first optimize the models using each dataset independently, and subsequently, we perform a comprehensive joint analysis combining all four datasets. Our results show that the Hu-Sawicki and ArcTanh models do not deviate significantly from the $\Lambda$CDM model at 68% confidence level for individual datasets and remain consistent at 99% confidence level in the joint analysis. In contrast, the Starobinsky model shows a strong deviation and appears as a viable alternative to $\Lambda$CDM. We also constrain the transition redshift parameter, i.e., $z_t$, and the obtained value agrees with values inferred from both early-time measurement (Planck) and late-time data from Type Ia Supernovae. These results support the potential of $f(R)$ gravity to explain the late-time cosmic acceleration effectively.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Coma Cluster Structure: From the Core to the Hubble Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Coma cluster, embedded in a cosmic filament, is a complex and dynamically active structure in the local Universe. Applying a density-based member selection (dbscan) to data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we identify its virilised core and zero-velocity boundary. Cross-correlating with the Cosmicflows-4 (CF4) catalogue enables a velocity-distance analysis, incorporating radial infall models and redshift-independent distance estimators. This reveals, for the first time, the Hubble flow surrounding Coma, a first step to investigate the entanglement between the dark matter in bound objects and the dark energy driving the expansion of their surroundings. The distance to the Coma centre is determined as $69.959 \pm 0.012 \, h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$. From dbscan, we infer a virial radius of $r_{\rm vir} = \left(1.95 \pm 0.12\right)\,h^{-1}~\text{Mpc}$ and a turnaround of $r_{\rm ta} \geq 4.87~{h}^{-1}~\mbox{Mpc}$. Combining the SDSS redshifts with the CF4 distances, we estimate the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = (73.10 \pm 0.92)~\mbox{km}/\mbox{s}/\mbox{Mpc}$. However, with different calibrations for the distance moduli, $H_0$ varies between $[72, 80]$ km/s/Mpc. Mass estimates via caustics, the virial theorem, and the Hubble-flow method yield $M = [0.77, 2.0] \times 10^{15}\,h^{-1}\,M_{\odot}$, consistent with prior studies. Our systematic approach maps the structure of Coma into the local Hubble flow and shows the degeneracies between dynamical parameters such as the Hubble constant, the virial radius, and the total mass.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian Inference for Pulsar Timing Arrays: Normalizing Flows for Rapid Model Comparison Across Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of nanohertz stochastic gravitational-wave backgrounds (SGWBs) by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) promises unique insights into astrophysical and cosmological origins. However, traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches become prohibitively expensive for large datasets. We employ a normalizing flow (NF)-based machine learning framework to accelerate Bayesian inference in PTA analyses. For the first time, we perform Bayesian model comparison across SGWB source models in the framework of machine learning by training NF architectures on the PTA dataset (NANOGrav 15-year) and enabling direct evidence estimation via learned harmonic mean estimators. Our examples include 10 conventional SGWB source models such as supermassive black hole binaries, power-law spectrum, cosmic strings, domain walls, scalar-induced GWs, first-order phase transitions, and dual scenario/inflationary gravitational wave. Our approach jointly infers 20 red noise parameters and 2 SGWB parameters per model in $\sim 20$\,hours (including training), compared to $\sim 10$\,days with MCMC. Critically, the NF method preserves rigorous model selection accuracy, with small Hellinger distances ($\lesssim 0.3$) relative to MCMC posteriors, and reproduces MCMC-based Bayes factors across all tested scenarios. This scalable technique for SGWB source comparison will be essential for future PTA expansions and next-generation arrays such as the SKA, offering orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains without sacrificing physical interpretability.</description>

      <title>Has DESI detected exponential quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results have strengthened the possibility that dark energy is dynamical, i.e., it has evolved over the history of the Universe. One simple, but theoretically well motivated and widely studied, physical model of dynamical dark energy is minimally coupled, single-field quintessence $\phi$ with an exponential potential $V(\phi)=V_0\,e^{-\lambda\phi}$. We perform a full Bayesian statistical analysis of the model using the DESI DR2 data, in combination with other cosmological observations, to constrain the model's parameters and compare its goodness of fit to that of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the quintessence model provides a significantly better fit to the data, both when the spatial curvature of the Universe is fixed to zero and when it is allowed to vary. The significance of the preference varies between $\sim3.3\sigma$ and $\sim3.8\sigma$, depending on whether the curvature density parameter $\Omega_K$ is fixed or varied. We obtain the values $0.698^{+0.173}_{-0.202}$ and $0.722^{+0.182}_{-0.208}$ at the $68.3\%$ (i.e., $1\sigma$) confidence level for the parameter $\lambda$ in the absence and the presence of $\Omega_K$, respectively, which imply $\sim3.5\sigma$ preference for a nonzero $\lambda$. We also obtain $\Omega_K=0.003\pm 0.001$, which implies $\sim3\sigma$ preference for a positive $\Omega_K$, i.e., a negative curvature. Finally, we discuss the differences between quintessence and phenomenological parametrizations of the dark energy equation-of-state parameter, in particular the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DESI has reported a dynamical dark energy (DE) signal based on the $w_0 w_a$CDM model that is in conflict with Hubble tension. Recalling that the combination of DESI DR1 BAO and DR1 full-shape (FS) modeling are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, in this letter we comment on the status of fluctuations in DR1 BAO documented in \cite{DESI:2024mwx, Colgain:2024xqj} in the DR2 update. In particular, we note that neither DR1 BAO nor DR2 BAO nor DR2 BAO+CMB confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model with relaxed model parameter priors confirm late-time accelerated expansion today. Translating DESI BAO constraints into flat $\Lambda$CDM constraints, we observe that the DESI LRG1 constraint remains the most prominent outlier preferring larger $\Omega_m$ values, LRG2 switches from smaller to larger $\Omega_m$ values relative to Planck-$\Lambda$CDM, and ELG data drive the relatively low $\Omega_m$ in the full DR2 BAO. We observe that one cannot restore $w_0 = -1$ within one $1 \sigma$ by removing either LRG1 or LRG2, but LRG2 in DR2, in contrast to LRG1 in DR1, now has a greater bearing on $w_0 &gt; -1$. We conclude that the BAO has yet to stabilise, but the general trend is towards greater consistency with DESI DR1 FS modeling results, where there may be no dynamical DE signal in DESI data alone.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Velocity Anisotropy Profile of Galaxy Clusters Using the Uchuu Cosmological Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are powerful laboratories for studying both cosmic structure formation and galaxy evolution. We present a comprehensive analysis of the velocity anisotropy profile, beta(r), in galaxy clusters using the Uchuu-UniverseMachine mock galaxy catalog, which combines the large-volume Uchuu N-body simulation with the UniverseMachine galaxy formation model. Focusing on clusters with log(M200) &gt;= 13.9 [h^-1 M_sun] up to redshift z = 1.5, we investigate the behavior of beta(r) as a function of cluster-centric radius, mass, and redshift. We find that beta(r) exhibits a universal shape: it rises from isotropic values near the cluster core, peaks at approximately 1.7 R200, declines around 3.4 R200 due to orbital mixing, and increases again in the outskirts due to the dominance of first-infalling galaxies. Our results show that more massive clusters have higher radial anisotropy and larger peak beta values. Moreover, beta(r) evolves with redshift, with high-redshift clusters displaying more radially dominated orbits and enhanced infall motions. We further derive redshift-dependent power-law scaling relations between M200 and key physical radii: hydrostatic (R_hs), infall (R_inf), and turnaround (R_ta). These findings offer a robust theoretical framework for interpreting the dynamical properties of observed galaxy clusters and provide key insights into the evolution of their dynamical state over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>A New Window on Dynamical Dark Energy: Combining DESI-DR2 BAO with future Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) appear to indicate the first evidence for dynamical dark energy (DDE), with a present-day behavior resembling quintessence. This evidence emerges when the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization of the dark energy equation of state, $w_{\textrm{de}} = w_0 + w_a (1-a)$, is considered, and persists across other functional forms of $w_{\textrm{de}}$. In this work, we investigate how the inclusion of future gravitational wave (GW) standard siren data impacts the uncertainties in cosmological parameters when combined with DESI measurements. Specifically, we analyze the expected contributions from three upcoming GW observatories: the Einstein Telescope (ET), the Deci-hertz Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (DECIGO), and the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO). We find that the addition of GW data, particularly from LIGO and DECIGO, significantly reduces the uncertainties in cosmological parameters, with the extent of the improvement depending on the specific form of $w_{\textrm{de}}$. Our results highlight both the constraining power of future GW observations and the importance of considering a range of cosmological models in data analysis.</description>

      <title>Probing gravity with non-linear clustering in redshift space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first computation of the gravity model testing parameter $E_G$ on realistic simulated modified gravity galaxy mocks. The analysis is conducted using two twin simulations presented in arXiv:1805.09824(1): one based on general relativity (GR) and the other on the $f(R)$ Hu $\&amp;$ Sawicki model with $f=10^{-5}$ (F5). This study aims to measure the $E_G$ estimator in GR and $f(R)$ models using high-fidelity simulated galaxy catalogs, with the goal of assessing how future galaxy surveys can detect deviations from standard gravity. Deriving this estimator requires precise, unbiased measurements of the growth rate of structure and the linear galaxy bias. We achieve this by implementing an end-to-end cosmological analysis pipeline in configuration space, using the multipoles of the 2-point correlation function. Our analysis demonstrates how to measure the scale-dependent growth rate predicted by non-standard gravity models. We split the estimation of the RSD $\beta$ parameter over distinct scale ranges, separating large (quasi-linear) and small (non-linear) scales. We show that this estimator can be accurately measured using mock galaxies in low redshift bins ($z &lt; 1$), where it offers strong discriminating power over competing gravity theories. We find that, for an all-sky galaxy survey and neglecting observational systematics, accurate and largely unbiased estimations of $E_G$ can be obtained across all redshifts. However, the error bars are too large to clearly distinguish between the theories. When measuring the scale-dependence of the $E_G$ estimator, we note that state-of-the-art theory modeling limitations and intrinsic "prior volume effects" prevent high-accuracy constraints. Alternatively, we propose a null test of gravity using RSD clustering, which, if small scales are modeled accurately in future surveys, could detect significant departures from GR.</description>

      <title>IAEmu: Learning Galaxy Intrinsic Alignment Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic alignments (IA) of galaxies, a key contaminant in weak lensing analyses, arise from correlations in galaxy shapes driven by tidal interactions and galaxy formation processes. Accurate IA modeling is essential for robust cosmological inference, but current approaches rely on perturbative methods that break down on nonlinear scales or on expensive simulations. We introduce IAEmu, a neural network-based emulator that predicts the galaxy position-position ($\xi$), position-orientation ($\omega$), and orientation-orientation ($\eta$) correlation functions and their uncertainties using mock catalogs based on the halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework. Compared to simulations, IAEmu achieves ~3% average error for $\xi$ and ~5% for $\omega$, while capturing the stochasticity of $\eta$ without overfitting. The emulator provides both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, helping identify regions where predictions may be less reliable. We also demonstrate generalization to non-HOD alignment signals by fitting to IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation data. As a fully differentiable neural network, IAEmu enables $\sim$10,000$\times$ speed-ups in mapping HOD parameters to correlation functions on GPUs, compared to CPU-based simulations. This acceleration facilitates inverse modeling via gradient-based sampling, making IAEmu a powerful surrogate model for galaxy bias and IA studies with direct applications to Stage IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Abundance Matching Method of Extending Simulated Halo Merger Trees to Resolve Low-Mass Progenitors and Sub-halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.08972v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm to extend subhalo merger trees in a low-resolution dark-matter-only simulation by conditionally matching them to those in a high-resolution simulation. The algorithm is general and can be applied to simulation data with different resolutions using different target variables. We instantiate the algorithm by a case in which trees from ELUCID, a constrained simulation of $(500h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$ volume of the local universe, are extended by matching trees from TNGDark, a simulation with much higher resolution. Our tests show that the extended trees are statistically equivalent to the high-resolution trees in the joint distribution of subhalo quantities and in important summary statistics relevant to modeling galaxy formation and evolution in halos. The extended trees preserve certain information of individual systems in the target simulation, including properties of resolved satellite subhalos, and shapes and orientations of their host halos. With the extension, subhalo merger trees in a cosmological scale simulation are extrapolated to a mass resolution comparable to that in a higher-resolution simulation carried out in a smaller volume, which can be used as the input for (sub)halo-based models of galaxy formation. The source code of the algorithm, and halo merger trees extended to a mass resolution of $\sim 2 \times 10^8 h^{-1}M_\odot$ in the entire ELUCID simulation, are available.</description>

      <title>Massive Dark Matter Halos at High Redshift: Implications for Observations in the JWST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13890v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of massive galaxies at high $z$ as recently observed by JWST appears to contradict the current $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Here we aim to alleviate this tension by incorporating uncertainties from three sources in counting galaxies: cosmic variance, error in stellar mass estimation, and backsplash enhancement. Each of these factors significantly increases the cumulative stellar mass density $\rho_*(&gt;M_*)$ at the high-mass end, and their combined effect can boost the density by more than one order of magnitude. Assuming a star formation efficiency of $\epsilon_* \sim 0.5$, cosmic variance alone reduces the tension to a $2\sigma$ level, except for the most massive galaxy at $z=8$. Additionally, incorporating a 0.3 dex lognormal dispersion in the stellar mass estimation brings the observed $\rho_*(&gt;M_*)$ at $z \sim 7 - 10$ within $2\sigma$. The tension is completely eliminated when we account for the gas stripped from backsplash halos. These results highlight the importance of fully modeling uncertainties when interpreting observational data of rare objects. We use the constrained simulation, ELUCID, to investigate the descendants of high-$z$ massive galaxies. Our findings reveal that a significant portion of these galaxies ultimately reside in massive halos at $z=0$ with $M_{\rm halo} &gt; 10^{13} h^{-1}M_\odot$. Moreover, a large fraction of local central galaxies in $M_{\rm halo} \geqslant 10^{14.5} h^{-1}M_\odot$ halos are predicted to contain substantial amounts of ancient stars formed in massive galaxies at $z \sim 8$. This prediction can be tested by studying the structure and stellar population of central galaxies in present-day massive clusters.</description>

      <title>The Resolution of the Gauge Problem of Cosmology provides Insight into the Formation of the First Structures in the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18658v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to four fundamental problems in the field of cosmological perturbation theory. Firstly, the issue of gauge dependence has been addressed by demonstrating the existence of unique and gauge-invariant quantities corresponding to the actual perturbations. Secondly, the formation of primordial structures after decoupling of matter and radiation is dependent on the existence of local fluid flows resulting from local pressure gradients. To take pressure gradients into account, it is necessary to consider both the energy density and the particle number density. Thirdly, the novel relativistic perturbation theory applies to an open, flat, and closed Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker universe. The derivation of the novel perturbation theory definitively reveals the inherent limitations of Newtonian gravitation as a framework for investigating cosmological density perturbations. Finally, the application of the perturbation theory to a flat universe demonstrates that, prior to decoupling, perturbations in both Cold Dark Matter and ordinary matter are coupled to perturbations in radiation. Therefore, the universe's earliest structures formed only after decoupling, at which point local nonadiabatic random pressure fluctuations became a significant factor. Negative nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations resulted in a brief, rapid growth of density fluctuations until the total pressure fluctuations became positive. In contrast, positive nonadiabatic pressure fluctuations led to the formation of voids. Perturbations with masses about $2.2\times10^{4}\,\text{M}_\odot$ became nonlinear already $60$ million years after the Big Bang, and perturbations with masses between $6.7\times10^2\,\text{M}_\odot$ and $1.2\times10^6\,\text{M}_\odot$ became nonlinear within about $600$ million years.</description>

      <title>Exploring Leptogenesis in the Era of First Order Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for implementing baryogenesis via leptogenesis at low scale within neutrino seesaw framework where a sufficient lepton asymmetry can be generated via out of equilibrium CP-violating decays of right handed neutrinos (RHNs) even when their mass falls below the Standard Model (SM) Higgs mass. It becomes possible by keeping the sphaleron in equilibrium below its conventional decoupling temperature $T_{\rm sp}^{\rm SM} \sim131.7$ GeV in SM so as to facilitate the conversion of lepton asymmetry to baryon asymmetry at such a low scale, thanks to the flexibility of the bubble nucleation temperature in case the electroweak phase transition (EWPT) is of first order. The scenario emerges as an exciting (and perhaps unique) possibility for low scale leptogenesis, particularly if the Universe attains a reheating temperature lower than 131.7 GeV. We show that a stochastic gravitational wave, characteristic of such first order EWPT, may be detected in near future detectors while the presence of RHNs of mass as low as 35 GeV opens up an intriguing detection possibility at current and future accelerator experiments.</description>

      <title>High-energy gamma-ray emission from memory-burdened primordial black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Theoretical studies on the memory-burden effect suggest that Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) with masses smaller than $10^{15}$ grams may be viable dark matter candidates and, consequently, be potential sources of high-energy particles in the present Universe. In this paper, we investigate the evaporation of memory-burdened PBHs into high-energy gamma-rays. Differently from previous analyses, we account for the attenuation of gamma-rays caused by their interaction with background radiation at energies above $10^5~{\rm GeV}$, as well as the secondary emission from the electromagnetic cascades generated during the propagation through extragalactic space. Performing a likelihood analysis with current gamma-ray data, we place new constraints on the parameter space of memory-burdened PBHs. Our results show that ultra-high-energy diffuse gamma-ray observations set more restrictive bounds than high-energy neutrino data, particularly in scenarios with a strong memory-burden suppression of the PBH evaporation.</description>

      <title>Simple third order operator-splitting schemes for stochastic mechanics and field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing numerical schemes with up to 3rd strong convergence order for solution of a class of stochastic differential equations, including equations of the Langevin type. The construction proceeds in two stages. In the first stage one approximates the stochastic equation by a differential equation with smooth coefficients randomly sampled at each time step. In the second stage the resulting regular equation is solved with the conventional operator-splitting techniques. This separation renders the approach flexible, allowing one to freely combine the numerical techniques most suitable to the problem at hand. The approach applies to ordinary and partial stochastic differential equations. In the latter case, it naturally gives rise to pseudo-spectral algorithms. We numerically test the strong convergence of several schemes obtained with this method in mechanical examples. Application to partial differential equations is illustrated by real-time simulations of a scalar field with quartic self-interaction coupled to a heat bath. The simulations accurately reproduce the thermodynamic properties of the field and are used to explore dynamics of thermal false vacuum decay in the case of negative quartic coupling.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dark matter production from fermionic spectator fields during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational particle production from vacuum for a minimally coupled fermionic spectator field during a single-field inflationary phase. We observe that metric perturbations arising from the quantum fluctuations of a scalar inflaton field enhance gravitational production, showing that such a perturbative contribution becomes dominant if the field mass is sufficiently smaller than the inflationary Hubble rate. We focus on modes that leave the Hubble horizon during the latest stages of slow-roll and we numerically compute the total number of particles obtained from perturbations, providing a lower bound on the amount of such \enquote{geometric} particles for the case of Starobinsky inflation and a quadratic hilltop scenario. Our outcomes are compatible with the net observational cold dark matter abundance as experimentally measured, whose dark matter candidate exhibits mass in the range $10^5 \lesssim m \lesssim 10^7$ GeV, excluded by previous non-perturbative calculations.</description>

      <title>Supernovae at Distances &lt; 40 Mpc: I.Catalogues and fractions of Supernovae in a Complete Sample</title>

Abstract: Context.This is the first paper of a series aiming to determine the fractions and birth rates of various types of supernovae (SNe) in the local Universe. Aims. In this paper, we aim to construct a complete sample of SNe in the nearby universe and provide more precise measurement of subtype fractions. Methods.We carefully selected our SN sample at a distance of &lt; 40 Mpc mainly from wide-field surveys conducted over the years from 2016 to 2023. Results.The sample contains a total of 211 SNe, including 109 SNe II, 69 SNe Ia, and 33 SNe Ibc. With the aid of sufficient spectra, we can obtain relatively accurate subtype classifications for all SNe in this sample. After corrections for the Malmquist bias, this volume-limited sample gives fractions of SNe Ia, SNe Ibc, and SNe II as $30.4^{+3.7}_{-11.5}\%$, $16.3^{+3.7}_{-7.4}\%$, and $53.3^{+9.5}_{-18.7}\%$, respectively.In the SN Ia sample, the fraction of the 91T-like subtype becomes relatively low (~5.4\%), while that of the 02cx-like subtype shows a moderate increase (~6.8\%). In the SN Ibc sample, we find significant fractions of broadlined SNe Ic (~18.0\%) and SNe Ibn (~8.8\%). The fraction of 87A-like subtype is determined as ~2.3\% for the first time, indicating rare explosions from blue supergiant stars. We find that SNe Ia show a double peak number distribution in S0- and Sc-type host galaxies, which may serve as a straightforward evidence for the presence of "prompt" and "delayed" progenitor components giving rise to SN Ia explosions. Several subtypes of SNe such as 02cx-like SNe Ia, broadlined SNe Ic, SNe IIn (and perhaps SNe Ibn) are found to occur preferentially in less massive spiral galaxies, favoring their associations with young stellar progenitors. Moreover, the 02cx-like subtype shows a trend of exploding in the outer skirt of their hosts, suggestive of metal-poor progenitors.</description>

      <title>A Power-law Inflation Tail for the Standard $R^2$-Inflation and the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conceptual problems of the standard slow-roll inflationary scenario include the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture issue, which severely restricts the tensor-to-scalar ratio in the standard minimally coupled scalar field inflation. Motivated by the fact that a scalar field in its vacuum configuration can be minimally coupled to gravity, or conformally coupled, and also that the first quantum corrections of the scalar field action include $R^2$ corrections, in this work we assume that $R^2$ gravity in the presence of a scalar field with constant equation of state parameter co-exist and control the early Universe. Constant equation of state parameter scalar field result from exponential scalar potentials. In our approach, the standard slow-roll era is controlled by the $R^2$ gravity and is followed by a power-law inflationary tail governed by a minimally coupled scalar field with an quintessential equation of state parameter, stemming from an exponential scalar potential. The fact that the total equation of state parameter after the end of the slow-roll era is equal to the value determined by the scalar field, has an effect on the duration of the $R^2$ governed slow-roll era, and it actually shortens the duration of the slow-roll era, by an extent which depends on the reheating temperature too, after all the inflationary patches have ended. The power-law inflationary tail to the standard $R^2$ inflation, solves the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture issues, and also the Swampland conjecture can be amended in this context. We also perform a dynamical system study to confirm numerically our findings.</description>

      <title>Consistency relation for the cosmological effects of modified gravity on gravitational waves and large scale structure observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) of dark energy provides a unified model independent theoretical framework to study the effects of dark energy and modified gravity. We show that the EFT allows to derive a theory independent consistency relation between the effective gravitational constant, the gravitational and electromagnetic luminosity distance and the speed of gravitational waves (GW), which generalizes the results obtained in some luminal modified gravity theories.
  We apply the consistency relation to map the large scale structure observational constraints on the effective gravitational constant to GW-EMW distance ratio constraints. The consistency relation allows to probe the value of the effective gravitational constant with multimessenger observations, independently from large scale structure observations, or at high redshift, where only GW events and their electromagnetic counterpart are observable.</description>

      <title>Dark energy under a gauge symmetry: A review of gauged quintessence and its implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the gauged quintessence scenario, wherein the quintessence scalar field responsible for dark energy is promoted to a complex field charged under a dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry. This construction leads to new and potentially rich cosmological phenomenology. After a concise recap of the standard quintessence scenario, we highlight how a $U(1)$ gauge invariance alters the dynamics of the scalar and the associated dark gauge boson. We survey the evolution of both fields across cosmic history, discuss their possible production via a misalignment mechanism, and examine implications for the Hubble tension. We also comment on potential non-gravitational signals of gauged quintessence through kinetic mixing (the dark photon vector portal).</description>

      <title>The universal crossover from thermodynamics and dynamics of supercritical RN-AdS black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of supercritical Reissner-Nordstr\"om Anti-de Sitter (RN-AdS) black holes in the extended phase space with the pressure defines as the cosmological constant. Supercritical black holes exist in the region where both temperature and pressure exceed the critical point, known as the supercritical region. The conventional view states that black holes in this regime are indistinguishable between large and small phases. However, recent research reveals that the supercritical regime exhibits universal gas-like and liquid-like phase separation, which shed light on the study on the supercritical region of RN-AdS black holes in the extended phase space. In this work, we calculate the thermodynamic potential and quasinormal modes (QNMs) of RN-AdS black holes, and identify transition curves between two different states in supercritical region using thermodynamic and dynamic methods. On one hand, we find the thermodynamic crossover curve (Widom line) by defining the scaled variance $\Omega$ (a higher-order derivative of Gibbs free energy). On the other hand, we identify the dynamic crossover curve (Frenkel line) by analyzing transitions between distinct QNM decay modes.</description>

      <title>Limits on primordial non-Gaussianities from BOSS galaxy-clustering data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.11518v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the power spectrum and the bispectrum of BOSS galaxy-clustering data using the prediction from the Effective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure at one-loop order for $\textit{both}$ the power spectrum $\textit{and}$ the bispectrum. With $\Lambda$CDM parameters fixed to Planck preferred values, we set limits on three templates of non-Gaussianities predicted by many inflationary models: the equilateral, the orthogonal, and the local shapes. After validating our analysis against simulations, we find $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm equil.}= 207 \pm 292\, , f_{\rm NL}^{\rm orth.}= -68 \pm 73\, , f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc.}= 52 \pm 34$, at $68\%$ confidence level. These bispectrum-based constraints from Large-Scale Structure, not far from the ones of WMAP, suggest promising results from upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Signals of merging supermassive black holes in pulsar timing arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we evaluate whether the gravitational wave background recently observed by a number of different pulsar timing arrays could be due to merging primordial supermassive black hole binaries. We find that for homogeneously distributed primordial black holes this possibility is inconsistent with strong cosmological and astrophysical constraints on their total abundance. If the distribution exhibits some clustering, however, the merger rate will, in general, be enhanced, opening the window for a consistent interpretation of the pulsar timing array data in terms of merging primordial black holes, if $\mu$-distortion constraints associated with the formation mechanism can be evaded.</description>

Abstract: Time delays from strong gravitational lensing provide a one-step absolute distance measurement. Thus, they measure $H_0$ independently of all other probes. We first review the foundations and history of time-delay cosmography. Then, we illustrate the current state of the art by means of two recent case studies that have been real breakthroughs: i) the quadruply imaged quasar lensed by a galaxy-scale deflector RXJ1131$-$1231, for which spatially resolved stellar kinematics is available; ii) the multiply imaged supernova "Refsdal", the first with measured time delays, lensed by cluster MACS1149.5$+$2223. We conclude by discussing the exciting future prospects of time-delay cosmography in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice I: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5%-20% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We find a simple universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

      <title>Evaluating quenching in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation with spectral covariance in the optical window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide valuable insights on galaxy evolution when coupled with observational data. Comparisons with real galaxies are typically performed via scaling relations of the observables. Here we follow an alternative approach based on the spectral covariance in a model-independent way. We build upon previous work by Sharbaf et al. that studied the covariance of high quality SDSS continuum-subtracted spectra in a relatively narrow range of velocity dispersion ($\sigma\in [100,150]$\,km\,s$^{-1}$). Here the same analysis is applied to synthetic data from the EAGLE and Illustris TNG100 simulations, to assess the ability of these runs to mimic real galaxies. The real and simulated spectra are consistent regarding spectral covariance, although with subtle differences that can inform the implementation of subgrid physics. Spectral fitting done a posteriori on stacks segregated with respect to latent space reveals that the first principal component (PC1) is predominantly influenced by the stellar age distribution, with an underlying age-metallicity degeneracy. Good agreement is found regarding star formation prescriptions but there is disagreement with AGN feedback, that also affects the subset of quiescent galaxies. We show a substantial difference in the implementation of the AGN subgrid prescriptions, regarding central black hole seeding, that could lead to the mismatch. Differences are manifest between these two simulations in the star formation histories stacked with respect to latent space. We emphasise that this methodology only relies on the spectral covariance to assess whether simulations provide a true representation of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Clustering with LSST: Effects of Number Count Bias from Blending</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will survey the southern sky to create the largest galaxy catalog to date, and its statistical power demands an improved understanding of systematic effects such as source overlaps, also known as blending. In this work we study how blending introduces a bias in the number counts of galaxies (instead of the flux and colors), and how it propagates into galaxy clustering statistics. We use the $300\,$deg$^2$ DC2 image simulation and its resulting galaxy catalog (LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration et al. 2021) to carry out this study. We find that, for a LSST Year 1 (Y1)-like cosmological analyses, the number count bias due to blending leads to small but statistically significant differences in mean redshift measurements when comparing an observed sample to an unblended calibration sample. In the two-point correlation function, blending causes differences greater than 3$\sigma$ on scales below approximately $10'$, but large scales are unaffected. We fit $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and linear galaxy bias in a Bayesian cosmological analysis and find that the recovered parameters from this limited area sample, with the LSST Y1 scale cuts, are largely unaffected by blending. Our main results hold when considering photometric redshift and a LSST Year 5 (Y5)-like sample.</description>

      <title>New analysis of SNeIa Pantheon Catalog: Variable speed of light as an alternative to dark energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05262v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In A&amp;A 412, 35 (2003) Blanchard, Douspis, Rowan-Robinson, and Sarkar (BDRS) slightly modified the primordial fluctuation spectrum and produced an excellent fit to WMAP's CMB power spectrum for an Einstein-de Sitter (EdS) universe, bypassing dark energy. Curiously, they obtained a Hubble value of $H_0\approx46$, in sharp conflict with the canonical range $H_0\sim67-73$. However, we will demonstrate that the reduced value of $H_0\approx46$ achieved by BDRS is fully compatible with the use of variable speed of light in analyzing the late-time cosmic acceleration observed in Type Ia supernovae (SNeIa). In Phys. Lett. B 862, 139357 (2025) we uncovered a hidden aspect in a generic class of scale-invariant actions: the dynamics of the dilaton can induce a variation in the speed of light as $c\propto\chi^{1/2}$, causing $c$ to vary alongside $\chi$ across spacetime. For an EdS universe with varying $c$, besides the effects of cosmic expansion, light waves emitted from distant SNeIa are further subject to a refraction effect, which alters the Lemaitre redshift relation to $1+z=a^{-3/2}$. Based on this new formula, we achieve a fit to the SNeIa Pantheon Catalog exceeding the quality of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Crucially, our approach does not require dark energy and produces $H_0=47.2$ in strong alignment with the BDRS finding of $H_0\approx46$. Hence, BDRS's analysis of the (early-time) CMB power spectrum and our variable-$c$ analysis of the (late-time) Hubble diagram of SNeIa fully agree on two counts: (i) the dark energy hypothesis is avoided, and (ii) $H_0$ is reduced to $\sim47$, which also yields an age $t_0=2/(3H_0)=13.8$ Gy for an EdS universe, without requiring dark energy. Most importantly, we will demonstrate that the late-time acceleration can be attributed to the declining speed of light in an expanding EdS universe, rather than to a dark energy component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mass of galaxy clusters estimated from weak-lensing observations is affected by projection effects, leading to a systematic underestimation compared to the true cluster mass, varying with both mass and redshift. The magnitude depends on the criteria used to select clusters and the spatial scale over which their mass is measured. We leverage hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters carried out with GadgetX and GIZMO-SIMBA as part of the Three Hundred project. We used them to quantify weak-lensing mass biases with respect also to the results from dark matter-only simulations. We also investigate how the biases propagate into the richness-mass relation. We aim to shed light on the effect of the presence of baryons on the weak-lensing mass bias and also whether this bias depends on the galaxy formation recipe; we seek to model the richness-mass relation that can be used as guidelines for observational experiments for cluster cosmology. We produced weak-lensing simulations of random projections to model the expected excess surface mass density profile of clusters up to redshift $z=1$. We then estimated the observed richness by counting the number of galaxies in a cylinder and correcting by projected contaminants. We derived the weak-lensing mass-richness relation and found consistency across hydrodynamical simulations. The intercept parameter of the relation is independent of redshift but varies with the minimum of the stellar mass to define the richness. At the same time, the slope is relatively constant up to $z=0.55$. The scatter in observed richness at a fixed weak-lensing mass increases linearly with redshift at a fixed stellar mass cut. As expected, we observed that the scatter in richness at a given true mass is smaller than at a given weak-lensing mass. Our results for the weak-lensing mass-richness relation align well with SDSS redMaPPer cluster analyses. [Abridged]</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>

Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Unexpected clustering pattern in dwarf galaxies challenges formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The galaxy correlation function serves as a fundamental tool for studying cosmology, galaxy formation, and the nature of dark matter. It is well established that more massive, redder and more compact galaxies tend to have stronger clustering in space. These results can be understood in terms of galaxy formation in Cold Dark Matter (CDM) halos of different mass and assembly history. Here, we report an unexpectedly strong large-scale clustering for isolated, diffuse and blue dwarf galaxies, comparable to that seen for massive galaxy groups but much stronger than that expected from their halo mass. Our analysis indicates that the strong clustering aligns with the halo assembly bias seen in simulations with the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology only if more diffuse dwarfs formed in low-mass halos of older ages. This pattern is not reproduced by existing models of galaxy evolution in a $\Lambda$CDM framework, and our finding provides new clues for the search of more viable models. Our results can be explained well by assuming self-interacting dark matter, suggesting that such a scenario should be considered seriously.</description>

      <title>Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent. Such an energy-scale-dependent behavior is typical in quantum field theory and quantum gravity under renormalization group considerations, however in the present scenario it has an additional justification, since in realistic cases one expects that Barrow entropy quantum-gravitational effects to be stronger at early times and to smooth out and disappear at late times. We impose specific, redshift-dependent ans\"{a}tze for the Barrow running exponent, such as the linear, CPL-like, exponential, and trigonometric ones, and we investigate their cosmological behavior. We show that we can recover the standard thermal history of the universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy epochs, in which the transition from deceleration to acceleration happens at $z\approx 0.65$, in agreement with observations. In the most realistic case of hyperbolic tangent ansatz, in which we can easily bound Barrow exponent inside its theoretically determined bounds 0 and 1 for all redshifts, we see that the dark-energy equation-of-state parameter can be quintessence like, or experience the phantom-divide crossing, while in the future it can either tend to the cosmological constant value or start increasing again. All these features reveal that Barrow holographic dark energy with varying exponent is not only theoretically more justified than the standard, constant-exponent case, but it leads to richer cosmological behavior too.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12797v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>Large neutrino mass in cosmology and keV sterile neutrino dark matter from a dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an extended seesaw model which generates active neutrino masses via the usual type-I seesaw and leads to a large number of massless fermions as well as a sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100) {\rm~keV}$ mass range. The dark sector comes into thermal equilibrium with Standard Model neutrinos after neutrino decoupling and before recombination via a U(1) gauge interaction in the dark sector. This suppresses the abundance of active neutrinos and therefore reconciles sizeable neutrino masses with cosmology. The DM abundance is determined by freeze-out in the dark sector, which allows avoiding bounds from X-ray searches. Our scenario predicts a slight increase in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ at recombination, potentially detectable by future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>Background-dependent and classical correspondences between $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $f(Q)$ and $f(T)$ gravity are based on fundamentally different geometric frameworks, yet they exhibit many similar properties. This article provides a comprehensive summary and comparative analysis of the various theoretical branches of torsional gravity and non-metric gravity, which arise from different choices of affine connection. We identify two types of background-dependent and classical correspondences between these two theories of gravity. The first correspondence is established through their equivalence within the Minkowski spacetime background. To achieve this, we develop the tetrad-spin formulation of $f(Q)$ gravity and derive the corresponding expression for the spin connection. The second correspondence is based on the equivalence of their equations of motion. Utilizing a metric-affine approach, we derive the general affine connection for static and spherically symmetric spacetime in $f(Q)$ gravity and compare its equations of motion with those of $f(T)$ gravity. Among others, our results reveal that, $f(T)$ solutions are not simply a subset of $f(Q)$ solutions; rather, they encompass a complex solution beyond $f(Q)$ gravity in black hole background.</description>

      <title>A new constraint on galaxy-halo connections of [O II] emitters via HOD modelling with angular clustering and luminosity functions from the Subaru HSC survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing a robust connection model between emission-line galaxies (ELGs) and their host dark haloes is of paramount importance in anticipation of upcoming redshift surveys. We propose a novel halo occupation distribution (HOD) framework that incorporates galaxy luminosity, a key observable reflecting ELG star-formation activity, into the galaxy occupation model. This innovation enables prediction of galaxy luminosity functions (LFs) and facilitates joint analyses using both angular correlation functions (ACFs) and LFs. Using physical information from luminosity, our model provides more robust constraints on the ELG-halo connection compared to methods relying solely on ACF and number density constraints. Our model was applied to [O II]-emitting galaxies observed at two redshift slices at $z=1.193$ and $1.471$ from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam PDR2. Our model effectively reproduces observed ACFs and LFs observed in both redshift slices. Compared to the established \citeauthor{geach12} HOD model, our approach offers a more nuanced depiction of ELG occupation across halo mass ranges, suggesting a more realistic representation of ELG environments. Our findings suggest that ELGs at $z\sim1.4$ may evolve into Milky-Way-like galaxies, as their inferred halo masses evolve accordingly based on the extended Press--Schechter formalism, highlighting their role as potential building blocks in galaxy formation scenarios. By incorporating the LF as a constraint linking galaxy luminosity to halo properties, our HOD model provides a more precise understanding of ELG-host halo relationships. Furthermore, this approach facilitates the generation of high-quality ELG mock catalogues of for future surveys. As the LF is a fundamental observable, our framework is potentially applicable to diverse galaxy populations, offering a versatile tool for analysing data from next-generation galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Searches for Power-Law Warped Extra Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extra dimensions with a bulk dilaton field can be power-law warped, unlike the exponential warping in the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model. We show that this mildly warped extra dimension can address the hierarchy problem with a novel Kaluza-Klein (KK) spectrum characterized by lighter feebly coupled KK modes compared to the KK modes in the RS model. We investigate the prospects of searching for signatures of such KK modes at current and future colliders, such as the LHC, CLIC, and FCC-ee using visible decays of KK gravitons. We also update the current bounds and projected limits for the RS model and the linear dilaton (LD) model. Furthermore, we explore the long-lived regime of KK gravitons at beam dump experiments, e.g., FASER2, MATHUSLA, and SHiP, as well as constraints from astrophysical and cosmological observations. We find that combining both kinds of searches will enable comprehensive coverage of the model parameter space relevant to the electroweak hierarchy problem.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23710v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a statistical study on the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) seeded by gravothermal core-collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshifts, using a semi-analytical framework based on Monte-Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal collapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Nature of Virgil: An Obscured AGN Lurking Within an Apparently Normal Lyman-{\alpha} Emitter During Cosmic Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01852v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the MIRI Extremely Red Object Virgil, a Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z_{spec} = 6.6379 \pm 0.0035$ with the photometric properties of a Little Red Dot. Leveraging new JWST/MIRI imaging from the MIDIS and PAHSPECS programs, we confirm Virgil's extraordinary nature among galaxies in JADES/GOODS-South, exhibiting a strikingly red NIRCam-to-MIRI color (F444W $-$ F1500W = $2.84\pm0.04$ mag). Deep NIRSpec/PRISM spectroscopy from the OASIS program offers key insights into the host galaxy, revealing properties of an average star-forming galaxy during Cosmic Reionization, such as a subsolar metallicity, low-to-moderate dust content, and a relatively high ionization parameter and electron temperature. By estimating the star formation rate of Virgil from UV and H$\alpha$, we find evidence that the galaxy is either entering or fading out of a bursty episode. Although line-ratio diagnostics employed at high-$z$ would classify Virgil as an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), this classification becomes ambiguous once redshift evolution is considered. Nonetheless, Virgil occupies the same parameter space as recently confirmed AGNs at similar redshifts. The new deep MIRI data at 15 $\mu$m reinforce the AGN nature of Virgil, as inferred from multiple spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes. Virgil's rising infrared SED and UV excess resemble those of Dust-Obscured Galaxies (DOGs) studied with Spitzer at Cosmic Noon, particularly blue-excess HotDOGs. Our results highlight the need for a multi-wavelength approach incorporating MIRI to uncover such extreme sources at $z\gtrsim6$ and to shed light on the interplay between galaxy evolution and early black hole growth during Cosmic Reionization.</description>
