      <title>Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity</title>

Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling circuits such as random unitaries. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a "non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling. Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as a potential resource for quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Polarization dynamics in vertical-cavity surface emitting lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments and their interpretation on polarization dynamics and polarization switching in vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers operated in the fundamental transverse mode regime are reviewed. Important observations are switching events to a mode with the lower unsaturated gain and the existence of elliptically polarized dynamical transition states after the destabilization of the low-frequency polarization mode. The observations demonstrate the need to consider explicitly the phase properties of the optical field as well as nonlinear effects affecting polarization selection above threshold. Good qualitative agreement is found with a model which takes into account the spin degrees of freedom of the light field as well as of the carriers (`spin-flip model'), if the spin-flip rate is taken to be some tens of $10^9$~s$^{-1}$. This constitutes a strong -- though indirect -- indication that spin dependent processes are important in polarization selection in the devices investigated.</description>

      <title>Hyperchaos and complex dynamical regimes in $N$-dimensional neuron lattices</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of $N$-dimensional lattices of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons coupled with a flow of electrical current. We consider both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings, homogeneous and heterogeneous neurons, and small and large lattices over a wide range of electrical coupling strengths. As the coupling strength is varied, the neurons exhibit a number of complex dynamical regimes, including unsynchronized chaotic spiking, local quasi-bursting, synchronized chaotic bursting, and synchronized hyperchaos. For lattices in higher spatial dimensions, we discover dynamical effects arising from the "destructive interference" of many connected neurons and miniature "phase transitions" from coordinated spiking threshold crossings. In large two- and three-dimensional neuron lattices, we observe emergent dynamics such as local synchronization, quasi-synchronization, and lag synchronization. These results illustrate the rich dynamics that emerge from coupled neurons in multiple spatial dimensions, highlighting how dimensionality, connectivity, and heterogeneity critically shape the collective behavior of neuronal systems.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used.</description>

      <title>Waveform proportionality and Taylor's law in coupled Lorenz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10159</link>

Abstract: Taylor's law (TL), a power-law relationship between the mean and variance of a quantity, has been observed across diverse scientific disciplines. Despite its ubiquity, the underlying mechanisms responsible for TL are not yet fully elucidated. In particular, the frequent empirical observation of TL with an exponent 2 warrants further investigation. In a previous study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 167202 (2025)], we hypothesized that synchronization contributes to the emergence of TL with an exponent 2. To validate this hypothesis, we employed coupled oscillator models, with each oscillator described by a distinct dynamical system: a food chain model, the R\"ossler system, the Brusselator, and the Lorenz system. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrated that strong coupling leads to a form of synchronization wherein time series become proportional to each other, consequently resulting in TL with an exponent 2. Here, we extend our previous findings for the coupled Lorenz system and provide detailed calculations. Our analytical and numerical results demonstrate that, under strong coupling, waveform proportionality and Taylor's law with an exponent 2 emerge not only in the original Lorenz system but also in the generalized and hyperchaotic Lorenz systems.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</description>
