      <title>Emergence of Order in Chemically Active Droplets: Temporal Dynamics and Collective Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behaviors such as swarming, chemical signaling, and clustering are fundamental to biological microorganisms, enabling hierarchical colony formation, coordinated motion, and enhanced nutrient accessibility crucial for their survival. Over the past few decades, extensive research has been dedicated to unraveling the mechanisms underlying these diverse collective patterns through experimental model systems. Among these, active droplets have emerged as valuable synthetic analogs, effectively replicating key biological attributes and serving as ideal platforms for investigating collective phenomena. This research explores the collective behavior of 4-Cyano-4-pentyl-biphenyl (5CB) oil droplets across varying P\'eclet ($Pe$) numbers. At high $Pe$, droplets exhibit a pusher mode of propulsion and form dynamic chain-like patterns. Decreasing $Pe$ enhances repulsive interactions among droplets, resulting in the inhibition of clustering. In the low $Pe$ regime, their repulsive interactions predominated by chemical field lead to the emergence of an ordered structure. Furthermore, we illustrate how active droplets efficiently navigate within a soft structured environment. These findings contribute to our comprehension of self-organized phenomena in active matter systems and provide insights for designing strategies for controlled locomotion in intricate fluidic environments.</description>

      <title>Liquid crystalline structures formed by sphere-rod amphiphilic molecules in solvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules is an important phenomenon attracting a broad range of research. In this work, we study the self-assembly of KTOF4 sphere-rod amphiphilic molecules in mixed water-dioxane solvents. The molecules are of a T-shaped geometry, comprised of a hydrophilic spherical Keggin-type cluster attached by a flexible bridge to the center of a hydrophobic rod-like oligodialkylfluorene (OF), which consists of four OF units. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) uncovers self-assembled spherical structures of KTOF4 in dilute solutions. These spheres are filled with smectic-like layers of KTOF4 separated by layers of the solution. There are two types of layer packings: (i) concentric spheres and (ii) flat layers. The concentric spheres form when the dioxane volume fraction in the solution is 35-50 vol%. The flat layers are formed when the dioxane volume fraction is either below (20 and 30 vol%.) or above (55 and 60 vol%.) the indicated range. The layered structures show no in-plane orientational order and thus resemble thermotropic smectic A liquid crystals and their lyotropic analogs. The layered packings reveal edge and screw dislocations. Evaporation of the solvent produces a bulk birefringent liquid crystal phase with textures resembling the ones of uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. These findings demonstrate that sphere-rod molecules produce a variety of self-assembled structures that are controlled by the solvent properties.</description>

      <title>On the use of neural networks for the structural characterization of polymeric porous materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural characterization is an essential task in the study of porous materials. To achieve reliable results, it requires to evaluate images with hundreds of pores. Current methods require large time amounts and are subjected to human errors and subjectivity. A completely automatic tool would not only speed up the process but also enhance its reliability and reproducibility. Therefore, the main objective of this article is the study of a deep-learning-based technique for the structural characterization of porous materials, through the use of a convolutional neural network. Several fine-tuned Mask R CNN models are evaluated using different training configurations in four separate datasets each composed of numerous SEM images of diverse polymeric porous materials: closed-pore extruded polystyrene (XPS), polyurethane (PU), and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and open-pore PU. Results prove the tool capable of providing very accurate results, equivalent to those achieved by time consuming manual methods, in a matter of seconds.</description>

      <title>Colloidal Model for Investigating Optimal Efficiency in Weakly Coupled Ratchet Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of superparamagnetic colloidal particles along self-assembled tracks using a periodically applied magnetic field as a model for ratchet-like mechanisms. Through video microscopy and simulations, we examine how factors such as particle size, track roughness, and the shape, intensity, and frequency of the applied potential influence transport efficiency. The findings reveal that processive motion can be achieved without residual attraction, with optimal transport efficiency governed by the combined effects of particle size ratios, actuation frequency, track roughness, and asymmetry in the applied potential. Additionally, we explore alternative strategies, including weak residual attraction and alternating magnetic fields, to further enhance efficiency. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of synthetic micro/nanomotors with potential applications in drug delivery and environmental remediation.</description>

      <title>Predicting structure and swelling of microgels with different crosslinker concentrations combining machine-learning with numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microgels made of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) are the prototype of soft, thermoresponsive particles widely used to study fundamental problems in condensed matter physics. However, their internal structure is far from homogeneous, and existing mean-field approaches, such as Flory-Rehner theory, provide only qualitative descriptions of their thermoresponsive behavior. Here, we combine machine learning and numerical simulations to accurately predict the concentration and spatial distribution of crosslinkers, the latter hitherto unknown experimentally, as well as the full swelling behavior of microgels, using only polymer density profiles. Our approach provides unprecedented insight into structural and thermodynamic properties of any standard microgel, including experimental ones.</description>

      <title>Theory of Generalized Hertzian Hyperspheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While hard-sphere models form the foundation of theoretical condensed matter physics, real systems often exhibit some degree of softness. We present a theoretical and numerical study of a class of nearly hard-sphere systems, generalized Hertzian hyperspheres, where particles interact via a finite-range repulsive potential that allows slight overlaps. Well-studied examples of this class include particles with harmonic repulsions, Hertzian spheres, and Hertzian disks. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic properties, coexistence pressures, and scaling laws governing structure and dynamics. The theory predicts how quantities scale with temperature, density, spatial dimension, and potential softness. These theoretical predictions are tested through numerical simulations in dimensions ranging from one to eight.</description>

      <title>Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning for Revealing Structure-Property Relationships in Carbon Nanotube Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose Explainable Multimodal Machine Learning (EMML), which integrates the analysis of diverse data types (multimodal data) using factor analysis for feature extraction with Explainable AI (XAI), for carbon nanotube (CNT) fibers prepared from aqueous dispersions. This method is a powerful approach to elucidate the mechanisms governing material properties, where multi-stage fabrication conditions and multiscale structures have complex influences. Thus, in our case, this approach helps us understand how different processing steps and structures at various scales impact the final properties of CNT fibers. The analysis targeted structures ranging from the nanoscale to the macroscale, including aggregation size distributions of CNT dispersions and the effective length of CNTs. Furthermore, because some types of data were difficult to interpret using standard methods, challenging-to-interpret distribution data were analyzed using Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) for extracting key features that determine the outcome. Contribution analysis with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) demonstrated that small, uniformly distributed aggregates are crucial for improving fracture strength, while CNTs with long effective lengths are significant factors for enhancing electrical conductivity. The analysis also identified thresholds and trends for these key factors to assist in defining the conditions needed to optimize CNT fiber properties. EMML is not limited to CNT fibers but can be applied to the design of other materials derived from nanomaterials, making it a useful tool for developing a wide range of advanced materials. This approach provides a foundation for advancing data-driven materials research.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic stresses in a multi-species suspension of active Janus colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A realistic description of active particles should include interactions with the medium, commonly a momentum-conserving simple fluid, in which they are suspended. In this work, we consider a multi-species suspension of self-diffusiophoretic Janus colloids interacting via chemical and hydrodynamic fields. Through a systematic coarse-graining of the microscopic dynamics, we calculate the multi-component contribution to the hydrodynamic stress tensor of the incompressible Stokesian fluid in which the particles are immersed. For a single species, we find that the strength of the stress produced by the gradients of the number density field is determined by the particles' self-propulsion and chemotactic alignment, and can be tuned to be either contractile or extensile. For a multi-species system, we unveil how different forms of activity modify the stress tensor, and how non-reciprocity in hydrodynamic interactions emerges in an active binary mixture.</description>

      <title>Strain stiffening due to stretching of entangled particles in random packings of granular materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stress-strain relations for random packings of entangling chains under triaxial compression can exhibit strain stiffening and sustain stresses several orders-of-magnitude beyond typical granular materials. X-ray tomography reveals the transition to this strong strain stiffening occurs when chains are long enough to entangle an average of about one chain each, which results in system-filling clusters of entangled chains. The number of entanglements is nearly proportional to the area surrounded by entangling particles with an excluded volume effect. A tendency was found for chain links to stretch when the packing was strained. The slope of the stress-strain relation of the packing can be calculated from a mean-field model consisting of the product of the effective extensional modulus of the chain, packing fraction, probability of stretched links, and the ratio of strain of stretched links to packing strain. The stress-strain model requires as input measurements of the ratio between local particle deformation and global average strain, and the probability of stretching for non-rigid particles. This results in a quadratic prediction for the stress-strain curve, with a curvature that agrees with experiments within the model uncertainties. This model explains that the strength of these packings comes from stretching of the links of chains, but only when the system-filling network of entanglements provides constraints that prevents failure by shear banding, so that particles must be deformed to move further under strain. In this model, the increasing slope of the stress-strain curve is mainly due to the fraction of stretched links increasing with strain. This model for the stress-strain relation is shown to be generalizable to different shapes of entangling particles by applying it to staples.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Bending Boundary Layer: the $\lambda$-test</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the mechanics of two asymmetric ribbons bound at one end and pulled apart at the other ends. We characterize the elastic junction near the bonding and conceptualize it as a bending boundary layer. While the size of this junction decreases with the pulling force, we observe the surprising existence of the binding angle as a macroscopic signature of the bending stiffnesses. Our results thus challenge the standard assumption of neglecting bending stiffness of thin shells at large tensile loading. In addition, we show how the rotational response of the structure exhibits a non-linear and universal behavior regardless of the ratio of asymmetry. Leveraging the independence of the binding angle to the pulling force, we finally introduce the $\lambda$-test -- a visual measurement technique to characterize membranes through simple mechanical coupling.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics; in particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales. For fluid flow in slit-shaped nanopores, we demonstrate that surface morphology provides an efficient control on the slip length, which approaches zero when matching the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively. The hydrodynamic permeability corroborates that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity below its bulk value; wide pores exhibit a crossover between boundary and bulk-like flows. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Noting that the investigated fluid model does not form droplets, our findings challenge the universality of previously reported correlations between slippage, solvophobicity, and a depletion zone. Furthermore, they underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The feedback between mechanical and chemical signals plays a key role in controlling many biological processes and collective cell behavior. Here we focus on the emergence of spatiotemporal density waves in a one-dimensional "cell train." Combining a minimal theoretical model with observations in an in vitro experimental system of MDCK epithelial cells confined to a linear pattern, we examine the spontaneous oscillations driven by the feedback between myosin activation and mechanical deformations and their effect on the response of the tissue to externally applied deformations. We show that the nature and frequency of spontaneous oscillations is controlled by the size of the cell train, with a transition from size-dependent standing waves to intrinsic spontaneous waves at the natural frequency of the tissue. The response to external boundary perturbations exhibit a resonance at this natural frequency, providing a possible venue for inferring the mechanochemical couplings that control the tissue behavior from rheological experiments.</description>
