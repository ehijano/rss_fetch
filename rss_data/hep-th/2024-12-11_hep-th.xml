      <title>Dependence of the induced vacuum energy of scalar matter in the background of an impenetrable magnetic tube on the coupling to the space-time curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We considered the vacuum polarization of a quantized charged scalar matter field in the background of a finite-thickness tube with magnetic flux inside. The tube is impenetrable for quantum matter and a Robin-type boundary condition is imposed at its surface. We have shown that in the flat space-time the total induced vacuum energy does not depend on the coupling $(\xi)$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only for the partial cases of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the tube's edge. However, for generalized Robin boundary conditions, the total induced energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in flat space-time, at least for negative values of the boundary condition parameter $-\pi/2&lt;\theta&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Counting microstates of out-of-equilibrium black hole fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and count the microstates of out-of-equilibrium eternal AdS black holes in which a shell carrying an order one fraction of the black hole mass is emitted from the past horizon and re-absorbed at the future horizon. Our microstates have semiclassical interpretations in terms of matter propagating behind the horizon. We show that they span a Hilbert space with a dimension equal to the exponential of the horizon area of the intermediate black hole. This is consistent with the idea that, in a non-equilibrium setting, entropy is the logarithm of the number of microscopic configurations consistent with the dynamical macroscopic state. In our case, therefore, the entropy should measure the number of microstates consistent with a large and atypical macroscopic black hole fluctuation due to which part of the early time state becomes fully known to an external observer.</description>

      <title>Causality bounds from charged shockwaves in 5d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective field theories are constrained by the requirement that their constituents never move superluminally on non-trivial backgrounds. In this paper, we study time delays experienced by photons propagating on charged shockwave backgrounds in five dimensions. In the absence of gravity -- where the shockwaves are electric fields sourced by boosted charges -- we derive positivity bounds for the four-derivative corrections to electromagnetism, reproducing previous results derived from scattering amplitudes. By considering the gravitational shockwaves sourced by Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes, we derive new constraints in the presence of gravity. We observe the by-now familiar weakening of positivity bounds in the presence of gravity, but without the logarithmic divergences present in 4d. We find that the strongest bounds appear by examining the time delay near the horizon of the smallest possible black hole, and discuss on the validity of the EFT expansion in this region. We comment on our bounds in the context of the swampland program as well as their relation with the positivity bounds obtained from dispersion relations.</description>

      <title>Fortuity in SYK Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fortuity phenomenon in supersymmetric Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. For generic choices of couplings, all the BPS states in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY SYK model are fortuitous. The SYK models reveal an intimate connection between fortuity and the Schwarzian description of supersymmetric black holes, reflected in a sharp feature of $R$-charge concentration - microscopically, all the fortuitous states are concentrated in particular charge sectors. We propose that both $R$-charge concentration and the random matrix behavior near the BPS states are key properties of a generic $q$-local supercharge and formulate these as a supercharge chaos conjecture. We expect supercharge chaos to hold universally for supercharges in holographic CFTs near their fortuitous states, potentially providing a microscopic interpretation for the charge constraints of supersymmetric black holes.
  We also construct SYK models that contain both fortuitous states and monotonous states and contrast their properties, providing further evidence that monotonous states are less chaotic than fortuitous states.</description>

      <title>Grey Galaxies in $AdS_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been conjectured \cite{Kim:2023sig} that the end point of the rotational superradiant instability of black holes in $AdS_4$ is a Grey Galaxy: an $\omega=1$ black hole sitting at the centre of $AdS_4$, surrounded by a large disk of rapidly rotating gravitons and other bulk fields. In this paper we study Grey Galaxies in $AdS_5$. In this case, the rotational group is of rank 2, and so has two distinct angular velocities $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$. We demonstrate that $AdS_5$ hosts two qualitatively distinct Grey Galaxy phases: the first with either $\omega_1\approx 1$ or $\omega_2\approx 1$, and the second with both angular velocities $\approx 1$. We use these results to present a conjecture for a part of the phase diagram of ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills (as a function of energy and the two angular momenta) that displays several phase transitions between regular black holes and various Grey Galaxy phases. We present an explicit gravitational construction of the phases in which $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ are both parametrically close to unity, and demonstrate that the corresponding boundary stress tensor is the sum of two pieces. The first is the stress tensor of the central black hole. The second - the contribution of the bulk gas - takes the form of the stress tensor of an equilibrated boundary conformal fluid, rotating at the given angular speeds $\omega_i$. We also briefly comment on the structure of Grey Galaxies in $AdS_D$ for $D &gt; 5$.</description>

Abstract: Consider a conformally covariant four-point function of identical scalar operators with a discrete spectrum, a twist gap, and compatible with the unitarity conditions. We give a mathematical proof confirming that the spectrum and OPE coefficients at large spin and fixed twist always become that of a generalized free field theory.</description>

      <title>Off-Shell Quantum Mechanics as Factorization Algebras on Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present, for the harmonic oscillator and the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system, an alternative formulation of quantum mechanics that is `off-shell': it is based on classical off-shell configurations and thus similar to the path integral. The core elements are Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) algebras and factorization algebras, following a program by Costello and Gwilliam. The BV algebras are the spaces of quantum observables ${\rm Obs}^q(I)$ given by the symmetric algebra of polynomials in compactly supported functions on some interval $I\subset\mathbb{R}$, which can be viewed as functionals on the dynamical variables. Generalizing associative algebras, factorization algebras include in their data a topological space, which here is $\mathbb{R}$, and an assignment of a vector space to each open set, which here is the assignment of ${\rm Obs}^q(I)$ to each open interval $I$. The central structure maps are bilinear ${\rm Obs}^q(I_1)\otimes {\rm Obs}^q(I_2)\rightarrow {\rm Obs}^q(J)$ for disjoint intervals $I_1$ and $I_2$ contained in an interval $J$, which here is the wedge product of the symmetric algebra. We prove, as the central result of this paper, that this factorization algebra is quasi-isomorphic to the factorization algebra of `on-shell' quantum mechanics. In this we extend previous work by including half-open and closed intervals, and by generalizing to the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ system.</description>

      <title>Self-dual compactons in the gauged restricted baby Skyrme model with magnetic impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of compact self-dual solitons in the restricted gauged baby Skyrme model in the presence of a magnetic impurity. The consistent implementation of the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) formalism depends on the relative size between the compacton and the impurity. To address this, we analyze the following scenarios: in the first, the impurity is entirely inside the compacton, and in the second, the impurity fully encircles the compacton. In both cases, the approach has enabled us to set the self-dual potential, achieve the Bogomol'ny bound for the energy, and establish the self-dual or BPS equations whose solutions saturate such a bound. We next focused on obtaining radially symmetric compactons, where for such an aim, we chose two types of functions to solve the BPS system: the first defining a step-type impurity and the second a Gaussian impurity. After solving the BPS system numerically, we depicted the resulting field profiles and highlighted the effects induced on the compacton's size, field profiles, magnetic field, and magnetic flux.</description>

      <title>Exploring types I and IIA effective actions through T-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-established that compactification of type I string theory on a circle $S^{(1)}$ transforms under T-duality into type I' theory, which is the compactification of type IIA string theory on the orbifold $\tilde{S}^{(1)}/\mathbb{Z}_2$, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ combines world-sheet parity with spacetime parity along the dual circle $\tilde{S}^{(1)}$. We speculate that the circular reduction of the classical effective action of type I should transform under the Buscher rules to the corresponding orbifold reduction of the classical effective action of type IIA theory. This symmetry may be used as a constraint to determine the bosonic couplings in the type I effective action and the bosonic couplings in the type IIA effective action that remain non-zero under the orbifold reduction.
  While the bosonic fields in the classical type IIA effective action appear at the 2-derivative, 8-derivative, and higher orders, the effective action of type I includes additional 4-derivative, 6-derivative, and higher-order couplings due to the anomalous Ramond-Ramond (R-R) gauge transformation in the Green-Schwarz mechanism. We demonstrate that the above proposal fixes the leading 2-derivative couplings in type I and type IIA theory, except for the Chern-Simons coupling in type IIA theory, which vanishes under the orbifold reduction. Furthermore, we observe that the higher-derivative couplings in the type I effective action resulting from the anomalous R-R gauge transformation are all at higher genus, which should not transform into any term in type IIA due to the recent observation that T-duality is a symmetry only of the classical effective action.</description>

      <title>Something Anomalies can tell about SM and Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This ia a review of anomalies applied to a bottom-up approach to standard model and gravity. It is divided in two parts. The first consists in a review proper of anomalies in quantum field theories. Anomalies are analyzed according to three different methods: a perturbative one based on Feynman diagram, a non-perturbative one relying on the Schwinger-DeWitt approach and, third, the one hinging on the Atiyah-Singer family's index theorem. The three methods are applied both to chiral gauge anomalies and trace anomalies. The fundamental distinction that our presentation leads to is between obstructive (O) and non-obstructive (NO) anomalies. The former are tied to the non-existence of fermion propagators, which fatally maim the corresponding theory. In the second part we apply this analysis to the SM and various of its extensions immersed in a gravitational background, and find that they all are plagued by a residual chiral trace anomaly. To completely eliminate all kind of dangerous anomalies in SM-like theories we propose a somewhat unconventional scheme, and exemplify it by means of an explicit model. The latter is a left-right symmetric model. We embed it in a Weyl geometry to render it conformal invariant. We then deal with some of its quantum aspects, in particular its even (NO) trace anomalies and the means to preserve its confomal invariance at the quantum level. We briefly review renormalization and unitarity in the framework of similar models discussed in the existing literature. Finally we present a possible (conjectural) application of the model to describe the junction between cosmology and quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing the perturbiner method we study the tree- and one-loop-level amplitudes in (anti)self-dual Yang-Mills, focusing on color-kinematics duality and double copy features; they arise naturally even in the fully off-shell case. In particular, we calculate the respective the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye relations for tree-level Berends-Giele currents and color-kinematics master numerators at one loop, both cases for any number of external particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two explicit expressions for generic singular vectors of type $(r,s)$ of the Virasoro algebra. These results follow from the paper of Bauer et al which presented recursive methods to construct the vectors. The expressions presented here generalise the results of Benoit-Saint Aubin for the type $(1,s)$ singular vectors in two different ways: the first simply solves the recursion through the use of partitions; the second gives explicit formulae for the coefficients in a particular expansion. A Mathematica notebook is available which implements the formulae.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Multi-Entropy Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multi-partite entanglement structure of an evaporating black hole and its Hawking radiation by dividing the radiation into finer subsystems. Using the multi-entropy of these configurations, we define a black hole multi-entropy curve, which describes how the multi-entropy changes during the black hole evaporation. This black hole multi-entropy curve is a natural generalization of the Page curve since the multi-entropy reduces to the entanglement entropy for the bi-partite case. The multi-entropy curve keeps increasing in the early time. It reaches the maximum value at the multi-entropy time, which is later than the Page time, and starts to decrease. However, it does not decrease to zero at the end of the black hole evaporation. This non-zero value of the multi-entropy represents the secret entanglement between Hawking particles.</description>

      <title>Dual equivalence between the Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and two self-dual massive models interacting with matter in $\mathcal{N}=2$, $d=3$ superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric generalization of the dual equivalence between the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model and two massive self-dual models. One of the self-dual models is described by a real scalar superfield, while the other is described by a chiral spinor superfield. The equivalence is analyzed in the presence of dynamical matter chiral superfields. Initially, we establish the duality by demonstrating the existence of master actions that interpolate between the models. We then show that the field equations are identical when the proper identifications are made. Finally, we confirm the dual equivalence by defining a master generating functional, which, after changing the variables, provides the generating functionals of the Maxwell-Chern-Simons model and the two massive self-dual models coupled to matter.</description>

      <title>Probing Line Defect CFT with Mixed-Correlators Bootstrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue our study of the defect CFT on a Maldacena-Wilson line in N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory using Bootstrability -- the conformal bootstrap supplemented with exact integrability data. In this paper, we extend this program to charged sectors of the theory, considering a mixed-correlator setup first introduced by Liendo, Meneghelli, and Mitev. The exact spectrum in all channels is given by integrability at any coupling. Additionally, we use exact expressions for some structure constants fixed by localisation and leverage the exact discrete symmetries of the theory. We analyse the remaining data with the numerical bootstrap, developing an algorithm optimised to scan over a large multidimensional space of OPE coefficients and carve the allowed region with the "cutting surface" procedure. We compute upper and lower bounds for 12 OPE coefficients for several values of the coupling. Our results are sharp for the lowest states in each sector but become quite wide for the excited states due to their near degeneracy. This highlights the need for studying the system with non-protected external states and for further input from integrability in the form of integrated correlators of non-protected operators.</description>

      <title>Interactions between different Kaluza-Klein modes in brane world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In brane-world theory, through Kaluza-Klein(KK) reduction, a higher dimensional U(1) gauge field manifests on the brane as a series of vector and scalar KK modes, while a bulk {fermion field appears as left- and right-handed ones. However, these conclusions rely on a common assumption that there is no interaction between different levels of KK modes. Recent experimental phenomena, such as flavor mixing in particles, suggest that such interactions should be considered. To address this}, we propose an Orthonormal Completeness Hypothesis(OCH) for the basis functions used to} expand the higher dimensional field. Using the OCH, we demonstrate that the effective action of a free bulk U(1) gauge field is intrinsically gauge invariant in brane models with d extra dimensions. Our study also reveals that in higher-dimensional cases, the coupling between different levels of KK modes can only be eliminated by choosing specific basis functions, provided the warp factors satisfy special commutation relations. In general, such couplings are universally present. We present numerical calculations for the U(1) gauge field in an interesting 6D brane world. This method can be extended to fermion fields, and it is shown that interactions between different levels of left- and right-handed KK modes exist, offering new insights into for phenomena like flavor mixing.</description>

      <title>Non-Lorentzian Supergravity and Kinematical Superalgebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present and classify the supersymmetric extensions of extended kinematical algebras, at the basis of non-Lorentzian physics theories. The diverse kinematical superalgebras are here derived by applying non- and ultra-relativistic expansion procedures involving different semigroups. We then build three-dimensional Chern-Simons non-Lorentzian supergravity theories based on such (extended) kinematical superalgebras, providing the supersymmetry transformation laws of the fields and the field equations of the models, which correspond to the vanishing of the curvature two-forms. In fact, the expansion procedure adopted allows to automatically end up with a non-degenerate bilinear invariant trace for the (extended) kinematical superalgebras. The latter is a crucial ingredient of the Chern-Simons field-theoretical formulation, as it allows to include a kinetic term for each gauge field of the theory, implying the vanishing of the curvature two-forms as field equations.</description>

      <title>BPS Dendroscopy on Local $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BPS states in type II string compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold can typically be decomposed as moduli-dependent bound states of absolutely stable constituents, with a hierarchical structure labelled by attractor flow trees. This decomposition is best understood from the scattering diagram, an arrangement of real codimension-one loci (or rays) in the space of stability conditions where BPS states of given electromagnetic charge and fixed phase of the central charge exist. The consistency of the diagram when rays intersect determines all BPS indices in terms of the `attractor indices' carried by the initial rays. In this work we study the scattering diagram for a non-compact toric CY threefold known as local $\mathbb{F}_0$, namely the total space of the canonical bundle over $\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1$. We first construct the scattering diagram for the quiver, valid near the orbifold point, and for the large volume slice, valid when both $\mathbb{P}^1$'s have large (and nearly equal) area. We then combine the insights gained from these simple limits to construct the scattering diagram along the physical slice of $\Pi$-stability conditions, which carries an action of a $\mathbb{Z}^4$ extension of the modular group $\Gamma_0(4)$. We sketch a proof of the Split Attractor Flow Tree Conjecture in this example, albeit for a restricted range of the central charge phase. Most arguments are similar to our early study of local $\mathbb{P}^2$ [arXiv:2210.10712], but complicated by the occurence of an extra mass parameter and ramification points on the $\Pi$-stability slice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1702.03498v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we briefly review the most general form of GUP motivated from nonlocal quantum mechanics discussed in detail by S. Masood, {\em et al}. We apply the special limit of this GUP form to the one-dimension linear potential to calculate the energy correction and the modified wave function. We also discuss the deformation effect on one dimensional delta potential well and one dimensional delta potential barrier. Moreover, we pay attention to the deformation effect on one dimensional hydrogen atom and investigate the Stark effect on the atom separately. Finally, we make a short conclusion.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior and phases of nonlinear sigma model on real Stiefel manifolds near two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a quasi-two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model on the real Stiefel manifolds with a generalized (anisotropic) metric, the equations of a two-charge renormalization group (RG) for the homothety and anisotropy of the metric as effective couplings are obtained in one-loop approximation. Normal coordinates and the curvature tensor are exploited for the renormalization of the metric. The RG trajectories are investigated and the presence of a fixed point common to four critical lines or four phases (tetracritical point) in the general case, or its absence in the case of Abelian structure 8group, is established.</description>

      <title>Late-time tails in nonlinear evolutions of merging black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover late-time gravitational-wave tails in fully nonlinear 3+1 dimensional numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes, using the highly accurate SpEC code. We achieve this result by exploiting the strong magnification of late-time tails due to binary eccentricity, recently observed in perturbative evolutions, and showcase here the tail presence in head-on configurations for several mass ratios close to unity. We validate the result through a large battery of numerical tests and detailed comparison with perturbative evolutions, which display striking agreement with full nonlinear ones. Our results offer yet another confirmation of the highly predictive power of black hole perturbation theory in the presence of a source, even when applied to nonlinear solutions. The late-time tail signal is much more prominent than anticipated until recently, and possibly within reach of gravitational-wave detectors measurements, unlocking observational investigations of an additional set of general relativistic predictions on the long-range gravitational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes (as Dark Matter) from the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study in detail the production of primordial black holes (PBHs), as well as their mass and initial spin, due to the phase transitions corresponding to radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) and featuring a large supercooling. The latter property allows us to use a model-independent approach. In this context, we demonstrate that the decay rate of the false vacuum grows exponentially with time to a high degree of accuracy, justifying a time dependence commonly assumed in the literature. Our study provides ready-to-use results for determining the abundance, mass and initial spin of PBHs generated in a generic RSB model with large supercooling. We find that PBHs are generically produced in a broad region of the model-independent parameter space. Notably, we identify the subregion that may explain recently observed microlensing anomalies. Additionally, we show that a simple Standard-Model extension, with right-handed neutrinos and gauged $B-L$ featuring RSB, may explain an anomaly of this sort in a region of its parameter space.</description>

      <title>Continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions from fixed-point annihilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central concept in the theory of phase transitions beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm is fractionalization: the formation of new quasiparticles that interact via emergent gauge fields. This concept has been extensively explored in the context of continuous quantum phase transitions between distinct orders that break different symmetries. We propose a mechanism for continuous order-to-order quantum phase transitions that operates independently of fractionalization. This mechanism is based on the collision and annihilation of two renormalization group fixed points: a quantum critical fixed point and an infrared stable fixed point. The annihilation of these fixed points rearranges the flow topology, eliminating the disordered phase associated with the infrared stable fixed point and promoting a second critical fixed point, unaffected by the collision, to a quantum critical point between distinct orders. We argue that this mechanism is relevant to a broad spectrum of physical systems. In particular, it can manifest in Luttinger fermion systems in three spatial dimensions, leading to a continuous quantum phase transition between an antiferromagnetic Weyl semimetal state, which breaks time-reversal symmetry, and a nematic topological insulator, characterized by broken lattice rotational symmetry. This continuous antiferromagnetic-Weyl-to-nematic-insulator transition might be observed in rare-earth pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. Other possible realizations include kagome quantum magnets, quantum impurity models, and quantum chromodynamics with supplemental four-fermion interactions.</description>

      <title>The long-range origin of the black hole entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, has emerged as a powerful tool for exploring the quantum nature of black holes, particularly their residual entropy at zero temperature. In this work, we investigate the role of long-range interactions in a chain of SYK dots with power-law decaying couplings and demonstrate how these interactions can lead to finite residual entropy in the strong non-local case. Indeed, as a function of the interaction range, the black-hole phase, found in the isolated SYK, melts into a long-range Fermi-liquid phase in the weak long-range regime and finally reaches the non Fermi-liquid phase in the purely local case. Our results pave the way to the understanding of the role of the interaction range in black hole thermodynamics and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Nonrelativistic Proca stars: Spherical stationary and multi-frequency states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we follow an effective theory approach to study the nonrelativistic limit of a selfgravitating and selfinteracting massive vector field. Our effective theory is characterized by three parameters: the field's mass $m_0$ and the selfinteraction constants $\lambda_n$ and $\lambda_s$. For definiteness, we focus on a systematic study of the equilibrium configurations, commonly referred to as Proca stars when they have finite energy. We identify two different types of Proca stars, depending on the specific sector of the effective theory that we are exploring. In the generic sector, defined by $\lambda_s\neq 0$, all equilibrium configurations are stationary states described by wave functions that evolve harmonically in time. However, in the symmetry-enhanced sector, for which $\lambda_s=0$, there exist multi-frequency states whose wave functions oscillate with two or three distinct frequencies in addition to the stationary states. We determine the conditions under which a ground state configuration with fixed particle number exists. When these conditions are met, we prove that the lowest energy is reached by a stationary spherically symmetric configuration of constant polarization that is linear or circular depending on the sign of $\lambda_s$. We numerically construct some illustrative examples of spherical stationary and multi-frequency solutions, analyze their properties, and compare them with our analytical predictions. Unlike stationary states and other soliton configurations, which form a discrete set in the solution space associated with fixed particle number, the symmetry-enhanced sector exhibits a continuum of solutions with multi-frequency states connecting stationary states of constant polarization.</description>

      <title>Merging black holes with Cauchy-characteristic matching: Computation of late-time tails</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present successful evolutions of binary black hole mergers using a novel numerical-relativity technique known as Cauchy-characteristic matching (CCM). This approach eliminates systematic errors associated with boundary conditions, effectively extending the computational domain to infinity. As an important application, we use CCM to resolve a late-time power-law tail in the gravitational wave from a head-on collision, and show that the tail is highly suppressed in a quasi-circular binary. Our results for the two extreme cases (orbital eccentricity $=0,1$) support the fact that tails increase with orbital eccentricity. Therefore, CCM paves the way for a detailed understanding of tails in eccentric systems. For the head-on case, we find that the tail behavior is consistent with predictions in the intermediate regime from black hole linear perturbation theory. However, we also raise the possibility that the power-law tail could be generated nonlinearly by quasinormal modes. The nonlinear contribution is expected to decay slower than predicted by Price's law, potentially dominating the signal at late times. If confirmed as nonlinear, this would be an example where nonlinearity prevails over linearity in the late-time regime of black hole dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I review a mechanism for a potential explanation of the dominance of matter over antimatter in the Universe (``our existence''), based on a (3+1)-dimensional string-inspired cosmological model, characterised by (uncancelled) gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) anomalies in the premordial epochs. The model is consistent with general covariance but entails spontaneous Lorentz (LV) and CPT Violation (CPTV), due to appropriate backgrounds of axion fields, which couple to the anomaly terms. Upon condensation of the gCS terms, due to primordial gravitational waves, these axions acquire a linear potential, which drives inflation of a Running-Vacuum-Model (RVM) type, while the effective action is also characterised by imaginary parts as well, which imply metastability of this RVM inflation. The axion backgrounds remain undiluted until the exit from inflation, and are responsible for yielding unconventional LV and CPTV Leptogenesis, which is then communicated to the baryon sector (Baryogenesis) via sphaleron processes. The model provides a phenomenologically consistent cosmological evolution from inflation till the modern era.</description>

Abstract: We present analytic results on physical kinematics for four integral families that are relevant to the production of two off-shell vector bosons with different masses. Our study consists of a ladder-box, a tennis-court, and two reducible ladder-box-like families. The results for the master integrals of these families are expressed up to order six in the dimensional regulator in terms of real-valued multiple polylogarithms. Furthermore, a semi-numeric solution is provided, employing generalized power series expansions using the package DiffExp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a baryogenesis mechanism termed scalar-tensor baryogenesis, analogous to gravitational and spontaneous baryogenesis, driven by scalar fields arising from the scalar-tensor representation of modified gravity theories. This mechanism reproduces the original interaction term of gravitational baryogenesis and those commonly introduced in modified gravity contexts. We demonstrate the mechanism within $f(R,T)$ and $f(R)$ gravity frameworks, focusing on $f(R)$. We explore a quintessence potential given by $V(\phi) = \alpha \frac{\phi^{m+1}}{{m+1}}$ and a potential given $V(\phi) = \beta^{-\frac{1}{n-1}}(n-1)\left(\frac{\phi - 1}{n}\right)^{\frac{n}{n-1}}$ that corresponds in the geometric representation to models of the form $R + \beta R^n$. The model with $n=2$ presented the best behavior in generating an acceptable asymmetry during the radiation-dominated epoch. Inspired by this result, employing Planck data, we explored the Starobinsky inflation model obtaining successful baryogenesis during the inflationary epoch for both gravitational and scalar-tensor baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Searching for the classical analogue of Hawking radiation and screening of Coulomb field by the horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of the existence of a classical analogue of Hawking radiation -- solutions to classical field equations that consist solely of outgoing waves, in the spacetime of a collapsing black hole. The non-static nature of the corresponding metric results in the absence of energy conservation for matter, which could otherwise a priori prohibit such solutions. A specific and simple scenario is considered: a black hole formation as a result of the collapse of a thin shell, which is not necessarily dust-like. In the corresponding spacetime, we study solutions of the equations for a real massless scalar field that take the form of purely outgoing waves. In addition to the homogeneous equation, we also examine the case of a constant point source of the field located at the symmetry center. The general solution outside the shell is expressed in terms of the confluent Heun function, while the equations inside the shell and the matching conditions at its surface are formulated as an integral equation. The analysis of various solution asymptotics enables the reduction of the integral equation to a matrix equation, which is subsequently solved numerically.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrino Flavor State Transition Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically determine neutrino transitional probabilities and abundance ratios at various distances from the source of creation in several astrophysical contexts, including the Sun, supernovae and cosmic rays. In doing so, we determine the probability of a higher-order transition state from $\nu_\tau\rightarrow\nu_\lambda$, where $\nu_\lambda$ represents a more massive generation than Standard Model neutrinos. We first calculate an approximate cross section for high-energy neutrinos which allows us to formulate comparisons for the oscillation distances of solar, supernova and higher-energy cosmic ray neutrinos. The flavor distributions of the resulting neutrino populations from each source detected at Earth are then compared via fractional density charts.</description>

      <title>Gravitational focusing and horizon entropy for higher-spin fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previously, the Raychaudhuri equation and the focusing theorem in General Relativity were generalised to diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity coupled to scalar and vector fields on linearly perturbed Killing horizons. The Wall entropy can be extracted from the generalised focusing equation and it satisfies the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. In this paper, we further extend the discussion of gravitational focusing on the horizon to include arbitrary bosonic fields with spin $s \geq 2$. These higher-spin fields introduce indefinite terms into the generalised focusing equation, obstructing the proof of the focusing theorem and the existence of an increasing horizon entropy. To resolve this issue, we propose a higher-spin focusing condition that eliminates these indefinite terms, thereby restoring the focusing theorem and the associated thermodynamic laws. We speculate that the focusing condition could be a necessary condition for the physical consistency of higher-spin theories.</description>

      <title>Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is concrete, bicomplete, and symmetric closed monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vec}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: When $\mathcal C$ is pivotal, we prove that $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators perserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.</description>

      <title>Scale Separation, Strong Coupling UV Phases, and the Identification of the Edge of the Conformal Window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a simple holographic model to discuss approaching the edge of the conformal window in strongly coupled gauge theories to draw lessons for lattice studies. Walking gauge theories have a gap between the scale where they enter the strong coupling regime and the scale of chiral symmetry breaking. We highlight that there can also be a gap between the scale where the critical value of the quark anti-quark operator's anomalous dimension is passed and the scale of the condensate. This potentially makes identifying the edge of the conformal window in a lattice simulation with UV bare coupling below the fixed point value on a finite lattice difficult. A resolution is to study the theory with a coupling above the fixed point value at the UV cut off. Here we show that an ``artefact" phase with chiral symmetry breaking triggered at the UV cut off exists and lies arbitrarily close to the fixed point at the edge of the conformal window. We quantify the chance of a misidentification of a chiral symmetry breaking theory as IR conformal. We also quantify where the artefact phase lies, tuned to the fixed point value. We use the latest lattice results for SU(3) gauge theory with ten quark flavours in [Hasenfratz:2023wbr] as a test case; we conclude their identification that the theory is in the conformal window is reliable.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of AQFTs and prefactorization algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits the equivalence problem between algebraic quantum field theories and prefactorization algebras defined over globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We develop a radically new approach whose main innovative features are 1.) a structural implementation of the additivity property used in earlier approaches and 2.) a reduction of the global equivalence problem to a family of simpler spacetime-wise problems. When applied to the case where the target category is a symmetric monoidal $1$-category, this yields a generalization of the equivalence theorem from [Commun. Math. Phys. 377, 971 (2019)]. In the case where the target is the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of cochain complexes, we obtain a reduction of the global $\infty$-categorical equivalence problem to simpler, but still challenging, spacetime-wise problems. The latter would be solved by showing that certain functors between $1$-categories exhibit $\infty$-localizations, however the available detection criteria are inconclusive in our case.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization around cosmic strings in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are the most popular topological defects arising from the spontaneous breaking of fundamental symmetries in the early Universe. They are the source of a number of interesting effects in cosmology and astrophysics. An interesting effect is the polarization of the vacuum state for quantum fields induced by the non-trivial topology of the spacetime around cosmic strings. In the present paper we describe the combined effects of the straight cosmic string and the gravitational field on the local properties of scalar, spinor and electromagnetic vacua. The local de Sitter spacetime is considered as the background geometry. It is shown that the influence of the spacetime curvature is essential at distances from the string of the order of or larger than the curvature radius. A qualitatively new feature is the appearance of the vacuum energy flux in the radial direction with respect to the cosmic string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Nishimori point of the random bond Ising model is a prototype of renormalization group fixed points with strong disorder. We show that the exact correlation length and crossover critical exponents at this point can be identified in two and three spatial dimensions starting from properties of the Nishimori line. These are the first exact exponents for frustrated random magnets, a circumstance to be also contrasted with the fact that the exact exponents of the Ising model without disorder are not known in three dimensions. Our considerations extend to higher dimensions and models other than Ising.</description>

Abstract: We construct and analyse wormhole solutions in quantised space-time. The field equations are constructed from the deformed wormhole metric in the proper reference frame using tetrads. The spatial geometry of the wormhole is analysed in the kappa space-time. Further, the modifications to the conditions that ensure traversibility of the wormhole are studied and it is found that the necessity of the exotic matter persists in the non-commuative case as in the commutative space-time. Casimir energy is considered a possible source for exotic matter and it is shown that the time to pass through the wormhole as well as the amount of exotic matter required to create the wormhole reduce due to non-commutativity of space-time.</description>

      <title>Kick it like DESI: PNGB quintessence with a dynamically generated initial velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the hint for time-dependent dynamical dark energy from an analysis of the DESI Baryon Accoustic Oscillation (BAO) data together with information from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Supernovae (SN), we relax the assumption of a vanishing initial velocity for a quintessence field. In particular we focus on pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone-Boson (PNGB) quintessence in the form of an axion like particle, that can arise as the phase of a complex scalar and could possess derivative couplings to fermions or topological couplings to abelian gauge fields, without upsetting the necessary flatness of its potential. We discuss mechanisms from the aforementioned interactions for sourcing an initial axion field velocity $\dot{\theta_i}$ at redshifts $3\leq z\leq 10$, that will "kick" it into motion. Driven by this initial velocity the axion will first roll up in its potential, similar to "freezing" dark energy. After it has reached the pinnacle of its trajectory, it will start to roll down, and behave as "thawing" quintessence. As a proof of concept we undertake a combined fit to BAO, SN and CMB data at the background level. We find that a scenario with $\dot{\theta_i}=\mathcal{O}(1) \; m_a$, where $m_a$ is the axion mass, is slightly preferred over both $\Lambda$CDM and the conventional "thawing" quintessence with $\dot{\theta_i}=0$. The best fit points for this case exhibit transplanckian decay constants and very flat potentials, which both are in tension with conjectures from string theory.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, there has been increasing collaboration between the fields of quantum computing and high energy physics, including using LHC processes such as top (anti-)quark pair production to perform high energy tests of quantum entanglement. In this proceeding, I will review another interesting property from quantum computing ("magic"), that is needed to make quantum computers with genuine computational advantage over their classical counterparts. How to make and enhance magic in general quantum systems is an open question, such that new insights are always useful. To this end, I will show that the LHC naturally produces magic top quarks, providing a novel playground for further study in this area.</description>

      <title>Natural solution of SUSY $\mu$ problem from modulus stabilization in modular flavor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to solve the SUSY $\mu$-problem in the framework of modular flavor symmetry. The bare $\mu$-term is forbidden by modular symmetry and the effective $\mu$-term is re-generated after the modulus field is stabilized. We discuss the stabilization mechanism of a single modulus field with the presence of SUSY breaking contributions described in the non-linear realized SUSY scheme with nilpotent goldstino $X_{nl}$ superfield. The presence of $X_{nl}$ contributions can possibly slightly change the original stabilized modulus VEV to a value located in the vicinity of some fixed points. Natural value of $\mu_{eff}$, which is much smaller than the SUSY scale, can either be the consequence of expansion of typical modular forms in terms of the tiny deviation parameter (away from the fixed point $\omega$), or be the joint consequence of suppression from both powers of $q$ [or $(2\Im\tau)^{-1}$] and the asymptotic suppression behavior of typical modular forms away from the fixed point $i\infty$.</description>

Abstract: Domain walls represent two-dimensional topological defects that emerge from the spontaneous breaking of discrete symmetries in various new physics models. In this study, we undertake the first calculation of gravitational waves produced by scalar perturbations generated from the domain wall network. Our findings indicate that the gravitational wave spectrum is notably distinct from that of other sources. This opens up a promising avenue for future gravitational wave experiments aimed at exploring the role of domain walls in the early Universe. Our results could significantly enhance the capabilities of gravitational wave experiments, serving as a valuable method for testing new physics and better identifying diverse sources of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>The unexpected shape of the primordial black hole mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a Universe with nearly-Gaussian initial curvature perturbations, the abundance of primordial black holes can be derived from the curvature power spectrum. When the latter is enhanced within a narrow range around a characteristic scale, the resulting mass function has a single distinct peak, corresponding to Schwarzschild radii set by the horizon entry time of that scale. In contrast, we show (both numerically and by providing an analytic estimation) that a broad enhancement - such as a plateau bounded by infrared and ultraviolet scales - produces a bimodal mass function, with a primary peak close to the infrared scale. We find that the typical initial gravitational potential (compaction function), conditioned on meeting the threshold for critical collapse, is generated by a thin spherical shell with infrared radius and a thickness comparable to the ultraviolet scale. This suggests a higher-than-expected abundance of PBH originating from Type II initial fluctuations. Our results significantly impact overproduction bounds on the amplitude of the power spectrum, and tighten the viable mass range for primordial black holes as dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend recent work on quantum geodesics on the Heisenberg algebra for flat spacetime to quantum geodesics on the algebra $D(M)$ of differential operators on a Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifold $M$. The required differential structure has a hidden non-associativity for the product of 1-forms with functions at order $\hbar^2$ due the Riemann curvature, i.e. in the presence of gravity, which is not visible at the operator level. The calculus commutation relations involve the Ricci curvature. As an application, the case of $M$ spacetime provides a new approach to general relativistic quantum mechanics on curved spacetime, with an operator version of the geodesic equations in the Heisenberg picture. In the case of a static metric, there is an effective Schroedinger-like equation with an induced potential depending on the energy with respect to coordinate time. The case of $M$ a Schwarzschild black hole is exhibited in detail and the black-hole gravatom is solved. It is found that its eigenfunctions exhibit probability density banding of a fractal nature approaching the horizon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12115v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a new class of non-supersymmetric ten-dimensional type II flux vacua, by studying first order differential equations which are deformations of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry conditions. We do so within the context of Generalised Complex Geometry, where there is a natural interpretation of the $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry conditions in terms of calibration conditions for probe D-branes, called D-string, domain-wall or space-filling branes, depending on them wrapping two, three or four non-compact dimensions. We focus on the class of non-supersymmetric vacua violating the D-string calibration condition, and write down their general equations of motion in the language of pure spinors. We solve them for a subclass of vacua, where the deformation of the calibration condition is dictated by the foliated geometry of the internal space. We also construct backgrounds violating both the domain-wall and D-string calibration conditions, generalising the one-parameter DWSB class of backgrounds introduced in L\"ust et al. We present several explicit solutions with SU$(2)$ and SU$(3)$ structures, and we investigate briefly their associated low energy effective theories.</description>

      <title>Dressing Factors for Mixed-Flux $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ Superstrings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose the dressing factors for the scattering of massive particles on the worldsheet of mixed-flux $AdS_3\times S^3\times T^4$ superstrings, in the string and mirror kinematics. The proposal passes all self-consistency checks in the both kinematics, including for bound states. It matches with perturbative and semiclassical computations from the string sigma model, and with its relativistic limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation-induced Brownian drift of fluctuations. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since the de Sitter-induced axion misalignment controlled only by the de Sitter curvature cannot be evaded, this would invalidate the anthropic prediction of the dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

Abstract: We use partial wave unitarity to constrain various bespoke four-point amplitudes. We start by constructing bespoke generalizations of the type I superstring amplitude, which we show satisfy dual resonance and have suitable high-energy limits. By analyzing the behavior of partial wave coefficients for highly massive states, we strictly rule out all bespoke amplitudes with asymptotically non-linear Regge trajectories and place constraints on the first few non-trivial parameters in asymptotically linear cases. Finally, we argue that while a large class of unitary bespoke amplitudes fails to satisfy Regge Sum Rules, there exists a smaller sub-class with a vanishing mass gap that is superpolynomially bounded.</description>

      <title>Schottky Anomaly of Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the extended thermodynamics of black holes, there exists a thermodynamical pressure whose dual thermodynamical quantity is volume. Extensive studies have been conducted on the phase structure of numerous black holes, which have demonstrated striking similarities to the phase structure of various ordinary matter systems. From the comparison of the thermodynamic properties between spherically symmetric AdS black holes and ordinary thermodynamic systems we known that the isovolumetric heat capacity of the former is zero, whereas that of the latter is non-zero. It is a subject of interest for the intrinsic reason for this discrepancy. For the Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom-de Sitter (RN-dS) spacetime with the coexistence of the black hole and cosmological horizons the effective thermodynamic quantities as well as the interaction between two horizons are presented. The heat capacity in the Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom-de Sitter (RN-dS) spacetime is then investigated, and it is demonstrated that the behavior of the heat capacity in the RN-dS spacetime is analogous to that of Schottky specific heat. Treating two horizons in the RN-dS spacetime as two distinct energy levels in a two-energy-level system we investigate the thermodynamic properties in the RN-dS spacetime with the method of studying the thermodynamic properties in an ordinary two-energy system, thereby elucidating the intrinsic reasons for the occurrence of Schottky specific heat in the RN-dS spacetime. The heat capacity observed in the RN-dS spacetime is not only consistent with that of the Schottky specific heat described by the effective thermodynamic quantities in the RN-dS spacetime, but also with that of an ordinary two-energy-level system. These results not only reveal the quantum properties of the RN-dS spacetime, but also provide a new avenue for further in-depth study of the quantum properties of black holes and dS spacetime.</description>

      <title>Regularising Spectral Curves for Homogeneous Yang-Baxter strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the semi-classical spectrum of integrable worldsheet $\sigma$-models using the Spectral Curve. We consider a Homogeneous Yang-Baxter deformation of the $AdS_5\times S^5$ superstring, understood as the composition of a Jordanian with a "non-diagonal" TsT deformation. We derive its type IIB supergravity solution, whose isometry algebra features zero supercharges and a non-relativistic conformal algebra in $0+1$ dimensions. While the Spectral Curves of non-diagonal TsT models are ill-defined, we demonstrate that the composition with a Jordanian model regularises this issue. From the regularised Curve, we derive the one-loop shift of the classical energy and the semi-classical spectrum of excitations of a point-like string. In the TsT limit, the one-loop shift vanishes despite the loss of supersymmetry. Our results suggest that it may be possible to use standard Bethe Ansatze on spin chain pictures of deformed $N=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory dual to non-diagonal TsT models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the holographic method to investigate an RG flow and IR physics of a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) deformed by a relevant scalar operator. On the dual gravity side, a renormalization group (RG) flow from a UV to IR CFT can be described by rolling a scalar field from an unstable to a stable equilibrium point. After considering a simple scalar potential allowing several local equilibrium points, we study the change of a coupling constant and ground state from the momentum-space and real-space RG flow viewpoints. For the real-space RG flow, we calculate the entanglement entropy as a function of a coupling constant and then explicitly show that the entanglement entropy diverges logarithmically at fixed points due to the restoration of conformal symmetry. We further study how the change of a ground state affects the two-point function and conformal dimension of a local operator numerically and analytically in the probe limit.</description>

      <title>Multiscalar Critical Models with Localised Cubic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20326v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interface localised interactions are studied for multiscalar universality classes accessible with the perturbative $\varepsilon$ expansion in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The associated beta functions at one loop and partially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal field theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class is free or as simple as the Wilson-Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For up to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified for all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results are obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar fields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast space of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for line and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. In this vast space, stable interfaces found for free and $O(N)$ bulks belong to the $F_4$ family, with global symmetries $SO(3), SU(3), Sp(6)$ and $F_4$, realised with $N=5,8,16,24$ scalar fields, respectively.</description>

Abstract: The JNR ansatz provides a simple formula to obtain families of charge N self-dual SU(2) Yang-Mills instantons in four-dimensional Euclidean space, from the free data of N+1 distinct points with associated positive weights. Here an analogous formula is presented for Skyrme fields in three-dimensional Euclidean space. These families of Skyrme fields include good approximations to a range of Skyrmions, with energies that are typically within a few percent of the numerically computed solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07521v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a cutting rule for equal-time in-in correlators including cosmological correlators based on Keldysh $r/a$ basis, which decomposes diagrams into fully retarded functions and cut-propagators consisting of Wightman functions. Our derivation relies only on basic assumptions such as unitarity, locality, and the causal structure of the in-in formalism, and therefore holds for theories with arbitrary particle contents and local interactions at any loop order. As an application, we show that non-local cosmological collider signals arise solely from cut-propagators under the assumption of microcausality. Since the cut-propagators do not contain (anti-)time-ordering theta functions, the conformal time integrals are factorized, simplifying practical calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness in temporal and/or spatial evolution.</description>

Abstract: By analyzing the global density of states (DOS) in the Double-Scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model, we construct a finite-dimensional Hamiltonian that replicates this DOS. We then tridiagonalize the Hamiltonian to determine the mean Lanczos coefficients within the parameter range. The bulk Lanczos coefficients, especially the Lanczos descent can be analytically expressed as a particular $q$-deformation of the logarithm. Our numerical results are further corroborated by semi-analytical findings, a random matrix potential construction in the bulk, and the analytic results at the edge of the Lanczos spectra using the method of moments.</description>

Abstract: We consider a reducible ${\cal N}=4$, $d=1$ multiplet described by a real superfield as a coupling of the mirror ${\bf (1, 4, 3)}$ and ordinary ${\bf (3, 4, 1)}$ multiplets. Employing this so-called "long multiplet", we construct a coupled system of dynamical and semi-dynamical multiplets. We show that the corresponding {\it on-shell} model reproduces the model of Fedoruk, Ivanov and Lechtenfeld presented in 2012. Furthermore, there is a hidden supersymmetry acting on the long multiplet that extends the full world-line supersymmetry to SU(2$|$2). In other words, the ${\cal N}=4$ long multiplet can be derived from an irreducible SU(2$|$2) multiplet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18482v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-established that the dimensional reduction of the classical effective action of string theory at any order of $\alpha'$ on a circle of arbitrary radius remains invariant under the higher-derivative extension of Buscher transformations. In this study, we extend this symmetry to higher-genus levels. By leveraging the validity of Buscher rules for any genus of the world-sheet, we find that the measure of the effective action remains invariant only when reduced on a self-dual circle. Our findings indicate that the invariance of the Lagrangian density under the higher-derivative and higher-genus extension of the corresponding restricted Buscher rules does not yield the one-loop effective action at order $\alpha'^3$ as derived by the S-matrix method. This result aligns with the general belief that quantum gravity has no global symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We study the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory on $S^d$ using supersymmetric localisation and holography. We argue that the analytic continuation in dimension to $d=1$ yields a Euclidean version of the BMN matrix quantum mechanics. This system can be analysed at large $N$ using supersymmetric localisation and leads to explicit results for the free energy on $S^d$ and the expectation value of supersymmetric Wilson loops. We show how these results can be reproduced at strong gauge coupling using holography by employing spherical D-brane solutions. We construct these solutions for any value of $d$ using an effective supergravity description and pay particular attention to the subtleties arising in the $d\to1$ limit. Our results have implications for the BMN matrix quantum mechanics and the physics of circular D0-branes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

We first show that the standard Bekenstein bound is violated when the entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole is described in non-Gaussian statistics Barrow, Tsallis, and Kaniadakis due to the presence of the related indices $\Delta$, $q$ and $\kappa$, respectively. Then, by adding the GUP effects into the Bekenstein bound, we find that the generalized bound is satisfied in the context of the mentioned entropies through a possible connection between the entropies indices and the GUP parameter $\beta$.</description>

Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>

Abstract: We show that the general charged, rotating black hole in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory has a singular extremal limit. Only the known analytic solutions with exactly zero charge or zero angular momenta have smooth extremal horizons. We also consider general black holes in five-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory, and show that they also have singular extremal limits except for one special value of the coefficient of the Chern-Simons term (the one fixed by supergravity). Combining this with earlier results showing that extremal black holes have singular horizons in four-dimensional general relativity with small higher derivative corrections, and in anti-de Sitter space with perturbed boundary conditions, one sees that smooth extremal horizons are indeed the exception and not the rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive soft theorems for on-shell scattering amplitudes from non-linearly realised global space-time symmetries, arising from the flat space and decoupling limits of the effective field theories (EFTs) of inflation, while taking particular care of on-shell limits, soft limits, time-ordered correlations, momentum derivatives, energy-momentum conserving delta functions and $i\varepsilon$ prescriptions. Intriguingly, contrary to common belief, we find with a preferred soft hierarchy among the soft momentum $q$, on-shell residue $p_a^0 \pm E_a$, and $\varepsilon$, the soft theorems do not have dependence on off-shell interactions, even in the presence of cubic vertices. We also argue that the soft hierarchy is a natural choice, ensuring the soft limit and on-shell limit commute. Our soft theorems depend solely on on-shell data and hold to all orders in perturbation theory. We present various examples including polynomial shift symmetries, non-linear realisation of Lorentz boosts and dilatations on how the soft theorems work. We find that the collection of exchange diagrams, where the soft momentum is associated with a cubic vertex, exhibits an enhanced soft scaling. The enhanced soft scaling explains why the sum of such diagrams do not enter the soft theorems non-trivially. We further apply the soft theorems to bootstrap the scattering amplitudes of the superfluid and scaling superfluid EFTs, finding agreement with the Hamiltonian analysis.</description>

Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local operators are the basic observables in quantum field theory which encode the physics observed by a local experimentalist. However, when gravity is dynamical, diffeomorphism symmetries are gauged which apparently obstructs a sensible definition of local operators, as different locations in spacetime are connected by these gauged symmetries. This consideration brings in the puzzle of reconciling our empirical world with quantum gravity. Intuitively, this puzzle can be avoided using relatively defined observables when there exists a natural reference system such as a distribution of galaxies in our universe. Nevertheless, this intuition is classical as the rods and clock defined in this way may also have quantum fluctuations so it is not a priori clear if it can be realized in the quantum regime. In this letter, we provide an affirmative answer to this question. Interestingly, we notice that the quantum fluctuations of the reference system are in fact essential for the realization of the above intuition in the quantum regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.11174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the linearly vanishing density of states, emergent massless Dirac quasiparticles resulting from the free fermion motion in a family of two-dimensional half-filled bipartite hyperbolic lattices feature dynamic mass generation through quantum phase transitions only for sufficiently strong finite-range Coulomb repulsion. As such, strong nearest-neighbor Coulomb repulsion ($V$) favors the nucleation of a charge-density-wave (CDW) order with a staggered pattern of average fermionic density between two sublattices of bipartite hyperbolic lattices. Considering a collection of spinless fermions (for simplicity), here we show that application of strong external magnetic fields by virtue of producing a \emph{finite} density of states near the zero energy triggers the condensation of the CDW order even for \emph{infinitesimal} $V$. The proposed curved space magnetic catalysis mechanism is operative for uniform and inhomogeneous (bell-shaped) magnetic fields. We present scaling of the CDW order with the total flux enclosed by hyperbolic Dirac materials for a wide range of (especially subcritical) $V$.</description>

      <title>Fiber 2-Functors and Tambara-Yamagami Fusion 2-Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, a strong categorification of the notion of a group-theoretical fusion 1-category. Physically speaking, such fusion 2-categories arise by gauging subgroups of a global symmetry. We show that group-theoretical fusion 2-categories are completely characterized by the property that the braided fusion 1-category of endomorphisms of the monoidal unit is Tannakian. Then, we describe the underlying finite semisimple 2-category of group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and, more generally, of certain 2-categories of bimodules. We also partially describe the fusion rules of group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and investigate the group gradings of such fusion 2-categories. Using our previous results, we classify fusion 2-categories admitting a fiber 2-functor. Next, we study fusion 2-categories with a Tambara-Yamagami defect, that is $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded fusion 2-categories whose non-trivially graded factor is $\mathbf{2Vect}$. We classify these fusion 2-categories, and examine more closely the more restrictive notion of Tambara-Yamagami fusion 2-categories. Throughout, we give many examples to illustrate our various results.</description>

Abstract: Using closed positive extensions of the quadratic form in the potential term we provide alternative solutions to the eigenstate equation for the free quantum field Hamiltonian in the Schr\"o\-din\-ger representation. We show that admissible extensions stem from the singular behaviour of the quantum field simultaneously in at least two points, the distance between the latter being limited by the extension parameter. Including position of singularities into dynamical model we provide example of quantum field evolved by the action of the free Hamiltonian interacting with external sources via functional boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>$f(Q,L_m)$ gravity, and its cosmological implications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the $f(Q)$ symmetric teleparallel gravity by introducing an arbitrary coupling between the non-metricity $Q$ and matter Lagrangian $L_m$ in the Lagrangian density $f$ of the theory, which thus leads to the $f\left(Q,L_m\right)$ theory. This generalisation encompasses Coincident General Relativity (CGR), and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR (STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the theory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study of the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the presence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the matter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are investigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this direction, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$ gravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for several choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\alpha Q + 2L_m + \beta$, and $f(Q,L_m)=- \alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \beta$, respectively. Comparative analyses with the standard $\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the observational implications of the models are investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Scalar Dark Matter Production through the Bubble Expansion Mechanism:The Role of the Lorentz factor and Non-Renormalizable Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bubble Expansion mechanism for the production of scalar dark matter during a first-order phase transition in the very early Universe. Seeking for a dark matter energy density in agreement with observations, we study different renormalizable and non-renormalizable interactions between the dark matter species and the field undergoing the transition, considering all possible regimes for the Lorentz boost factor associated with the motion of the bubble wall. By employing a combination of analytical and numerical techniques, we demonstrate that sufficient dark matter production is achievable even in the previously unexplored low-velocity bubble expansion regime, enlarging the parameter space and possibilities of the scenario. Notably, for the non-renormalizable interactions it is found that the produced dark matter abundances exhibit a similar qualitative behavior to the renormalizable case, even for low Lorentz boost factors. Furthermore, for a transition around the electroweak scale, the associated gravitational wave spectrum is within the reach of future detectors.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Enabled Intensity Interferometry in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important tool in studying the sub-femtoscale spacetime structure of matter in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is Hanbury-Brown-Twiss (HBT) intensity interferometry of identical particles in the final state of such collisions. We show here that a variant of an entanglement enabled intensity interferometry ($E^2 I^2$) proposed by Cotler and Wilczek provides a powerful alternative to HBT interferometry in extracting fundamental nonperturbative features of QCD at high energies. In particular, we show that the spatial distributions of color singlet (pomeron) configurations in nuclei can be obtained from exclusive resonant decays of $\rho$-mesons into $\pi^\pm$-pairs in ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral nuclear collisions (UPCs) at RHIC and the LHC. The $E^2 I^2$ framework developed here is quite general. It can be employed to extract information on the spin structure of pomeron couplings as well as enhance the discovery potential for rare odderon configurations from exclusive vector meson decays into few-particle final states both in UPCs and at the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Black holes of type D revisited: relating their various metric forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02308v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a complete family of spacetimes which represent black holes with rotation, NUT twist, acceleration, electric and magnetic charges. These are exact solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations with any cosmological constant, such that the (non-null) electromagnetic field is aligned with both the double-degenerate principal null directions of the Weyl tensor. In particular, we explicitly relate various coordinates and the corresponding physical parameters of such solutions, namely the original Plebanski-Demianski (PD) form, the convenient Astorino (A) form which was found recently, and formally improved here (A+), the Griffiths-Podolsky (GP), and Podolsky-Vratny (PV) form of the metric. It is demonstrated that, if properly mapped and physically interpreted, all these representations cover the complete class of type D black holes. Using the new A-parameters, the two main PD quartic metric functions are factorized into the product of quadratic expressions, enabling thus an explicit analysis. Moreover, we clarify the role of the twist parameter $\omega$, related to both the Kerr-like rotation and the NUT parameters $a$ and $l$, respectively. Special attention is payed to the elusive subclass of accelerating NUT black holes with $a=0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parton evolution equations in QCD are controlled by the anomalous dimensions of gauge-invariant twist-two spin-$N$ quark and gluon operators. Under renormalization, these mix with gauge-variant operators of the same quantum numbers, referred to as alien operators. Our work addresses the systematic study of these alien operators at arbitrary spin $N$, using generalized BRST symmetry relations to derive their couplings and Feynman rules at all values of $N$. We observe how the all-$N$ structure of the generalized (anti-)BRST constraints relates the couplings of alien operators with $n+1$ gluons to those with $n$ gluons. Realizing a bootstrap, we present all one-loop results necessary for performing the operator renormalization up to four loops in QCD.</description>

      <title>Mass hierarchies in gauge theory with two index symmetric representation matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories, the running of the anomalous dimension of a fermion bilinear operator is believed to lead to chiral symmetry breaking when gamma=1. Naively using perturbative results to judge when gamma=1 leads to the possibility of large dynamically generated mass hierarchies in models with both two index symmetric representation and fundamental representation fermions. In this paper we study a holographic model of this physics to predict the separation in scales in the meson spectrum. We study SU(Nc) theories at different Nc with one flavour of two index symmetric representation as a function of the number of fundamental fermion flavours NfF. The largest hierarchy we find is for Nc=7 and NfF=22 where the rho mesons made of the two different representations are separated in scale by a factor of 13. For general Nc the hierarchy can be made greater than 7 by tuning NfF. We display the hierarchy as a function of NfF and investigate the quark mass dependence. These predictions do depend on the extrapolation of gamma from the perturbative regime - even in a pessimistic scenario a distinct gap can be achieved.</description>

Abstract: We derive an exact formula $F(e)$ which provides a concrete estimate for the total number and angular momentum of gravitons emitted during the nonrelativistic inspiral of two black holes. We show that the function $F(e)$ is a slowly growing monotonic function of the eccentricity $0 \le e \le 1$ and $F(1) = 1.0128 \cdots $. We confirm and extend the results obtained by Page for the function $F(e)$. We also get an exact result for the ratio $\nu (e_i) = \frac{2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)}{L_i}$ where the numerator $2\hbar N(L_i, e_i)$ is the sum of the spin angular momentum magnitudes of the gravitons emitted and $N(L_i, e_i)$ is the total number of gravitons emitted in the gravitational waves during nonrelativistic inspiral from an initial eccentricity $e_i$ down to a final eccentricity $e = 0$ and the denominator $L_i$ is the magnitude of the initial orbital angular momentum. If the orbit starts off with unit eccentricity $e_i=1$, we get the value $\nu(1) = 1.002\, 268\, 666\, 2 \pm 10^{-10}$ which confirms the Page's conjecture that the true value of $\nu(1)$ will lie between $1.001\cdots$ and $1.003\cdots$. We also show that the formula $F(e)$ for gravitons emitted, originally expressed as an infinite series, can be represented by a single function through an integral representation.</description>
