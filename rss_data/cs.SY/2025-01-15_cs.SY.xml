      <title>The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter Specified and Analyzed with the Real-time Mode-aware Dataflow Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ingenuity is an autonomous Cyber-Pysical System (CPS) that has successfully completed more than 70 flights over Mars between 2021 and 2024. Ensuring the safety of its mission is paramount, as any failure could result in catastrophic economic damage and significant financial losses. Dataflow Models of Computation and Communication (DF MoCCs) serve as a formal framework for specifying and analyzing the timing behavior of such CPSs. In particular, the Real-time Mode-aware Dataflow (RMDF) model is highly suitable to specify and analyze real-time and mode-dependent Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) like Ingenuity. This paper showcases the application of RMDF for the specification and analysis of Ingenuity. We propose a dataflow specification of Ingenuity, analyze its timing behavior, and provide a feasibility test. Finally, we proposed a plausible explanation of the timing anomaly that occurred during the sixth flight of Ingenuity.</description>

      <title>Koopman Meets Limited Bandwidth: Effect of Quantization on Data-Driven Linear Prediction and Control of Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman-based lifted linear identification have been widely used for data-driven prediction and model predictive control (MPC) of nonlinear systems. It has found applications in flow-control, soft robotics, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). For autonomous systems, this system identification method works by embedding the nonlinear system in a higher-dimensional linear space and computing a finite-dimensional approximation of the corresponding Koopman operator with the Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD) algorithm. EDMD is a data-driven algorithm that estimates an approximate linear system by lifting the state data-snapshots via nonlinear dictionary functions. For control systems, EDMD is further modified to utilize both state and control data-snapshots to estimate a lifted linear predictor with control input. This article investigates how the estimation process is affected when the data is quantized. Specifically, we examine the fundamental connection between estimates of the linear predictor matrices obtained from unquantized data and those from quantized data via modified EDMD. Furthermore, using the law of large numbers, we demonstrate that, under a large data regime, the quantized estimate can be considered a regularized version of the unquantized estimate. We also explore the relationship between the two estimates in the finite data regime. We further analyze the effect of nonlinear lifting functions on this regularization due to quantization. The theory is validated through repeated numerical experiments conducted on several control systems. The effect of quantization on the MPC performance is also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Role of the DSO in Electricity Trading of VPPs via a Stackelberg Game Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DER) has sparked interest in promoting their participation in the power market. Here we consider a setting in which different virtual power plants (VPPs) with certain flexible resources take part in electricity trading, either by direct participation in the wholesale power market, or interfaced by the Distribution System Operator (DSO). Our goal is to examine the role and influence of the DSO as a stakeholder, for which we formulate a Stackelberg game via a bilevel optimization model: the DSO maximizes profits at the upper level, while VPPs minimize operating costs at the lower level. To solve this problem, we use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucke optimality conditions of the convex lower-level problems to achieve a single-level mixed-integer nonlinear program. The results show that the role of the DSO as an intermediary agent leads to a decrease in operating costs for the VPPs, while guaranteeing a profit for the DSO.</description>

      <title>The Reliability of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Performance under Communication Loss and Latency Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mission-critical use of highly maneuverable Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) requires a thorough understanding of the reliability of their communication systems. Investigations into system-level performance under stochastic aviation communication conditions are critical for estimating mission success rates and assessing the risks associated with integrating RPAS into existing airspace, ensuring overall aviation safety. This study aims to quantify the impact of communication latency and complete signal loss on the mission completion performance of a highly maneuverable RPAS. The mission is defined as a static waypoint tracking task in three-dimensional airspace. We start with examining and deriving mathematical formulations of key reliability metrics of Required Communication Performance (RCP). These stochastic factors are then embedded into flight control simulations (i.e., communication availability and latency) to examine the system behavior. Lastly, we generate mission success rate and mission completion time envelopes through extensive multiprocessing Monte Carlo simulations through high-performance computing. We discover a drastic deterioration in flight performance while latency or availability erodes the stability margin. In addition, we propose a new reliability metric, namely \textit{communicability}, which integrates three key RCP metrics and helps understanding the maximum tolerable latency to flight control. The procedure and results obtained from this research inform engineers designing RPAS with better trade-off between communication capability and flight control performance. Future works includes exploring alternative flight simulators (i.e., nonlinear dynamic inversion) with other missions (i.e., dynamic waypoint following), or develop delay-compensated optimal controls. The analysis on stability margin is also desired for theoretical verification.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Power Losses and the Efficacy of Power Minimization Strategies in Multichannel Electrical Stimulation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroprosthetic devices require multichannel stimulator systems with an increasing number of channels. However, there are inherent power losses in typical multichannel stimulation circuits caused by a mismatch between the power supply voltage and the voltage required at each electrode to successfully stimulate tissue. This imposes a bottleneck towards high-channel-count devices, which is particularly severe in wirelessly-powered devices. Hence, advances in the power efficiency of stimulation systems are critical. To support these advances, this paper presents a methodology to identify and quantify power losses associated with different power supply scaling strategies in multichannel stimulation systems. The proposed methodology utilizes distributions of stimulation amplitudes and electrode impedances to calculate power losses in multichannel systems. Experimental data from previously published studies spanning various stimulation applications were analyzed to evaluate the performance of fixed, global, and stepped supply scaling methods, focusing on their impact on power dissipation and efficiency. Variability in output conditions results in low power efficiency in multichannel stimulation systems across all applications. Stepped voltage scaling demonstrated substantial efficiency improvements, achieving an increase of 67 % to 146 %, particularly in high-channel-count applications with significant variability in tissue impedance. Global scaling, by contrast, was more advantageous for systems with fewer channels. The findings highlight the importance of tailoring power management strategies to specific applications to optimize efficiency while minimizing system complexity. The proposed methodology offers a framework for evaluating efficiency-complexity trade-offs, advancing the design of scalable neurostimulation systems.</description>

      <title>Range-Only Dynamic Output Feedback Controller for Safe and Secure Target Circumnavigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The safety and security of robotic systems are paramount when navigating around a hostile target. This paper addresses the problem of circumnavigating an unknown target by a unicycle robot while ensuring it maintains a desired safe distance and remains within the sensing region around the target throughout its motion. The proposed control design methodology is based on the construction of a joint Lyapunov function that incorporates: (i) a quadratic potential function characterizing the desired target-circumnavigation objective, and (ii) a barrier Lyapunov function-based potential term to enforce safety and sensing constraints on the robot's motion. A notable feature of the proposed control design is its reliance exclusively on local range measurements between the robot and the target, realized using a dynamic output feedback controller that treats the range as the only observable output for feedback. Using the Lyapunov stability theory, we show that the desired equilibrium of the closed-loop system is asymptotically stable, and the prescribed safety and security constraints are met under the proposed controllers. We also obtain restrictive bounds on the post-design signals and provide both simulation and experimental results to validate the theoretical contributions.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of Transformer-less Inverter Topologies for Grid-Connected PV Systems: Minimizing Leakage Current and THD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, into power grids has gained major attention due to their environmental and economic benefits. Although traditional transformer-based grid-connected PV inverters provide galvanic isolation for leakage current, they suffer from major drawbacks of high cost, lower efficiency, and increased size. Transformer-less grid-connected PV inverters (TLGI) have emerged as a prominent alternative, as they achieve higher efficiency, compact design, and lower cost. However, due to a lack of galvanic isolation, TLGIs are highly affected by leakage current caused by the fluctuation of common-mode voltage (CMV). This paper investigates three topologies H4, H5, and HERIC with comparisons between their CMV, differential-mode voltage (DMV), total harmonic distortion (THD), and leakage current. A simulation was conducted for each topology in MATLAB/Simulink R2023a, and the results demonstrate that the H5 topology achieves a balance between low leakage current, reduced THD, and optimal operational efficiency, making it suitable for practical application.</description>

      <title>Economic Model Predictive Control for Periodic Operation: A Quadratic Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic dynamical systems, distinguished by their repetitive behavior over time, are prevalent across various engineering disciplines. In numerous applications, particularly within industrial contexts, the implementation of model predictive control (MPC) schemes tailored to optimize specific economic criteria was shown to offer substantial advantages. However, the real-time implementation of these schemes is often infeasible due to limited computational resources. To tackle this problem, we propose a resource-efficient economic model predictive control scheme for periodic systems, leveraging existing single-layer MPC techniques. Our method relies on a single quadratic optimization problem, which ensures high computational efficiency for real-time control in dynamic settings. We prove feasibility, stability and convergence to optimum of the proposed approach, and validate the effectiveness through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Novel Method for Detecting Dust Accumulation in Photovoltaic Systems: Evaluating Visible Sunlight Obstruction in Different Dust Levels and AI-based Bird Droppings Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an innovative method for automatically detecting dust accumulation on a PV system and notifying the user to clean it instantly. The accumulation of dust, bird, or insect droppings on the surface of photovoltaic (PV) panels creates a barrier between the solar energy and the panel's surface to receive sufficient energy to generate electricity. The study investigates the effects of dust on PV panel output and visible sunlight (VSL) block amounts to utilize the necessity of cleaning and detection. The amount of blocked visible sunlight while passing through glass due to dust determines the accumulated dust level. Visible sunlight can easily pass through the clean, transparent glass but reflects when something like dust obstructs it. Based on those concepts, a system is designed with a light sensor that is simple, effective, easy to install, hassle-free, and can spread the technology. The study also explores the effectiveness of the detection system developed by using image processing and machine learning algorithms to identify dust levels and bird or insect droppings accurately. The experimental setup in Gazipur, Bangladesh, found that excessive dust can block up to 55% of visible sunlight, wasting 55% of solar energy in the visible spectrum, and cleaning can recover 3% of power weekly. The data from the dust detection system is correlated with the 400W capacity solar panels' naturally lost efficiency data to validate the system. This research measured visible sunlight obstruction and loss due to dust. However, the addition of an infrared radiation sensor can draw the entire scenario of energy loss by doing more research.</description>

      <title>Safety Verification for Evasive Collision Avoidance in Autonomous Vehicles with Enhanced Resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive hazard analysis, risk assessment, and loss evaluation for an Evasive Minimum Risk Maneuvering (EMRM) system designed for autonomous vehicles. The EMRM system is engineered to enhance collision avoidance and mitigate loss severity by drawing inspiration from professional drivers who perform aggressive maneuvers while maintaining stability for effective risk mitigation. Recent advancements in autonomous vehicle technology demonstrate a growing capability for high-performance maneuvers. This paper discusses a comprehensive safety verification process and establishes a clear safety goal to enhance testing validation. The study systematically identifies potential hazards and assesses their risks to overall safety and the protection of vulnerable road users. A novel loss evaluation approach is introduced, focusing on the impact of mitigation maneuvers on loss severity. Additionally, the proposed mitigation integrity level can be used to verify the minimum-risk maneuver feature. This paper applies a verification method to evasive maneuvering, contributing to the development of more reliable active safety features in autonomous driving systems.</description>

      <title>Open-source End-to-End Digital Beamforming System Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital beamforming forms the foundation for massive MIMO in 6G wireless communications. At their core, digital beamforming architectures provide key benefits such as faster beam search, interference nulling via zero-force beamforming, higher spectral capacity, and more increased flexibility. However, they generally tradeoff power consumption due to the large number of ADCs in such systems. This paper introduces an open-source MATLAB-based behavioral hardware model of a general digital beamforming system. More specifically, it models an end-to-end uplink between an arbitrary number of user elements (UEs) and an arbitrarily large base station (BS) with and without a strong interferer. This paper also presents and validates an equation-based model for the effects of interference on thermal and quantization noise. The behavioral model presented in this paper aims to deepen understanding of such digital beamforming systems to enable system designers to make optimizations. The results presented in this paper primarily center on implementations with low-resolution ADCs and, thus, focus on the effects of system parameters, including interferer strength, on quantization noise.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present LUCAS (Low power Ultra-low jitter Compact ASIC for SiPM), an analog front-end for Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPM) targeting fast timing detectors in Time-of-Flight Computed Tomography (ToF-CT). LUCAS features a very low input impedance preamplifier followed by a voltage comparator. It is designed in TSMC 65 nm low-power CMOS technology with a power supply of 1.2 V. Our first 8-channel prototype has been sent to fabrication and will be received in August 2023. Post-layout simulations predict less than 40 ps FWHM SPTR jitter and an approximate power consumption of 3.2 mW per channel. The front end is suitable for applications with rigorous jitter requirements and high event rates, thanks to its 3.9 GHz unity-gain bandwidth. The front-end compact form factor will facilitate its incorporation into systems demanding high channel densities.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Decision-Making for Digital Twin in Additive Manufacturing with Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Twin-a virtual replica of a physical system enabling real-time monitoring, model updating, prediction, and decision-making-combined with recent advances in machine learning (ML), offers new opportunities for proactive control strategies in autonomous manufacturing. However, achieving real-time decision-making with Digital Twins requires efficient optimization driven by accurate predictions of highly nonlinear manufacturing systems. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for real-time decision-making, using a multi-variate deep neural network (DNN), named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE), as the surrogate model. Different from the models in conventional MPC which only provide one-step ahead prediction, TiDE is capable of predicting future states within the prediction horizon in one shot (multi-step), significantly accelerating MPC. Using Directed Energy Deposition additive manufacturing as a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC in achieving melt pool temperature tracking to ensure part quality, while reducing porosity defects by regulating laser power to maintain melt pool depth constraints. In this work, we first show that TiDE is capable of accurately predicting melt pool temperature and depth. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed MPC achieves precise temperature tracking while satisfying melt pool depth constraints within a targeted dilution range (10%-30%), reducing potential porosity defects. Compared to the PID controller, MPC results in smoother and less fluctuating laser power profiles with competitive or superior melt pool temperature control performance. This demonstrates MPC's proactive control capabilities, leveraging time-series prediction and real-time optimization, positioning it as a powerful tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process optimization in manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Identification of Partially Observed Bilinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a realization of a partially observed bilinear dynamical system (BLDS) from noisy input-output data. Given a single trajectory of input-output samples, we provide a finite time analysis for learning the system's Markov-like parameters, from which a balanced realization of the bilinear system can be obtained. Our bilinear system identification algorithm learns the system's Markov-like parameters by regressing the outputs to highly correlated, nonlinear, and heavy-tailed covariates. Moreover, the stability of BLDS depends on the sequence of inputs used to excite the system. These properties, unique to partially observed bilinear dynamical systems, pose significant challenges to the analysis of our algorithm for learning the unknown dynamics. We address these challenges and provide high probability error bounds on our identification algorithm under a uniform stability assumption. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and sample complexity. Lastly, we perform numerical experiments with synthetic data to reinforce these insights.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Outlier Connections Detection in Databases Network Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article describes a practical method for detecting outlier database connections in real-time. Outlier connections are detected with a specified level of confidence. The method is based on generalized security rules and a simple but effective real-time machine learning mechanism. The described method is non-intrusive to the database and does not depend on the type of database. The method is used to proactively control access even before database connection is established, minimize false positives, and maintain the required response speed to detected database connection outliers. The capabilities of the system are demonstrated with several examples of outliers in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Prediction Interval Construction Method for Electricity Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices plays an essential role in the electricity market. To reflect the uncertainty of electricity prices, price intervals are predicted. This paper proposes a novel prediction interval construction method. A conditional generative adversarial network is first presented to generate electricity price scenarios, with which the prediction intervals can be constructed. Then, different generated scenarios are stacked to obtain the probability densities, which can be applied to accurately reflect the uncertainty of electricity prices. Furthermore, a reinforced prediction mechanism based on the volatility level of weather factors is introduced to address the spikes or volatile prices. A case study is conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed novel prediction interval construction method. The method can also provide the probability density of each price scenario within the prediction interval and has the superiority to address the volatile prices and price spikes with a reinforced prediction mechanism.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators via HEOL, and a discussion on AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks and their applications in deep learning have recently made an incursion into the field of control. Deep learning techniques in control are often related to optimal control, which relies on Pontryagin maximum principle or the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. They imply control schemes that are tedious to implement. We show here that the new HEOL setting, resulting from the fusion of the two established approaches, namely differential flatness and model-free control, provides a solution to control problems that is more sober in terms of computational resources. This communication is devoted to the synchronization of the popular Kuramoto's coupled oscillators, which was already considered via artificial neural networks (B\"ottcher et al., Nature Communications 2022), where, contrarily to this communication, only the single control variable is examined. One establishes the flatness of Kuramoto's coupled oscillator model with multiplicative control and develops the resulting HEOL control. Unlike many exemples, this system reveals singularities that are avoided by a clever generation of phase angle trajectories. The results obtained, verified in simulation, show that it is not only possible to synchronize these oscillators in finite time, and even to follow angular frequency profiles, but also to exhibit robustness concerning model mismatches. To the best of our knowledge this has never been done before. Concluding remarks advocate a viewpoint, which might be traced back to Wiener's cybernetics: control theory belongs to AI.</description>

      <title>An Open Source Validation System for Continuous Arterial Blood Pressure Measuring Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the blood pressure waveform is becoming a more frequently studied area. The development of sensor technologies opens many new ways to be able to measure high-quality signals. The development of such an aim-specific sensor can be time-consuming, expensive, and difficult to test or validate with known and consistent waveforms. In this paper, we present an open source blood pressure waveform simulator with an open source Python validation package to reduce development costs for early-stage sensor development and research. The simulator mainly consists of 3D printed parts which technology has become a widely available and cheap solution. The core part of the simulator is a 3D printed cam that can be generated based on real blood pressure waveforms. The validation framework can create a detailed comparison between the signal waveform used to design the cam and the measured time series from the sensor being validated. The presented simulator proved to be robust and accurate in short- and long-term use, as it produced the signal waveform consistently and accurately. To validate this solution, a 3D force sensor was used, which was proven earlier to be able to measure high-quality blood pressure waveforms on the radial artery at the wrist. The results showed high similarity between the measured and the nominal waveforms, meaning that comparing the normalized signals, the RMSE value ranged from $0.0276 \pm 0.0047$ to $0.0212 \pm 0.0023$, and the Pearson correlation ranged from $0.9933 \pm 0.0027$ to $0.9978 \pm 0.0005$. Our validation framework is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim. Our hardware framework, which allows reproduction of the presented solution, is available at https://github.com/repat8/cam-bpw-sim-hardware. The entire design is an open source project and was developed using free software.</description>

Abstract: Future multifunction RF systems will be able to not only perform various different radar, communication and electronic warfare functionalities but also to perform them simultaneously on the same aperture. This ability of concurrent operations requires new, cognitive approaches of resource management compared to classical methods.

      <title>MMAPs to model complex multi-state systems with vacation policies in the repair facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two complex multi-state systems subject to multiple events are built in an algorithmic and computational way by considering phase-type distributions and Markovian arrival processes with marked arrivals. The internal performance of the system is composed of different degradation levels and internal repairable and non-repairable failures can occur. Also, the system is subject to external shocks that may provoke repairable or non-repairable failure. A multiple vacation policy is introduced in the system for the repairperson. Preventive maintenance is included in the system to improve the behaviour. Two types of task may be performed by the repairperson; corrective repair and preventive maintenance. The systems are modelled, the transient and stationary distributions are built and different performance measures are calculated in a matrix-algorithmic form. Cost and rewards are included in the model in a vector matrix way. Several economic measures are worked out and the net reward per unit of time is used to optimize the system. A numerical example shows that the system can be optimized according to the existence of preventive maintenance and the distribution of vacation time. The results have been implemented computationally with Matlab and R (packages: expm, optim).</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cruise Controllers with Bidirectional Sensing for a String of Vehicles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a nonlinear cruise controller that is fully decentralized (by vehicle) and uses spacing and speed measurements from the preceding and following vehicles to decide on the appropriate control action (acceleration) for each vehicle. The proposed cruise controller is studied on both a ring-road and an open road and guarantees that there are no collisions between vehicles, while their speeds are always positive and never exceed the road speed limits. For both cases of the open road and the ring-road, we rigorously prove that the set of equilibrium points is globally asymptotically stable and provide KL estimates that guarantee uniform convergence to the said set. Moreover, we show that for the ring-road, and under certain conditions, there is a single equilibrium point which is exponentially attractive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present data-based conditions for enforcing contractivity via feedback control and obtain desired asymptotic properties of the closed-loop system. We focus on unknown nonlinear control systems whose vector fields are expressible via a dictionary of functions and derive data-dependent semidefinite programs whose solution returns the controller that guarantees contractivity. When data are perturbed by disturbances that are linear combinations of sinusoids of known frequencies (but unknown amplitude and phase) and constants, we remarkably obtain conditions for contractivity that do not depend on the magnitude of the disturbances, with imaginable positive consequences for the synthesis of the controller. Finally, we show how to design from data an integral controller for nonlinear systems that achieves constant reference tracking and constant disturbance rejection.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Low-Cost Electric Vehicles (Evs) Supercharger: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a probabilistic modeling method utilizing smart meter data and an innovative agent-based simulator for electric vehicles (EVs). The aim is to assess the effects of different cost-driven EV charging strategies on the power distribution network (PDN). We investigate the effects of a 40% EV adoption on three parts of Frederiksberg's low voltage distribution network (LVDN), a densely urbanized municipality in Denmark. Our findings indicate that cable and transformer overloading especially pose a challenge. However, the impact of EVs varies significantly between each LVDN area and charging scenario. Across scenarios and LVDNs, the share of cables facing congestion ranges between 5% and 60%. It is also revealed that time-of-use (ToU)-based and single-day cost-minimized charging could be beneficial for LVDNs with moderate EV adoption rates. In contrast, multiple-day optimization will likely lead to severe congestion, as such strategies concentrate demand on a single day that would otherwise be distributed over several days, thus raising concerns about how to prevent it. The broader implications of our research suggest that, despite initial worries primarily centered on congestion due to unregulated charging during peak hours, a transition to cost-based smart charging, propelled by an increasing awareness of time-dependent electricity prices, may lead to a significant rise in charging synchronization, bringing about undesirable consequences for the power distribution network (PDN).</description>

      <title>Regression Equilibrium in Electricity Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-stage electricity markets, renewable power producers enter the day-ahead market with a forecast of future power generation and then reconcile any forecast deviation in the real-time market at a penalty. The choice of the forecast model is thus an important strategy decision for renewable power producers as it affects financial performance. In electricity markets with large shares of renewable generation, the choice of the forecast model impacts not only individual performance but also outcomes for other producers. In this paper, we argue for the existence of a competitive regression equilibrium in two-stage electricity markets in terms of the parameters of private forecast models informing the participation strategies of renewable power producers. In our model, renewables optimize the forecast against the day-ahead and real-time prices, thereby maximizing the average profits across the day-ahead and real-time markets. By doing so, they also implicitly enhance the temporal cost coordination of day-ahead and real-time markets. We base the equilibrium analysis on the theory of variational inequalities, providing results on the existence and uniqueness of regression equilibrium in energy-only markets. We also devise two methods to compute regression equilibrium: centralized optimization and a decentralized ADMM-based algorithm.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Assessment of Vehicle-to-Grid Capabilities in Supporting Grid During Emergencies: Case Study of Travis County, TX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As extreme weather events become more common and threaten power grids, the continuing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) introduces a growing opportunity for their use as a distributed energy storage resource. This energy storage can be used as backup generation through the use of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, where electricity is sent back from EV batteries to the grid. With enough participation from EV owners, V2G can mitigate outages during grid emergencies. In order to investigate a practical application of V2G, this study leverages a vast array of real-world data, such as survey results on V2G participation willingness, historical outage data within ERCOT, current EV registrations, and demographic data. This data informs realistic emergency grid scenarios with V2G support using a synthetic transmission grid for Travis County. The results find that as EV ownership rises in the coming years, the simultaneous facilitation of bidirectional charging availability would allow for V2G to play a substantial role in preventing involuntary load shed as a result of emergencies like winter storms.</description>

      <title>Promoting Shared Energy Storage Aggregation among High Price-Tolerance Prosumer: An Incentive Deposit and Withdrawal Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many residential prosumers exhibit a high price-tolerance for household electricity bills and a low response to price incentives. This is because the household electricity bills are not inherently high, and the potential for saving on electricity bills through participation in conventional Shared Energy Storage (SES) is limited, which diminishes their motivation to actively engage in SES. Additionally, existing SES models often require prosumers to take additional actions, such as optimizing rental capacity and bidding prices, which happen to be capabilities that typical household prosumers do not possess. To incentivize these high price-tolerance residential prosumers to participate in SES, a novel SES aggregation framework is proposed, which does not require prosumers to take additional actions and allows them to maintain existing energy storage patterns. Compared to conventional long-term operation of SES, the proposed framework introduces an additional short-term construction step during which the energy service provider (ESP) acquires control of the energy storage systems (ESS) and offers electricity deposit and withdrawal services (DWS) with dynamic coefficients, enabling prosumers to withdraw more electricity than they deposit without additional actions. Additionally, a matching mechanism is proposed to align prosumers' electricity consumption behaviors with ESP's optimization strategies. Finally, the dynamic coefficients in DWS and trading strategies are optimized by an improved deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Case studies are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed SES aggregation framework with DWS and the matching mechanism.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces XPLORER, a passive deformable UAV with a spring-augmented chassis and proprioceptive state awareness, designed to endure collisions and maintain smooth contact. We develop a fast-converging external force estimation algorithm for XPLORER that leverages onboard sensors and proprioceptive data for contact and collision detection. Using this force information, we propose four motion primitives, including three novel tactile-based primitives: tactile-traversal, tactile-turning, and ricocheting-to aid XPLORER in navigating unknown environments. These primitives are synthesized autonomously in real-time to enable efficient exploration and navigation by leveraging collisions and contacts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the potential of passive deformable UAVs for contact-rich real-world tasks such as non-destructive inspection, surveillance and mapping, and pursuit/evasion.</description>

      <title>Invariance Proximity: Closed-Form Error Bounds for Finite-Dimensional Koopman-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A popular way to approximate the Koopman operator's action on a finite-dimensional subspace of functions is via orthogonal projections. The quality of the projected model directly depends on the selected subspace, specifically on how close it is to being invariant under the Koopman operator. The notion of invariance proximity provides a tight upper bound on the worst-case relative prediction error of the finite-dimensional model. However, its direct calculation is computationally challenging. This paper leverages the geometric structure behind the definition of invariance proximity to provide a closed-form expression in terms of Jordan principal angles on general inner product spaces. Unveiling this connection allows us to exploit specific isomorphisms to circumvent the computational challenges associated with spaces of functions and enables the use of existing efficient numerical routines to compute invariance proximity.</description>

      <title>United We Fall: On the Nash Equilibria of Multiplex and Multilayer Network Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Network games provide a framework to study strategic decision making processes that are governed by structured interdependencies among agents. However, existing models do not account for environments in which agents simultaneously interact over multiple networks, or when agents operate over multiple action dimensions. In this paper, we propose new models of multiplex network games to capture the different modalities of interactions among strategic agents, and multilayer network games to capture their interactions over multiple action dimensions. We explore how the properties of the constituent networks of a multiplex/multilayer network can undermine or support the existence, uniqueness, and stability of the game's Nash equilibria. Notably, we highlight that both the largest and smallest eigenvalues of the constituent networks (reflecting their connectivity and two-sidedness, respectively) are instrumental in determining the uniqueness of the multiplex/multilayer network game's equilibrium. Together, our findings shed light on the reasons for the fragility of equilibria when agents interact over networks of networks, and point out potential interventions to alleviate them.</description>

      <title>GenSafe: A Generalizable Safety Enhancer for Safe Reinforcement Learning Algorithms Based on Reduced Order Markov Decision Process Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03912v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (SRL) aims to realize a safe learning process for Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms by incorporating safety constraints. However, the efficacy of SRL approaches often relies on accurate function approximations, which are notably challenging to achieve in the early learning stages due to data insufficiency. To address this issue, we introduce in this work a novel Generalizable Safety enhancer (GenSafe) that is able to overcome the challenge of data insufficiency and enhance the performance of SRL approaches. Leveraging model order reduction techniques, we first propose an innovative method to construct a Reduced Order Markov Decision Process (ROMDP) as a low-dimensional approximator of the original safety constraints. Then, by solving the reformulated ROMDP-based constraints, GenSafe refines the actions of the agent to increase the possibility of constraint satisfaction. Essentially, GenSafe acts as an additional safety layer for SRL algorithms. We evaluate GenSafe on multiple SRL approaches and benchmark problems. The results demonstrate its capability to improve safety performance, especially in the early learning phases, while maintaining satisfactory task performance. Our proposed GenSafe not only offers a novel measure to augment existing SRL methods but also shows broad compatibility with various SRL algorithms, making it applicable to a wide range of systems and SRL problems.</description>

      <title>Layer-Adaptive State Pruning for Deep State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of state dimension optimization methods, deep state space models (SSMs) have sacrificed model capacity, training search space, or stability to alleviate computational costs caused by high state dimensions. In this work, we provide a structured pruning method for SSMs, Layer-Adaptive STate pruning (LAST), which reduces the state dimension of each layer in minimizing model-level output energy loss by extending modal truncation for a single system. LAST scores are evaluated using the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ norms of subsystems and layer-wise energy normalization. The scores serve as global pruning criteria, enabling cross-layer comparison of states and layer-adaptive pruning. Across various sequence benchmarks, LAST optimizes previous SSMs, revealing the redundancy and compressibility of their state spaces. Notably, we demonstrate that, on average, pruning 33% of states still maintains performance with 0.52% accuracy loss in multi-input multi-output SSMs without retraining. Code is available at https://github.com/msgwak/LAST.</description>

      <title>The improvement in transmission resilience metrics from reduced outages or faster restoration can be calculated by rerunning historical outage data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transmission utilities routinely collect detailed outage data, including resilience events in which outages bunch up due to weather. The resilience events and their resilience metrics can readily be extracted from this historical outage data. Improvements such as grid hardening or investments in restoration lead to reduced outages or faster restoration. We show how to rerun this history with the effects of the reduced outages or faster restoration included to find the resulting improvement in resilience metrics, thus quantifying the benefits of these investments. This is demonstrated with case studies for specific events (a derecho and a hurricane), and all large events or large thunderstorms in the Midwest USA. Instead of predicting future extreme events with models, which is very challenging, the historical rerun readily quantifies the benefits that a resilience investment would have had if it had been made in the past. The historical rerun is particularly vivid in making the case for resilience investments to stakeholders because it quantifies the benefits for events actually experienced by those stakeholders, rather than for future events predicted with uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Aerial Robot Inspection Challenge: A Benchmark for Heterogeneous Multi-UAV Planning and Lessons Learned</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the Cooperative Aerial Robot Inspection Challenge (CARIC), a simulation-based benchmark for motion planning algorithms in heterogeneous multi-UAV systems. CARIC features UAV teams with complementary sensors, realistic constraints, and evaluation metrics prioritizing inspection quality and efficiency. It offers a ready-to-use perception-control software stack and diverse scenarios to support the development and evaluation of task allocation and motion planning algorithms. Competitions using CARIC were held at IEEE CDC 2023 and the IROS 2024 Workshop on Multi-Robot Perception and Navigation, attracting innovative solutions from research teams worldwide. This paper examines the top three teams from CDC 2023, analyzing their exploration, inspection, and task allocation strategies while drawing insights into their performance across scenarios. The results highlight the task's complexity and suggest promising directions for future research in cooperative multi-UAV systems.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Robotic Handwriting System with AI Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a cost-effective robotic handwriting system designed to replicate human-like handwriting with high precision. Combining a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, 3D-printed components, and a machine learning-based handwriting generation model implemented via TensorFlow, the system converts user-supplied text into realistic stroke trajectories. By leveraging lightweight 3D-printed materials and efficient mechanical designs, the system achieves a total hardware cost of approximately \$56, significantly undercutting commercial alternatives. Experimental evaluations demonstrate handwriting precision within $\pm$0.3 millimeters and a writing speed of approximately 200 mm/min, positioning the system as a viable solution for educational, research, and assistive applications. This study seeks to lower the barriers to personalized handwriting technologies, making them accessible to a broader audience.</description>
