      <title>Evolution of Plastic Dispersal in Stable Environment: Local Information of Fitness Consequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitness consequence of dispersal depends on property of the entire landscape, which patches are available and what are the cost of moving. These are information that are not available locally when an organism make the decision to disperse. This poses a problem to the organism, where it is unclear how an adaptive decision can be made. This also poses a problem to the scientist, since in order to study the adaptiveness of dispersal, we need information of the entire landscape. For theorist, this is through making a series of assumption about either the landscape or the organism, and for empiricists, this means a large amount of measurements needs to be made across a large area. In this paper, we propose a link between local demographic process, which an organism can have access to, to the fitness consequence of dispersal. This meant local environmental cue can be used for the decision on dispersal, and hence allow the evolution of plastic dispersal strategy. We will then show that using this approach, evolution of dispersal on complex landscape can be modelled with relative ease, and to show that accidental dispersal in one patch can drive the evolution of adaptive dispersal in another.</description>

      <title>Integrated strong reciprocity enables productive punishment and protective defection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation in large groups and one-shot interactions is often hindered by freeloading. Punishment can enforce cooperation, but it is usually regarded as wasteful because the costs of punishing offset its benefits. Here, we analyze an evolutionary game model that integrates upstream and downstream reciprocity with costly punishment: integrated strong reciprocity (ISR). We demonstrate that ISR admits a stable mixed equilibrium of ISR and unconditional defection (ALLD), and that costly punishment can become productive: When sufficiently efficient, it raises collective welfare above the no-punishment baseline. ALLD players persist as evolutionary shields, preventing invasion by unconditional cooperation (ALLC) or alternative conditional strategies (e.g., antisocial punishment). At the same time, the mixed equilibrium of ISR and ALLD remains robust under modest complexity costs that destabilize other symmetric cooperative systems.</description>

      <title>Bayes-PD: Exploring a Sequence to Binding Bayesian Neural Network model trained on Phage Display data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phage display is a powerful laboratory technique used to study the interactions between proteins and other molecules, whether other proteins, peptides, DNA or RNA. The under-utilisation of this data in conjunction with deep learning models for protein design may be attributed to; high experimental noise levels; the complex nature of data pre-processing; and difficulty interpreting these experimental results. In this work, we propose a novel approach utilising a Bayesian Neural Network within a training loop, in order to simulate the phage display experiment and its associated noise. Our goal is to investigate how understanding the experimental noise and model uncertainty can enable the reliable application of such models to reliably interpret phage display experiments. We validate our approach using actual binding affinity measurements instead of relying solely on proxy values derived from 'held-out' phage display rounds.</description>

      <title>The Feller diffusion as the limit of a coalescent point process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Feller diffusion is studied as the limit of a coalescent point process in which the density of the node height distribution is skewed towards zero. Using a unified approach, a number of recent results pertaining to scaling limits of branching processes are reinterpreted as properties of the Feller diffusion arising from this limit. The notion of Bernoulli sampling of a finite population is extended to the diffusion limit to cover finite Poisson-distributed samples drawn from infinite continuum populations. We show that the coalescent tree of a Poisson-sampled Feller diffusion corresponds to a coalescent point process with a node height distribution taking the same algebraic form as that of a Bernoulli-sampled birth-death process. By adapting methods for analysing k-sampled birth-death processes, in which the sample size is pre-specified, we develop methods for studying the coalescent properties of the k-sampled Feller diffusion.</description>

      <title>Inference in conditioned dynamics through causality restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing observables from conditioned dynamics is typically computationally hard, because, although obtaining independent samples efficiently from the unconditioned dynamics is usually feasible, generally most of the samples must be discarded (in a form of importance sampling) because they do not satisfy the imposed conditions. Sampling directly from the conditioned distribution is non-trivial, as conditioning breaks the causal properties of the dynamics which ultimately renders the sampling procedure efficient. One standard way of achieving it is through a Metropolis Monte-Carlo procedure, but this procedure is normally slow and a very large number of Monte-Carlo steps is needed to obtain a small number of statistically independent samples. In this work, we propose an alternative method to produce independent samples from a conditioned distribution. The method learns the parameters of a generalized dynamical model that optimally describe the conditioned distribution in a variational sense. The outcome is an effective, unconditioned, dynamical model, from which one can trivially obtain independent samples, effectively restoring causality of the conditioned distribution. The consequences are twofold: on the one hand, it allows us to efficiently compute observables from the conditioned dynamics by simply averaging over independent samples. On the other hand, the method gives an effective unconditioned distribution which is easier to interpret. The method is flexible and can be applied virtually to any dynamics. We discuss an important application of the method, namely the problem of epidemic risk assessment from (imperfect) clinical tests, for a large family of time-continuous epidemic models endowed with a Gillespie-like sampler. We show that the method compares favorably against the state of the art, including the soft-margin approach and mean-field methods.</description>
