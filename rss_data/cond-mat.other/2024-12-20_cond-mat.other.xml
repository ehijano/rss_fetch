      <title>Band Structures of One-Dimensional Periodic Materials with Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how arbitrary unit cells of periodic materials can be represented as graphs whose nodes represent atoms and whose weighted edges represent tunneling connections between atoms. Further, we present methods to calculate the band structure of a material with an arbitrary graphical representation, which allows one to study the Fermi level of the material as well as conductivity at zero temperature. We present results for both circular chains as well as randomly-generated unit cell structures, and also use this representation to show that the connectivity of the unit cell is not correlated to its band gap at half filling. This paper provides an introductory insight into the utilization of graph theory for computational solid-state physics.</description>

      <title>Cluster dynamics in macroscopic photoactive particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental study on the collective behavior of macroscopic self-propelled particles that are externally excited by light. This property allows testing the system response to the excitation intensity in a very versatile manner. We discover that for low excitation intensities, clustering at the boundaries is always present, even when this is prevented by implementing flower-shaped confining walls. For high excitation intensities, however, clusters are dissolved more or less easily depending on their size. Then, a thorough analysis of the cluster dynamics allows us to depict a phase diagram depending on the number of agents in the arena and the excitation intensity. To explain this, we introduce a simple kinetic model where cluster evolution is governed by a balance between adsorption and desorption processes. Interestingly, this simple model is able to reproduce the phase space observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Topological Landau Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of Landau's theory of phase transitions by incorporating the topology of the order parameter. When the order parameter comprises several components arising from multiplicity in the same irreducible representation of symmetry, it can possess a nontrivial topology and acquire a Berry phase under the variation of thermodynamic parameters. To illustrate this idea, we investigate the superconducting phase transition of an electronic system with tetragonal symmetry and an attractive interaction involving two partial waves, both transforming in the trivial representation. By analyzing the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation in the adiabatic limit, we show that the order parameter acquires a Berry phase after a cyclic evolution of parameters. We study two concrete models -- one preserving time-reversal symmetry and one breaking it -- and demonstrate that the nontrivial topology of the order parameter originates from thermodynamic analogs of gapless Dirac and Weyl points in the phase diagram. Finally, we identify an experimental signature of the topological Berry phase in a Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Quantum kinetic theory of light-matter interactions in degenerate plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05917v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A rigorous treatment of light-matter interactions typically requires an interacting quantum field theory. However, most applications of interest are handled using classical or semiclassical models, which are valid only when quantum-field fluctuations can be neglected. This approximation breaks down in scenarios involving large light intensities or degenerate matter, where additional quantum effects become significant. In this work, we address these limitations by developing a quantum kinetic framework that treats both light and matter fields on equal footing, naturally incorporating both linear and nonlinear interactions. To accurately account for light fluctuations, we introduce a photon distribution function that, together with the classical electromagnetic fields, provides a better description of the photon fluid. From this formalism, we derive kinetic equations from first principles that recover classical electrodynamical results while revealing couplings that are absent in the corresponding classical theory. Furthermore, by addressing the Coulomb interaction in the Hartree-Fock approximation, we include the role of fermionic exchange exactly in both kinetic and fluid regimes through a generalized Fock potential. The latter provides corrections not only to the electrostatic forces but also to the plasma velocity fields, which become significant in degenerate conditions.</description>
