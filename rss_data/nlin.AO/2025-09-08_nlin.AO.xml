      <title>Swarming and Flocking Unified Through Behavioral Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural flocks (aligned) and swarms (non-aligned) both exhibit features of criticality, challenging their treatment as two ends of the same phase transition. We present a model for the cohesion of active individuals, who spontaneously self-assemble into a near-critical state, whether aligned or not. In our framework, these individuals move in open space and possess differing self-propelling velocities. The emerging velocity fluctuations, shown to be correlated and scale-invariant, are triggered by inherent noise rooted in individual imperfections. Using the finite-size scaling theory, we show that our system exhibits criticality features observed in groups of midges and starlings.</description>

      <title>Spatial Patterning and Selection: How the Environment Shapes Molecular Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assembly theory predicts that a distinguishing signature of life is its ability to produce complex molecules in abundance, opening new possibilities for life detection. Experimental validation of this approach has so far relied on abiotic controls like meteoritic material, or simple, well-mixed chemical systems. However, decades of research in self-organization have shown that spatial patterning can foster dynamical self-organization. This raises the possibility that systems with nontrivial spatial patterns might promote abiotic formation of molecules with higher than expected assembly indices, potentially leading to false positives in life detection approaches based on assembly theory. To explore this, we used a model of artificial chemistry to investigate how spatial organization can influence the development of molecular assembly indices. Our findings reveal that transport factors, such as diffusion, significantly affect the distribution of chemical species within a system. Additionally, system topology critically impacts the distribution of assembly indices: while it does not enable arbitrary complexity, ordered lattices can shift the threshold for abiotic chemistry upward. Moreover, we demonstrate that diffusion can impede the formation and detection of these high assembly index molecules, bearing important implications for life detection experiments and astrobiological missions.</description>

      <title>Integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity stabilizes cooperator-defector coexistence in N-player giving games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cooperation persists among strangers despite theoretical predictions of difficulties in large, well-mixed populations, leaving a fundamental evolutionary puzzle. While upstream (pay-it-forward: helping others because you were helped) and downstream (rewarding-reputation: helping those with good reputations) indirect reciprocity have been independently considered as solutions, their joint dynamics in multiplayer contexts remain unexplored. We study N-player giving games with benefit b and cost c and analyze evolutionary dynamics for three strategies: unconditional cooperation (X), unconditional defection (Y), and an integrated reciprocal strategy (Z) combining unconditional forwarding with reputation-based discrimination. We show that integrating upstream and downstream reciprocity can yield a globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium of unconditional defectors and integrated reciprocators whenever the benefit-to-cost ratio exceeds a threshold (b/c &gt; 2). Counterintuitively, introducing small complexity costs, rather than destabilizing, stabilizes the equilibrium by preventing not only unconditional cooperators (viewed as second-order freeloaders) but also alternative conditional strategies from invading. While the equilibrium frequency of integrated reciprocators decreases with group size N, it remains positive for any finite N. Rather than requiring uniformity, our model reveals one pathway to stable cooperation through strategic diversity. Defectors serve as "evolutionary shields" preventing system collapse while integrated reciprocators flexibly combine open and discriminative responses. This framework demonstrates how pay-it-forward chains and reputation systems can jointly maintain social polymorphism including cooperation despite cognitive limitations and group size challenges, offering a potential evolutionary foundation for behavioral diversity in human societies.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Theory of Behavioural Swarms: Towards Modelling the Collective Dynamics of Living Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical swarm models, exemplified by the Cucker--Smale framework, provide foundational insights into collective alignment but exhibit fundamental limitations in capturing the adaptive, heterogeneous behaviours intrinsic to living systems. This paper formalises the mathematical theory of \textit{Behavioural Swarms}, a comprehensive framework where each particle's state incorporates a dynamic internal variable, the \textit{activity} that co-evolves with position and velocity through nonlocal interactions. We demonstrate how this approach transcends prior models by integrating adaptive decision-making mechanisms and heterogeneous behavioural states into rigorous differential systems. Through applications in behavioural economics and crowd dynamics, we establish the theory's capacity to predict emergent macroscopic patterns from individual behavioural states. Our critical analysis positions this framework against kinetic theories of active particles and agent-based approaches, revealing distinct advantages for modelling systems where individual agency drives collective outcomes.</description>
