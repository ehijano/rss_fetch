      <title>A New Horizon of Data Communication through Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the blessing of our existing data communication system, we can communicate or share our information with each other in every nook and corner of the world within some few seconds but there are some limitations in our traditional data communication system. Every day we are trying to overcome these limitations and improve our systems for better performance. Among them some problems may not be resolvable, for the reason of very basic or root dependencies of physics. In this paper, we have clarified some main drawbacks in our traditional communication system and provided a conceptual model to overcome these issues by using mystic Quantum Entanglement theorem rather than classical or modern physics phenomenon. In the end, we introduced a possible Quantum circuit diagram and Quantum network architecture for end-to-end data communication. It is predicted that through this hypothetical model data can be transmitted faster than light and it will be 100% real time between any distances without any kinds of traditional communication medium that are being used to date.</description>

      <title>Measuring the speed of quantum particles without a round-trip under non-synchronized quantum clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main issues in measuring the speed of light when it only travels from one spatial position into another position, known as the one-way speed of light, is that the clocks belonging to each separated spatial position are not and, in principle, cannot be synchronized with sufficient precision. This issue is the main reason why all of the measurements of the speed of light until now have measured the two-way speed of light, i.e., measuring the speed of light that travels from a source to another location and back to the source, and so there is a need for only one clock to measure the speed. Here, we show that it is possible, in principle, to measure the velocity of particles that travel at the speed of light without assuming a round-trip once we adopt a quantum mechanical description under two boundary conditions to the state of the quantum system followed by the two-state-vector formalism while assuming non-synchronized quantum clocks with unknown time dilation. We show that the weak value of velocity can be measured for a test particle that has a clock that is not synchronized with the clock of the quantum particle. Following the proposed setup, when the weak value of the velocity is known even without knowing the time states of the system, such a weak velocity is the two-way speed of light. Otherwise, one has to impose assumptions regarding the time states of the quantum clocks, which then give weak velocities that can be slower or even faster than the two-way speed of light. We further explore some fundamental implications of the setup. The proposed approach opens a new avenue toward measuring the velocities of quantum particles while overcoming relativistic issues regarding the synchronization of clocks.</description>

      <title>Persistent Topological Negativity in a High-Temperature Mixed-State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state as it thermalizes under a strongly-symmetric quantum channel describing the Metropolis-Hastings dynamics for the $d$-dimensional classical Ising model at inverse temperature $\beta$. This channel outputs the classical Gibbs state when acting on a product state in the computational basis. When applying this channel to a GHZ state in spatial dimension $d&gt;1$, the resulting mixed state changes character at the Ising phase transition temperature from being long-range entangled to short-range-entangled as temperature increases. Nevertheless, we show that the topological entanglement negativity of a large region is insensitive to this transition and takes the same value as that of the pure GHZ state at any finite temperature $\beta&gt;0$. We establish this result by devising a local operations and classical communication (LOCC) ``decoder" that provides matching lower and upper bounds on the negativity in the thermodynamic limit which may be of independent interest. This perspective connects the negativity to an error-correction problem on the $(d-1)$-dimensional bipartitioning surface and explains the persistent negativity in certain correlated noise models found in previous studies. Numerical results confirm our analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing Universal Thermalization Dynamics in a (2+1)D Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating non-equilibrium phenomena in strongly-interacting quantum many-body systems, including thermalization, is a promising application of near-term and future quantum computation. By performing experiments on a digital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled trapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics of a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using randomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical approximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution and the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables exhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for thermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust tools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body systems, including in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Highly-efficient quantum Fourier transformations for some nonabelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Fourier transformations are an essential component of many quantum algorithms, from prime factoring to quantum simulation. While the standard abelian QFT is well-studied, important variants corresponding to \emph{nonabelian} groups of interest have seen less development. In particular, fast nonabelian Fourier transformations are important components for both quantum simulations of field theories as well as approaches to the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem. In this work, we present fast quantum Fourier transformations for a number of nonabelian groups of interest for high energy physics, $\mathbb{BT}$, $\mathbb{BO}$, $\Delta(27)$, $\Delta(54)$, and $\Sigma(36\times3)$. For each group, we derive explicit quantum circuits and estimate resource scaling for fault-tolerant implementations. Our work shows that the development of a fast Fourier transformation can substantively reduce simulation costs by up to three orders of magnitude for the finite groups that we have investigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compilation optimizes quantum algorithms performances on real-world quantum computers. To date, it is performed via classical optimization strategies. We introduce a class of quantum algorithms to perform compilation via quantum computers, paving the way for a quantum advantage in compilation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach via Quantum and Simulated Annealing-based compilation: we successfully compile a Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation with up to 64 qubits and 64 time-steps and a Quantum Fourier Transform with up to 40 qubits and 771 time steps. We show that, for a translationally invariant circuit, the compilation results in a fidelity gain that grows extensively in the size of the input circuit, outperforming any local or quasi-local compilation approach.</description>

      <title>Small correlation is sufficient for optimal noisy quantum metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a class of metrological resource states whose quantum Fisher information scales optimally in both system size and noise rate. In these states, qubits are partitioned into sensing groups with relatively large correlations within a group but small correlations between groups. The states are obtainable from local Hamiltonian evolution, and we design a metrologically optimal and efficient measurement protocol utilizing time-reversed dynamics and single-qubit local measurements. Using quantum domino dynamics, we also present a protocol free of the time-reversal step that has an estimation error roughly twice the best possible value.</description>

      <title>Full classification of Pauli Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie groups, and therefore Lie algebras, are fundamental structures in quantum physics that determine the space of possible trajectories of evolving systems. However, classification and characterization methods for these structures are often impractical for larger systems. In this work, we provide a comprehensive classification of Lie algebras generated by an arbitrary set of Pauli operators, from which an efficient method to characterize them follows. By mapping the problem to a graph setting, we identify a reduced set of equivalence classes: the free-fermionic Lie algebra, the set of all anti-symmetric Paulis on n qubits, the Lie algebra of symplectic Paulis on n qubits, and the space of all Pauli operators on n qubits, as well as controlled versions thereof. Moreover, out of these, we distinguish 6 Clifford inequivalent cases and find a simple set of canonical operators for each, which allow us to give a physical interpretation of the dynamics of each class. Our findings reveal a no-go result for the existence of small Lie algebras beyond the free-fermionic case in the Pauli setting and offer efficiently computable criteria for universality and extendibility of gate sets. These results bear significant impact in ideas in a number of fields like quantum control, quantum machine learning, or classical simulation of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Non-Demolition Measurements and Leggett-Garg inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum non-demolition measurements define a non-invasive protocol to extract information from a quantum system that we aim to monitor. They exploit an additional quantum system that is sequentially coupled to the system. Eventually, by measuring the additional system, we can extract information about temporal correlations developed by the quantum system dynamics with respect to a given observable. This protocol leads to a quasi-probability distribution for the measured observable outcomes, which can be negative. We prove that the presence of these negative regions is a necessary and sufficient condition for the violation of macrorealism. This is a much stronger condition than the violation of the Leggett-Garg inequalities commonly used for the same task. Indeed, we show that there are situations in which Leggett-Garg inequalities are satisfied even if the macrorealism condition is violated. As a consequence, the quantum non-demolition protocol is a privileged tool to identify with certainty the quantum behavior of a system. As such, it has a vast number of applications to different fields from the certification of quantumness to the study of the quantum-to-classical transition.</description>

      <title>Capacities of quantum Markovian noise for large times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a quantum Markovian noise model, we study the maximum dimension of a classical or quantum system that can be stored for arbitrarily large time. We show that, unlike the fixed time setting, in the limit of infinite time, the classical and quantum capacities are characterized by efficiently computable properties of the peripheral spectrum of the quantum channel. In addition, the capacities are additive under tensor product, which implies in the language of Shannon theory that the one-shot and the asymptotic i.i.d. capacities are the same. We also provide an improved algorithm for computing the structure of the peripheral subspace of a quantum channel, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Pulse family optimization for parametrized quantum gates using spectral clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametrized gate circuits are used in plentiful applications in the current NISQ era of quantum computing. These parametrized gates are chiefly implemented using analytically found pulse protocols, often yielding suboptimal gate times, and consequently, fidelities. Alternatively, gate optimization algorithms are designed to construct high fidelity pulses for individual, fixed points in continuous parameter space. Gates for intermediate parameters can subsequently be found by some form of interpolation between previously constructed pulses. Nevertheless, it is not guaranteed (as with analytic protocols) that the pulses found by the optimization algorithms belong to the same \textit{family} of solutions and thus show resemblance. Interpolation between two pulses of differing solution families often leads to high infidelities, as the pulse strays away from the minimum in the parameter/fidelity landscape. In this work, we introduce a \textit{spectral clustering} method to sort high-fidelity, optimized pulses in families, and interpolating solely between pulses of the same family. Accordingly, interpolations will always approach maximal fidelity. Furthermore, as more than one pulse family is constructed, the parameter space can be partitioned according to which family prevails fidelity-wise. This work provides a meticulous demonstration of our constitutive continuous gate family construction by applying it to a universal gate set for Rydberg and Cat qubits under noise.</description>

      <title>Ergotropy and Capacity Optimization in Heisenberg Spin Chain Quantum Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the performance of finite spin quantum batteries (QBs) using Heisenberg spin models with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) and Kaplan--Shekhtman--Entin-Wohlman--Aharony (KSEA) interactions. The QBs are modeled as interacting quantum spins in local inhomogeneous magnetic fields, inducing variable Zeeman splitting. We derive analytical expressions for the maximal extractable work, ergotropy and the capacity of QBs, as recently examined by Yang et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 030402 (2023)]. These quantities are analytically linked through certain quantum correlations, as posited in the aforementioned study. Different Heisenberg spin chain models exhibit distinct behaviors under varying conditions, emphasizing the importance of model selection for optimizing QB performance. In antiferromagnetic (AFM) systems, maximum ergotropy occurs with a Zeeman splitting field applied to either spin, while ferromagnetic (FM) systems benefit from a uniform Zeeman field. Temperature significantly impacts QB performance, with ergotropy in the AFM case being generally more robust against temperature increases compared to the FM case. Incorporating DM and KSEA couplings can significantly enhance the capacity and ergotropy extraction of QBs. However, there exists a threshold beyond which additional increases in these interactions cause a sharp decline in capacity and ergotropy. This behavior is influenced by temperature and quantum coherence, which signal the occurrence of a sudden phase transition. The resource theory of quantum coherence proposed by Baumgratz et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401 (2014)] plays a crucial role in enhancing ergotropy and capacity. However, ergotropy is limited by both the system's capacity and the amount of coherence. These findings support the theoretical framework of spin-based QBs and may benefit future research on quantum energy storage devices.</description>

      <title>Quantum repeater protocol for deterministic distribution of macroscopic entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributing long-distance entanglement is a fundamental goal that is necessary for a variety of tasks such as quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and quantum metrology. Currently quantum repeater schemes typically aim to distribute one ebit at a time, the equivalent of one Bell pair's worth of entanglement. Here we present a method to distribute a macroscopic amount of entanglement across long-distances using a number of operations that scales only linearly with the chain length. The scheme involves ensembles of qubits and entangling them with an $S^z S^z$ interaction, which can be realized using atomic gas ensembles coupled by a shared optical mode. Using only local measurements on the intermediate ensembles, this leaves the ensembles at the ends of the chain entangled. We show that there are particular ``magic'' interaction times that allow for distribution of entanglement with perfect fidelity, with no degradation with chain length. The scheme is deterministic, such that with suitable local conditional unitary corrections, the same entangled state can always be prepared with good approximation.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement for Multi-node Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling the number of entangled nodes in a quantum network is a challenge with significant implications for quantum computing, clock synchronisation, secure communications, and quantum sensing. In a quantum network, photons interact with matter qubits at different nodes, flexibly enabling the creation of remote entanglement between them. Multipartite entanglement among multiple nodes will be crucial for many proposed quantum network applications, including quantum computational tasks and quantum metrology. To date, experimental efforts have primarily focused on generating bipartite entanglement between nodes, which is widely regarded as the fundamental quantum resource for quantum networks. However, relying exclusively on bipartite entanglement to form more complex multipartite entanglement introduces several challenges. These include the need for ancillary qubits, extensive local entangling operations which increases the preparation latency, and increasingly stringent requirements on coherence times as the number of nodes grows. Here, we analyse various schemes that achieve multipartite entanglement between nodes in a single step, bypassing the need for multiple rounds of bipartite entanglement. We demonstrate that different schemes can produce distinct multipartite entangled states, with varying fidelity and generation rates. Additionally, we discuss the applicability of these schemes across different experimental platforms, highlighting their primary advantages and disadvantages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a generative quantum learning algorithm, R\'enyi-ADAPT, using the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem Tailored ansatz (ADAPT) framework in which the loss function to be minimized is the maximal quantum R\'enyi divergence of order two, an unbounded function that mitigates barren plateaus which inhibit training variational circuits. We benchmark this method against other state-of-the-art adaptive algorithms by learning random two-local thermal states. We perform numerical experiments on systems of up to 12 qubits, comparing our method to learning algorithms that use linear objective functions, and show that R\'enyi-ADAPT is capable of constructing shallow quantum circuits competitive with existing methods, while the gradients remain favorable resulting from the maximal R\'enyi divergence loss function.</description>

      <title>Scaling and assigning resources on ion trap QCCD architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion trap technologies have earned significant attention as potential candidates for quantum information processing due to their long decoherence times and precise manipulation of individual qubits, distinguishing them from other candidates in the field of quantum technologies. However, scalability remains a challenge, as introducing additional qubits into a trap increases noise and heating effects, consequently decreasing operational fidelity. Trapped-ion Quantum Charge-Coupled Device (QCCD) architectures have addressed this limitation by interconnecting multiple traps and employing ion shuttling mechanisms to transfer ions among traps. This new architectural design requires the development of novel compilation techniques for quantum algorithms, which efficiently allocate and route qubits, and schedule operations. The aim of a compiler is to minimize ion movements and, therefore, reduce the execution time of the circuit to achieve a higher fidelity.
  In this paper, we propose a novel approach for initial qubit placement, demonstrating enhancements of up to 50\% compared to prior methods. Furthermore, we conduct a scalability analysis on two distinct QCCD topologies: a 1D-linear array and a ring structure. Additionally, we evaluate the impact of the excess capacity -- i.e. the number of free spaces within a trap -- on the algorithm performance.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization and Floquet engineering in a spin ensemble with a clock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying and controlling quantum many-body interactions is fundamentally important for quantum science and related emerging technologies. Optically addressable solid-state spins offer a promising platform for exploring various quantum many-body phenomena due to their scalability to a large Hilbert space. However, it is often challenging to probe many-body dynamics in solid-state spin systems due to large on-site disorder and undesired coupling to the environment. Here, we investigate an optically addressable solid-state spin system comprising a strongly interacting ensemble of millions of ytterbium-171 ions in a crystal. Notably, this platform features a clock transition that gives rise to pure long-range spin-exchange interactions, termed the dipolar XY model. Leveraging this unique feature, we investigate quantum thermalization by varying the relative ratio of interaction strength to disorder, dynamically engineering the XY model into other many-body Hamiltonian models, and realizing a time-crystalline phase of matter through periodic driving. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of rare-earth ions serves as a versatile testbed for many-body physics and offers valuable insights for advancing quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Provably Efficient Adiabatic Learning for Quantum-Classical Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-classical hybrid dynamics is crucial for accurately simulating complex systems where both quantum and classical behaviors need to be considered. However, coupling between classical and quantum degrees of freedom and the exponential growth of the Hilbert space present significant challenges. Current machine learning approaches for predicting such dynamics, while promising, remain unknown in their error bounds, sample complexity, and generalizability. In this work, we establish a generic theoretical framework for analyzing quantum-classical adiabatic dynamics with learning algorithms. Based on quantum information theory, we develop a provably efficient adiabatic learning (PEAL) algorithm with logarithmic system size sampling complexity and favorable time scaling properties. We benchmark PEAL on the Holstein model, and demonstrate its accuracy in predicting single-path dynamics and ensemble dynamics observables as well as transfer learning over a family of Hamiltonians. Our framework and algorithm open up new avenues for reliable and efficient learning of quantum-classical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Rank Is All You Need: Estimating the Trace of Powers of Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the trace of powers of identical $k$ density matrices (i.e., $\text{Tr}(\rho^k)$) is a crucial subroutine for many applications such as calculating nonlinear functions of quantum states, preparing quantum Gibbs states, and mitigating quantum errors. Reducing the requisite number of qubits and gates is essential to fit a quantum algorithm onto near-term quantum devices. Inspired by the Newton-Girard method, we developed an algorithm that uses only $\mathcal{O}(r)$ qubits and $\mathcal{O}(r)$ multi-qubit gates, where $r$ is the rank of $\rho$. We prove that the estimation of $\{\text{Tr}(\rho^i)\}_{i=1}^r$ is sufficient for estimating the trace of powers with large $k &gt; r$. With these advantages, our algorithm brings the estimation of the trace of powers closer to the capabilities of near-term quantum processors. We show that our results can be generalized for estimating $\text{Tr}(M\rho^k)$, where $M$ is an arbitrary observable, and demonstrate the advantages of our algorithm in several applications.</description>

      <title>Redefining Lexicographical Ordering: Optimizing Pauli String Decompositions for Quantum Compiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computing, the efficient optimization of Pauli string decompositions is a crucial aspect for the compilation of quantum circuits for many applications, such as chemistry simulations and quantum machine learning. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm for the synthesis of trotterized time-evolution operators that results in circuits with significantly fewer gates than previous solutions. Our synthesis procedure takes the qubit connectivity of a target quantum computer into account. As a result, the generated quantum circuit does not require routing, and no additional CNOT gates are needed to run the resulting circuit on a target device. We compare our algorithm against Paulihedral and TKET, and show a significant improvement for randomized circuits and different molecular ansatzes. We also investigate the Trotter error introduced by our ordering of the terms in the Hamiltonian versus default ordering and the ordering from the baseline methods and conclude that our method on average does not increase the Trotter error.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of Nonlinear Collision Operator in Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm to tackle the quadratic nonlinearity in the Lattice Boltzmann (LB) collision operator. The key idea is to build the quantum gates based on the particle distribution functions (PDF) within the coherence time for qubits. Thus, both the operator and a state vector are linear functions of PDFs, and upon quantum state evolution, the resulting PDFs will have quadraticity. To this end, we decompose the collision operator for a $DmQn$ lattice model into a product of $2(n+1)$ operators, where $n$ is the number of lattice velocity directions. After decomposition, the $(n+1)$ operators with constant entries remain unchanged throughout the simulation, whereas the remaining $(n+1)$ will be built based on the statevector of the previous time step. Also, we show that such a decomposition is not unique. Compared to the second-order Carleman-linearized LB, the present approach reduces the circuit width by half and circuit depth by exponential order. The proposed algorithm has been verified through the one-dimensional flow discontinuity and two-dimensional Kolmogrov-like flow test cases.</description>

      <title>A Search for High-Threshold Qutrit Magic State Distillation Routines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the best attainable threshold for qudit magic state distillation is directly related to the question of whether or not contextuality is sufficient for universal quantum computation. We carry out a search for high-threshold magic state distillation routines for a highly-symmetric qutrit magic state known as the strange state. Our search covers a large class of $[[n,1]]_3$ qutrit stabilizer codes with up to 23 qutrits, and is facilitated by a theorem that relates the distillation performance of a qudit stabilizer code to its weight-enumerators. We could not find any code with $n&lt;23$ qutrits that distills the strange state with better than linear noise suppression, other than the 11-qutrit Golay code. However, for $n=23$, we find over 600 CSS codes that can distill the qutrit strange state with cubic noise suppression. While none of these codes surpass the threshold of the 11-qutrit Golay code, their existence suggests that, for large codes, the ability to distill the qutrit strange state is somewhat generic.</description>

      <title>How quantum and evolutionary algorithms can help each other: two examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of bio-inspired evolutionary algorithms for designing quantum circuits with specific goals, focusing on two particular tasks. The first one is motivated by the ideas of Artificial Life that are used to reproduce stochastic cellular automata with given rules. We test the robustness of quantum implementations of the cellular automata for different numbers of quantum gates The second task deals with the sampling of quantum circuits that generate highly entangled quantum states, which constitute an important resource for quantum computing. In particular, an evolutionary algorithm is employed to optimize circuits with respect to a fitness function defined with the Mayer-Wallach entanglement measure. We demonstrate that, by balancing the mutation rate between exploration and exploitation, we can find entangling quantum circuits for up to five qubits. We also discuss the trade-off between the number of gates in quantum circuits and the computational costs of finding the gate arrangements leading to a strongly entangled state. Our findings provide additional insight into the trade-off between the complexity of a circuit and its performance, which is an important factor in the design of quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Diffracting molecular matter-waves at deep-ultraviolet standing-light waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matter-wave interferometry with molecules is intriguing both because it demonstrates a fundamental quantum phenomenon and because it opens avenues to quantum-enhanced measurements in physical chemistry. One great challenge in such experiments is to establish matter-wave beam splitting mechanisms that are efficient and applicable to a wide range of particles. In the past, continuous standing light waves in the visible spectral range were used predominantly as phase gratings, while pulsed vacuum ultraviolet light found applications in photo-ionisation gratings. Here, we explore the regime of continuous, intense deep-ultraviolet ($\rm &gt;1 MW/cm^2$, $\rm 266\,nm$) light masks, where a rich variety of photo-physical and photo-chemical phenomena and relaxation pathways must be considered. The improved understanding of the mechanisms in this interaction opens new potential pathways to protein interferometry and to matter-wave enhanced sensing of molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Optimally robust shortcuts to population inversion in cat-state qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cat-state qubits formed by photonic coherent states are a promising candidate for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computing. Such logic qubits have a biased noise channel that the bit-flip error dominates over all the other errors. In this manuscript, we propose an optimally robust protocol using the control method of shortcuts to adiabaticity to realize a nearly perfect population inversion in a cat-state qubit. We construct a shortcut based on the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant and examine the stability versus different types of perturbations for the fast and robust population inversion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the population inversion can be mostly insensitive to systematic errors in our protocol. Even when the parameter imperfection rate for bit-flip control is $20\%$, the final population of the target state can still reach $\geq 99\%$. The optimally robust control provides a feasible method for fault-tolerant and scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Generating three-photon Rabi oscillations without a large-detuning condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that in the quantum Rabi model, a three-photon resonance occurs when the cavity field bare frequency is about 1/3 of the atomic transition frequency. In this manuscript, we show that the resonance can also be generated in the absence of the 1/3 condition by employing an artificial atom with tunable transition frequency. To realize the protocol, the modulation frequency should be comparable to the cavity frequency in order to induce a counter-rotating interaction in the effective Hamiltonian. In this way, three-photon Rabi oscillations can be observed in a small-detuning regime, thus avoiding the excitation of high-energy states. We derive an effective Hamiltonian (equivalent to the anisotropic Rabi model Hamiltonian) to determine the magnitude of the energy splitting and the resonance position. Numerical simulations results show that the protocol not only generates a three-photon resonance, but also has a detectable output photon flux. We hope the protocol can be exploited for the realization of Fock-state sources and the generation of multiparticle entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a protocol for the preparation of high-fidelity entangled cat states with composite pulses. The physical model contains two Kerr-nonlinear resonators and a cavity. By properly designing the parameters, each Kerr-nonlinear resonator is confined in the cat-state subspace and the entangled cat states can be generated efficiently. We introduce composite two-photon drives with multiple amplitudes and frequencies to improve the fidelity of the entangled cat states in the presence of parameter errors. The performance of the protocol is estimated by taking into account the parametric errors and decoherence. Numerical simulation results show that the protocol is insensitive to timing error and detuning error, and has strong robustness to decoherence. We hope the protocol may provide a method for preparing stable entangled cat states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a relativistic quantum communication channel between two localized qubit systems, mediated by a relativistic quantum field, that can achieve the theoretical maximum for the quantum capacity in arbitrary curved spacetimes using the Unruh-DeWitt detector formalism. Using techniques from algebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum communication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field and the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting quantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are independent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice of Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.</description>

      <title>Robust Implementation of Discrete-time Quantum Walks in Any Finite-dimensional Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research has shown that quantum walks can accelerate certain quantum algorithms and act as a universal paradigm for quantum processing. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, owing to its discrete nature, stands out as one of the most suitable choices for circuit implementation. Nevertheless, most current implementations are characterized by extensive, multi-layered quantum circuits, leading to higher computational expenses and a notable decrease in the number of confidently executable time steps on current quantum computers. Since quantum computers are not scalable enough in this NISQ era, we also must confine ourselves to the ancilla-free frontier zone. Therefore, in this paper, we have successfully cut down the circuit cost concerning gate count and circuit depth by half through our proposed methodology in qubit systems as compared to the state-of-the-art increment-decrement approach. Furthermore, for the engineering excellence of our proposed approach, we implement DTQW in any finite-dimensional quantum system with akin efficiency. To ensure an efficient implementation of quantum walks without requiring ancilla, we have incorporated an intermediate qudit technique for decomposing multi-qubit gates. Experimental outcomes hold significance far beyond the realm of just a few time steps, laying the groundwork for dependable implementation and utilization on quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a cost-effective method for collecting single photons emitted from single nitrogen-vacancy centers in nanodiamonds. Conventional components of a confocal laser-scanning microscope, such as microscope objectives and the piezo translation stages, are replaced by two affordable Blu-ray optical pickup units. A Hanbury Brown and Twiss setup is used to identify single photon emission. The proposed approach is inexpensive and simple and lowers the entry-level to single photon research for quantum technologies. This enables student lab experiments or demonstration experiments at schools and shows that efficient sources of quantum light can be made from standard components compatible with established industry processes.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Protocol for High-Quality QAOA Parameters with Few Shots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum heuristic for combinatorial optimization that has been demonstrated to scale better than state-of-the-art classical solvers for some problems. For a given problem instance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters. While average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful performance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given instance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of circuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end protocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques. We use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the shot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal model (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a trapped-ion processor using up to $32$ qubits and $5$ QAOA layers, and we demonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To the best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA parameter tuning on a trapped-ion processor.</description>

Abstract: The field of Quantum Computing has gathered significant popularity in recent years and a large number of papers have studied its effectiveness in tackling many tasks. We focus in particular on Quantum Annealing (QA), a meta-heuristic solver for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. It is known that the effectiveness of QA is dependent on the task itself, as is the case for classical solvers, but there is not yet a clear understanding of which are the characteristics of a problem that makes it difficult to solve with QA. In this work, we propose a new methodology to study the effectiveness of QA based on meta-learning models. To do so, we first build a dataset composed of more than five thousand instances of ten different optimization problems. We define a set of more than a hundred features to describe their characteristics, and solve them with both QA and three classical solvers. We publish this dataset online for future research. Then, we train multiple meta-models to predict whether QA would solve that instance effectively and use them to probe which are the features with the strongest impact on the effectiveness of QA. Our results indicate that it is possible to accurately predict the effectiveness of QA, validating our methodology. Furthermore, we observe that the distribution of the problem coefficients representing the bias and coupling terms is very informative to identify the probability of finding good solutions, while the density of these coefficients alone is not enough. The methodology we propose allows to open new research directions to further our understanding of the effectiveness of QA, by probing specific dimensions or by developing new QUBO formulations that are better suited for the particular nature of QA. Furthermore, the proposed methodology is flexible and can be extended or used to study other quantum or classical solvers.</description>

      <title>Estimating quantum Markov chains using coherent absorber post-processing and pattern counting estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a two step strategy for estimating one-dimensional dynamical parameters of a quantum Markov chain, which involves quantum post-processing the output using a coherent quantum absorber and a "pattern counting'' estimator computed as a simple additive functional of the outcomes trajectory produced by sequential, identical measurements on the output units. We provide strong theoretical and numerical evidence that the estimator achieves the quantum Cram\'{e}-Rao bound in the limit of large output size. Our estimation method is underpinned by an asymptotic theory of translationally invariant modes (TIMs) built as averages of shifted tensor products of output operators, labelled by binary patterns. For large times, the TIMs form a bosonic algebra and the output state approaches a joint coherent state of the TIMs whose amplitude depends linearly on the mismatch between system and absorber parameters. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime the TIMs capture the full quantum Fisher information of the output state. While directly probing the TIMs' quadratures seems impractical, we show that the standard sequential measurement is an effective joint measurement of all the TIMs number operators; indeed, we show that counts of different binary patterns extracted from the measurement trajectory have the expected joint Poisson distribution. Together with the displaced-null methodology of J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57 245304 2024 this provides a computationally efficient estimator which only depends on the total number of patterns. This opens the way for similar estimation strategies in continuous-time dynamics, expanding the results of Phys. Rev. X 13, 031012 2023.</description>

      <title>Driving of an open quantum system at finite temperature across first- and second-order quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open fully connected system of qubits at nonzero temperature is driven within a finite time interval along various paths in the space of its control parameters. The driving leads across finite-size precursors of the first- and second-order quantum phase transition from factorized to entangled ground-state phases, aiming at the preparation of the complex ground state of the system at the final parameter point with maximal fidelity. During the drive, the system is coupled to a heat bath with a constant temperature, the dynamics being determined in a nonpertubative way by the method of Hierarchical Equations of Motion. It is shown that the presence of the heat bath in combination with specific patterns of avoided crossings affecting the ground and excited states in the parameter region around the quantum phase transition may considerably improve the fidelity of preparation of the target ground state.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Roles of Quantum Environments: From Heat Baths to Work Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environments in quantum thermodynamics usually take the role of heat baths. These baths are Markovian, weakly coupled to the system, and initialized in a thermal state. Whenever one of these properties is missing, standard quantum thermodynamics is no longer suitable to treat the thermodynamic properties of the system that result from the interaction with the environment. Using a recently proposed framework for open system quantum thermodynamics which is valid for arbitrary couplings and non-Markovian effects, we show that within the very same model, described by a Fano-Anderson Hamiltonian, the environment can take three different thermodynamic roles: a standard heat bath, exchanging only heat with the system, a work reservoir, exchanging only work, and a hybrid environment, providing both types of energy exchange. The exact role of the environment is determined by the strength and structure of the coupling, and by its initial state. The latter also dictates the long time behaviour of the open system, leading to thermal equilibrium for an initial thermal state and to a nonequilibrium steady state when there are displaced environmental modes.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Stochastic Dynamics of Quantum Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steady-state quantum thermal machines are typically characterized by a continuous flow of heat between different reservoirs. However, at the level of discrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt quantum jumps, each representing the exchange of finite quanta with the environment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of quantum thermal machines into cycles that are classified as engine-like, cooling-like, or idle. We explore the statistics of each cycle type and its duration, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for thermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of the same type. Our framework presents a novel approach in characterizing thermal machines, with significant relevance to modern experiments, such as mesoscopic transport using quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Perfect Wave Transfer in Continuous Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the perfect transfer of information in 1+1D continuous quantum systems. This includes effective descriptions of inhomogeneous spin chains, for which the notion of perfect state transfer in quantum information was introduced, and here phrased in terms of waves. We show that reflection symmetry is necessary for perfect wave transfer (PWT) in any inhomogeneous conformal field theory, and even sufficient when restricted to one-particle excitations. To determine if or when it is sufficient more generally, we first break conformal invariance and study a broad class of 1+1D bosonic theories. We show that the question can then be posed as an inverse Sturm-Liouville problem that determines when the bosonic theory exhibits PWT. We demonstrate how to uniquely solve this problem, which also shows that reflection symmetry is sufficient for the special case with conformal invariance. Using bosonization, our continuum results extend these notions to interacting quantum field theories.</description>

      <title>The dynamical alpha-R\'enyi entropies of local Hamiltonians grow at most linearly in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generic one dimensional spin system of length L, arbitrarily large, with strictly local interactions, for example nearest neighbor, and prove that the dynamical alpha-R\'enyi entropies, 0 &lt; alpha &lt; 1, of an initial product state grow at most linearly in time. We extend our bound on the dynamical generation of entropy to systems with exponential decay of interactions, for values of alpha close enough to 1. We provide a non rigorous argument to extend our results to initial low-entangled, meaning O(log L) states. This class of states includes many examples of spin systems ground states, and also critical states. This implies that low entanglement states have an efficient MPS representation that persists at least up to times of order log L. The main technical tools are the Lieb-Robinson bounds, to locally approximate the dynamics of the spin chain, a strict upper bound of Audenaert on alpha-R\'enyi entropies and a bound on their concavity. Such a bound, that we provide in an appendix, can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>To reset, or not to reset -- that is the question</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether to reset qubits, or not, during quantum error correction experiments is a question of both foundational and practical importance for quantum computing. Text-book quantum error correction demands that qubits are reset after measurement. However, fast qubit reset has proven challenging to execute at high fidelity. Consequently, many cutting-edge quantum error correction experiments are opting for the no-reset approach, where physical reset is not performed. It has recently been postulated that no-reset is functionally equivalent to reset procedures, as well as being faster and easier. For memory experiments, we confirm numerically that resetting provides no benefit. On the other hand, we identify a remarkable difference during logical operations. We find that unconditionally resetting qubits can reduce the duration of fault-tolerant logical operation by up to a factor of two as the number of measurement errors that can be tolerated is doubled. We support this with numerical simulations. However, our simulations also reveal that the no-reset performance is superior if the reset duration or infidelity exceeds a given threshold. Lastly, we introduce two novel syndrome extraction circuits that can reduce the time overhead of no-reset approaches. Our findings provide guidance on how experimentalists should design future experiments.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Network Instrument: Measuring PQC Adoption Rates and Identifying Migration Pathways</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.
  This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.
  This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029\% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024. Our analyses identify pathways to migrate current applications to be quantum-resistant.</description>

Abstract: It is possible to make a detector which clicks after absorbing a single graviton. Similarly, it is possible to make a gravitational wave detector which can see the quantum noise induced by certain highly squeezed states of the graviton. However, contrary to some recent arguments in the literature, observation of either or both of these signals would not constitute proof or even evidence that the gravitational field is quantized. This is a simple technical statement: a classical gravitational wave can produce the same output data in a detector. Here we explain this result, presented earlier in arXiv:2308.12988, which is a straightforward extension of an ancient argument in quantum optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-electron interactions in high-mobility conductors can give rise to transport signatures resembling those described by classical hydrodynamics. Using a nanoscale scanning magnetometer, we imaged a distinctive hydrodynamic transport pattern - stationary current vortices - in a monolayer graphene device at room temperature. By measuring devices with increasing characteristic size, we observed the disappearance of the current vortex and thus verify a prediction of the hydrodynamic model. We further observed that vortex flow is present for both hole- and electron-dominated transport regimes, while disappearing in the ambipolar regime. We attribute this effect to a reduction of the vorticity diffusion length near charge neutrality. Our work showcases the power of local imaging techniques for unveiling exotic mesoscopic transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Engineering Rydberg-pair interactions in divalent atoms with hyperfine-split ionization thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information processing with neutral atoms relies on Rydberg excitation for entanglement generation. While the use of heavy divalent or open-shell elements, such as strontium or ytterbium, has benefits due to their optically active core and a variety of possible qubit encodings, their Rydberg structure is generally complex. For some isotopes in particular, hyperfine interactions are relevant even for highly excited electronic states. We employ multi-channel quantum defect theory to infer the Rydberg structure of isotopes with non-zero nuclear spin and perform non-perturbative Rydberg-pair interaction calculations. We find that due to the high level density and sensitivities to external fields, experimental parameters must be precisely controlled. Specifically in ${}^{87}$Sr, we study an intrinsic F\"orster resonance, unique to divalent atoms with hyperfine-split thresholds, which simultaneously provides line stability with respect to external field fluctuations and enhanced long-range interactions. Additionally, we provide parameters for pair states that can be effectively described by single-channel Rydberg series. The explored pair states provide exciting opportunities for applications in the blockade regime as well as for more exotic long-range interactions such as largely flat, distance-independent potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whispering gallery mode (WGM) optomechanical resonators are a promising technology for the simultaneous control and measurement of optical and mechanical degrees of freedom at the nanoscale. They offer potential for use across a wide range of applications such as sensors and quantum transducers. Double-disk WGM resonators, which host strongly interacting mechanical and optical modes co-localized around their circumference, are particularly attractive due to their high optomechanical coupling. Large-scale integrated fabrication of silicon double-disk WGM resonators has not previously been demonstrated. In this work we present a process for the fabrication of double-layer silicon-on-insulator wafers, which we then use to fabricate functional optomechanical double silicon disk resonators with on-chip optical coupling. The integrated devices present an experimentally observed optical quality factors of the order of 10^5 and a single-photon optomechanical coupling of approximately 15 kHz.</description>

Abstract: This article introduces operator on operator regression in quantum probability. Here in the regression model, the response and the independent variables are certain operator valued observables, and they are linearly associated with unknown scalar coefficient (denoted by $\beta$), and the error is a random operator. In the course of this study, we propose a quantum version of a class of estimators (denoted by $M$ estimator) of $\beta$, and the large sample behaviour of those quantum version of the estimators are derived, given the fact that the true model is also linear and the samples are observed eigenvalue pairs of the operator valued observables.</description>

      <title>Second-order nonlocal shifts of scattered wave-packets: What can be measured by Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effects ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scattering of wavepackets with arbitrary energy dispersion on surfaces has been analyzed. Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is found that besides the known Goos-H\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset, as well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear. Furthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well, which can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of dielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric function the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal dielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to scattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the Goos-H\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials. Oppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the temporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on the beam geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum circuits make it possible to simulate the continuous-time dynamics of a many-body Hamiltonian by implementing discrete Trotter steps of duration $\tau$. However, when $\tau$ is sufficiently large, the discrete dynamics exhibit qualitative differences compared to the original evolution, potentially displaying novel features and many-body effects. We study an interesting example of this phenomenon, by considering the integrable Trotterization of a prototypical integrable model, the XXZ Heisenberg spin chain. We focus on the well-known bipartition protocol, where two halves of a large system are prepared in different macrostates and suddenly joined together, yielding non-trivial nonequilibrium dynamics. Building upon recent results and adapting the generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) of integrable models, we develop an exact large-scale description of an explicit one-dimensional quantum-circuit setting, where the input left and right qubits are initialized in two distinct product states. We explore the phenomenology predicted by the GHD equations, which depend on the Trotter step and the gate parameters. In some phases of the parameter space, we show that the quantum-circuit large-scale dynamics is qualitatively different compared to the continuous-time evolution. In particular, we find that a single microscopic defect at the junction, such as the addition of a single qubit, may change the nonequilibrium macrostate appearing at late time.</description>

Abstract: Micro-objects levitated in a vacuum are an exciting platform for precision sensing due to their low dissipation motion and the potential for control at the quantum level. Arrays of such sensors would allow noise cancellation, directionality, increased sensitivity and in the quantum regime the potential to exploit correlation and entanglement. We use neuromorphic detection via a single event-based camera to record the motion of an array of levitated microspheres. We present the first truly scalable method for multiparticle control by implementing real-time feedback to cool the motion of three objects simultaneously.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale programmable photonic circuits are opening up new possibilities for information processing providing fast and energy-efficient means for matrix-vector multiplication. Here, we introduce a novel architecture of photonic circuits capable of implementing non-unitary transfer matrices, usually required by photonic neural networks, iterative equation solvers or quantum samplers. Our architecture exploits compact low-depth beam-splitter meshes rather than bulky fully connected mixing blocks used in previous designs, making it more compatible with planar integrated photonics technology. We have shown that photonic circuits designed with our architecture have lower depth than their standard counterparts and are extremely tolerant to hardware errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the use of quantum generative adversarial networks QGANs for modeling eye movement velocity data. We assess whether the advanced computational capabilities of QGANs can enhance the modeling of complex stochastic distribution beyond the traditional mathematical models, particularly the Markov model. The findings indicate that while QGANs demonstrate potential in approximating complex distributions, the Markov model consistently outperforms in accurately replicating the real data distribution. This comparison underlines the challenges and avenues for refinement in time series data generation using quantum computing techniques. It emphasizes the need for further optimization of quantum models to better align with real-world data characteristics.</description>

      <title>Coherence as entropy increment for Tsallis and Renyi entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.06840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relative entropy of coherence can be written as an entropy difference of the original state and the incoherent state closest to it when measured by relative entropy. The natural question is, if we generalize this situation to Tsallis or R\'enyi entropies, would it define good coherence measures? In other words, we define a difference between Tsallis entropies of the original state and the incoherent state closest to it when measured by Tsallis relative entropy. Taking R\'enyi entropy instead of the Tsallis entropy, leads to the well-known distance-based R\'enyi coherence, which means this expression defined a good coherence measure. Interestingly, we show that Tsallis entropy does not generate even a genuine coherence monotone, unless it is under a very restrictive class of operations. Additionally, we provide continuity estimates for both Tsallis and R\'enyi coherence expressions. Furthermore, we present two coherence measures based on the closest incoherent state when measures by Tsallis or R\'enyi relative entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate two practical mitigation methods to attenuate the cosmic muon flux, compatible with experiments involving superconducting qubits: shallow underground sites and specific device orientation. Using a specifically-built cosmic muon detector, we identify underground sites, widely present in urban environments, where significant attenuation of cosmic muon flux, up to a factor 35 for 100-meter depths, can be attained. Furthermore, we employ two germanium wafers in an above-ground laboratory, each equipped with a particle sensor, to show how the orientation of the chip with respect to the sky affects the amount and type of energy deposited on the substrate by ionizing radiation. We observe that the horizontal detector sees more counts at lower energy, while the vertical one is impacted by more particles at higher energy. The methods here described proposed ways to directly understand and reduce the effects of cosmic rays on qubits by attenuating the source of this type of decoherence, complementing existing on-chip mitigation strategies. We expect that both on-chip and off-chip methods combined will become ubiquitous in quantum technologies based on superconducting qubit circuits.</description>

      <title>Investigating the quantum discord dynamics with a bipartite split of the multiqubit system in the correlated photon-matter model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08207v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we try to study the quantum discord dynamics in a complex correlated photon-matter model, which is modified from the Tavis-Cummings-Hubbard model - a common cavity quantum electrodynamics model. The target model consists of two hydrogen atoms. A neutral hydrogen molecule can be obtained through an association reaction and disintegrated through dissociation reaction. The formation and breaking of covalent bond is accompanied by the creation and annihilation of phonon. Compared with previous efforts, studying the quantum discord dynamics of this complicated system is more challenging than it was for the simple quantum system, which consisted of a single two-level atom. For convenience, we adopt a bipartite split of the multiqubit system and the two-qubit von Neumann projective measurement on the observed subsystem. We attempt to examine the dissipative dynamics in open quantum system in addition to the unitary evolution of closed quantum system. We are dedicated to identifying the regularity of quantum correlation as the basis for future research on more complex quantum systems, specifically including the impacts of nuclei tunneling effect, covalent bond formation strength, and dissipation intensities of photon (phonon) on quantum discord.</description>

      <title>Unveiling quantum steering by quantum-classical uncertainty complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the remarkable aspects of quantum steering is its ability to violate local uncertainty complementarity relations. In this vein of study, various steering witnesses employing different uncertainty relations have been developed including Reid's criteria. Here, we introduce a novel complementarity relation between system's quantum and classical uncertainties corresponding to the distillable coherence and the von-Neumann entropy, respectively. We demonstrate a superior steering detection efficiency compared to an entropic uncertainty relation. Notably, our proposed steering witness can detect ``all pure entangled states," while the entropic uncertainty relation cannot. We also experimentally validate such a property through a photonic system. Furthermore, a deeper connection to the uncertainty principle is revealed by showcasing the functionality of our proposed complementarity as a quantifier of measurement incompatibility and quantum steerability under genuine incoherent operations. Our work establishes a clear quantitative and operational link between coherence and steering, which are significant resources of quantum technologies, and underscores our efforts in bridging the uncertainty principle with quantum coherence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a formalism to detect genuine multipartite entanglement by considering projection map which is a positive but not completely positive map. Projection map has been motivated by the no-pancake theorem which repudiates the existence of a quantum operation that maps the Bloch sphere onto a disk along its equator. The not complete positivity feature of projection map is explored to investigate genuine multipartite entanglement in arbitrary N-qubit quantum systems. Our proposed framework can detect some important classes of genuinely entangled states in tripartite and quadripartite scenarios. We provide illustrative example to show the efficacy of our formalism to detect a class of tripartite PPT bound entangled states. Finally, we construct a suitable witness operator based on projection map to certify genuine tripartite entanglement, which is likely to be feasible experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We present a cavity-electromechanical system comprising a superconducting quantum interference device which is embedded in a microwave resonator and coupled via a pick-up loop to a 6 $\mu$g magnetically-levitated superconducting sphere. The motion of the sphere in the magnetic trap induces a frequency shift in the SQUID-cavity system. We use microwave spectroscopy to characterize the system, and we demonstrate that the electromechanical interaction is tunable. The measured displacement sensitivity of $10^{-7} \, \mathrm{m} / \sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, defines a path towards ground-state cooling of levitated particles with Planck-scale masses at millikelvin environment temperatures.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Pseudomodes for Strongly Coupled Open Quantum Systems: Unravelings, Correlations and Thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudomode framework provides an exact description of the dynamics of an open quantum system coupled to a non-Markovian environment. Using this framework, the influence of the environment on the system is studied in an equivalent model, where the open system is coupled to a finite number of unphysical pseudomodes that follow a time-local master equation. Building on the insight that this master equation does not need to conserve the hermiticity of the pseudomode state, we here ask for the most general conditions on the master equation that guarantee the correct reproduction of the system's original dynamics. We demonstrate that our generalized approach decreases the number of pseudomodes that are required to model, for example, underdamped environments at finite temperature. We also provide an unraveling of the master equation into quantum jump trajectories of non-Hermitian states, which further facilitates the utilization of the pseudomode technique for numerical calculations by enabling the use of easily parallelizable Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, we show that pseudomodes, despite their unphysical nature, provide a natural picture in which physical processes, such as the creation of system-bath correlations or the exchange of heat, can be studied. Hence, our results pave the way for future investigations of the system-environment interaction leading to a better understanding of open quantum systems far from the Markovian weak-coupling limit.</description>

Abstract: It is well-known that the set of statistics that can be observed in a Bell-type experiment is limited by quantum theory. Unfortunately, tools are missing to identify the precise boundary of this set. Here, we propose to study the set of quantum statistics from a dual perspective. By considering all Bell expressions saturated by a given realization, we show that the CHSH expression can be decomposed in terms of extremal Tsirelson inequalities that we identify. This brings novel insight into the geometry of the quantum set in the (2,2,2) scenario. Furthermore, this allows us to identify all the Bell expressions that are able to self-test the Tsirelson realization.</description>

Abstract: Entanglement potentials (EPs) enable the characterization and quantification of the nonclassicality of single-mode optical fields by measuring the entanglement generated through beam splitting. We experimentally generated single-photon states and tomographically reconstructed the corresponding two-qubit states to determine EPs defined via popular two-qubit measures of entanglement. These include the potentials for the relative entropy of entanglement (REEP), concurrence, and negativity. Among our experimental states, we found those that are very close (at least for some ranges of parameters) to the theoretical upper and lower bounds on relative EPs (or relative nonclassicality), i.e., when one EP is maximized or minimized for a given value if another EP. We experimentally confirmed the counterintuitive theoretical result of Ref. [Phys. Rev. A 92, 062314 (2015)] that the relative nonclassicality (specifically, the negativity potential for given values of the REEP) of single-photon states can be increased by dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the experimental error budget of parametric resonance gates in a tunable coupler architecture. We identify and characterize various sources of errors, including incoherent, leakage, amplitude, and phase errors. By varying the two-qubit gate time, we explore the dynamics of these errors and their impact on the gate fidelity. To accurately capture the impact of incoherent errors on gate fidelity, we measure the coherence times of qubits under gate operating conditions. Our findings reveal that the incoherent errors, mainly arising from qubit relaxation and dephasing due to white noise, limit the fidelity of the two-qubit gates. Moreover, we demonstrate that leakage to noncomputational states is the second largest contributor to the two-qubit gates infidelity, as characterized using leakage-randomized benchmarking. The error budgeting methodology we developed here can be effectively applied to other types of gate implementations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the frictional force arising from quantum fluctuations when two dissipative metallic plates are set in a shear motion. While early studies showed that the electromagnetic fields in the quantum friction setup reach nonequilibrium steady states, yielding a time-independent force, other works have demonstrated the failure to attain steady states, leading to instability and time-varying friction under sufficiently low-loss conditions. Here, we develop a fully quantum-mechanical theory without perturbative approximations and unveil the transition from stable to unstable regimes of the quantum friction setup. Due to the relative motion of the plates, their electromagnetic response may be active in some conditions, resulting in optical gain. We prove that the standard fluctuation-dissipation leads to inconsistent results when applied to our system, and, in particular, it predicts a vanishing frictional force. Using a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation tailored for gain media, we calculate the frictional force in terms of the system Green's function, thereby recovering early works on quantum friction. Remarkably, we also find that the frictional force diverges to infinity as the relative velocity of the plates approaches a threshold. This threshold is determined by the damping strength and the distance between the metal surfaces. Beyond this critical velocity, the system exhibits instability, akin to the behaviour of a laser cavity, where no steady state exists. In such a scenario, the frictional force escalates exponentially. Our findings pave the way for experimental exploration of the frictional force in proximity to this critical regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Memoryless (Markovian) system-bath interactions are of fundamental interest in physics. While typically, the absence of memory originates from the characteristics of the bath, here we demonstrate that it can result from the system becoming lossy due to the Markovian interaction with a second bath. This uncovers an interesting interplay between independent baths and suggests that Markovianity is ``contagious'', i.e., it can be transferred from one bath to another through the system with which they both interact. We introduce a Bloch-Redfield-inspired approach that accounts for this distinct origin of Markovianity and uniquely combines non-Hermitian Hamiltonian formalism with master equations. This method significantly improves the description of the interaction between a lossy system (associated with a Lindblad master equation) and a non-Markovian bath, reducing the computational demands of complex system-bath setups across various fields.</description>

Abstract: Differentiable models of physical systems provide a powerful platform for gradient-based algorithms, with particular impact on parameter estimation and optimal control. Quantum systems present a particular challenge for such characterisation and control, owing to their inherently stochastic nature and sensitivity to environmental parameters. To address this challenge, we present a versatile differentiable quantum master equation solver, and incorporate this solver into a framework for device characterisation. Our approach utilises gradient-based optimisation and Bayesian inference to provide estimates and uncertainties in quantum device parameters. To showcase our approach, we consider steady state charge transport through electrostatically defined quantum dots. Using simulated data, we demonstrate efficient estimation of parameters for a single quantum dot, and model selection as well as the capability of our solver to compute time evolution for a double quantum dot system. Our differentiable solver stands to widen the impact of physics-aware machine learning algorithms on quantum devices for characterisation and control.</description>

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms, inspired by neural networks, have become a novel approach in quantum computing. However, designing efficient parameterized quantum circuits remains a challenge. Quantum architecture search tackles this by adjusting circuit structures along with gate parameters to automatically discover high-performance circuit structures. In this study, we propose an end-to-end distributed quantum architecture search framework, where we aim to automatically design distributed quantum circuit structures for interconnected quantum processing units with specific qubit connectivity. We devise a circuit generation algorithm which incorporates TeleGate and TeleData methods to enable nonlocal gate implementation across quantum processing units. While taking into account qubit connectivity, we also incorporate qubit assignment from logical to physical qubits within our quantum architecture search framework. A two-stage progressive training-free strategy is employed to evaluate extensive circuit structures without circuit training costs. Through numerical experiments on three VQE tasks, the efficacy and efficiency of our scheme is demonstrated. Our research into discovering efficient structures for distributed quantum circuits is crucial for near-term quantum computing where a single quantum processing unit has a limited number of qubits. Distributed quantum circuits allow for breaking down complex computations into manageable parts that can be processed across multiple quantum processing units.</description>

Abstract: The qubit scalability imposes a paramount challenge in the field of quantum computing. Photonic interconnects between distinct quantum computing modules provide a solution to deal with this issue. The fundamental part of this approach is entanglement distribution via travelling photons emitted by matter qubits. However, randomness of the spontaneous emission in the matter qubits limits both the entanglement fidelity and the generation rate. In this paper, by numerical and analytical methods, we investigate the relationship between the entanglement affected by the spontaneous emission and the waveform of the pump pulse used in the photon generation. We confirm and analyze a rate-fidelity trade-off in the entanglement swapping with Gaussian pump pulses and show that a simple extension to non-Gaussian pump pulses improves the trade-off in a certain parameter region. Furthermore we extend our analysis to entanglement distribution in the general multipartite setting and show that the analysis of the bipartite entanglement can be straightforwardly applied in this case as well.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a systematic approach for analyzing strongly correlated systems by adapting the conventional quantum cluster method to a quantum circuit model. We have developed a more concise formula for calculating the cluster's Green's function, requiring only real-number computations on the quantum circuit instead of complex ones. This approach is inherently more suited to quantum circuits, which primarily yield statistical probabilities. As an illustrative example, we explored the Hubbard model on a 2D lattice. The ground state is determined utilizing Xiaohong, a superconducting quantum processor equipped with 66 qubits, supplied by QuantumCTek Co., Ltd. Subsequently, we employed the circuit model to compute the real-time retarded Green's function for the cluster, which is then used to determine the lattice Green's function. We conducted an examination of the band structure in the insulator phase of the lattice system. This preliminary investigation lays the groundwork for exploring a wealth of innovative physics within the field of condensed matter physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a non-variational quantum algorithm designed to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimisation problems, including constrained and non-binary problems. The algorithm leverages an engineered interference process achieved through repeated application of two unitaries; one inducing phase-shifts dependent on objective function values, and the other mixing phase-shifted probability amplitudes via a continuous-time quantum walk (CTQW) on a problem-specific graph. The algorithm's versatility is demonstrated through its application to various problems, namely those for which solutions are characterised by either a vector of binary variables, a vector of non-binary integer variables, or permutations (a vector of integer variables without repetition). An efficient quantum circuit implementation of the CTQW for each of these problem types is also discussed. A penalty function approach for constrained problems is also introduced, including a method for optimising the penalty function. The algorithm's performance is demonstrated through numerical simulation for randomly generated instances of the following problems (and problem sizes): weighted maxcut (18 vertices), maximum independent set (18 vertices), k-means clustering (12 datapoints, 3 clusters), capacitated facility location (12 customers, 3 facility locations), and the quadratic assignment problem (9 locations). For each problem instance, the algorithm finds a globally optimal solution with a small number of iterations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm For Solving Nonlinear Algebraic Equations</title>

Abstract: Nonlinear equations are challenging to solve due to their inherently nonlinear nature. As analytical solutions typically do not exist, numerical methods have been developed to tackle their solutions. In this article, we give a quantum algorithm for solving a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, in which each equation is a multivariate polynomial of known coefficients. Building upon the classical Newton method and some recent works on quantum algorithm plus block encoding from the quantum singular value transformation, we show how to invert the Jacobian matrix to execute Newton's iterative method for solving nonlinear equations, where each contributing equation is a homogeneous polynomial of an even degree. A detailed analysis are then carried out to reveal that our method achieves polylogarithmic time in relative to the number of variables. Furthermore, the number of required qubits is logarithmic in the number of variables. In particular, we also show that our method can be modified with little effort to deal with polynomial of various types, thus implying the generality of our approach. Some examples coming from physics and algebraic geometry, such as Gross-Pitaevski equation, Lotka-Volterra equations, and intersection of algebraic varieties, involving nonlinear partial differential equations are provided to motivate the potential application, with a description on how to extend our algorithm with even less effort in such a scenario. Our work thus marks a further important step towards quantum advantage in nonlinear science, enabled by the framework of quantum singular value transformation.</description>

      <title>Implementing a synthetic magnetic vector potential in a 2D superconducting qubit array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum processors are a compelling platform for analog quantum simulation due to the precision control, fast operation, and site-resolved readout inherent to the hardware. Arrays of coupled superconducting qubits natively emulate the dynamics of interacting particles according to the Bose-Hubbard model. However, many interesting condensed-matter phenomena emerge only in the presence of electromagnetic fields. Here, we emulate the dynamics of charged particles in an electromagnetic field using a superconducting quantum simulator. We realize a broadly adjustable synthetic magnetic vector potential by applying continuous modulation tones to all qubits. We verify that the synthetic vector potential obeys requisite properties of electromagnetism: a spatially-varying vector potential breaks time-reversal symmetry and generates a gauge-invariant synthetic magnetic field, and a temporally-varying vector potential produces a synthetic electric field. We demonstrate that the Hall effect--the transverse deflection of a charged particle propagating in an electromagnetic field--exists in the presence of the synthetic electromagnetic field.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Annealers with Near-Optimal Minor-Embedded Instances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Benchmarking Quantum Process Units (QPU) at an application level usually requires considering the whole programming stack of the quantum computer. One critical task is the minor-embedding (resp. transpilation) step, which involves space-time overheads for annealing-based (resp. gate-based) quantum computers. This paper establishes a new protocol to generate graph instances with their associated near-optimal minor-embedding mappings to D-Wave Quantum Annealers (QA). This set of favorable mappings is used to generate a wide diversity of optimization problem instances. We use this method to benchmark QA on large instances of unconstrained and constrained optimization problems and compare the performance of the QPU with efficient classical solvers. The benchmark aims to evaluate and quantify the key characteristics of instances that could benefit from the use of a quantum computer. In this context, existing QA seem best suited for unconstrained problems on instances with densities less than $10\%$. For constrained problems, the penalty terms used to encode the hard constraints restrict the performance of QA and suggest that these QPU will be less efficient on these problems of comparable size.</description>

      <title>The hBN defects database: a theoretical compilation of color centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have become an intensively researched system due to their potential applications in quantum technologies. There has been a large variety of defects being fabricated, yet, for many of them, the atomic origin remains unclear. The direct imaging of the defect is technically very challenging, in particular since, in a diffraction-limited spot, there are many defects and then one has to identify the one that is optically active. Another approach is to compare the photophysical properties with theoretical simulations and identify which defect has a matching signature. It has been shown that a single property for this is insufficient and causes misassignments. Here, we publish a density functional theory (DFT)-based searchable online database covering the electronic structure of hBN defects (257 triplet and 211 singlet configurations), as well as their photophysical fingerprint (excited state lifetime, quantum efficiency, transition dipole moment and orientation, polarization visibility, and many more). All data is open-source and publicly accessible at https://h-bn.info and can be downloaded. It is possible to enter the experimentally observed defect signature and the database will output possible candidates which can be narrowed down by entering as many observed properties as possible. The database will be continuously updated with more defects and new photophysical properties (which can also be specifically requested by any users). The database therefore allows one to reliably identify defects but also investigate which defects might be promising for magnetic field sensing or quantum memory applications.</description>

      <title>Systematic time-coarse graining for driven quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many recent advancements in quantum computing leverage strong drives on nonlinear systems for state preparation, signal amplification, or gate operation. However, the interplay within such strongly driven system introduces multi-scale dynamics that affects the long-time behavior of the system in non-trivial ways that are very difficult to model. Therefore, the analysis of these systems often relies on effective Hamiltonian models that introduce additional nonlinear processes which approximate the long-time dynamics so that highly oscillatory terms may be ignored. However, the removal of such high frequency transitions can only be performed rigorously within a systematic framework of time-coarse graining, which is a fundamentally irreversible operation. This implies that standard approaches with unitary effective models cannot accurately capture the long-time behavior of strongly driven nonlinear quantum systems in general. We introduce a systematic perturbation theory for obtaining the complete non-unitary effective model of the time-coarse grained (TCG) dynamics of a driven quantum system to any order in the coupling strengths. We derive a closed-form analytical formula for both unitary and non-unitary contributions, in the form of an effective Hamiltonian and non-unitary (pseudo-)dissipators. Remarkably, even though the effective theory presumes unitary time evolution at the microscopic level, the time-coarse grained dynamics is found to follow a non-unitary time evolution in general. This occurs even when there is no open heat reservoir for the system to become entangled with or dissipate into. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method using several typical models of driven nonlinear systems in superconducting circuits, and show that it generalizes and improves on existing methods by providing more accurate results and explaining phenomena that have not been accounted for.</description>

Abstract: We aim to establish a scalable scheme for characterising diagonal non-Clifford gates for single- and multi-qudit systems; \(d\) is a prime-power integer. By employing cyclic operators and a qudit T gate, we generalise the dihedral benchmarking scheme for single- and multi-qudit circuits. Our results establish a path for experimentally benchmarking qudit systems and are of theoretical and experimental interest because our scheme is optimal insofar as it does not require preparation of the full qudit Clifford gate set to characterise a non-Clifford gate. Moreover, combined with Clifford randomised benchmarking, our scheme is useful to characterise the generators of a universal gate set.</description>

Abstract: When applying quantum computing to machine learning tasks, one of the first considerations is the design of the quantum machine learning model itself. Conventionally, the design of quantum machine learning algorithms relies on the ``quantisation" of classical learning algorithms, such as using quantum linear algebra to implement important subroutines of classical algorithms, if not the entire algorithm, seeking to achieve quantum advantage through possible run-time accelerations brought by quantum computing. However, recent research has started questioning whether quantum advantage via speedup is the right goal for quantum machine learning [1]. Research also has been undertaken to exploit properties that are unique to quantum systems, such as quantum contextuality, to better design quantum machine learning models [2]. In this paper, we take an alternative approach by incorporating the heuristics and empirical evidences from the design of classical deep learning algorithms to the design of quantum neural networks. We first construct a model based on the data reuploading circuit [3] with the quantum Hamiltonian data embedding unitary [4]. Through numerical experiments on images datasets, including the famous MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms the quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN)[5] by a large margin (up to over 40% on MNIST test set). Based on the model design process and numerical results, we then laid out six principles for designing quantum machine learning models, especially quantum neural networks.</description>

      <title>Sparks of Quantum Advantage and Rapid Retraining in Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of quantum computing holds the potential to revolutionize various fields by solving complex problems more efficiently than classical computers. Despite this promise, practical quantum advantage is hindered by current hardware limitations, notably the small number of qubits and high noise levels. In this study, we leverage adiabatic quantum computers to optimize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, a powerful neural network architecture for representing complex functions with minimal parameters. By modifying the network to use Bezier curves as the basis functions and formulating the optimization problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problem, we create a fixed-sized solution space, independent of the number of training samples. Our approach demonstrates sparks of quantum advantage through faster training times compared to classical optimizers such as the Adam, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Adaptive Gradient, and simulated annealing. Additionally, we introduce a novel rapid retraining capability, enabling the network to be retrained with new data without reprocessing old samples, thus enhancing learning efficiency in dynamic environments. Experimental results on initial training of classification and regression tasks validate the efficacy of our approach, showcasing significant speedups and comparable performance to classical methods. While experiments on retraining demonstrate a sixty times speed up using adiabatic quantum computing based optimization compared to that of the gradient descent based optimizers, with theoretical models allowing this speed up to be even larger! Our findings suggest that with further advancements in quantum hardware and algorithm optimization, quantum-optimized machine learning models could have broad applications across various domains, with initial focus on rapid retraining.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the complexity compared to that obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises two subspaces with a weak coupling between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tunneling dynamics of a magnetic $^{164}$Dy quantum gas in an elongated or pancake skewed double-well trap is investigated with a time-dependent extended Gross-Pitaevskii approach. Upon lifting the energy offset, different tunneling regimes can be identified. In the elongated trap and for sufficiently large offset, the different configurations exhibit collective macroscopic tunneling. For smaller offset, partial reflection from and transmission through the barrier lead to density accumulation in both wells, and eventually to tunneling-locking. One can also reach the macroscopic self-trapping regime for increasing relative dipolar interaction strength, while tunneling vanishes for large barrier heights. A richer dynamical behavior is observed for the pancake-like trap. For instance, the supersolid maintains its shape, while the superfluid density gets distorted signifying the emergence of peculiar excitation patterns in the macroscopic tunneling regime. The findings reported here may offer new ways to probe distinctive dynamical features in the supersolid and droplet regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use time-resolved nonlinear pump--probe measurements to reveal features of semiconductor moir\'e materials not accessible to linear spectroscopy. With an intense, red-detuned pump pulse, we generate a high density of virtual excitons or exciton--polarons in various moir\'e minibands. A broadband probe pulse in turn measures the response of all optical resonances induced by the pump-generated excitations. We generically observe a coherent blue shift originating from contact-like exciton--exciton interactions. At charge neutrality, these measurements allow us to assess the spatial overlap between different optical excitations and to observe signatures of a bound biexciton state between two different moir\'e exciton modes. In contrast to electron doped monolayers, spatially confined moir\'e attractive polarons behave as an ensemble of non-interacting two-level emitters, exhibiting an electron-density-independent ac-Stark effect. Tuning the pump laser into resonance with the attractive polaron, we demonstrate the filling of the moir\'e lattice with localized polarons and thereby realize a nonequilibrium Bose--Fermi mixture in moir\'e flat bands.</description>

      <title>Survival Probability, Particle Imbalance, and Their Relationship in Quadratic Models</title>

Abstract: We argue that the dynamics of particle imbalance in quadratic fermionic models is, for the majority of initial many-body product states in site occupation basis, virtually indistinguishable from the dynamics of survival probabilities of single-particle states. We then generalize our statement to a similar relationship between the non-equal time and space density correlation functions in many-body states and the transition probabilities of single-particle states at nonzero distances. Finally, we study the equal time connected density-density correlation functions in many-body states, which exhibit certain qualitative analogies with the survival and transition probabilities of single-particle states. Our results are numerically tested for two paradigmatic models of single-particle localization: the 3D Anderson model and the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model. This work gives affirmative answer to the question whether it is possible to measure features of the single-particle survival and transition probabilities by the dynamics of observables in many-body states.</description>

      <title>A tractable model of monitored fermions with conserved $\mathrm{U}(1)$ charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study measurement-induced phases of free fermion systems with U(1) symmetry. Following a recent approach developed for Majorana chains, we derive a field theory description for the purity and bipartite entanglement at large space and time scales. We focus on a multi-flavor one-dimensional chain with random complex hoppings and continuous monitoring of the local fermion density. By means of the replica trick, and using the number of flavors as a large parameter controlling our approximations, we derive an effective field theory made up of a SU(N) non-linear sigma model (NL$\sigma$M) coupled to fluctuating hydrodynamics. Contrary to the case of non-interacting Majorana fermions, displaying no U(1) symmetry, we find that the bipartite entanglement entropy satisfies an area law for all monitoring rates, but with a nontrivial scaling of entanglement when the correlation length is large. We provide numerical evidence supporting our claims. We briefly show how imposing a reality condition on the hoppings can change the NL$\sigma$M and also discuss higher dimensional generalizations.</description>

      <title>1-Form Symmetric Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 1-form symmetry, manifesting as loop-like symmetries, has gained prominence in the study of quantum phases, deepening our understanding of symmetry. However, the role of 1-form symmetries in Projected Entangled-Pair States (PEPS), two-dimensional tensor network states, remains largely underexplored. We present a novel framework for understanding 1-form symmetries within tensor networks, specifically focusing on the derivation of algebraic relations for symmetry matrices on the PEPS virtual legs. Our results reveal that 1-form symmetries impose stringent constraints on tensor network representations, leading to distinct anomalous braiding phases carried by symmetry matrices. We demonstrate how these symmetries influence the ground state and tangent space in PEPS, providing new insights into their physical implications for enhancing ground state optimization efficiency and characterizing the 1-form symmetry structure in excited states.</description>

      <title>Near-quantum limited axion dark matter search with the ORGAN experiment around 26 $\mu$eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest result from The ORGAN Experiment, an axion haloscope is presented. This iteration of the experiment operated at millikelvin temperatures using a flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifier (JPA) for reduced noise, along with various other upgrades over previous iterations. Covering the $25.45 - 26.27\,\mu\text{eV}$ ($6.15-6.35$ GHz) mass (frequency) range, this near-quantum limited phase of ORGAN employs a conducting rod resonator and a 7-T solenoidal magnet to place the most sensitive exclusion limits on axion-photon coupling in the range to date, with $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \gtrsim 2.8\times10^{-13}$ at a 95% confidence level.</description>

      <title>Low energy excitations in bosonic quantum quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21230v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first principles construction of the low-energy effective action for bosonic self-organized quantum quasicrystals. Our generalized elasticity approach retains the appropriate number of phase- and corresponding conjugate density- degrees-of-freedom required for a proper description of the Goldstone modes. For the dodecagonal and decagonal quasicrystal structures we obtain collective longitudinal and transversal excitations with an isotropic speed of sound. Meanwhile, for the octagonal structure, the coupling between phononic and phasonic degrees of freedom leads in turn to hybridization of the latter with the condensate sound mode, producing collective excitations with a longitudinal and transversal component, and an anisotropic speed of sound. Finally, we discuss the fate of each excitation mode at the low and high density phase transitions limiting the quantum quasicrystal phase.</description>
