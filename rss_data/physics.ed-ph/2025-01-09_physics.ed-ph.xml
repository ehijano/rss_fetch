      <title>Modeling with quantities in calculus and physics: A conceptual framework of the fundamental theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a substantial curricular overlap between calculus and physics, yet introductory physics students often struggle to connect the two. We introduce a conceptual framework for the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) to help unify learning across both disciplines. We propose a consistent approach to teaching definite integrals, including shared vocabulary and symbolism, to help students recognize how concepts like change, rate, and accumulation show up in both calculus and physics. We argue that the typical interpretation of the FTC in calculus, focusing on antiderivatives in closed form, doesn't align well with how physicists use these concepts. We advocate for an additional focus on Riemann sums and the underlying ideas of change, rate, products, and accumulation, which are fundamental in both fields. This approach can help students build a deeper, more integrated understanding of both mathematics and physics quantity. By aligning learning objectives across the disciplines, we argue that students can develop a stronger understanding of foundational mathematical principles.</description>

      <title>How Can a Quantum Particle Be Found in a Classically Forbidden Region?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the many perplexing results of quantum mechanics is one that contradicts a result from introductory physics: the possibility of finding a quantum particle in a region that would be forbidden classically by energy conservation. An especially interesting example of this phenomenon with practical applications is quantum tunneling. Here we investigate the reasons for this puzzling result by focusing on the difference between how quantities like kinetic and potential energy are represented mathematically in classical and quantum mechanics. In quantum mechanics, physical observables, like energy, are represented by operators rather than real numbers. The consequences of this difference will be illustrated explicitly using a toy model in which the kinetic and potential energy operators are represented by $2 \times 2$ matrices, which do not commute like their classical analogs. This model will then illustrate how classically perplexing results, like a quantum particle being found in the forbidden region, can arise.</description>
