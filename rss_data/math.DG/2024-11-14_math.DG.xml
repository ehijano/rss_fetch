      <title>Uniqueness and Symmetry of Self-Similar Solutions of Curvature Flows in Warped Product Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we establish some uniqueness and symmetry results of self-similar solutions to curvature flows by some homogeneous speed functions of principal curvatures in some warped product spaces. In particular, we proved that any compact star-shaped self-similar solution to any parabolic flow with homogeneous degree $-1$ (including the inverse mean curvature flow) in warped product spaces $I \times_{\phi} M^n$, where $M^n$ is a compact homogeneous manifold and $\phi'' \geq 0$, must be a slice. The same result holds for compact self-expanders when the degree of the speed function is greater than $-1$ and with an extra assumption $\phi' \geq 0$.
  Furthermore, we also show that any complete non-compact star-shaped, asymptotically concial expanding self-similar solutions to the flow by positive power of mean curvature in hyperbolic and anti-deSitter-Schwarzschild spaces are rotationally symmetric.</description>

      <title>Connected components of the space of triples of transverse partial flags in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ and Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We count the number of connected components in the space of triples of transverse flags in any flag manifold of $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$. We compute the effect the involution of the unipotent radical has on those components and deduce that for certain parabolic subgroups $P_{\Theta}$, any $P_{\Theta}$-Anosov subgroup is virtually isomorphic to either a surface group of a free group. We give examples of Anosov subgroups which are neither free nor surface groups for some sets of roots which do not fall under the previous results. As a consequence of the methods developed here, we get an explicit algorithm based on computation of minors to check if a unipotent matrix in $\mathrm{SO}_0(p,q)$ belong to the $\Theta$-positive semigroup $U_\Theta^{&gt;0}$ when $p\neq q$.</description>

      <title>On the Euler characteristics for quandles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quandle is an algebraic system whose axioms generalize the algebraic structure of the point symmetries of symmetric spaces. In this paper, we give a definition of Euler characteristics for quandles. In particular, the quandle Euler characteristic of a compact connected Riemannian symmetric space coincides with the topological Euler characteristic. Additionally, we calculate the Euler characteristics of some finite quandles, including generalized Alexander quandles, core quandles, discrete spheres, and discrete tori. Furthermore, we prove several properties of quandle Euler characteristics, which suggest that they share similar properties with topological Euler characteristics.</description>

      <title>Stability of the catenoid for the hyperbolic vanishing mean curvature equation in 4 spatial dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic stability of the catenoid, as a nonflat stationary solution to the hyperbolic vanishing mean curvature (HVMC) equation in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{1 + (n + 1)}$ for $n = 4$. Our main result is under a ``codimension-$1$'' assumption on initial perturbation, modulo suitable translation and boost (i.e. modulation), without any symmetry assumptions. In comparison to the $n \geq 5$ case addressed by L\"{u}hrmann-Oh-Shahshahani arxiv:2212.05620, proving catenoid stability in $4$ dimensions shares additional difficulties with its $3$ dimensional analog, namely the slower spatial decay of the catenoid and slower temporal decay of waves. To overcome these difficulties in the $n = 3$ case, the strong Huygens principle, as well as a miraculous cancellation in the source term, plays an important role in arxiv:2409.05968 to obtain strong late time tails. In $n = 4$ dimensions, without these special structural advantages, our novelty is to introduce an appropriate commutator vector field to derive a new hierarchy of estimates with higher $r^p$-weights so that an improved pointwise decay can be established. We expect this to be applicable for proving improved late time tails of other quasilinear wave equations in even dimensions or wave equations with inverse square potential.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Cartan geometry on complex manifolds with trivial logarithmic tangent bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a compact complex manifold, and $D\, \subset\, M$ a reduced normal crossing divisor on it, such that the logarithmic tangent bundle $TM(-\log D)$ is holomorphically trivial. Let ${\mathbb A}$ denote the maximal connected subgroup of the group of all holomorphic automorphisms of $M$ that preserve the divisor $D$. Take a holomorphic Cartan geometry $(E_H,\,\Theta)$ of type $(G,\, H)$ on $M$, where $H\, \subset\, G$ are complex Lie groups. We prove that $(E_H,\,\Theta)$ is isomorphic to $(\rho^* E_H,\,\rho^* \Theta)$ for every $\rho\, \in\, \mathbb A$ if and only if the principal $H$--bundle $E_H$ admits a logarithmic connection $\Delta$ singular on $D$ such that $\Theta$ is preserved by the connection $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Projective Banach Lie bialgebras, the projective Yang-Baxter equation and projective Poisson Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of projective Banach Lie bialgebras as the projective tensor product analogue of Banach Lie bialgebras. Then we consider the completion of the classical Yang-Baxter equation and classical r-matrices, and propose the notions of the projective Yang-Baxter equation and projective r-matrices. As in the finite-dimensional case, we prove that every quasi-triangular projective r-matrix gives rise to a projective Banach Lie bialgebra. Next adapting Poisson Banach-Lie groups to the projective tensor product setting, we propose the notion of projective Banach Poisson-Lie groups and show that the differentiation of a projective Banach Poisson-Lie group has the projective Banach Lie bialgebra structure. Finally considering bounded $\mathcal{O}$-operators on Banach Lie algebras, we give an equivalent description of triangular projective r-matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of smooth holomorphic foliations with numerically flat tangent bundles on compact K\"ahler manifolds. Extending earlier results on non-uniruled projective manifolds by the second and fourth authors, we show that such foliations induce a decomposition of the tangent bundle of the ambient manifold, have leaves uniformized by Euclidean spaces, and have torsion canonical bundle. Additionally, we prove that smooth two-dimensional foliations with numerically trivial canonical bundle on projective manifolds are either isotrivial fibrations or have numerically flat tangent bundles. This in turn implies a global Weinstein splitting theorem for rank-two Poisson structures on projective manifolds. We also derive new Hodge-theoretic conditions for the existence of zeros of Poisson structures on compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in all homotopy classes of mappings from complex projective space to Riemannian manifolds, the infimum of the energy is proportional to the infimal area in the homotopy class of mappings of the 2-sphere which represents the induced homomorphism on the second homotopy group. We then establish a family of optimal lower bounds for a larger class of energy functionals for mappings from real and complex projective space to Riemannian manifolds and characterize the mappings which attain these lower bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider smooth vector bundles over smooth manifolds equipped with non-smooth geometric data. For nilpotent differential operators acting on these bundles, we show that the kernels of induced Hodge-Dirac-type operators remain isomorphic under uniform perturbations of the geometric data. We consider applications of this to the Hodge-Dirac operator on differential forms induced by so-called rough Riemannian metrics, which can be of only measurable coefficient in regularity, on both compact and non-compact settings. As a consequence, we show that the kernel of the associated non-smooth Hodge-Dirac operator with respect to a rough Riemannian metric remains isomorphic to smooth and singular cohomology when the underlying manifold is compact.</description>

      <title>About Wess-Zumino-Witten equation and Harder-Narasimhan potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a polarized family of complex projective manifolds, we identify the algebraic obstructions that govern the existence of approximate solutions to the Wess-Zumino-Witten equation. When this is specialized to the fibration associated with a projectivization of a vector bundle, we recover a version of Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence.
  More broadly, we demonstrate that a certain auxiliary Monge-Amp\`ere type equation, generalizing the Wess-Zumino-Witten equation by taking into account the weighted Bergman kernel associated with the Harder-Narasimhan filtrations of direct image sheaves, admits approximate solutions over any polarized family. These approximate solutions are shown to be the closest counterparts to true solutions of the Wess-Zumino-Witten equation whenever the latter do not exist, as they minimize the associated Yang-Mills functional.
  As an application, in a fibered setting, we prove an asymptotic converse to the Andreotti-Grauert theorem conjectured by Demailly.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere are rigid under smooth perturbations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport on the Lie Group of Roto-translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The roto-translation group SE2 has been of active interest in image analysis due to methods that lift the image data to multi-orientation representations defined on this Lie group. This has led to impactful applications of crossing-preserving flows for image de-noising, geodesic tracking, and roto-translation equivariant deep learning. In this paper, we develop a computational framework for optimal transportation over Lie groups, with a special focus on SE2. We make several theoretical contributions (generalizable to matrix Lie groups) such as the non-optimality of group actions as transport maps, invariance and equivariance of optimal transport, and the quality of the entropic-regularized optimal transport plan using geodesic distance approximations. We develop a Sinkhorn like algorithm that can be efficiently implemented using fast and accurate distance approximations of the Lie group and GPU-friendly group convolutions. We report valuable advancements in the experiments on 1) image barycentric interpolation, 2) interpolation of planar orientation fields, and 3) Wasserstein gradient flows on SE2. We observe that our framework of lifting images to SE2 and optimal transport with left-invariant anisotropic metrics leads to equivariant transport along dominant contours and salient line structures in the image. This yields sharper and more meaningful interpolations compared to their counterparts on R^2</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we classify and construct differential symmetry breaking operators $\mathbb{D}$ from a line bundle over the real projective space $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^n$ to a vector bundle over $\mathbb{R}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}$. We further determine the factorization identities of $\mathbb{D}$ and the branching laws of the corresponding generalized Verma modules of $\mathfrak{sl}(n+1,\mathbb{C})$. By utilizing the factorization identities, the $SL(n,\mathbb{R})$-representations realized on the image $\text{Im}(\mathbb{D})$ are also investigated.</description>
