      <title>Topological Approach for Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models. Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz system as an example.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability under $q$-dilatation and $q$-contraction of coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the Lyapunov stability under coordinate $q$-contraction and $q$-dilatation in three dynamical systems: the discrete-time dissipative H\'enon map, and the conservative, non-integrable, continuous-time H\'enon-Heiles and diamagnetic Kepler problems. The stability analysis uses the $q$-deformed Jacobian and $q$-derivative, with trajectory stability assessed for $q &gt; 1$ (dilatation) and $q &lt; 1$ (contraction). Analytical curves in the parameter space mark boundaries of distinct low-periodic motions in the H\'enon map. Numerical simulations compute the maximal Lyapunov exponent across the parameter space, in Poincar\'e surfaces of section, and as a function of total energy in the conservative systems. Simulations show that $q$-contraction ($q$-dilatation) generally decreases (increases) positive Lyapunov exponents relative to the $q = 1$ case, while both transformations tend to increase Lyapunov exponents for regular orbits. Some exceptions to this trend remain unexplained regarding Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori stability.</description>

      <title>Classical transport in a maximally chaotic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced. This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the microscopic chaos.</description>

      <title>A strategy to control synchronized dynamics in swarmalator systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization forms the basis of many coordination phenomena in natural systems, enabling them to function cohesively and support their fundamental operations. However, there are scenarios where synchronization disrupts a system's proper functioning, necessitating mechanisms to control or suppress it. While several methods exist for controlling synchronization in non-spatially embedded oscillators, to the best of our knowledge no such strategies have been developed for swarmalators (oscillators that simultaneously move in space and synchronize in time). In this work, we address this gap by introducing a novel control strategy based on Hamiltonian control theory to suppress synchronization in a system of swarmalators confined to a one-dimensional space. The numerical investigations we performed, demonstrate that the proposed control strategy effectively suppresses synchronized dynamics within the swarmalator population. We studied the impact of the number of controlled swarmalators as well as the strength of the control term, in its original form and in a simplified one.</description>

      <title>Simulating phase inversion processes by coupled map lattice: Towards the theoretical design of food texture and quality in dairy processing from fresh cream to butter via whipped cream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical model and simulation for the formation dynamics of diverse texture patterns that emerge spontaneously or self-organize during phase inversion processes of fresh cream by mechanical whipping. The results suggest that the model should be applied for theoretically designing the texture and quality of whipped cream and butter products. The modeling complexity in phase inversion processes from fresh cream via whipped cream to butter was overcome by using a well-established complex systems approach, coupled map lattice (CML). The proposed CML consists of a minimal set of procedures (i.e., parameterized nonlinear maps), whipping, coalescence, and flocculation, acting on the appropriately coarse-grained field variables, surface energy, cohesive energy, and velocity (flow) of the emulsion defined on a two-dimensional square lattice. In the CML simulations, two well-known and different phase inversion processes are reproduced at high and low whipping temperatures. The overrun and viscosity changes simulated in these processes are at least qualitatively consistent with those observed in experiments. We characterize these processes exhibiting different texture patterns as the viscosity dominance at high whipping temperature and as the overrun dominance at low whipping temperature on the viscosity-overrun plane, which is one of the state diagrams.</description>

      <title>Long-window hybrid variational data assimilation methods for chaotic climate models tested with the Lorenz 63 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid 4D-variational data assimilation method for chaotic climate models is introduced using the Lorenz '63 model. This approach aims to optimise an Earth system model (ESM), for which no adjoint exists, by utilising an adjoint model of a different, potentially simpler ESM. The technique relies on synchronisation of the model to observed time series data employing the dynamical state and parameter estimation (DSPE) method to stabilise the tangent linear system by reducing all positive Lyapunov exponents to negative values. Therefore, long windows can be used to improve parameter estimation. In this new extension a second layer of synchronisation is added between the two models, with and without an adjoint, to facilitate linearisation around the trajectory of the model without an adjoint. The method is conceptually demonstrated by synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems, representing two ESMs, one with and the other without an adjoint model. Results are presented for an idealised case of identical, perfect models and for a more realistic case in which they differ from one another. If employed with a coarser ESM with an adjoint, the method will save computational power as only one forward run with the full ESM per iteration needs to be carried out. It is demonstrated that there is negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the 'traditional' optimisation of full ESM with an adjoint. In a variation of the method outlined, synchronisation between two identical models can be used to filter noisy data. This reduces optimised parametric model uncertainty by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.</description>

      <title>Unorientable topological gravity and orthogonal random matrix universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The duality of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity and a double scaled matrix integral has led to studies of the canonical spectral form factor (SFF) in the so called $\tau-$scaled limit of large times, $t \to \infty$, and fixed temperature in order to demonstrate agreement with universal random matrix theory (RMT). Though this has been established for the unitary case, extensions to other symmetry classes requires the inclusion of unorientable manifolds in the sum over geometries, necessary to address time reversal invariance, and regularization of the corresponding prime geometrical objects, the Weil-Petersson (WP) volumes. We report here how universal signatures of quantum chaos, witnessed by the fidelity to the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble, emerge for the low-energy limit of unorientable JT gravity, i.e. the Airy model/topological gravity. To this end, we implement the loop equations for the corresponding dual (double-scaled) matrix model and find the generic form of the Airy WP volumes, supported by calculations using unorientable Kontsevich graphs. In an apparent violation of the gravity/chaos duality, the $\tau-$scaled SFF on the gravity side acquires both logarithmic and power law contributions in $t$, not manifestly present on the RMT side. We show the expressions can be made to agree by means of bootstrapping-like relations hidden in the asymptotic expansions of generalized hypergeometric functions. Thus, we are able to establish strong evidence of the quantum chaotic nature of unorientable topological gravity.</description>
