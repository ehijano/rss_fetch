      <title>Demonstration of a Mobile Optical Clock Ensemble at Sea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic clocks have been at the leading edge of accuracy and precision since their inception in the 1950s. However, typically the most capable of these clocks have been confined to laboratories despite the fact that there are compelling reasons to apply them in the field and/or while in motion. These applications include synchronization of distributed critical infrastructure (e.g. data servers, communications, electricity grids), scientific applications (e.g. radio-astronomy) and to mitigate the effects of interruption to Global Navigation Satellite Systems.
  Over the last 20 years, there has been a breakthrough in the performance of atomic clocks by transitioning from an atomic reference based on a microwave transition to an optical frequency transition. The $10^5$-fold increase in reference frequency confers the potential for significantly higher performance. However, this performance increase has come at the cost of size, complexity and fragility which has continued the confinement of these clocks to the laboratory.
  Here we report on a recent international collaboration where three emerging optical clocks, each operating on different principles, were trialed at sea. These clocks incorporate optical frequency combs so that their stable frequency outputs can be used directly in electronic apparatus and were also automated so that they do not require expert supervision. We present the frequency stability and reliability of these three clocks over multiple weeks of unsupervised naval trials, both in harbour and on the ocean. The performance of all three devices was orders of magnitude superior to existing best-in-class commercial solutions over short and medium timescales. This demonstrates that optical clocks are ready to deliver advantages for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the sensitivity of an atom interferometer with a phase modulation readout scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sensitivity of an interferometer depends on its readout scheme. However, little attention has been paid to the readout schemes of atom interferometers from the viewpoint of their sensitivity. The difference in sensitivity between readout schemes or their optimization has not been considered in the literature. Herein, we analytically calculate the sensitivities of an atom interferometer with typical readout schemes by applying the two-photon formalism, which was developed for optical interferometers to deal with quantum noise. Our calculations reveal that by using sinusoidal phase modulation, the sensitivity can surpass that obtained by the conventional phase sweeping scheme. The superiority of this phase modulation scheme for both cold and thermal atomic beams is demonstrated. In addition, we show that the phase modulation scheme is advantageous for atom-flux fluctuation and resists atom-flux drift. This study performs a general analysis of the sensitivity of atom interferometers and identifies an advantageous readout scheme.</description>

      <title>Identification of highly-forbidden optical transitions in highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical clocks represent the most precise experimental devices, finding application in fields spanning from frequency metrology to fundamental physics. Recently, the first highly charged ions (HCI) based optical clock was demonstrated using Ar$^{13+}$, opening up a plethora of novel systems with advantageous atomic properties for high accuracy clocks. While numerous candidate systems have been explored theoretically, the considerable uncertainty of the clock transition frequency for most species poses experimental challenges. Here, we close this gap by exploring quantum logic-inspired experimental search techniques for sub-Hertz clock transitions in HCI confined to a linear Paul trap. These techniques encompass Rabi excitation, an optical dipole force (ODF) approach, and linear continuous sweeping (LCS) and their applicability for different types of HCI. Through our investigation, we provide tools to pave the way for the development of exceptionally precise HCI-based optical clocks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control and Glassiness in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems are powerful detectors with wide-ranging applications from scanning probe microscopy of materials to biomedical imaging. Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, for instance, can be operated as qubits for sensing of magnetic field, temperature, or related signals. By well-designed application of pulse sequences, experiments can filter this signal from environmental noise, allowing extremely sensitive measurements with single NV centers. Recently, optimal control has been used to further improve sensitivity by modification of the pulse sequence, most notably by optimal placement of $\pi$ pulses. Here we consider extending beyond $\pi$ pulses, exploring optimization of a continuous, time-dependent control field. We show that the difficulty of optimizing these protocols can be mapped to the difficulty of finding minimum free energy in a classical frustrated spin system. While most optimizations we consider show autocorrelations of the sensing protocol that grow as a power law -- similar to an Ising spin glass -- the continuous control shows slower logarithmic growth, suggestive of a harder Heisenberg-like glassy landscape.</description>

      <title>Lithium Borohydride (LiBH4): An Innovative Material for Neutron Radiation Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation shielding plays a crucial role in various industries, including nuclear and space exploration. Among the most abundant elements and isotopes found in nature, 10B has one of the highest neutron absorption cross-sections, closely followed by 6Li. It is worth noting that hydrogen, with its light nucleus, serves as an excellent neutron reflector. Surprisingly, the potential of the lithium borohydride molecule (LiBH4), which consists exclusively of these elements, as a shield against neutron radiation has not yet been explored. This study investigates various materials that can potentially be used as shields. First, we assessed traditional shields and previous optimizations for shielding. The findings showed that concrete containing 10% B4C yielded the best results. High-performance concrete (HPC) replaced regular concrete. By gradually incorporating lithium borohydride into the shield, along with the appropriate level of boron carbide, further optimization was achieved. Calculations were performed using the MCNPX 2.7E code. The introduction of the new shield resulted in a significant 40% reduction in volume compared with the previous sample. The study findings showed that a 30 cm thick shield effectively blocked 95% of the total neutrons and 92% of the total gamma radiation. Additionally, it was noted that the shielding effects of lithium borohydride against fast neutrons are greater than those of boron carbide. Various parameters and data of the designed shield were calculated and compared with those of the previous sample.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interplay between mass-energy equivalence, interactions and entanglement in an optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose protocols that probe manifestations of the mass-energy equivalence in an optical lattice clock (OLC) interrogated with spin coherent and entangled quantum states. To tune and uniquely distinguish the mass-energy equivalence effects (gravitational redshift and second order Doppler shift) in such setting, we devise a dressing protocol using an additional nuclear spin state. We then analyze the interplay between photon-mediated interactions and gravitational redshift and show that such interplay can lead to entanglement generation and frequency synchronization. In the regime where all atomic spins synchronize, we show the synchronization time depends on the initial entanglement of the state and can be used as a proxy of its metrological gain compared to a classical state. Our work opens new possibilities for exploring the effects of general relativity on quantum coherence and entanglement in OLC experiments.</description>

      <title>A Rydberg atom based system for benchmarking mmWave automotive radar chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors and receivers have enabled sensitive and traceable measurements of RF fields at a wide range of frequencies. Here we demonstrate the detection of electric field amplitude in the extremely high frequency (EHF) band, at $131\ \mathrm{GHz}$. In our approach we propagate the EHF field in a beam, with control over its direction and polarization at the detector using photonic waveplates. This way, we take advantage of the highest detection sensitivity, registered for collinear propagation and circular polarization. To exhibit the potential for applications in this kind of Rydberg-atom based detection, we perform test measurements on the EHF field emitted from an on-chip radar, planned to be used in automotive industry as a vital sign detector. Our work elucidates practical applications of Rydberg-atom media as well as photonic metamaterial elements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-RF (MRF) dressing allows trapping of ultracold atoms in novel spatial geometries, such as highly controllable bilayer structures for 2D ultracold gases, providing unique opportunities for the investigation of 2D quantum systems both in and out of equilibrium. Here, we give an overview of the recent developments of MRF-dressed atom experiments, illustrated by the detailed studies of universal relaxation dynamics across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless critical point enabled by coherent splitting quench protocols and detection of correlations via spatially selective matter-wave interferometry.</description>

      <title>Harmonic generation with topological edge states and electron-electron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been found previously that the presence or absence of topological edge states in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model has a huge impact on harmonic generation spectra. More specifically, the yield of harmonics for harmonic orders that correspond to photon energies below the band gap is many orders of magnitude different in the trivial and topological phase. It is shown in this work that this effect is still present if electron-electron interaction is taken into account, i.e., if a Hubbard term is added to the SSH Hamiltonian. To that end, finite SSH-Hubbard chains at half filling are considered that are short enough to be accessible to exact diagonalization but already showing edge states in the topological phase. We show that the huge difference in the harmonic yield between the trivial and the topological phase can be reproduced with few-level models employing only the many-body ground state and a few excited many-body states.</description>

      <title>Studying highly relativistic vortex-electron beams by atomic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the opportunities of using electron scattering by screened Coulomb potential as a tool to retrieve properties of the relativistic vortex beams of electrons, such as their transverse momentum and orbital angular momentum (OAM). We focus on relativistic and ultra-relativistic regimes of the electron energies of at least several MeV and higher, in which the transverse beam momentum is typically much smaller than its longitudinal momentum. Different scattering scenarios for the incident electron beam are considered. In particular, the scattering by a very wide target can be used to probe the electron transverse momentum when its values are larger than 10 keV. The scattering by a target of a width comparable to that of the incident beam allows one to obtain information about the electron OAM. Varying target sizes in the range from couple to hundreds of nanometers, one can in principle distinguish OAM values from several units of $\hbar$ up to thousands and more.</description>

      <title>Radiative lifetime of the A 2{\Pi}1/2 state in RaF with relevance to laser cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiative lifetime of the $A$ $^2 \Pi_{1/2}$ (v=0) state in radium monofluoride (RaF) is measured to be 35(1) ns. The lifetime of this state and the related decay rate $\Gamma = 2.86(8) \times 10^7$ $s^{-1}$ are of relevance to the laser cooling of RaF via the optically closed $A$ $^2 \Pi_{1/2} \leftarrow X$ $^2\Sigma_{1/2}$ transition, which makes the molecule a promising probe to search for new physics. RaF is found to have a comparable photon-scattering rate to homoelectronic laser-coolable molecules. Thanks to its highly diagonal Franck-Condon matrix, it is expected to scatter an order of magnitude more photons than other molecules when using just 3 cooling lasers, before it decays to a dark state. The lifetime measurement in RaF is benchmarked by measuring the lifetime of the $8P_{3/2}$ state in Fr to be 83(3) ns, in agreement with literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16939v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthogonality of eigenstates of different energies and its implications in potential scattering are unlabeled. Scalar products of scattering states of different energies are found to have finite non-orthogonal terms in potentials of finite widths. Their superpositions have time-dependent norms, and are not suitable for isolate states. In these systems, a perturbative method and a variational method are viable methods for finding a rigorous transition probability that describes phenomena completely. In various exceptional potentials, an orthogonality is satisfied.</description>

      <title>Dark state transport between unitary Fermi superfluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions, for example, in a quantum degenerate gas is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly-interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.</description>
