      <title>Deep learning-based predictive modelling of transonic flow over an aerofoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively predicting transonic unsteady flow over an aerofoil poses inherent challenges. In this study, we harness the power of deep neural network (DNN) models using the attention U-Net architecture. Through efficient training of these models, we achieve the capability to capture the complexities of transonic and unsteady flow dynamics at high resolution, even when faced with previously unseen conditions. We demonstrate that by leveraging the differentiability inherent in neural network representations, our approach provides a framework for assessing fundamental physical properties via global instability analysis. This integration bridges deep neural network models and traditional modal analysis, offering valuable insights into transonic flow dynamics and enhancing the interpretability of neural network models in flowfield diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Gravito-capillary pinning of pendant droplets under wet uneven surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pendant drops spontaneously appear on the underside of wet surfaces through the Rayleigh-Taylor instability. These droplets have no contact line, they are connected to a thin liquid film with which they exchange liquid and are thus mobile: any perturbation will set them in motion. Here, using experiments, numerical simulations, and theory I show that pendant drops sliding under a slightly tilted wet substrate can pin on topographic defects, despite their lack of contact line. Instead, this pinning force has a gravito-capillary origin: liquid has to moves up or down and the interface has to deforms for the drop the pass the defect. I propose a semi-analytical model for arbitrary substrate topographies that matches the pinning force observed experimentally and numerically, without any fitting parameter. I finally demonstrate how to harness this pinning force to guide pendant drops on complex paths.</description>

      <title>Mean temperature and concentration profiles in turbulent internal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit formulas for the mean profiles of temperature or concentration of a diffusing substance (modeled as passive scalars) in forced turbulent convection, as a function of the Reynolds and Prandtl numbers. The derivation leverages on the observed universality of the inner-layer thermal eddy diffusivity with respect to Reynolds and Prandtl number variations and across different flows, and on universality of the passive scalar defect in the core flow. Matching of the inner- and outer-layer expression yields a smooth compound passive scalar profile. We find excellent agreement of the analytical profile with data from direct numerical simulations of pipe and channel flows under various forcing conditions, and over a wide range of Reynolds and Prandtl numbers.</description>

      <title>The memory of Rayleigh-Taylor turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of inferring the initial conditions of a Rayleigh-Taylor mixing zone by measuring the 0D turbulent quantities at an unspecified time. To this aim, we have generated a comprehensive dataset through direct numerical simulations (DNS), focusing on miscible fluids with slight density contrasts. The initial interface deformations in these simulations are characterized by an annular spectrum which is parametrized by four non dimensional numbers. %In order to study the sensitivity of 0D turbulent quantities to the initial interface perturbation distributions, we build a surrogate model for the simulations using a physics-informed neural network (PINN). This allows us to compute the Sobol indices for the turbulent quantities, disentangling the effects of the initial parameters on the growth of the mixing layer. Within a Bayesian framework, we use a Markov chain Monte-Carlo method to determine the posterior distributions of initial conditions given various state variables. %This sheds light on the inertial or diffusive trajectories along with how the initial conditions are progressively forgotten during transition to turbulence. Moreover, it identifies which turbulent quantities are better predictors for the dynamics of Rayleigh-Taylor mixing zones by more effectively retaining the memory of the flow. By inferring the initial conditions and forward propagating its maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate, we propose a strategy to model the Rayleigh-Taylor transition to turbulence.</description>

      <title>Scaling of high-Rayleigh-number convection based on internal convective boundary layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a phenomenological model for thermal convection at high Rayleigh numbers. It hypothesizes existence of a high-Reynolds-number turbulent boundary layer near each horizontal plate, which is shown to be convective. The convective logarithmic friction law of Tong and Ding (2020) is used to relate the large-scale velocity to the induced friction velocity. The predicted scaling relations of the Nusselt ($Nu$) and Reynolds numbers ($Re$) on the Rayleigh number ($Ra$) do not have a power law form, each being a single function, suggesting a single flow regime with no transition, instead of multiple regimes. However, the predicted $Nu$ and $Re$ scaling is close to $Ra^{1/3}$ and $Ra^{4/9}$ for $Ra \sim 10^9$ to $10^{17}$, consistent with direct numerical simulation (DNS) results up to $Ra\sim 10^{15}$. For $Ra&lt;10^9$, the model also correctly predicts the deviations observed in DNS from the above power law scaling. The model predicts deviations from $Ra^{1/3}$ beyond $Ra \sim 10^{17}$ with the local scaling exponent approaching $1/2$, which would likely require data at $Ra&gt;10^{18}$ to verify.</description>

      <title>Controlling the chaotic wake of a flapping foil by tuning its chordwise flexibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effects of chord-wise flexibility as an instrument to control chaotic transitions in the wake of a flexible flapping foil have been studied here using an immersed boundary method-based in-house fluid-structure-interaction solver. The ability of the flapping foil at an optimum level of flexibility to inhibit chaotic transition, otherwise encountered in a similar but rigid configuration, has been highlighted. The rigid foil manifests chaotic transition through a quasi-periodic-intermittency route at high dynamic plunge velocities; whereas, increasing the level of flexibility gradually regularises the aperiodic behaviour through a variety of interesting wake patterns. If flexibility is increased beyond an optimum level, aperiodicity sets in again and robust chaos is restored at very high flexibility levels. The mechanisms of triggering the order-to-chaos transition are different between the rigid and the high flexibility cases. Along the route to order and back to chaos, the flexible foil exhibits different flow-field behaviours, including far-wake switching, primary \&amp; secondary vortex streets, bifurcated wakes and interactive vortices between the bifurcated wakes. The underlying interaction mechanisms of the flow-field vortices responsible for the associated dynamical signatures of the wake have been closely tracked. This study further examines the optimum propulsive performance range of the flexible flapper and investigates its connection with the periodicity/regularity of the system.</description>

      <title>Confined phase singularities reveal the spin-to-orbital angular momentum conversion of sound waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify an acoustic process in which the conversion of angular momentum between its spin and orbital form takes place. The interaction between an evanescent wave propagating at the interface of two immiscible fluids and an isolated droplet is considered. The elliptical motion of the fluid supporting the incident wave is associated with a simple state of spin angular momentum, a quantity recently introduced for acoustic waves in the literature. We experimentally observe that this field predominantly forces a directional wave transport circling the droplet's interior, revealing the existence of confined phase singularities. The circulation of the phase, around a singular point, is characteristic of angular momentum in its orbital form, thereby demonstrating the conversion mechanism. The numerical and experimental observations presented in this work have implications for the fundamental understanding of the angular momentum of acoustic waves, and for applications such as particle manipulation with radiation forces or torques, acoustic sensing and imaging.</description>

      <title>Universality of satellites in the breakup of a stretched fluid bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a fluid object breaks, it often leaves behind satellite fragments. Here we show that satellite formation can follow universal dynamics, leading to robust satellite sizes. Specifically, we consider the breakup of a slowly stretched fluid bridge, which we realize experimentally using a soap-film bubble suspended between two plates. Combining experiments and one-dimensional simulations, we show that a main satellite bubble always forms as the bridge breaks. We discover that the size of the bubble is highly reproducible and can be dramatically increased by stretching the bridge faster or increasing its volume. The satellite size is a simple function of two non-dimensional parameters: the normalized volume of the bridge and the Weber number, measuring inertia due to stretching as compared to surface tension. These observations can be explained by tracing the bridge evolution over a series of dynamical stages in which the bridge: (i) closely follows a sequence of equilibrium bridge configurations; (ii) stretches as it begins to breakup after reaching an unstable equilibrium; and (iii) follows a universal breakup solution. The last stage takes place over a finite region, the corresponding length scale determined by stretching during the previous stage. This length scale controls the satellite size, and the universality of the dynamics makes the system highly reproducible. This work suggests universal satellite formation dynamics may provide a route for understanding satellite bubble sizes in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Inertia onset in disordered porous media flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the very onset of the inertial regime in pore-scale fluid flow in a three-dimensional, disordered porous media. We analyze how the flow structure changes with increasing Reynolds number. In particular, we compute tortuosity, spatial kinetic energy localization, and the pore-space volume fraction containing negative streamwise velocity. Our analysis shows that the onset of inertia observed in a standard way by computing the friction factor appears at a Reynolds number two orders of magnitude higher than indicated by analyzing tortuosity and spatial distribution of kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>A new HOC scheme for computation of flow and heat transfer in nonuniform polar grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a higher order compact (HOC) discretization is developed on the nonuniform polar grid. The discretization conceptualized using the unsteady convection-diffusion equation (CDE) is further extended to flow problems governed by the Navies-Stokes (N-S) equations as well as the Boussinesq equations. The scheme developed here combines the advantages of body-fitted mesh with grid clustering, thereby making it efficient to capture flow gradients on polar grids. The scheme carries a spatial convergence of order three with temporal order of convergence being almost two. Diverse flow problems are being investigated using the scheme. Apart from two verification studies we validate the scheme by time marching simulation for the benchmark problem of driven polar cavity and the problem of natural convection in the horizontal concentric annulus. In the process, a one-sided approximation for the Neumann boundary condition for vorticity is also presented. Finally, the benchmark problem of forced convection around a circular cylinder is tackled. The results obtained in this study are analyzed and compared with the well-established numerical and experimental data wherever available in the literature. The newly developed scheme is found to generate accurate solutions in each case.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically and numerically the impact of an elastic sphere on a rigid wall in a viscous fluid. Our focus is on the dynamics of the contact, employing the soft lubrication model in which the sphere is separated from the wall by a thin liquid film. In the limit of large sphere inertia, the sphere bounces and the dynamics is close to the Hertz theory. Remarkably, the film thickness separating the sphere from the wall exhibits non-trivial self-similar properties that vary during the spreading and retraction phases. Leveraging these self-similar properties, we establish the energy budget and predict the coefficient of restitution for the sphere. The general framework derived here opens many perspectives to study the lubrication film in impact problems.</description>

      <title>Toward Local Madelung Mechanics in Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been shown that relativistic quantum theory leads to a local interpretation of quantum mechanics wherein the universal wavefunction in configuration space is entirely replaced with an ensemble of local fluid equations in spacetime. For want of a fully relativistic quantum fluid treatment, we develop a model using the nonrelativistic Madelung equations, and obtain conditions for them to be local in spacetime. Every particle in the Madelung fluid is equally real, and has a definite position, momentum, kinetic energy, and potential energy. These are obtained by defining quantum momentum and kinetic energy densities for the fluid and separating the momentum into average and symmetric parts, and kinetic energy into classical kinetic and quantum potential parts. The two types of momentum naturally give rise to a single classical kinetic energy density, which contains the expected kinetic energy, even for stationary states, and we define the reduced quantum potential as the remaining part of the quantum kinetic energy density. We treat the quantum potential as a novel mode of internal energy storage within the fluid particles, which explains most of the nonclassical behavior of the Madelung fluid. For example, we show that in tunneling phenomena the quantum potential negates the barrier so that nothing prevents the fluid from flowing through. We show how energy flows and transforms in this model, and that enabling local conservation of energy requires defining a quantum potential energy current that flows through the fluid rather than only flowing with it. The nonrelativistic treatment generally contains singularities in the velocity field, which undermines the goal of local dynamics, but we expect a proper relativistic treatment will bound the fluid particle velocities at $c$.</description>
