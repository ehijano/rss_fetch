      <title>Novel Asymmetrical High-Resolution and High-Sensitivity Brain Dedicated PET system: Design optimization and performance evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective. This study investigates the best achievable performance of a brain-dedicated PET system with high resolution and sensitivity by evaluating different detector configurations, while maintaining a practical system design suitable for dynamic brain Imaging. Approach. Monte Carlo simulations were performed to evaluate system sensitivity and image quality under various timing resolutions (200 ps, 100 ps and 50 ps). The PET scanner geometry was optimized for human head imaging, featuring an elliptical cylindrical configuration with a neck cut-out, and front/back panels to enhance sensitivity and line of response (LOR) sampling. Detector configurations using LYSO:Ce crystals of varying thicknesses (15 mm and 20 mm) and depth of interaction (DOI) levels were simulated. Sensitivity was calculated using a point-like 511 keV back-to-back gamma source simulated at multiple locations within the field of view (FOV). Image reconstruction was conducted using list mode Maximum Likelihood Expectation Maximization (MLEM), assessing both a Derenzo-type phantom and a voxelated digital brain phantom. Main results. A location-dependent sensitivity ranging from 35.04% to 13.59% was achieved using a 20 mm thick LYSO:Ce crystal. Spatial resolution ranged from 0.8 mm to 1.5 mm within the FOV without applying resolution recovery techniques, measured using the FWHM of reconstructed hot rods. Previous results using 15 mm crystals with three DOI levels showed sensitivity between 23.42% and 15.99%, confirming the performance benefits of increased detector thickness and DOI capability. Significance. This study demonstrates the potential of a practical, brain-optimized PET system to achieve superior resolution and sensitivity for brain imaging. The findings offer valuable insights into optimal detector configurations, supporting the development of next-generation high-performance brain PET technologies.</description>

      <title>A CFD-Based Investigation of Local Luminal Curvature as a Primary Determinant of Hemodynamic Environments in Cerebral Aneurysms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between vascular morphology and hemodynamics is fundamental to understanding the natural history of cerebral aneurysms (CAs). While global geometric indices have been widely studied, the local interaction between luminal curvature and wall shear stress (WSS) remains poorly characterized. This study analyzed a large cohort of CAs to investigate how local surface morphology relates to hemodynamics. This was performed via CFD flow simulations of a set of 76 patient-specific CA geometries using the OpenFOAM library. Geometry and pulsatile inflow conditions were modeled based on patient arterial diameter and age. Blood was assumed to be a Newtonian incompressible fluid flowing in a laminar regime. We utilized a geometric framework to classify the aneurysm lumen into spherical-like and saddle-like patches based on Gaussian curvature. Our results demonstrate a robust, statistically significant correlation between these curvature types and hemodynamic metrics, regardless of rupture status or aneurysm type. Specifically, saddle-like patches, predominantly found at the aneurysm neck, are associated with high time-averaged WSS, a low oscillatory shear index, and intense near-wall vortical activity as identified by the lambda2-criterion. In contrast, spherical-like patches, dominant at the dome, correspond to regions of flow impingement characterized by lower time-averaged WSS and an elevated oscillatory shear index. These findings suggest that wall curvature is a primary determinant of local hemodynamics. By bridging the gap between local wall morphology and pathological wall markers, this work suggests that curvature-based mapping can serve as a powerful tool for identifying vulnerable regions susceptible to thinning and rupture. This objective geometric assessment offers valuable insights for risk stratification and the precision planning of endovascular interventions.</description>

      <title>Respiratory Motion Management in Abdominal MRI: Revisiting the Gap Between Technical Advances and Clinical Translation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherently slow acquisition speed of MRI makes abdominal imaging highly sensitive to respiratory motion artifacts. Since the early days of MRI, the development of respiratory motion compensation has been an active research topic, and this field has achieved substantial technical progress. Despite these advances, majority of these techniques are not clinically available, and motion management methods used in clinical abdominal MRI today have changed little over the past decades. This observation is striking and points to a significant gap between technical innovation and clinical translation in this area.
  This review is motivated by this question: why have so many motion management techniques not been adopted into routine clinical workflows? Unlike conventional survey-style reviews that focus on summarizing emerging methods, this article takes a different, and perhaps opposite, perspective to investigate why those technologically sophisticated innovations are misaligned with practical clinical needs. Specifically, we discuss the barriers behind the gap between research advances and clinical practice, clarify the clinical requirements for effective respiratory motion management in abdominal MRI, and highlight research directions with stronger relevance to routine workflows.
  The review begins with an overview of the clinical impact of respiratory motion in abdominal MRI, followed by a discussion of standard abdominal MRI sequences and their motion sensitivity. We then summarize current clinical strategies and advanced approaches, along with the barriers that hinder their clinical adoption. The article concludes with future directions and broader lessons learned from this translational gap, with the goal of guiding future developments towards improved clinical integration.</description>

      <title>Solderable Microcontroller-Integrated E-Textiles using UV-Tape-Assisted Laser Patterning Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we developed a UV-tape-assisted laser patterning (UT-Laser) technique that enables the simple transfer-based formation of wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m onto textile substrates. With the rapid advancement of wearable devices capable of acquiring various types of physiological and environmental information, research on electronic textiles (e-textiles)-in which electronic components are integrated into fabrics and clothing-has progressed considerably. However, integrating high-performance, rigid electronic components onto textiles remains challenging: the diameter of textile fibers limits the formation of fine wiring, making reliable mounting of such components difficult. To address these challenges, we devised the UT-Laser technique, in which thin foil or film materials are laser vector-cut on UV tape, and the adhesive strength is controlled through UV exposure. The unnecessary portions are selectively and collectively peeled away to form fine wiring, which is subsequently transferred onto the textile substrate. This approach enables facile fabrication of fine wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m on textiles. Furthermore, by forming fine wiring from a flexible copper clad laminate and transferring it onto heat-resistant glass cloth, electronic components can be soldered directly, allowing the fabrication of e-textile devices capable of withstanding more than 10,000 bending cycles. The prototype e-textile device fabricated using the proposed method integrates a microcontroller, USB connector, battery holder, flash memory, inertial measurement unit, and environmental sensors, and successfully acquires data related to stair climbing, respiration, and changes in body temperature during sleep.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Human Body-coupled Electric Field Interference in Unshielded Ultra-Low Field MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Portable ultra-low field MRI (ULF-MRI) systems operated in unshielded environments are susceptible to electromagnetic interference (EMI). Subject presence in the imaging region will lead to substantial noise increases, yet the dominant coupling mechanism remains insufficiently characterized. We develop a lumped-parameter circuit model of the coupled environment-body-receiver system. The model indicates that ambient time-varying electric fields induce a body common-mode potential, which is converted into differential-mode noise through capacitive imbalance between the head and the receive-coil terminals, yielding strong dependence on subject position and geometry. Circuit analysis, simulations, and controlled experiments support the model, with predicted imbalance consistent with measured noise variations. Guided by this mechanism, we implement a capacitive low-impedance bypass to clamp the body potential, achieving an approximately 3.5-fold SNR improvement on a 50 mT prototype. The proposed model offers a compact circuit-based tool for analyzing and mitigating human body-coupled electric-field interference in portable ULF-MRI.</description>
