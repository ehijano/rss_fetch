      <title>Persistent Hierarchy in Contemporary International Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Science is increasingly global, with international collaboration playing a crucial role in advancing scientific development and knowledge exchange across borders. However, the processes that regulate how scientific labor is distributed among countries remain underexplored, leading to challenges in ensuring both effective collaboration and equitable participation across diverse scientific communities. Here, we leverage three million internationally coauthored publications produced by countries worldwide to examine the division of scientific labor in international collaboration, identify the factors that shape this distribution, and assess its broader consequences. Our findings uncover a persistent hierarchical structure in international collaboration, with researchers from scientifically advanced countries tend to occupy leading roles, while those from less-developed countries are often relegated to supportive roles, even after controlling for various influential factors. This hierarchy is also reflected in the research content, as countries with lower scientific capacity tend to participate in international collaborations that deviate from their domestic science. By analyzing the labor division within international collaborations, we demonstrate that researchers from less-developed countries face systematic disadvantages, which not only limit their contributions to the global scientific community but also prevent them from fully benefiting from international collaborations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Scientific Contributions through Citation Context and Division of Labor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific contributions are a direct reflection of a research paper's value, illustrating its impact on existing theories or practices. Existing measurement methods assess contributions based on the authors' perceived or self-identified contributions, while the actual contributions made by the papers are rarely investigated. This study measures the actual contributions of papers published in Nature and Science using 1.53 million citation contexts from citing literature and explores the impact pattern of division of labor (DOL) inputs on the actual contributions of papers from an input-output perspective. Results show that experimental contributions are predominant, contrasting with the theoretical and methodological contributions self-identified by authors. This highlights a notable discrepancy between actual contributions and authors' self-perceptions, indicating an 'ideal bias'. There is no significant correlation between the overall labor input pattern and the actual contribution pattern of papers, but a positive correlation appears between input and output for specific types of scientific contributions, reflecting a 'more effort, more gain' effect. Different types of DOL input in papers exhibit a notable co-occurrence trend. However, once the paper reaches the dissemination stage, the co-occurrence of different types of actual contributions becomes weaker, indicating that a paper's contributions are often focused on a single type.</description>

      <title>Top Research Performance Over Three Decades: A Multidimensional Micro-Data Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04199v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this research, the contributions of a highly productive minority of scientists to the national Polish research output over the past three decades (1992-2021) is explored. In almost all previous research, the approaches to high research productivity are missing the time component. Cross-sectional studies were not complemented by longitudinal studies: Scientists comprising the classes of top performers have not been tracked over time. Three classes of top performers (the upper 1%, 5%, and 10%) are examined, and a surprising temporal stability of productivity patterns is found. The 1/10 and 10/50 rules consistently apply across the three decades: The upper 1% of scientists, on average, account for 10% of the national output, and the upper 10% account for almost 50% of total output, with significant disciplinary variations. The Relative Presence Index (RPI) we constructed shows that men are overrepresented and women underrepresented in all top performers classes. Top performers are studied longitudinally through their detailed publishing histories, with micro-data coming from the raw Scopus dataset. Econometric models identify the three most important predictors that change the odds ratio estimates of membership in the top performance classes: gender, academic age, and research collaboration. The downward trend in fixed effects over successive six-year periods indicates increasing competition in academia. A large population of all internationally visible Polish scientists (N=152,043) with their 587,558 articles is studied.</description>

      <title>LitSearch: A Retrieval Benchmark for Scientific Literature Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Literature search questions, such as "Where can I find research on the evaluation of consistency in generated summaries?" pose significant challenges for modern search engines and retrieval systems. These questions often require a deep understanding of research concepts and the ability to reason across entire articles. In this work, we introduce LitSearch, a retrieval benchmark comprising 597 realistic literature search queries about recent ML and NLP papers. LitSearch is constructed using a combination of (1) questions generated by GPT-4 based on paragraphs containing inline citations from research papers and (2) questions manually written by authors about their recently published papers. All LitSearch questions were manually examined or edited by experts to ensure high quality. We extensively benchmark state-of-the-art retrieval models and also evaluate two LLM-based reranking pipelines. We find a significant performance gap between BM25 and state-of-the-art dense retrievers, with a 24.8% absolute difference in recall@5. The LLM-based reranking strategies further improve the best-performing dense retriever by 4.4%. Additionally, commercial search engines and research tools like Google Search perform poorly on LitSearch, lagging behind the best dense retriever by up to 32 recall points. Taken together, these results show that LitSearch is an informative new testbed for retrieval systems while catering to a real-world use case.</description>
