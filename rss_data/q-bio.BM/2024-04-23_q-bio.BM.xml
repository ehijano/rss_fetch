      <title>Molecular simulations to investigate the impact of N6-methylation in RNA recognition: Improving accuracy and precision of binding free energy prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent RNA post-transcriptional modification that plays crucial roles in RNA stability, structural dynamics, and interactions with proteins. The YT521-B (YTH) family of proteins, which are notable m6A readers, function through their highly conserved YTH domain. Recent structural investigations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have shed light on the recognition mechanism of m6A by the YTHDC1 protein. Despite advancements, using MD to predict the stabilization induced by m6A on the free energy of binding between RNA and YTH proteins remains challenging, due to inaccuracy of the employed force field and limited sampling. For instance, simulations often fail to sufficiently capture the hydration dynamics of the binding pocket. This study addresses these challenges through an innovative methodology that integrates metadynamics, alchemical simulations, and force-field refinement. Importantly, our research identifies hydration of the binding pocket as giving only a minor contribution to the binding free energy and emphasizes the critical importance of precisely tuning force-field parameters to experimental data. By employing a fitting strategy built on alchemical calculations, we refine the m6A partial charges parameters, thereby enabling the simultaneous reproduction of N6 methylation on both the protein binding free energy and the thermodynamic stability of nine RNA duplexes. Our findings underscore the sensitivity of binding free energies to partial charges, highlighting the necessity for thorough parameterization and validation against experimental observations across a range of structural contexts.</description>

      <title>Simple, Efficient and Scalable Structure-aware Adapter Boosts Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14850</link>

Abstract: Fine-tuning Pre-trained protein language models (PLMs) has emerged as a prominent strategy for enhancing downstream prediction tasks, often outperforming traditional supervised learning approaches. As a widely applied powerful technique in natural language processing, employing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques could potentially enhance the performance of PLMs. However, the direct transfer to life science tasks is non-trivial due to the different training strategies and data forms. To address this gap, we introduce SES-Adapter, a simple, efficient, and scalable adapter method for enhancing the representation learning of PLMs. SES-Adapter incorporates PLM embeddings with structural sequence embeddings to create structure-aware representations. We show that the proposed method is compatible with different PLM architectures and across diverse tasks. Extensive evaluations are conducted on 2 types of folding structures with notable quality differences, 9 state-of-the-art baselines, and 9 benchmark datasets across distinct downstream tasks. Results show that compared to vanilla PLMs, SES-Adapter improves downstream task performance by a maximum of 11% and an average of 3%, with significantly accelerated training speed by a maximum of 1034% and an average of 362%, the convergence rate is also improved by approximately 2 times. Moreover, positive optimization is observed even with low-quality predicted structures. The source code for SES-Adapter is available at https://github.com/tyang816/SES-Adapter.</description>

      <title>MolCRAFT: Structure-Based Drug Design in Continuous Parameter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative models for structure-based drug design (SBDD) have shown promising results in recent years. Existing works mainly focus on how to generate molecules with higher binding affinity, ignoring the feasibility prerequisites for generated 3D poses and resulting in false positives. We conduct thorough studies on key factors of ill-conformational problems when applying autoregressive methods and diffusion to SBDD, including mode collapse and hybrid continuous-discrete space. In this paper, we introduce MolCRAFT, the first SBDD model that operates in the continuous parameter space, together with a novel noise reduced sampling strategy. Empirical results show that our model consistently achieves superior performance in binding affinity with more stable 3D structure, demonstrating our ability to accurately model interatomic interactions. To our best knowledge, MolCRAFT is the first to achieve reference-level Vina Scores (-6.59 kcal/mol) with comparable molecular size, outperforming other strong baselines by a wide margin (-0.84 kcal/mol).</description>

      <title>Improved Cryo-EM Pose Estimation and 3D Classification through Latent-Space Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown poses (projection angles and image shifts) in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments, reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D images is very challenging. In addition to these challenges, heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction requires conformational classification. In popular cryo-EM reconstruction algorithms, poses and conformation classification labels must be predicted for every input cryo-EM image, which can be computationally costly for large datasets. An emerging class of methods adopted the amortized inference approach. In these methods, only a subset of the input dataset is needed to train neural networks for the estimation of poses and conformations. Once trained, these neural networks can make pose/conformation predictions and 3D reconstructions at low cost for the entire dataset during inference. Unfortunately, when facing heterogeneous reconstruction tasks, it is hard for current amortized-inference-based methods to effectively estimate the conformational distribution and poses from entangled latent variables. Here, we propose a self-supervised variational autoencoder architecture called "HetACUMN" based on amortized inference. We employed an auxiliary conditional pose prediction task by inverting the order of encoder-decoder to explicitly enforce the disentanglement of conformation and pose predictions. Results on simulated datasets show that HetACUMN generated more accurate conformational classifications than other amortized or non-amortized methods. Furthermore, we show that HetACUMN is capable of performing heterogeneous 3D reconstructions of a real experimental dataset.</description>
