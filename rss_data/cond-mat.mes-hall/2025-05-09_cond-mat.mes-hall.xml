      <title>Beyond fixed-size skyrmions in nanodots: switchable multistability with ferromagnetic ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a novel approach to control and stabilize magnetic skyrmions in ultrathin multilayer nanostructures through spatially engineered magnetostatic fields generated by ferromagnetic nanorings. Using analytical modeling and micromagnetic simulations, we show that the stray fields from a Co/Pd ferromagnetic ring with out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy significantly enhance N\'eel-type skyrmion stability in an Ir/Co/Pt nanodot, even without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Most notably, we observe a multistability phenomenon, where skyrmions can be stabilized at two or more distinct equilibrium diameters depending on the ring's magnetization orientation. These stable states exhibit energy barriers substantially exceeding thermal fluctuations at room temperature, suggesting practical applications for robust multibit memory storage. By tuning geometric parameters of the ferromagnetic ring, we demonstrate precise control over skyrmion size and stability, opening pathways for advanced spintronic nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Pump-induced magnon anticrossing due to three-magnon splitting and confluence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a plausible mechanism for achieving magnon-magnon level repulsion spectrum originating from the oscillation between the splitting and confluence in a three-magnon scattering process. When a magnetostatic mode on a YIG sphere is pumped by a microwave signal near the magnon resonance frequency with an increasing amplitude, the generated magnon condensate at half of the pumping frequency exerts a back-action to the original magnon mode. Such a strong nonlinear coupling manifests a striking feature of a 'bending effect' of the magnetostatic mode spectra, akin to the anti-crossing observed in a strongly coupled magnon-photon system.</description>

      <title>Theoretically proposed controlled creation of Bloch-type skyrmions with spin-orbit torque in a chiral-ferromagnet/heavy-metal heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The creation and manipulation of magnetic skyrmions in magnetic bilayer heterostructures via spin-orbit torque have been intensively studied in spintronics because of their potential application as information carriers in next-generation magnetic memory devices. However, experimental attempts have not always been successful. In this paper, we theoretically elucidate the underlying reasons for these difficulties and propose a practical method to overcome them by employing magnetic bilayer heterostructures that incorporate a chiral ferromagnetic layer hosting Bloch-type skyrmions instead of the conventional ferromagnetic layer that hosts N\'{e}el-type skyrmions. Our micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that Bloch-type skyrmions can be controllably created in this system via spin-orbit torque exerted by a perpendicular spin current. This finding provides a promising platform and method for realizing skyrmion-based spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Proposed controlled creation and manipulation of skyrmions with spin-orbit torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical mechanisms underlying current-driven skyrmion motion include the spin-transfer torque exerted by a spin-polarized horizontal electric current and the spin-orbit torque exerted by a perpendicular spin current. Each mechanism requires a specific sample geometry and structural configuration. Regarding current-induced skyrmion creation, skyrmions can be efficiently created at low current densities via spin-transfer torque when an electric current is applied to a nanotrack structure with a small notch. However, an effective and controlled method for skyrmion creation via spin-orbit torque in notched nanotracks has yet to be established. Here we theoretically propose a method for the creation, driving, and deletion of skyrmions in a three-terminal magnetic heterojunction with a notch. Our proposal offers valuable insights into the design of techniques for skyrmion creation and manipulation using spin-orbit torque, which is essential for technical applications of magnetic skyrmions as information carriers in next-generation spintronic memory devices.</description>

      <title>Spatially Mapping Phonon Drag in Ultrascaled 5-nm Silicon Nanowire Field-Effect Transistor Based on a Quantum Hydrodynamic Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compelling demand for higher performance and lower thermal energy dissipation in nanoelectronic devices is the major driving force of the semiconductor industry's quest for future generations of nanotransistors. Over the past 15 years, the miniaturization of silicon-based nanoelectronics predicted by Moore's law has driven an aggressive scaling down of the transistor structure, including materials, design, and geometries. In this regard, the electronic device community has expanded its focus to ultrascaled transistors targeting 7-nm technology node and beyond. However, these emerging nanodevices are also creating thermal issues that could evidently limit their carrier transfer as a result of strong electron-phonon coupling. We aim to explain the physical origin of self-heating effects in an ultrascaled 5-nm silicon nanowire Field-Effect Transistor. On the basis of the quantum hydrodynamic approach, a possible explanation of phonon drag contribution to thermal conductivity is also discussed. To the best of our knowledge, we report for the first time the impact of the phonon drag effect on the electrical and thermal performance of 5nm gate-all-around silicon nanowire field-effect transistors. Our findings provide a deep insight into the origin of self-heating as a result of mutual electron-phonon coupling. Furthermore, we further demonstrate that the phonon drag effect significantly reduces thermal conductivity by nearly 50\% under high bias conditions.</description>

      <title>Exponential Dependence of Interlayer Exchange Coupling in Fe/MgO(001) Superlattices on Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interlayer exchange coupling in Fe/MgO(001) superlattices is found to increase exponentially with decreasing temperature. Around 150~K, the field induced response changes from discrete switching, governed by field-driven domain propagation, to a collective rotation of the magnetic layers. This transition is accompanied by a change in the magnetic ground state from 180$^{\circ}$ (antiferromagnetic) to 90$^{\circ}$ alignment between adjacent Fe layers. These effects are argued to arise from quantum well states, defined by the total thickness of the samples.</description>

      <title>Engineering second order topological superconductor hosting tunable Majorana corner modes in magnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrid platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical framework for realizing a two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological superconductor (SOTSC) in a hybrid system comprised of a $d$-wave superconductor, a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI), and a noncollinear magnetic texture deposited on top of the unconventional superconductor. While the interplay of the $d$-wave superconductor and QSHI has been studied as a platform to realize Majorana corner modes (MCMs), we show that the addition of the spin texture enables the tunability of these MCMs. Each corner of this hybrid system can host one or two Majorana modes depending on the system parameters, in particular, exchange strength and pitch vector of the spin texture. To characterize the higher order bulk topology, we compute the quadrupolar winding number, which directly corresponds to the number of MCMs acquiring a value of one for four corner modes and two for eight corner modes. We investigate and show the close resemblance in the topological phase diagrams obtained from the low energy effective Hamiltonian that reveals an emergent in-plane Zeeman field and spin-orbit coupling induced by the spin texture, and the real space tight binding lattice model. The microscopic pairing mechanism responsible for the appearance of SOTSC phase is investigated via an effective bulk pairing analysis, while a low-energy edge theory captures the mechanism behind tunability of MCMs. Our result paves the way for realizing SOTC with multiple MCMs which can be tuned via system parameters.</description>

      <title>Josephson current signature of Floquet Majorana and topological accidental zero modes in altermagnet heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the generation and Josephson current signatures of Floquet Majorana end modes (FMEMs) in a periodically driven altermagnet (AM) heterostructure. Considering a one-dimensional (1D) Rashba nanowire (RNW) proximitized to a regular $s$-wave superconductor and a $d$-wave AM, we generate both $0$- and $\pi$-FMEMs by driving the nontopological phase of the static system. While the static counterpart hosts both topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and non-topological accidental zero modes (AZMs), the drive can gap out the static AZMs and generate robust $\pi$-FMEMs, termed as topological AZMs (TAZMs). We topologically characterize the emergent FMEMs via dynamical winding numbers exploiting chiral symmetry of the system. Moreover, we consider a periodically driven Josephson junction comprising of RNW/AM-based 1D topological superconduting setup. We identify the signature of MZMs and FMEMs utilizing $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect, distinguishing them from trivial AZMs exhibiting $2\pi$-periodicty, in both static and driven platforms. This Josephson current signal due to Majorana modes survives even in presence of finite disorder. Our work establishes a route to realize and identify FMEMs in AM-based platforms through Floquet engineering and Josephson current response.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear optical response of truly chiral phonons: Light-induced phonon angular momentum, Peltier effect, and orbital current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear optical responses of chiral phonons to terahertz and infrared light are studied using the nonlinear response theory. We show that the photo-induced angular momentum increases with the square of the chiral-phonon relaxation time $\tau$, giving a significantly larger angular momentum compared to ordinary phonons. We also find that the photo-induced Peltier effect by chiral phonons occurs through a mechanism distinct from those proposed recently; the induced energy current scales $\propto\tau^2$, giving a larger energy current in the clean limit. We prove a linear relation between the generated angular momentum and the energy current. Lastly, we show that the orbital current, an analog of the spin current, occurs through a nonlinear response. These findings demonstrate the unique properties and functionalities of chiral phonons.</description>

      <title>Ballistic-to-diffusive transition in engineered counter-propagating quantum Hall channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic quantum Hall systems hosting counter-propagating edge states can show seemingly non-universal transport regimes, usually depending on the size of the sample. We experimentally probe transport in a quantum Hall sample engineered to host a tunable number of counter-propagating edge states. The latter are coupled by Landauer reservoirs, which force charge equilibration over a tunable effective length. We show that charge transport is determined by the balance of up- and downstream channels, with a ballistic regime emerging for unequal numbers of channels. For equal numbers, we observe a transition to a critical diffusive regime, characterized by a diverging equilibration length. Our approach allows simulating the equilibration of hole-conjugate states and other exotic quantum Hall effects with fully controlled parameters using well-understood quantum Hall states.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal non-dissipative current states in bilayer electron-hole systems in the presence of potential barriers that divide the system into left and right sides was investigated. The consideration is performed both for the case of weak carrier coupling (high density) and strong coupling (low density). It is shown that in the high-density limit, the critical current is proportional to the product of the transparencies of the barriers in the electron and hole layers, whereas in the low-density limit, the current is inversely proportional to the sum of the heights of the potential barriers.</description>

      <title>Fermi lune and transdimensional orbital magnetism in rhombohedral multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetry and geometry of the Fermi surface play an essential role in governing the transport properties of a metallic system. A Fermi surface with reduced symmetry is intimately tied to unusual transport properties such as anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear Hall effect. Here, combining theoretical calculations and transport measurements, we report the discovery of a new class of bulk Fermi surface structure with unprecedented low symmetry, the ``Fermi lune", with peculiar crescent shaped Fermi energy contours, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. This emergent Fermi-lune structure driven by electron-electron interactions spontaneously breaks time-reversal, mirror, and rotational symmetries, leading to two distinctive phenomena: giant intrinsic non-reciprocity in longitudinal transport and a new type of magnetism termed ``transdimensional orbital magnetism". Coupling the Fermi lune to a superlattice potential further produces a novel Chern insulator exhibiting quantized anomalous Hall effect controlled by in-plane magnetic field. Our work unveils a new symmetry breaking state of matter in the transdimensional regime, which opens an avenue for exploring correlated and topological quantum phenomena in symmetry breaking phases.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Spin-Polarized Unconventional Skin Effect in Hatano-Nelson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a nonzero spectral winding number in one dimension (1D). By investigating 1D spinful Hatano-Nelson model with Abelian gauge fields we uncover a tunable, unconventional spin-polarized NHSE with zero spectral winding, coexisting with a bidirectional conventional NHSE exhibiting nonzero winding. The unconventional skin modes display scale-restricted localization, distinguishing them from the critical NHSE. Upon introducing an external magnetic field coupled to the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional skin modes are suppressed, leading to spectral instability and the emergence of critical NHSE with system size-dependent non-Bloch spectra. Meanwhile, conventional skin modes persist, but undergo a transition from bidirectional to unidirectional accumulation. Our results provide experimentally accessible predictions, relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.</description>

      <title>Parity anomaly from LSM: exact valley symmetries on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the honeycomb tight-binding model hosts an exact microscopic avatar of its low-energy SU(2) valley symmetry and parity anomaly. Specifically, the SU(2) valley symmetry arises from a collection of conserved, integer-quantized charge operators that obey the Onsager algebra. Along with lattice reflection and time-reversal symmetries, this Onsager symmetry has a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) anomaly that matches the parity anomaly in the IR. Indeed, we show that any local Hamiltonian commuting with these symmetries cannot have a trivial unique gapped ground state. We study the phase diagram of the simplest symmetric model and survey various deformations, including Haldane's mass term, which preserves only the Onsager symmetry. Our results place the parity anomaly in 2+1D alongside Schwinger's anomaly in 1+1D and Witten's SU(2) anomaly in 3+1D as 't Hooft anomalies that can arise from the Onsager symmetry on the lattice.</description>

      <title>HOP-graphene: A high-capacity anode for Li/Na-ion batteries unveiled by first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for efficient energy storage has driven the search for advanced anode materials for lithium- and sodium-ion batteries (LIBs and SIBs). In this context, we report the application of HOP-graphene (a 5-6-8-membered 2D carbon framework) as a high-performance anode material for LIBs and SIBs using density functional theory simulations. Diffusion studies reveal low energy barriers of 0.70 eV for Li and 0.39 eV for Na, indicating superior mobility at room temperature compared to other carbon allotropes, like graphite. Full lithiation and sodiation accommodate 24 Li and 22 Na atoms, respectively, delivering outstanding theoretical capacities of 1338 mAh/g (Li) and 1227 mAh/g (Na). Bader charge analysis and charge density difference maps confirm substantial electron transfer from the alkali metals to the substrate. Average open-circuit voltages of 0.42 V (Li) and 0.33 V (Na) suggest favorable electrochemical performance. HOP-graphene also demonstrates excellent mechanical strength. These findings position HOP-graphene as a promising candidate for next-generation LIB and SIB anodes.</description>

      <title>Athos-Graphene: Computational Discovery of an Art-Inspired 2D Carbon Anode for Lithium-Ion Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have attracted growing interest for their structural versatility and potential in energy storage and nanoelectronics. We propose Athos-Graphene (AG), a novel 2D carbon allotrope inspired by the geometric patterns of Brazilian artist Athos Bulc\~ao. Designed using density functional theory, AG features a periodic structure with high thermodynamic and thermal stability, as evidenced by a low cohesive energy of -7.96 eV/atom, the absence of imaginary phonon modes, and robust performance in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations up to 1000 K. It exhibits anisotropic mechanical properties, with Young's modulus values of 585 GPa and 600 GPa along the x- and y-directions, and Poisson's ratios of 0.19 and 0.17, respectively. Electronic structure analyses confirm its metallic behavior, while optical studies reveal anisotropic absorption in the visible and UV regions. For lithium-ion storage, Athos-Graphene shows strong Li adsorption (-2.3 to -1.0 eV), a high theoretical capacity of 836.78 mAh/g, and a low average open-circuit voltage of 0.54 V. Lithium diffusion barriers are as low as 0.3 eV on the surface and 0.66 eV between layers, with a high diffusion coefficient greater than 6x10^-6 cm^2/s. These features highlight AG as a promising anode material for high-performance lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Tailoring composite skyrmionic spin textures in an above-room-temperature ferromagnet Fe3-xGaTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing room-temperature tunable skyrmionic objects in van der Waals ferromagnet offers unparalleled prospects for future spintronics. Here, we report an experimental investigation on the emergence and evolution of skyrmionic spin textures in the non-stoichiometric Fe3-xGaTe2 using magnetic force microscopy. The iron-deficiency-specific magnetic states of stripe, striped skyrmionium and striped skyrmion sack are observed. Through zero-field-cooling and field-cooling measurements, we observed distinct topological transitions and trivial transitions (distinguished by changes in topological charge) emerging during the stepwise evolution of topological spin textures, which enabled us to develop an evolution pathway model. Leveraging this model, the room-temperature stable composite topological spin textures of skyrmionium, skyrmion bag and sack states are further controllably realized via the exclusive topological-transition path (regulated by magnetic field and DMI intensity). Our work provides valuable insights into the room-temperature realization of topological spin textures in Fe3-xGaTe2, and inspires further exploration of their potential applications in heterostructure spintronics.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Dynamic Range of Quantum Sensing via Quantum Circuit Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology is a promising application of quantum technologies, enabling the precise measurement of weak external fields at a local scale. In typical quantum sensing protocols, a qubit interacts with an external field, and the amplitude of the field is estimated by analyzing the expectation value of a measured observable. Sensitivity can, in principle, be enhanced by increasing the number of qubits within a fixed volume, thereby maintaining spatial resolution. However, at high qubit densities, inter-qubit interactions induce complex many-body dynamics, resulting in multiple oscillations in the expectation value of the observable even for small field amplitudes. This ambiguity reduces the dynamic range of the sensing protocol. We propose a method to overcome the limitation in quantum metrology by adopting a quantum circuit learning framework using a parameterized quantum circuit to approximate a target function by optimizing the circuit parameters. In our method, after the qubits interact with the external field, we apply a sequence of parameterized quantum gates and measure a suitable observable. By optimizing the gate parameters, the expectation value is trained to exhibit a monotonic response within a target range of field amplitudes, thereby eliminating multiple oscillations and enhancing the dynamic range. This method offers a strategy for improving quantum sensing performance in dense qubit systems.</description>

Abstract: The creation of atomically thin layers of non-exfoliable materials remains a crucial challenge, requiring the development of innovative techniques. Here, confinement epitaxy is exploited to realize two-dimensional gallium via intercalation in epitaxial graphene grown on silicon carbide. Novel superstructures arising from the interaction of gallenene (a monolayer of gallium) with graphene and the silicon carbide substrate are investigated. The coexistence of different gallenene phases, including b010-gallenene and the elusive high-pressure Ga(III) phase, is identified. This work sheds new light on the formation of two-dimensional gallium and provides a platform for investigating the exotic electronic and optical properties of confined gallenene.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleic acids have been regarded as stiff polymers with long-range flexibility and generally modeled using elastic rod models of polymer physics. Notwithstanding, investigations carried out over the past few years on single fragments of order $\sim 100$ base pairs have revealed remarkable flexibility properties at short scales and called for theoretical approaches that emphasize the role of the bending fluctuations at single sites along the molecule stack. Here, we review a three dimensional mesoscopic Hamiltonian model which assumes a discrete representation of the double stranded (ds) molecules at the level of the nucleotides. The model captures the fundamental local interactions between adjacent sugar-phosphate groups and the pairwise interactions between complementary base pair mates. A statistical method based on the path integral formalism sets the ensemble of the base pair breathing fluctuations which are included in the partition function and permits to derive the thermodynamics and the elastic response of single molecules to external forces. We apply the model to the computation of the twist-stretch relations for fragments of ds-DNA and ds-RNA, showing that the obtained opposite pattern (DNA overtwists whereas RNA untwists versus force) follows from the different structural features of the two helices. Moreover, we focus on the DNA stretching due to the confinement in nano-pores and, finally, on the computation of the cyclization probability of open ends molecules of $\sim 100$ base pairs under physiological conditions. The mesoscopic model shows a distinct advantage over the elastic rod model in estimating the molecule bendability at short length scale.</description>

      <title>Report on Neural-like Criticality in Ag-based Nanoparticle Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emulating the neural-like information processing dynamics of the brain provides a time and energy efficient approach for solving complex problems. While the majority of neuromorphic hardware currently developed rely on large arrays of highly organized building units, such as in rigid crossbar architectures, in biological neuron assemblies make use of dynamic transitions within highly parallel, reconfigurable connection schemes. Neuroscience suggests that efficiency of information processing in the brain rely on dynamic interactions and signal propagations which are self-tuned and non-rigid. Brain-like dynamic and avalanche criticality have already been found in a variety of self-organized networks of nanoobjects, such as nanoparticles (NP) or nanowires. Here we report on the dynamics of the electrical spiking signals from Ag-based self-organized nanoparticle networks (NPNs) at the example of monometallic Ag NPNs, bimetallic AgAu alloy NPNs and composite Ag/ZrN NPNs, which combine two distinct NP species. We present time series recordings of the resistive switching responses in each network and showcase the determination of switching events as well as the evaluation of avalanche criticality. In each case, for Ag NPN, AgAu NPN and Ag/ZrN NPN, the agreement of three independently derived estimates of the characteristic exponent provides evidence for avalanche criticality. The study shows that Ag-based NPNs offer a broad range of versatility for integration purposes into physical computing systems without destroying their critical dynamics, as the composition of these NPNs can be modified to suit specific requirements for integration.</description>

      <title>Size dependence of the properties of synthetic-antiferromagnet-based stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions for probabilistic computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic magnetic tunnel junctions (s-MTJs) are core components for spintronics-based probabilistic computing (p-computing), a promising candidate for energy-efficient unconventional computing. To achieve reliable performance under practical conditions, the use of a synthetic antiferromagnetic (SAF) free-layer configuration was proposed due to its enhanced tolerance to magnetic field perturbations. For engineering the SAF s-MTJs, we systematically investigate the properties of the SAF s-MTJs as a function of the junction size. We observe that decreasing junction size leads to shorter relaxation times, enhanced magnetic field robustness, and enhanced insensitivity to bias voltage. These findings provide key insights toward high-performance p-computers with reliable operation.</description>

      <title>Type-III Weyl Semi-Half-Metal in an Ultralight Monolayer Li$_2$N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between magnetic ordering and band topology has emerged as a fertile ground for discovering novel quantum states with profound implications for fundamental physics and next-generation electronics. Here, we theoretically predict a new type-III Weyl semi-half-metal (SHM) state in monolayer Li$_2$N, uniquely combining magnetic half-metallicity and type-III Weyl semimetal characteristics. First-principles calculations reveal a fully spin-polarized and critically tilted Weyl cone around the Fermi level in monolayer Li$_2$N, driven by $p$-orbital ferromagnetism. This arises from the symmetry-protected band crossing between a flat valence band and a highly dispersive conduction band, leading to type-III Weyl fermions with strong transport anisotropy. A low-energy $k{\cdot}p$ Hamiltonian is constructed and corresponding nontrivial edge states are uncovered to capture the topological nature of Li$_2$N. Notably, this Weyl SHM phase remains robust under biaxial strain ranging from -2$\%$ to $4\%$, with an ideal type-III Weyl fermion emerging alongside a line-like ergodic surface emerging at 3.7$\%$ strain, offering a promising platform for exploring correlated electronic phenomena. Our results establish Li$_2$N as a viable candidate for realizing exotic type-III Weyl SHM states and open a new avenue for exploring the intricate interplay among magnetism, topology, and flat-band physics.</description>

      <title>Open quantum systems with particle and bath driven by time-dependent fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized quantum Langevin equation and its fluctuation-dissipation relation describing the quantum dynamics of a tagged particle interacting with a medium (environment), where both the particle and the environment are driven by an external time-dependent (e.g. oscillating) field. We specialize on the case of a charged tagged particle interacting with a bath of charged oscillators, under an external AC electric field, although the results are much more general and can be applied to any type of external time-dependent fields. We derive the corresponding quantum Langevin equation, which obeys a modified fluctuation-dissipation relation where the external field plays an explicit role. Using these results, we provide an illustration of their usefulness and derive a new form of the quantum Nyquist noise for the voltage fluctuations in electrical circuits under AC conditions (finite frequency), which is the most general since it also accounts for the response of the heat bath (e.g. lattice ions) to the applied AC electric field in the GHz-THz region, of relevance for 5G/6G wireless technologies. This generalized quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation for driven systems can also find other applications ranging from quantum noise in quantum optics to quantum computing with trapped ions.</description>

Abstract: We analyse the interplay between mechanical and radiation pressure in an optomechanical cavity system. Our study is based on an analytical evaluation of the infinite Bessel summations involved, which previously had led to a numerical exploration of the so-called attractor diagram. The analytical expressions are then suitable for further asymptotic analysis in opposing regimes of the amplitude, which allows for a characterisation of the diagram in terms of elementary functions. The same method is applied to the study of optomechanical limit cycles, extending previous results for enhanced values of the parameter space without the need for approximations such as the resolved sideband approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of several classes of novel topological insulators (TIs) with hybrid-order boundary states generated from the first-order TIs with additional crystalline symmetries. Unlike the current studies on hybrid-order TIs where different-order topology arises from merging different-order TIs in various energy, {\color{red} these novel TIs exhibit unique properties, featuring a remarkable coexistence of first-order gapless modes and higher-order Fermi arc states}, behaving as a hybrid between the first-order TIs and higher-order topological semimetals within a single bulk gap. Our findings establish a profound connection between these novel $d$-dimensional ($d$D) TIs and ($d-1$)D higher-order TIs (HOTIs), which can be understood as a result of stacking $(d-1)$D HOTIs to $d$D with $d=3,4$, revealing unconventional topological phase transitions by closing the gap in certain first-order boundaries rather than the bulk. The bulk-boundary correspondence between these higher-order Fermi-arcs and bulk topological invariants associated with additional crystalline symmetries is also demonstrated. We then address the conventional topological phase transitions from these novel TIs to nodal-line/nodal-surface semimetal phases, where the gapless phases host new kinds of topological responses. Meanwhile, we present the corresponding topological semimetal phases by stacking these unique TIs. Finally, we discuss potential ways to realize these novel phases in synthetic and real materials, with a particular focus on the feasible implementation in optical lattices using ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>The formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in silicon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Silicon-based qubits are often made by trapping individual electrons in quantum dots defined by electric gates. Quantum information can then be stored using the spin states of the electrons. However, the nuclei of the surrounding atoms also have spin degrees of freedom that couple to the electron spin qubits and cause decoherence. The emergence of a nuclear-spin dark state has been predicted to reduce this coupling during dynamic nuclear polarization, when the electrons in the quantum dot drive the nuclei in the semiconductor into a decoupled state. Here, we report the formation of a nuclear-spin dark state in a gate-defined silicon double quantum dot. We show that, as expected, the transverse electron-nuclear coupling rapidly diminishes in the dark state, and that this state depends on the synchronized precession of the nuclear spins. Moreover, the dark state significantly reduces the relaxation rate between the singlet and triplet electronic spin states. This nuclear-spin dark state has potential applications as a quantum memory or in quantum sensing, and might enable increased polarization of nuclear spin ensembles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons dominate the optoelectronic response of many materials. Depending on the time scale and host material, excitons can exhibit free diffusion, phonon-limited diffusion, or polaronic diffusion, and exciton transport often limits the efficiency of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells or photodetectors. We demonstrate that topological excitons exhibit enhanced diffusion in all transport regimes. Using quantum geometry, we find that topological excitons are generically larger and more dispersive than their trivial counterparts, promoting their diffusion. We apply this general theory to organic polyacene semiconductors and show that exciton transport increases up to fourfold when topological excitons are present. We also propose that non-uniform electric fields can be used to directly probe the quantum metric of excitons, providing a rare experimental window into a basic geometric feature of quantum states. Our results provide a new strategy to enhance exciton transport in semiconductors and reveal that mathematical ideas of topology and quantum geometry can be important ingredients in the design of next-generation optoelectronic technologies.</description>

While the prevalent multiple Andreev reflection theory matches the experimentally observed SGS, it is limited to a DC \emph{voltage} bias. For a DC \emph{current} bias, existing theories are restricted to low-transparency junctions and fail to capture the full SGS. We introduce a microscopic Floquet approach applicable for arbitrary transparencies, and recover the correct SGS for a DC \emph{current} bias. We provide a comprehensive understanding of SGS for a DC \emph{current} bias, which entails two-quasiparticle tunneling processes absent in existing theories, via two complementary perspectives: in the frequency domain, as generalised Andreev reflections absorbing multiple energies, and in the time domain, as the interference of non-equilibrium current pulses.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Nano-Imaging of Excitons in a Monolayer Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitons, Coulomb bound electron-hole pairs, dominate the optical response of two-dimensional semiconductors across near-infrared and visible frequencies due to their large binding energy and prominent oscillator strength. Previous measurements of excitons in 2D semiconductors have primarily relied on far-field optical spectroscopy techniques which are diffraction limited to several hundred nanometers. To precisely image nanoscale spatial disorder requires an order of magnitude increase in resolution capabilities. Here, we present a study of the exciton spectra of monolayer MoSe2 in the visible range using a cryogenic scattering-type scanning near field optical microscope (s-SNOM) operating down to 11 K. By mapping the spatial variation in the exciton resonance across an hBN encapsulated MoSe2 monolayer, we achieve sub-50 nm spatial resolution and energy resolution below 1 meV. We further investigate the material's near-field spectra and dielectric function, demonstrating the ability of cryogenic visible s-SNOM to reveal nanoscale disorder. Comparison to room temperature measurements illustrate the enhanced capabilities of cryogenic s-SNOM to reveal fine-scale material heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Equivalent Electric Model of a Macrospin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20811v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamics of a ferromagnetic macrospin (e.g., a free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ)) can be described in terms of equivalent capacitor charge $Q$ and inductor flux $\Phi$, in a manner similar to a standard electric LC circuit, but with strongly nonlinear and coupled capacitance and inductance. This description allows for the inclusion of Gilbert damping and spin transfer torques and yields a relatively simple equivalent electric circuit, which can be easily modeled in LTspice or other electrical engineering software. It allows one to easily simulate advanced electrical circuits containing MTJs and conventional electronic components in standard simulation software.</description>

      <title>Power Transfer in Magnetoelectric Resonators: a Combined Analytical and Finite Element Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical model for power transfer in a magnetoelectric film bulk acoustic resonator (FBAR) comprising a piezoelectric-magnetostrictive bilayer. The model describes the power flow between the elastic and magnetic systems, quantifying the transduction efficiency when the FBAR operates as a magnetic transducer. By applying the model to example systems using piezoelectric ScAlN and magnetostrictive CoFeB, Ni, or Terfenol-D layers, we demonstrate the potential for achieving high efficiencies in magnetoelectric transducers, rendering them ideal for efficient ferromagnetic resonance excitation. The validity of the model's assumptions is confirmed through comparison with a numerical finite element resonator model in COMSOL\texttrademark. The finite element model further enables a comprehensive study of the resonator's dynamic behavior, including transient and steady-state regimes, and the identification of resonant frequencies within the system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Freezing in Exactly Solvable Models of Driven Chaotic Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract: The late-time equilibrium behavior of generic interacting models is determined by the coupled hydrodynamic equations associated with the globally conserved quantities. In the presence of an external time-dependent drive, non-integrable systems typically thermalize to an effectively infinite-temperature state, losing all memory of their initial states. However, in the presence of a large time-periodic Floquet drive, there exist special points in phase-space where the strongly interacting system develops approximate {\it emergent} conservation laws. Here we present results for an exactly solvable model of two coupled chaotic quantum dots with multiple orbitals interacting via random two and four-fermion interactions in the presence of a Floquet drive. We analyze the phenomenology of dynamically generated freezing using a combination of exact diagonalization, and field-theoretic analysis in the limit of a large number of electronic orbitals. The model displays universal freezing behavior irrespective of whether the theory is averaged over the disorder configurations or not. We present explicit computations for the growth of many-body chaos and entanglement entropy, which demonstrates the long-lived coherence associated with the interacting degrees of freedom even at late-times at the dynamically frozen points. We also compute the slow timescale that controls relaxation away from exact freezing in a high-frequency expansion.</description>

      <title>Designing edge currents using mesoscopic patterning in chiral d-wave superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are topological as characterized by a finite Chern number and chiral edge modes. Direct fingerprints of chiral superconductivity are thus often taken to be spontaneous edge currents with associated magnetic signatures. However, a number of recent theoretical studies have shown that the total edge current along semi-infinite edges is greatly reduced or even vanishes in many scenarios for all pairing symmetries except chiral $p$-wave, thus impeding experimental detection. We demonstrate how mesoscopic finite-sized samples can be designed to give rise to a shape- and size-dependent strong enhancement of the chiral edge currents and their generated orbital magnetic moment and magnetic fields. In particular, we find that low rotational symmetry systems, such as pentagons and hexagons, give rise to the largest currents, while circular disks also generate large currents but in the opposite direction. We estimate the resulting magnetic fields to be as large as $0.01-0.5$ mT, with a magnetic moment approaching $\mu_B/2$ per Cooper pair (Bohr magneton $\mu_B$). The current and magnetic signatures diverge with shrinking system sizes, eventually cut off by finite-size suppression of chiral superconductivity. We extract the full phase diagram as a function of temperature and system size for different geometries, including competing superconducting orders. In geometries strongly suppressing only one of the $d$-wave components, we find an additional heat capacity jump, as large as $10\%$ of the bulk normal-superconducting transition, marking the transition between a chiral and a nodal $d$-wave state. This further acts as an indirect signature of chiral superconductivity. Our results are relevant for system sizes on the order of tens to hundreds of coherence lengths, and highlight mesoscopic patterning as a viable route to experimentally identify chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between $\SI{50}{\kelvin}$ and $\SI{75}{\kelvin}$ on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Correlations and Krylov spread for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian: Ising chain with a complex-valued transverse magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity measures the spread of an evolved state in a natural basis, induced by the generator of the dynamics and the initial state. Here, we study the spread in Hilbert space of the state of an Ising chain subject to a complex-valued transverse magnetic field, initialized in a trivial product state with all spins pointing down. We demonstrate that Krylov spread reveals structural features of many-body systems that remain hidden in correlation functions that are traditionally employed to determine the phase diagram. When the imaginary part of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian is gapped, the system state asymptotically approaches the non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum for this Hamiltonian. We find that the spread of this evolution unravels three different dynamical phases based on how the spread reaches its infinite-time value. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the Krylov spread and the static correlation function for the z-components of spins in the underlying non-Hermitian Bogoliubov vacuum, providing a full analytical characterization of correlations across the phase diagram. Specifically, for a gapped imaginary spectrum in a finite magnetic field, we find that the correlation function exhibits an oscillatory behavior that decays exponentially in space. Conversely, for a gapless imaginary spectrum, the correlation function displays an oscillatory behavior with an amplitude that decays algebraically in space; the underlying power law depends on the manifestation of two exceptional points within this phase.</description>

      <title>Triplet superconductivity by the orbital Rashba effect at surfaces of elemental superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is often assumed that in a superconductor without spin-triplet pairing, the formation of unconventional spin-triplet densities requires the spin-orbit interaction in combination with either broken inversion symmetry or broken time-reversal symmetry. Here, we show from first principles the existence of supercurrent-driven spin triplet densities on the surface of a variety of simple superconducting materials without spin-orbit coupling. We are able to attribute this phenomenon to the superconducting non-relativistic orbital Rashba Edelstein effect. Furthermore, we find that the spin-orbit induced spin moment is one order of magnitude smaller than the orbital moment, and has a vanishing effect on the total magnitude of the induced triplet density. Our findings imply the existence of a route to generate spin-currents without the use of heavy metals. Additionally, as an orbital moment can couple directly to a magnetic field, it shows that orbital physics is the dominant term that drives the superconducting diode effect.</description>
