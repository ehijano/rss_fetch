      <title>A CPD-enabled low-scaling environment solver in a coupled cluster based static quantum embedding theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15129v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We incorporate a canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD) based low-level solver as a means to accelerate the environment-level solver for the recently developed MPCC embedding framework. Using CPD, we both factorize the three dominant order-three density-fitting two-electron integral (DF TEI) tensors and develop a novel formulation that reduces the storage complexity of the low-level solver from ${O}(N^3)$ to $O(NR)$, where $R$ is the CPD rank, and the computational scaling of the most time-consuming contractions from ${O}(N^4)$ to ${O}(NR^2)$. We provide benchmarks on representative chemical environments, namely water clusters $\mathrm{{(H_2O)_n}}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$ and linear alkane chains $\mathrm{{C_nH_{2n+2}}}$ with $n = 1$ to $6$. For both test sets, using the CPD-compressed DF TEI tensors reproduces the DF reference convergence behavior of the low-level solver, the subsequent high-level step, and the fully self-consistent MPCC iterations, while introducing only small, rank-controlled shifts in absolute energies. At a fixed tolerance in the absolute MPCC energy, the CP ranks required for these tensor approximations increase linearly with system size. Chemically relevant energy differences are likewise preserved, as demonstrated for water-cluster dissociation energies and in a proof-of-concept embedding calculation of methane in a four-water cluster.</description>

      <title>High-throughput screening and mechanistic insights into solid acid proton conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton-conducting solid acids could enable water-free operation of high-temperature fuel cells. However, systematic materials screening has, hitherto, been computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a two-stage high-throughput screening strategy that directly computes proton diffusion coefficients, enabled by machine-learned interatomic potentials fine-tuned to ab initio data. Starting from more than six million materials, our screening -- based on structural motifs rather than empirical descriptors -- identifies $27$ high-performing proton conductors, including over ten previously unexplored compounds. These include sustainable and commercially available materials, candidates that have not yet been synthesized, organic systems that fall outside conventional design rules, and known proton conductors that validate our approach. Importantly, our findings reveal a universal oxygen--oxygen distance of approximately $2.5$~{\AA} at the moment of proton transfer across diverse chemistries, providing mechanistic insight and showing that macroscopic proton conductivity emerges from the interplay between anion rotational dynamics, hydrogen-bond network connectivity, and proton-transfer probability.</description>

      <title>Machine learning electronic structure and atomistic properties from the external potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations remain a major bottleneck in atomistic simulations and, not surprisingly, have attracted significant attention in machine learning (ML). Most existing approaches learn a direct map from molecular geometries, typically represented as graphs or encoded local environments, to molecular properties or use ML as a surrogate for electronic structure theory by targeting quantities such as Fock or density matrices expressed in an atomic orbital (AO) basis.
  Inspired by the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem, in this work, we propose an operator-centered framework in which the external (nuclear) potential, expressed in an AO basis, serves as the model input. From this operator, we construct hierarchical, body-ordered representations of atomic configurations that closely mirror the principles underlying several popular atom-centered descriptors. At the same time, the matrix-valued nature of the external potential provides a natural connection to equivariant message-passing neural networks. In particular, we show that successive products of the external potential provide a scalable route to equivariant message passing and enable an efficient description of long-range effects. We demonstrate that this approach can be used to model molecular properties, such as energies and dipole moments, from the external potential, or learn effective operator-to-operator maps, including mappings to the Fock matrix and the reduced density matrix from which multiple molecular observables can be simultaneously derived.</description>

      <title>Analytical Nuclear Gradients of State-Averaged Configuration Interaction Singles Variants: Application to Conical Intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive analytical nuclear gradients for state-averaged configuration interaction singles (SACIS) and its spin-projected extension (SAECIS), enabling efficient geometry optimization and minimum-energy conical intersection (MECX) searches within a low-cost CIS-based framework. The formulation employs a Lagrangian approach and explicitly removes null-space contributions in the coupled perturbed equations to ensure numerically stable gradients. For twisted-pyramidalized ethylene, both SACIS and SAECIS qualitatively reproduce the correct conical intersection topology, in sharp contrast to conventional CIS and ECIS. Benchmark calculations on twelve MECXs demonstrate that both methods reproduce geometries with mean RMSDs below 0.1~{\AA} relative to high-level reference methods. SACIS captures the essential degeneracy through variational orbital relaxation, which alleviates ground-state Hartree--Fock (HF) orbital bias and effectively incorporates static correlation through localization effects; notably, spin projection is found to be non-essential for the qualitative description of these intersections. Overall, SACIS and SAECIS provide qualitatively reliable CX descriptions at mean-field computational cost in a black-box manner. Given their comparable accuracy and the additional overhead associated with spin projection, SACIS offers a more favorable cost-performance balance for general applications, whereas SAECIS may become advantageous when higher excited states with significant double-excitation character are involved.</description>

      <title>How to Train a Shallow Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shallow ensembles provide a convenient strategy for uncertainty quantification in machine learning interatomic potentials, that is computationally efficient because the different ensemble members share a large part of the model weights. In this work, we systematically investigate training strategies for shallow ensembles to balance calibration performance with computational cost. We first demonstrate that explicit optimization of a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss improves calibration with respect to approaches based on ensembles of randomly initialized models, or on a last-layer Laplace approximation. However, models trained solely on energy objectives yield miscalibrated force estimates. We show that explicitly modeling force uncertainties via an NLL objective is essential for reliable calibration, though it typically incurs a significant computational overhead. To address this, we validate an efficient protocol: full-model fine-tuning of a shallow ensemble originally trained with a probabilistic energy loss, or one sampled from the Laplace posterior. This approach results in negligible reduction in calibration quality compared to training from scratch, while reducing training time by up to 96%. We evaluate this protocol across a diverse range of materials, including amorphous carbon, ionic liquids (BMIM), liquid water (H$_2$O), barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$), and a model tetrapeptide (Ac-Ala3-NHMe), establishing practical guidelines for reliable uncertainty quantification in atomistic machine learning.</description>

      <title>Extending numerical simulations in SIMPSON: Electron paramagnetic resonance, dynamic nuclear polarisation, propagator splitting, pulse transients, and quadrupolar cross terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aimed at the simulation, design, and interpretation of advanced pulse experiments crossing the boundaries between nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), including the rapidly emerging, hybrid discipline of pulsed dynamic nuclear polarisation (DNP), we present a host of novel features in the widely used SIMPSON software package addressing these aspects. Along with this come new features for advanced pulse sequence evaluation in terms of propagator splitting, high-order spin operator cross terms, and pulse phase transients. These fundamental new tools are introduced in a C++-based next generation of the SIMPSON software, which improves calculations speed in some aspects, is better prepared for further developments, and facilitates easier community contributions to the open-source software package.</description>

      <title>Photoionization of temperature-controlled nanoparticles in a beam: Accurate and efficient determination of ionization energies and work functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A beam of free alkali metal nanoparticles is produced by a condensation source, passed through a thermalizing tube adjustable over a broad temperature range, and ionized by tunable light. High stability of the particle flux and an automated data acquisition routine allow efficient collection of photoionization yield curves. A careful fit of the data to the universal Fowler function makes it possible to obtain nanoparticle ionization energies, and from those, the metal work functions, with $\sim$0.2% precision. The experimental arrangement, nanoparticle thermalization rates, and ionization threshold analysis are described in detail. The use of ultrapure and temperature-controlled gas-phase nanoparticles facilitates the analysis of electronic properties, such as work functions, and of their interplay with thermal lattice dynamics.</description>

      <title>Temperature-dependent photoionization thresholds of alkali-metal nanoparticles reveal thermal expansion and the melting transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the photoionization of pure sodium and potassium nanoparticles isolated in a beam enabled an accurate determination of their work functions as a function of temperature. In addition to resolving and quantifying the initial gradual decrease of the work function with temperature, which is associated with thermal expansion, the experiment revealed that the work function then undergoes a distinct drop both in magnitude and in slope that signifies the onset of nanoparticle melting. This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value. This suppression aligns with predictions from the Gibbs-Thomson equation which describes finite-size phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Isotope effect in the work function of lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work functions of 7Li and 6Li metals have been measured as a function of temperature, by using photoionization of pure isolated metal nanoparticles in a beam. These data reveal a marked isotope effect in the temperature variation of these work functions. Furthermore, for both isotopes the curvature of this temperature variation is found to be significantly larger than may be ascribed purely to a change in the electron gas density. These findings enhance the characterization of lithium as a quantum material in which the interplay between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom is nontrivial, and call for a microscopic understanding beyond simple models. Additionally, the slope of the work function curves was observed to vanish in the low temperature limit, as had been predicted on the basis of the Third Law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Reactive Coarse Grained Force Field for Metal-Organic Frameworks applied to Modeling ZIF-8 Self-Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding the self-assembly mechanism of metal-organic frameworks is a crucial step in reducing trial-and-error tests in their synthesis protocols. Atomistic simulations have proven essential in revealing molecular-level features of MOF nucleation, but they still exhibit limitations in the simulation setups due to size constraints (inability of reaching realistic concentrations or exploring non-stoichiometric metal:ligand ratios). In this contribution, we develop a methodology to derive reactive coarse grained force fields based on multiscale coarse graining methods. We apply our novel methodology to the case of the archetypal zeolitic-imidazolate framework ZIF-8. Our coarse grained force field, which we call nb-CG-ZIF-FF, does not contain any explicit connectivity information, but learns the tetrahedral Zn-connectivity from many body correlations within an atomistic benchmark. nb-CG-ZIF-FF quantitatively reproduces the features of bulk, crystalline ZIF-8 as well as the structural evolution of pre-nucleation species in terms of Zn n-fold coordination populations from the atomistic benchmark. While the range of rings that are formed along the synthesis process are well captured by nb-CG-ZIF-FF, the model cannot exactly reproduce ring populations. Our reactive CG force field fitting approach can be applied to any MOF, opening new research avenues in modeling MOF formation, decomposition, defect dynamics and phase transition processes.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time for multiple searchers with finite speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the mean fastest first-passage time (fFPT) to an immobile target for an ensemble of $N$ independent finite-speed random searchers driven by dichotomous noise and described by the telegrapher's equation. In stark contrast to the well-studied case of Brownian particles -- for which the mean fFPT vanishes logarithmically with $N$ -- we uncover that the mean fFPT is bounded from below by the minimal ballistic travel time, with an exponentially fast convergence to this bound as $N \to \infty$. This behavior reveals a dramatic efficiency advantage of physically realistic, finite-speed searchers over Brownian ones and illustrates how diffusive macroscopic models may be conceptually misleading in predicting the short-time behavior of a physical system. We extend our analysis to anomalous diffusion generated by Riemann-Liouville-type dichotomous noises and find that target detection is more efficient in the superdiffusive regime, followed by normal and then subdiffusive regimes, in agreement with physical intuition and contrary to earlier predictions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the structural stability of ionized gold clusters of sizes ranging from 22 to 100 atoms, contrasting compact, cage and planar structures. While it is well known that neutral clusters in the upper part of this size range predominantly favor compact structures, our results reveal that positively ionized gold clusters exhibit structural transitions in which planar structures become energetically preferred once the charge is sufficiently large. In addition, we study the finite-temperature stability of the structures and find that thermodynamic effects further stabilize planar configurations relative to their compact counterparts. To explore the potential energy surface, we use the Minima Hopping algorithm combined with a machine-learned potential. Since the machine-learned potential does not apply to ionized clusters, we introduce a charge-correction term to incorporate Coulomb interactions and charge screening.</description>

Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.</description>

      <title>Initial Guesses for Multicomponent Mean-Field Methods: Assessment and New Developments</title>

Abstract: The convergence of self-consistent field equations in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital methods strongly depends on the choice of initial guesses for quantum nuclei. Although several such guesses have been proposed in the literature, a systematic comparison of their performance as well as attempts of constructing novel approximations based on model tasks of quantum mechanics were not reported to date. In this work, we address both issues by introducing novel nuclear initial guesses derived from the analytical solutions of the three-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and benchmarking them against existing approaches. We demonstrate that the isotropic variant of our guess outperforms existing approximations in nuclear-electronic orbital density functional theory calculations employing a simultaneous self-consistent field convergence protocol. Although our guess requires the computation of partial Hessians, we demonstrate that these can be evaluated with low-cost methods without affecting the accuracy of resulting protonic density matrices. Our results demonstrate that the proposed guess is robust and efficient and could provide a route to improved convergence in mean-field nuclear-electronic orbital computations.</description>

Abstract: Photoelectron-photoion coincidence momentum imaging has been performed to investigate excitation processes on dissociative ionization of OCS, OCS $\to$ OCS$^+$ + e$^-$ $\to$ OC + S$^+$ + e$^-$, in phase-locked $\omega + 2\omega$ intense laser fields. The electron kinetic energy spectra depend on coincidentally produced ion species, OCS$^+$ or S$^+$. The observed electron momentum distribution shows clear asymmetry along the laser polarization direction with a 2$\pi$-oscillation period as a function of the phase difference between the $\omega$ and $2\omega$ laser fields. The asymmetry of electron emission in the OCS$^+$ channel flips at the electron kinetic energy of 8.2 eV where the dominant scattering direction switches from forward to backward. In the S$^+$ channel, the asymmetry flips at the lower kinetic energy of 4.2 eV. In comparison with a classical trajectory Monte Carlo simulation, it has been clarified that this energy shift between the OCS$^+$ and S$^+$ channels corresponds to the excitation energy of the parent ion and that electron recollisional excitation takes place to form the fragment ion in intense laser fields.</description>
