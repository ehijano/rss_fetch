      <title>The Star Clusters As Links between galaxy Evolution and Star formation (SCALES) project I: Numerical method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar clusters are critical constituents within galaxies: they are the result of highest-density star formation, and through their spatially and temporally correlated feedback they regulate their host galaxy evolution. We present a novel numerical method to model star clusters as individual units of star formation using sink particles. In our method, star clusters grow via gas accretion and via merging with less massive clusters. We describe the implementation in the radiation hydrodynamics code GIZMO and run a large grid of marginally bound, turbulent clouds of $10^7~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ to explore the effect of modeling ingredients on the evolution of the clouds and the star clusters. We find both gas accretion and mergers to be critical processes to form star clusters of masses up to $\sim10^5$-$10^6~{\rm M}_{\odot}$, while ionising radiation is the main feedback mechanism regulating the growth of star clusters. The majority of our star clusters assemble their mass in $0.3$-$2.6~{\rm Myr}$, and the most massive ones take $\sim10~{\rm Myr}$. By removing high density gas by accretion, our sink-based cluster formation prescription allows the newly-formed star clusters to inject their stellar feedback in less dense environments. This makes feedback more efficient at ionising and disrupting the cloud than if we were to use a standard star formation approach, indicating that our numerical method is the missing critical step to model the interplay between star clusters and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Local Analogs of Primordial Galaxies: In Search of Intermediate Mass Black Holes with JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local low metallicity galaxies with signatures of possible accretion activity are ideal laboratories in which to search for the lowest mass black holes and study their impact on the host galaxy. Here we present the first JWST NIRSpec IFS observations of SDSS J120122.30+021108.3, a nearby ($z=0.00354$) extremely metal poor dwarf galaxy with no optical signatures of accretion activity but identified by WISE to have extremely red mid-infrared colors consistent with AGNs. We identify over one hundred lines between $\sim$ 1.7-5.2 microns, an unresolved nuclear continuum source with an extremely steep spectral slope consistent with hot dust from an AGN ($F_\nu \approx\nu^{-1.5}$), and a plethora of H I, He I, and H$_2$ lines, with no lines from heavier elements, CO or ice absorption features, or PAHs.Our observations reveal that the red WISE source arises exclusively from a bright central unresolved source ($&lt;$ 3pc) suggestive of an AGN, yet there are no He II lines or coronal lines identified in the spectrum, and, importantly, there is no evidence that the radiation field is harder in the nuclear source compared with surrounding regions. These observations can be explained with a young ($&lt;$ 5 Myr) nuclear star cluster with stellar mass $\sim3\times 10^4$ M$_\odot$ and a deeply embedded AGN with bolometric luminosity $\sim$ $2\times10^{41}$ ergs $^{-1}$. The implied black hole mass is $\sim$ 1450 M$_\odot$, based on the Eddington limit, roughly consistent with that expected based on extrapolations of black hole galaxy scaling relations derived for more massive black holes. Longer wavelength observations are crucial to confirm this scenario.</description>

      <title>The SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper Reverberation Mapping Project: Multi-Line Dynamical Modeling of a Highly Variable Active Galactic Nucleus with Decade-long Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present dynamical modeling of the broad-line region (BLR) for the highly variable AGN SDSS J141041.25+531849.0 ($z = 0.359$) using photometric and spectroscopic monitoring data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project and the SDSS-V Black Hole Mapper program, spanning from early 2013 to early 2023. We model the geometry and kinematics of the BLR in the H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and MgII, emission lines for three different time periods to measure the potential change of structure within the BLR across time and line species. We consistently find a moderately edge-on $(i_{\rm full-state} = 53.29^{\circ} \,{}^{+7.29}_{-6.55})$ thick-disk $(\theta_{\rm opn, \; full-state} = 54.86^{\circ} \,{}^{+5.83}_{-4.74})$ geometry for all BLRs, with a joint estimate for the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) for each of three time periods, yielding $\log_{10}(M_{\rm BH} / M_{\odot}) = 7.66^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ when using the full dataset. The inferred individual virial factor $f$ $\sim 1$ is significantly smaller than the average factor for a local sample of dynamically modeled AGNs. There is strong evidence for non-virial motion, with over $80\%$ of clouds on inflowing/outflowing orbits. We analyze the change in model parameters across emission lines, finding the radii of BLRs for the emission lines are consistent with the following relative sizes $R_{\rm H\beta} \lesssim R_{\rm MgII } \lesssim R_{\rm H\alpha}$. Comparing results across time, we find $R_{\rm low-state} \lesssim R_{\rm high-state}$, with the change in BLR size for H$\beta$, being more significant than for the other two lines. The data also reveal complex, time-evolving, and potentially transient dynamics of the BLR gas over decade-long timescales, encouraging for future dynamical modeling of fine-scale BLR kinematics.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Evidence Against the Bulge-Halo Conspiracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the internal mass structure of galaxies have observed a `conspiracy' between the dark matter and stellar components, with total (stars $+$ dark) density profiles showing remarkable regularity and low intrinsic scatter across various samples of galaxies at different redshifts. Such homogeneity suggests the dark and stellar components must somehow compensate for each other in order to produce such regular mass structures. We test the conspiracy using a sample of 22 galaxies from the `Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral field spectroscopy' (MAGPI) Survey that targets massive galaxies at $ z \sim 0.3$. We use resolved, 2D stellar kinematics with the Schwarzschild orbit-based modelling technique to recover intrinsic mass structures, shapes, and dark matter fractions. This work is the first implementation of the Schwarzschild modelling method on a sample of galaxies at a cosmologically significant redshift. We find that the variability of structure for combined mass (baryonic and dark) density profiles is greater than that of the stellar components alone. Furthermore, we find no significant correlation between enclosed dark matter fractions at the half-light radius and the stellar mass density structure. Rather, the total density profile slope, $\gamma_{\mathrm{tot}}$, strongly correlates with the dark matter fraction within the half-light radius, as $\gamma_{\mathrm{tot}} = (1.3 \pm 0.2) f_{\mathrm{DM}} - (2.44 \pm 0.04)$. Our results refute the bulge-halo conspiracy and suggest that stochastic processes dominate in the assembly of structure for massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Where Have All the Sulfur Atoms Gone? Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon as a Possible Sink for the Missing Sulfur in the Interstellar Medium. I. The C--S Band Strengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite its biogeneic and astrochemical importance, sulfur (S), the 10th most abundant element in the interstellar medium (ISM) with a total abundance of S/H~2.2E-5, largely remains undetected in molecular clouds. Even in the diffuse ISM where S was previously often believed to be fully in the gas phase, in recent years observational evidence has suggested that S may also be appreciably depleted from the gas. What might be the dominant S reservoir in the ISM remains unknown. Solid sulfides like MgS, FeS and SiS_2 are excluded as a major S reservoir due to the undetection of their expected infrared spectral bands in the ISM. In this work, we explore the potential role of sulfurated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules -- PAHs with sulfur heterocycles (PASHs) -- as a sink for the missing S. Utilizing density function theory, we compute the vibrational spectra of 18 representative PASH molecules. It is found that these molecules exhibit a prominent, C--S stretching band at ~10 micron and two relatively weak, C--S deformation bands at 15 and 25 micron that are not mixed with the nominal PAH bands at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3 and 12.7 micron If several parts per million of S (relative to H) are locked up in PAHs, the 10 micron C--S band would be detectable by Spitzer and JWST. To quantitatively explore the amount of S/H depleted in PASHs, detailed comparison of the infrared emission spectra of PASHs with the Spitzer and JWST observations is needed.</description>

      <title>Absence of High-mass Prestellar Cores in the Orion Giant Molecular Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental difference between "core-fed" and "clump-fed" star formation theories lies in the existence or absence of high-mass cores at the prestellar stage. However, only a handful of such cores have been observed. Here, different than previous search in distributed star formation regions in the Galactic plane, we search for high-mass prestellar cores in the Orion GMC, by observing the 7 most massive starless cores selected from previous deep continuum surveys. We present ALMA ACA Band 6 and Band 7 continuum and line observations toward the 7 cores, in which we identify 9 dense cores at both bands. The derived maximum core mass is less than 11 Msun, based on different dust temperatures. We find no high-mass prestellar cores in this sample, aligning with the results of previous surveys, thereby challenging the existence of such cores in Orion. Outside Orion, further detailed studies are needed for remaining high-mass prestellar core candidates to confirm their status as massive, starless cores.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-dark matter connection from weak lensing in imaging surveys: Impact of photometric redshift errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainties in photometric redshifts and stellar masses from imaging surveys affect galaxy sample selection, their abundance measurements, as well as the measured weak lensing signals. We develop a framework to assess the systematic effects arising from the use of redshifts and stellar masses derived from photometric data, and explore their impact on the inferred galaxy-dark matter connection. We use galaxy catalogues from the UniverseMachine (UM) galaxy formation model to create Pz-mock galaxy samples that approximately follow the redshift errors in the Subaru HSC survey. We focus on galaxy stellar-mass thresholds ranging from $\log\left[M_*/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]$ from $8.6$ to $11.2$ in steps of 0.2 dex within two redshift bins $0.30-0.55$ and $0.55-0.80$. A comparison of the Pz-mock samples to true galaxy samples in UM shows a relatively mild sample contamination for thresholds with $\log\left[M_{*,\rm limit}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]&lt;10.6$, while an increasing contamination towards the more massive end. We show how such contamination affects the measured abundance and the lensing signal. A joint HOD modelling of the observables from the Pz-mock compared to the truth in the UM informs the systematic biases on the average halo masses of central galaxies in the HSC survey. Even with a reasonably conservative choice of photo-$z$ errors in Pz-mock, we show that the inferred halo masses deduced from the HSC galaxies for low-mass thresholds will have a systematic bias smaller than 0.05 dex. Beyond $\log\left[M_{*,\rm limit}/(h^{-2}M_\odot)\right]=10.6$, the inferred halo masses show an increasing systematic bias with stellar mass, reaching values of order $0.2$ dex, larger than the statistical error.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Outflow in Orion-KL Source I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ALMA observations of SiO, SiS, H$_2$O , NaCl, and SO line emission at ~30 to 50 mas resolution. These images map the molecular outflow and disk of Orion Source I (SrcI) on ~12 to 20 AU scales. Our observations show that the flow of material around SrcI creates a turbulent boundary layer in the outflow from SrcI which may dissipate angular momentum in the rotating molecular outflow into the surrounding medium. Additionally, the data suggests that the proper motion of SrcI may have a significant effect on the structure and evolution of SrcI and its molecular outflow. As the motion of SrcI funnels material between the disk and the outflow, some material may be entrained into the outflow and accrete onto the disk, creating shocks which excite the NaCl close to the disk surface.</description>

      <title>Galactic Gas Models Strongly Affect the Determination of the Diffusive Halo Height</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The height of the Milky Way diffusion halo, above which cosmic-rays can freely escape the galaxy, is among the most critical, yet poorly known, parameters in cosmic-ray physics. Measurements of radioactive secondaries, such as $^{10}$Be or $^{26}$Al, which decay equivalently throughout the diffusive volume, are expected to provide the strongest constraints. This has motivated significant observational work to constrain their isotopic ratios, along with theoretical work to constrain the cross-section uncertainties that are thought to dominate radioactive secondary fluxes. In this work, we show that the imprecise modelling of the Milky Way spiral arms significantly affects our ability to translate $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes into constraints on the diffusive halo height, biasing our current results. Utilizing state-of-the-art spiral arms models we produce new predictions for the $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes that motivate upcoming measurements by AMS-02 and HELIX.</description>

      <title>The evolving role of astrophysical modelling in dark matter halo relaxation response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the change in the radial distribution of dark matter within haloes in response to baryonic astrophysical processes in galaxies at different epochs, investigating the role of astrophysical modeling in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations in producing the response. We find that the linear quasi-adiabatic relaxation with additional dependence on the halo-centric distance provides a good description not only at $z=0$, but also at an earlier epoch ($z=1$) in the IllustrisTNG simulation suite, with parameters being more universal across a much larger variety of haloes at $z=1$ than at $z=0$. Through systematic analysis of a large collection of simulations from the CAMELS project, we find that the baryonic prescriptions for both AGN and stellar feedbacks have a strong influence on the relaxation response of the dark matter halo. In particular, only the parameters controlling the overall feedback energy flux have an effect on the relaxation response, while the wind speed and burstiness have negligible effect on the relaxation at a fixed amount of energy flux. However, the exact role of these parameters on the relaxation depends on the redshift. We also study the role of a variety of baryonic astrophysical processes through the EAGLE physics variation simulations. While these depict a similar picture regarding the importance of feedback effects, they also reveal that the gas equation of state has one of the strongest influences on the relaxation response, consistent with the expectation from self-similar analyses.</description>

      <title>Optical observations of the Galactic SNR HB9 and H II region G159.2+3.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We present multi-wavelength observations of the Galactic SNR HB9 and the H II region G159.2+3.3 apparently projected nearby, in order to study their properties and potential physical connections. Results. HB9 is bright in $\gamma$-rays, but the $\gamma$-ray morphology is centrally filled and most of it is not clearly associated with the surrounding molecular clouds. There is a weak apparent connection of HB9 to the IR bright enclosing shell of G159.2+3.3 in $\gamma$-ray. The diffuse Balmer line has almost identical morphology as the radio emission in G159.2+3.3, indicating they two are thermal in origin. Using medium-band high-resolution optical spectra from selected regions of the southeast (SE) shell of HB9 and G159.2+3.3, we found the radial velocity dispersion of HB9 along the slit is significantly higher than the FWHM of the lines. In contrast, these two values are both smaller and comparable to each other in G159.2+3.3. This indicates that the gas in HB9 may have additional global motion triggered by the SNR shock. The [N II] $\lambda$6583A/H$\alpha$ line ratio of both objects can be interpreted with photo-ionisation by hot stars or low velocity shocks, except for the post-shock region in the SE shell of HB9, where the elevated [N II]/H$\alpha$ line ratio suggests contribution from shock ionisation. The measured electron density from the [S II] 6716/6730 line ratio is significantly lower in the brighter G159.2+3.3 compared to the SE shell of HB9. Conclusions. Our density estimate suggests that G159.2+3.3, although appearing brighter and more compact, is likely located at a much larger distance than HB9, so the two objects have no physical connections, unless the shock compressed gas in HB9 has a significantly lower filling factor.</description>

      <title>A combined study of thermohaline mixing and envelope overshooting with PARSEC: Calibration to NGC 6397 and M4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermohaline mixing is one of the main processes in low-mass red giant stars that affect the transport of chemicals and, thus, the surface abundances along the evolution. The interplay of thermohaline mixing with other processes, such as the downward overshooting from the convective envelope, should be carefully investigated. This study aims to understand the combined effects of thermohaline mixing and envelope overshooting. After implementing the thermohaline mixing process in the \textsc{parsec} stellar evolutionary code, we compute tracks and isochrones (with \textsc{trilegal} code) and compare them with observational data. To constrain the efficiencies of both processes, we perform a detailed modelling that is suitable for globular clusters NGC 6397 and M4. Our results indicate that an envelope overshooting efficiency parameter, $\Lambda_\mathrm{e}=0.6$, and a thermohaline efficiency parameter, $\alpha_\mathrm{th}=50$, are necessary to reproduce the RGB bump magnitudes and lithium abundances observed in these clusters. We find that both envelope overshooting and thermohaline mixing have a significant impact on the variation of $^7$Li abundances. Additionally, we also explore the effects of adopting solar-scaled or $\alpha$-enhanced mixtures on our models. The $^{12}$C and the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio are also effective indicators to probe extra mixing in RGB stars. Although, their usefulness is currently limited by the lack of precise and accurate C-isotopes abundances.</description>

      <title>The influence of baryons on low-mass haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Voids-within-Voids-within-Voids (VVV) project used dark-matter-only simulations to study the abundance and structure of dark matter haloes over the full mass range populated in the standard $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ cosmology. Here we explore how baryonic effects modify these results for $z=0$ halo masses in the range $10^4$ to $10^7~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, below the threshold for galaxy formation. Our main study focuses on three simulations from identical initial conditions at $z=127$, one following dark matter only, one including non-radiative gas, and one additionally including the baryonic physics relevant in this halo mass range (cooling and photoheating). In the non-radiative simulation, above $10^{5.5}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$, halo abundance and internal structure are very similar to the dark-matter-only simulation, and the baryon to dark matter ratio is everywhere close to the cosmic value. At lower mass, this ratio drops and haloes are less concentrated and less massive in the non-radiative case. Test simulations at higher resolution show this to be mainly a resolution effect; the expected drop in baryon content due to residual pressure effects only becomes substantial for $z=0$ haloes below $\sim 10^{2.7}~\mathrm{M_\odot}$. However, gas is heated by reionization at $z=6$ in our "full physics" run, and this results in almost complete expulsion of gas from all haloes in our simulated mass range. This suppresses the halo mass function by $\sim 30 \%$, lowers halo concentration, and consequently weakens the dark matter annihilation signal by $\sim 40-60 \%$.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: Detection of Wolf-Rayet stars injecting nitrogen into a low-metallicity, $z=2.37$ proto-globular cluster leaking ionizing photons</title>

Abstract: We report the detection of a population of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars in the Sunburst Arc, a strongly gravitationally lensed galaxy at redshift $z=2.37$. As the brightest known lensed galaxy, the Sunburst Arc has become an important cosmic laboratory for studying star and cluster formation, Lyman $\alpha$ radiative transfer, and Lyman Continuum (LyC) escape. Here, we present the first results of JWST/NIRSpec IFU observations of the Sunburst Arc, focusing on a stacked spectrum of the 12-fold imaged LyC-emitting (Sunburst LCE) cluster. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the cluster is massive and compact, with $M_{\text{dyn}} = (9\pm1) \times 10^{6} M_{\odot}$, Our age estimate of 4.2--4.5 Myr is much larger than the crossing time of $t_{\text{cross}} = 183 \pm 9 $ kyr, indicating that the cluster is dynamically evolved and consistent with being gravitationally bound. We find a significant nitrogen enhancement of the low ionization state ISM, with $\log(N/O) = -0.74 \pm 0.09$, which is $\approx 0.8$ dex above typical values for H II regions of similar metallicity in the local Universe. We find broad stellar emission complexes around He II$\lambda 4686$ and C IV$\lambda 5808$ with associated nitrogen emission -- this is the first time WR signatures have been directly observed at redshifts above $\sim 0.5$. The strength of the WR signatures cannot be reproduced by stellar population models that only include single-star evolution. While models with binary evolution better match the WR features, they still struggle to reproduce the nitrogen-enhanced WR features. JWST reveals the Sunburst LCE to be a highly ionized, proto-globular cluster with low oxygen abundance and extreme nitrogen enhancement that hosts a population of Wolf-Rayet stars, and possibly Very Massive stars (VMSs), which are rapidly enriching the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Tidal mass loss in the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy through N-body simulations with Gaia EDR3-based orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) represents a challenge for some globular cluster (GC) formation models, because an exceptionally high fraction of its stellar mass is locked in its GC system. In order to shed light on our understanding of GC formation, we aim to constrain the amount of stellar mass that Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW). Exploiting the flexibility of effective multi-component $N$-body simulations and relying on state-of-the-art estimates of Fornax's orbital parameters, we study the evolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally justified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr. We find that, though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of stellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most eccentric orbit considered. We conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal stripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass of the GC system of the Fornax dSph and we discuss quantitatively the implications for GC formation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Why artificial disruption is not a concern for current cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that cold dark matter subhalos are hard to disrupt and almost all cases of subhalo disruption observed in numerical simulations are due to numerical effects. However, these findings primarily relied on idealized numerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of subhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the Aquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of surviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition channels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted after redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial disruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos accreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos experience pre-processing and many of them are accreted through major mergers at high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high mass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and semi-analytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid disappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these subhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate that they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end of the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art cosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scale of the energy spectrum define a characteristic scale, which can be regarded as the integral scale of turbulence, and the Nyquist wavenumber can be regarded as the dissipation scale. With these two characteristic scales, the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum's exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.</description>

      <title>eROSITA (eRASS1) study of the Canis Major overdensity: Developing a multi-wavelength algorithm for classifying faint X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the data of eROSITA (extended Roentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array) on board Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (Spektr-RG, SRG) taken during the first eROSITA all-sky survey (eRASS1), we perform the first X-ray classification and population study in the field of Canis Major overdensity (CMa OD), which is an elliptical-shaped stellar overdensity located at l = -240, b = -80. The study aims to identify the X-ray sources in CMa OD. For this purpose, we developed a classification algorithm using multi-wavelength criteria as a preliminary method for the classification of faint X-ray sources, specifically in regions with a high source number density. Out of a total number of 8311 X-ray sources, we have classified 1029 sources as Galactic stars and binaries in the foreground, 946 sources as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and galaxies in the background, and 435 sources with stellar counterparts, which can belong to either the MW or CMa OD. Among the sources with a stellar counterpart, we have identified 34 symbiotic star candidates, plus 335 sources, of which the infrared counterparts have properties of M-giants in CMa OD. Moreover, there is a known high-mass X-ray binary (HMXB, 4U 0728-25) in the field of our study, which, according to the Gaia parallax of its companion, seems to be a member of CMa OD. There is also a recently detected transient low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB, SRGt J071522.1-191609), which can be a member of CMa OD based on its companion that is most likely highly absorbed and is thus located behind the Galactic disk. In addition, we present the X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of members and candidate members of CMa OD. It is dominated by sources with luminosities of &lt; 2*10^32-10^33 erg/s in the energy range of 0.2-2.3 keV, which are expected to be either accreting white dwarfs or quiescent LMXBs.</description>

      <title>A Dust-Scattering Model for M1-92: A Revised Estimate of the Mass Distribution and Inclination</title>

Abstract: Preplanetary nebulae (PPNe) are formed from mass-ejecting late-stage AGB stars. Much of the light from the star gets scattered or absorbed by dust particles, giving rise to the observed reflection nebula seen at visible and near-IR wavelengths. Precursors to planetary nebulae (PNe), PPNe generally have not yet undergone any ionization by UV radiation from the still-buried stellar core. Bipolar PPNe are a common form of observed PPNe. This study lays the groundwork for future dynamical studies by reconstructing the dust density distribution of a particularly symmetric bipolar PPN, M1-92 (Minkowski's Footprint, IRAS 19343$+$2926). For this purpose, we develop an efficient single-scattering radiative transfer model with corrections for double-scattering. Using a V-band image from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), we infer the dust density profile and orientation of M1-92. These results indicate that M1-92's slowly expanding equatorial torus exhibits an outer radial cutoff in its density, which implicates the influence of a binary companion during the formation of the nebula.</description>

      <title>A new quantization scheme of black holes in effective loop quantum gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loop quantum cosmology has achieved great successes, in which the polymerization plays a crucial role. In particular, the phase-space-variable dependent polymerization turns out to be the unique one that leads to consistent quantization of the homogeneous and isotropic universe. However, when applying the same scheme to the quantization of black holes, it meets resistances, when the Kantowski-Sachs (KS) gauge is adopted. In this paper, we continue to study the quantum effects of the polymerization near the location that a classical black hole horizon used to be, from the point of view of effective loop quantum gravity in the KS gauge. In particular, we find a phase-space-variable dependent polymerization scheme that leads to negligible quantum effects near the location of the classical black hole horizon, but significantly alters the spacetime structure near the origin, so that the classical singularity is finally replaced by a finite and regular transition surface. The final geodesically-complete spacetime consists of the regular transition surface that connects a black hole in one side and an anti-trapped region in the other side. In the anti-trapped region, no white hole horizons are found and the spacetime is extended to infinity, at which the geometric radius of the two-spheres becomes infinitely large.</description>
