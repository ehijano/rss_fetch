      <title>ChemicHull: an online tool for determining extremal chemical graphs of maximum degree at most 3 for any degree-based topological indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological indices are graph-theoretic descriptors that play a crucial role in mathematical chemistry, capturing the structural characteristics of molecules and enabling the prediction of their physicochemical properties. A widely studied category of topological indices, known as degree-based topological indices, are calculated as the sum of the weights of a graph's edges, where each edge weight is determined by a formula that depends solely on the degrees of its endpoints.
  This work focuses exclusively on chemical graphs in which no vertex has a degree greater than 3, a model for conjugated systems. Within a polyhedral framework, each chemical graph is mapped to a point in a three-dimensional space, enabling extremal values of any degree-based topological index to be determined through linear optimization over the corresponding polyhedron. Analysis within this framework reveals that extremality is limited to a small subset of chemical graph families, implying that certain chemical graphs can never attain extremality for any degree-based topological index.
  The main objective of this paper is to present ChemicHull, an online tool we have developed to determine and display extremal chemical graphs for arbitrary degree-based topological indices. To illustrate the power of this tool, we easily recover established results, emphasizing its effectiveness for chemically significant graph classes such as chemical trees and unicyclic chemical graphs. This tool also enabled the identification of a counterexample to a previously published extremal result concerning the Randi\'c index.</description>

      <title>Enumeration With Nice Roman Domination Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Extension Perfect Roman Domination is NP-complete, all minimal (with respect to the pointwise order) perfect Roman dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay. This algorithm uses a bijection between minimal perfect Roman dominating functions and Roman dominating functions and the fact that all minimal Roman dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay. This bijection considers the set of vertices with value 2 under the functions. In this paper, we will generalize this idea by defining so called nice Roman Domination properties for which we can employ this method. With this idea, we can show that all minimal maximal Roman Dominating functions can be enumerated with polynomial delay in O(1.9332^n) time. Furthermore, we prove that enumerating all minimal connected/total Roman dominating functions on cobipartite graphs can be achieved with polynomial delay. Additionally, we show the existence of a polynomial-delay algorithm for enumerating all minimal connected Roman dominating function on interval graphs. We show some downsides to this method as well.</description>

      <title>3-colorable planar graphs have an intersection segment representation using 3 slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his PhD Thesis, E.R. Scheinerman conjectured that planar graphs are intersection graphs of line segments in the plane. This conjecture was proved with two different approaches by J. Chalopin and the author, and by the author, L. Isenmann, and C. Pennarun. In the case of 3-colorable planar graphs E.R. Scheinerman conjectured that it is possible to restrict the set of slopes used by the segments to only 3 slopes. Here we prove this conjecture by using an approach introduced by S. Felsner to deal with contact representations of planar graphs with homothetic triangles.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Cooperative Optimization of a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a parallel shared-memory schema to cooperatively optimize the solution of a Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem instance with minimal synchronization effort and without the need for an explicit decomposition. To this end, we design FILO2$^x$ as a single-trajectory parallel adaptation of the FILO2 algorithm originally proposed for extremely large-scale instances and described in Accorsi and Vigo (2024). Using the locality of the FILO2 optimization applications, in FILO2$^x$ several possibly unrelated solution areas are concurrently asynchronously optimized. The overall search trajectory emerges as an iteration-based parallelism obtained by the simultaneous optimization of the same underlying solution performed by several solvers. Despite the high efficiency exhibited by the single-threaded FILO2 algorithm, the computational results show that, by better exploiting the available computing resources, FILO2$^x$ can greatly enhance the resolution time compared to the original approach, still maintaining a similar final solution quality for instances ranging from hundreds to hundreds of thousands customers.</description>

      <title>Non-dissective coverings by planks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A plank is the part of space between two parallel planes. The following open problem, posed 45 years ago, can be viwed as the converse of Tarski's plank problem (Bang's theorem): Is it true that if the total width of a collection of planks is sufficiently large, then the planks can be individually translated to cover a unit ball $B$?
  A translative covering of $B$ by planks is said to be non-dissective if the planks can be added one by one, in some order, such that the uncovered part remains connected at each step, and is empty at the end. Improving a classical result of Groemer, we show that every set of $C/\epsilon^{7/4}$ planks of width $\epsilon$ admits a non-dissective translative covering of $B$, provided $C$ is large enough. Our proof yields a low-complexity algorithm. We also establish the first nontrivial lower bound of $c/\epsilon^{4/3}$ for this quantity.</description>

      <title>Greedy Algorithms for Shortcut Sets and Hopsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the power of greedy algorithms for hopsets and shortcut sets. In particular, we propose simple greedy algorithms that, given an input graph $G$ and a parameter $\beta$, compute a shortcut set or an exact hopset $H$ of hopbound at most $\beta$, and we prove the following guarantees about the size $|H|$ of the output:
  For shortcut sets, we prove the bound $$|H| \le \tilde{O}\left( \frac{n^2}{\beta^3} + \frac{n^{3/2}}{\beta^{3/2}} \right).$$ This matches the current state-of-the-art upper bound by Kogan and Parter [SODA '22].
  For exact hopsets of $n$-node, $m$-edge weighted graphs, the size of the output hopset is existentially optimal up to subpolynomial factors, under some technical assumptions.
  Despite their simplicity and conceptual implications, these greedy algorithms are slower than existing sampling-based approaches. Our second set of results focus on faster deterministic algorithms that are based on a certain greedy set cover approximation algorithm on paths in the transitive closure. One consequence is a deterministic algorithm that takes $O(mn^{2/3})$ time to compute a shortcut set of size $\tilde{O}(n)$ and hopbound $O(n^{1/3})$.</description>

      <title>From data to concepts via wiring diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A wiring diagram is a labeled directed graph that represents an abstract concept such as a temporal process. In this article, we introduce the notion of a quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graph, and prove that quasi-skeleton wiring diagram graphs correspond to Hasse diagrams. Using this result, we designed algorithms that extract wiring diagrams from sequential data. We used our algorithms in analyzing the behavior of an autonomous agent playing a computer game, and the algorithms correctly identified the winning strategies. We compared the performance of our main algorithm with two other algorithms based on standard clustering techniques (DBSCAN and agglomerative hierarchical), including when some of the data was perturbed. Overall, this article brings together techniques in category theory, graph theory, clustering, reinforcement learning, and data engineering.</description>

      <title>Acyclic dichromatic number of oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}(D)$ of a digraph $D=(V,A)$ is the minimum number of sets in a partition $V_1,\ldots{},V_k$ of $V$ into $k$ subsets so that the induced subdigraph $D[V_i]$ is acyclic for each $i\in [k]$. This is a generalization of the chromatic number for undirected graphs as a graph has chromatic number at most $k$ if and only if the complete biorientation of $G$ (replace each edge by a directed 2-cycle) has dichromatic number at most $k$. In this paper we introduce the acyclic dichromatic number $\vec{\chi}_{\rm a}(D)$ of a digraph $D$ as the minimum number of sets in a partition $V_1,\ldots{},V_k$ of $V$ so that the induced subdigraph $D[V_i]$ is acyclic for each $i\in [k]$ and each of the bipartite induced subdigraphs $D[V_i,V_j]$ is acyclic for each $1\leq i&lt;j\leq k$. This parameter, which resembles the definition of acyclic chromatic number for undirected graphs, has apparently not been studied before.
  We derive a number of results which display the difference between the dichromatic number and the acyclic dichromatic number, in particular, there are digraphs $D$ with arbitrarily large $\vec{\chi}_{\rm a}(D)-\vec{\chi}(D)$, even among tournaments with dichromatic number 2 and bipartite tournaments (where the dichromatic number is always 2). We prove several complexity results, including that deciding whether $\vec{\chi}_{\rm a}(D)\leq 2$ is NP-complete already for bipartite digraphs, while it is polynomial for tournaments (contrary to the case for dichromatic number). We also generalize the concept of heroes of a tournament to acyclic heroes of tournaments.</description>

      <title>Intersecting families with covering number $3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02621v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A covering number of a family is the size of the smallest set that intersects all sets from the family. In 1978 Frankl determined for $n\ge n_0(k)$ the largest intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ with covering number $3$. In this paper, we essentially settle this problem, showing that the same family is extremal for any $k\ge 100$ and $n&gt;2k$.</description>

      <title>Large Induced Subgraphs of Bounded Degree in Outerplanar and Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14784v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following question. Let $\mathcal G$ be a family of planar graphs and let $k\geq 3$ be an integer. What is the largest value $f_k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph in $\mathcal G$ has an induced subgraph with degree at most $k$ and with $f_k(n)$ vertices? Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs or the class of the planar graphs. In both cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\frac{5n}{13}&gt;0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)&lt;0.572n+O(1)$ vertices.</description>
