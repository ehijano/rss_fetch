      <title>Discovering Motifs to Fingerprint Multi-Layer Networks: a Case Study on the Connectome of C. Elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motif discovery is a powerful and insightful method to quantify network structures and explore their function. As a case study, we present a comprehensive analysis of regulatory motifs in the connectome of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans). Leveraging the Efficient Subgraph Counting Algorithmic PackagE (ESCAPE) algorithm, we identify network motifs in the multi-layer nervous system of C. elegans and link them to functional circuits. We further investigate motif enrichment within signal pathways and benchmark our findings with random networks of similar size and link density. Our findings provide valuable insights into the organization of the nerve net of this well documented organism and can be easily transferred to other species and disciplines alike.</description>

      <title>Beyond Earthly Limits: Protection against Cosmic Radiation through Biological Response Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upcoming phase of space exploration not only includes trips to Mars and beyond, but also holds great promise for human progress. However, the harm caused by cosmic radiation, consisting of Galactic Cosmic Rays and Solar Particle Events, is an important safety concern for astronauts and other living things that will accompany them. Research exploring the biological effects of cosmic radiation includes experiments conducted in space itself and in simulated space environments on Earth. Notably, NASA's Space Radiation Laboratory has taken significant steps forward in simulating cosmic radiation by using particle accelerators and is currently pioneering the progress in this field. Curiously, much of the research emphasis thus far has been on understanding how cosmic radiation impacts living organisms, instead of finding ways to help them resist the radiation. In this paper, we briefly talk about current research on the biological effects of cosmic radiation and propose possible protective measures through biological interventions. In our opinion, biological response pathways responsible for coping with stressors on Earth can provide effective solutions for protection against the stress caused by cosmic radiation. We also recommend establishing the Dedicated International Accelerator Laboratory for Space Travel related radiation research (DIAL-ST) to advance this field and evaluate protective biological pathways through particle accelerator experiments simulating cosmic radiation.</description>
