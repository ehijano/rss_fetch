      <title>On the anisotropic velocity distribution of newborn pickup ions in the heliosheath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the velocity distribution of pickup ions is crucial for understanding the energetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes observed by Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). Pickup ions in the heliosheath contain two main components: those transmitted across the heliospheric termination shock and those locally created within the heliosheath. In this work, we discuss the velocity distribution of the latter locally created component. We find that pickup ions created by the charge exchange of neutral solar wind may be a significant source of the observed ENA fluxes between about 100 eV and 1 keV. Moreover, newborn pickup ions can maintain highly anisotropic velocity distribution in the heliosheath. This is because the kinetic instabilities are weak after the solar wind flow decelerates at the termination shock. Hybrid kinetic simulations show the mirror instability to be the dominant mode for conditions in the heliosheath close to the termination shock. We estimate that effects of neutral solar wind and anisotropy may enhance the expected phase space density of newborn pickup ions by more than a factor of 100.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Airfoil Design Using Neural Network Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, prediction of airfoil shape from targeted pressure distribution (suction and pressure sides) and vice versa is demonstrated using both Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) techniques. The dataset is generated for 1600 airfoil shapes, with simulations carried out at Reynolds numbers (Re) ranging from 10,000 and 90,00,000 and angles of attack (AoA) ranging from 0 to 15 degrees, ensuring the dataset captured diverse aerodynamic conditions. Five different CNN and DNN models are developed depending on the input/output parameters. Results demonstrate that the refined models exhibit improved efficiency, with the DNN model achieving a multi-fold reduction in training time compared to the CNN model for complex datasets consisting of varying airfoil, Re, and AoA. The predicted airfoil shapes/pressure distribution closely match the targeted values, validating the effectiveness of deep learning frameworks. However, the performance of CNN models is found to be better compared to DNN models. Lastly, a flying wing aircraft model of wingspan &gt;10 m is considered for the prediction of pressure distribution along the chordwise. The proposed CNN and DNN models show promising results. This research underscores the potential of deep learning models accelerating aerodynamic optimization and advancing the design of high-performance airfoils.</description>

      <title>Temporal Correlation between Positive-Charged Cosmic Ray Flux and Solar Polar Field Variation: Insights from Delayed Modulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the time-dependent modulation of galactic cosmic rays near Earth, with a focus on the cosmic proton flux and polar field. Using data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) and the Wilcox Solar Observatory, we identify a significant time-lagged relationship between the observation of two missions. Our model incorporates a weighted magnetic field parameter to address the hemispheric asymmetry in polar fields and captures the temporal evolution of cosmic-ray proton spectra in relation to solar activity. We find a time lag of approximately 10 months, varying with cosmic ray rigidity. At 1 GV, the time lag is 360 days, while it is 300 days above 3 GV. A potential mechanism is proposed to explain the observed time-lagged relationship and its dependence on cosmic ray rigidity. This offers predictive insights into cosmic ray modulation within the heliosphere. These results enhance the accuracy of space weather forecasting models, with significant implications for the safety of space missions and aviation.</description>
