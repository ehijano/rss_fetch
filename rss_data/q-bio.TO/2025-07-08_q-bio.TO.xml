      <title>Design and optimization of in situ self-functionalizing stress sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical forces are crucial regulators of diverse biological processes, yet their in vivo measurement remains challenging due to limitations of current techniques, that can be destructive or require complex dedicated setups. This study introduces a novel class of biocompatible, self-functionalizing stress sensors based on inverted emulsions, that can be used to measure mechanical stresses inside tissues but can also locally perturb the biological environment through specific binder presentation or drug delivery. We engineered an optimal design for these inverted emulsions, focusing on finding the perfect balance between the two contradictory constraints: achieving low surface tension for deformability while maintaining emulsion instability for efficient self-functionalization and drug release. Proof-of-concept experiments in both agarose gels and complex biological systems, including brain organoids and zebrafish embryos, confirm the droplets ability to deform in response to mechanical stress applied on the tissue, to self-functionalize and to release encapsulated molecules locally. These versatile sensors offer a method for non-invasive stress measurements and targeted chemical delivery within living biological tissues, overcoming current technical barriers in biophysical measurements.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the CoW with the TopCoW Challenge: Topology-Aware Anatomical Segmentation of the Circle of Willis for CTA and MRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is an important network of arteries connecting major circulations of the brain. Its vascular architecture is believed to affect the risk, severity, and clinical outcome of serious neurovascular diseases. However, characterizing the highly variable CoW anatomy is still a manual and time-consuming expert task. The CoW is usually imaged by two non-invasive angiographic imaging modalities, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and computed tomography angiography (CTA), but there exist limited datasets with annotations on CoW anatomy, especially for CTA. Therefore, we organized the TopCoW challenge with the release of an annotated CoW dataset. The TopCoW dataset is the first public dataset with voxel-level annotations for 13 CoW vessel components, enabled by virtual reality technology. It is also the first large dataset using 200 pairs of MRA and CTA from the same patients. As part of the benchmark, we invited submissions worldwide and attracted over 250 registered participants from six continents. The submissions were evaluated on both internal and external test datasets of 226 scans from over five centers. The top performing teams achieved over 90% Dice scores at segmenting the CoW components, over 80% F1 scores at detecting key CoW components, and over 70% balanced accuracy at classifying CoW variants for nearly all test sets. The best algorithms also showed clinical potential in classifying fetal-type posterior cerebral artery and locating aneurysms with CoW anatomy. TopCoW demonstrated the utility and versatility of CoW segmentation algorithms for a wide range of downstream clinical applications with explainability. The annotated datasets and best performing algorithms have been released as public Zenodo records to foster further methodological development and clinical tool building.</description>
