      <title>2-Segal maps associated to a category with cofibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waldhausen's $S_\bullet$-construction gives a way to define the algebraic $K$-theory space of a category with cofibrations. Specifically, the $K$-theory space of a category with cofibrations $\mathcal{C}$ can be defined as the loop space of the realization of the simplicial topological space $|iS_\bullet \mathcal{C} |$. Dyckerhoff and Kapranov observed that if $\mathcal{C}$ is chosen to be a proto-exact category, then this simplicial topological space is 2-Segal. A natural question is then what variants of this $S_\bullet$-construction give 2-Segal spaces. We find that for $|iS_\bullet \mathcal{C}|$, $S_\bullet\mathcal{C}$, $wS_\bullet\mathcal{C}$, and the simplicial set whose $n$th level is the set of isomorphism classes of $S_\bullet\mathcal{C}$, there are certain $2$-Segal maps which are always equivalences. However for all of these simplicial objects, none of the rest of the $2$-Segal maps have to be equivalences. We also reduce the question of whether $|wS_\bullet \mathcal{C}|$ is $2$-Segal in nice cases to the question of whether a simpler simplicial space is $2$-Segal. Additionally, we give a sufficient condition for $S_\bullet \mathcal{C}$ to be $2$-Segal. Along the way we introduce the notion of a generated category with cofibrations and provide an example where the levelwise realization of a simplicial category which is not $2$-Segal is $2$-Segal.</description>

      <title>On Iterated Integral on Simplicial Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simplicial analogy of Chen's iterated integral was introduced in another paper. However, its properties were hardly investigated in the paper. In particular, no mention is made of whether it coincides with Chen's iterated integral as a special case. In this paper, we answer this question. This paper consists of two main parts. One of them is the research of elementary properties of simplicial iterated integral. In particular, we describe a relationship between iterated integral and homotopy pullback. The other one is a comparison of Chen's iterated integral and simplicial iterated integral. At the end of this paper, we observe Chen's theorem and Hain's theorem which connects rational homotopy groups and (co)homologies of a smooth manifold, and give an infinity-categorical viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Non-Formality of $S^2$ via the free loop space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $E_1$-equivalence $C^\bullet(S^2) \simeq H^\bullet(S^2)$ does not intertwine the inclusion of constant loops into the free loop space $S^2 \to LS^2$. That is, the isomorphism $HH_\bullet(H^\bullet(S^2)) \cong H^\bullet(LS^2)$ does not preserve the obvious maps to $H^\bullet(S^2)$ that exist on both sides. We give an explicit computation of the defect in terms of the $E_\infty$-structure on $C^\bullet(S^2)$. Finally, we relate our calculation to recent work of Poirier-Tradler on the string topology of $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Hopf algebras in the cohomology of $\mathcal{A}_g$, $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$, and $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a bigraded cocommutative Hopf algebra structure on the weight zero compactly supported rational cohomology of the moduli space of principally polarized abelian varieties. By relating the primitives for the coproduct to graph cohomology, we deduce that $\dim H^{2g+k}_c(\mathcal{A}_g)$ grows at least exponentially with $g$ for $k = 0$ and for all but finitely many positive integers $k$. Our proof relies on a new result of independent interest; we use a filtered variant of the Waldhausen construction to show that Quillen's spectral sequence abutting to the cohomology of $BK(\mathbb{Z})$ is a spectral sequence of Hopf algebras. From the same construction, we also deduce that $\dim H^{\binom{n}{2} - n - k}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}))$ grows at least exponentially with $n$, for $k = -1$ and for all but finitely many non-negative integers $k$.</description>

      <title>The Wu relations in real algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and study relations between Chern classes and Galois cohomology classes in the Gal(C/R)-equivariant cohomology of real algebraic varieties with no real points. We give applications to the topology of their sets of complex points, and to sums of squares problems. In particular, we show that -1 is a sum of 2 squares in the function field of any smooth projective real algebraic surface with no real points and with vanishing geometric genus, as well as higher-dimensional generalizations of this result.</description>

      <title>K-theory and lozalizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the mapping class group is not an $h$-cobordism invariant of high-dimensional manifolds by exhibiting $h$-cobordant manifolds whose mapping class groups have different cardinalities. In order to do so, we introduce a moduli space of "$h$-block" bundles and understand its difference with the moduli space of ordinary block bundles.</description>

Abstract: Let TC$_n$ denote the n-th topological complexity. For nilpotent CW space of finite type, Grant--Lupton--Oprea proved the following: If TC$_n$(X)=n-1 then X is homotopy equivalent to an odd-dimensional sphere. In my previous version I stated that I can get rid of the nilpotence condition. Currently I cannot do it (the proof of Theorem 4.4 in the previous version is wrong) but I have made some progress there, and I present it here</description>

      <title>Circle actions on oriented manifolds with 3 fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.09424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.09424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let the circle group act on a compact oriented manifold $M$ with a non-empty discrete fixed point set. Then the dimension of $M$ is even. If $M$ has one fixed point, $M$ is the point. In any even dimension, such a manifold $M$ with two fixed points exists, a rotation of an even dimensional sphere. Suppose that $M$ has three fixed points. Then the dimension of $M$ is a multiple of 4. Under the assumption that each isotropy submanifold is orientable, we show that if $\dim M=8$, then the weights at the fixed points agree with those of an action on the quaternionic projective space $\mathbb{HP}^2$, and show that there is no such 12-dimensional manifold $M$.</description>

      <title>Bordism of flow modules and exact Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11766v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a stably framed Liouville manifold X , we construct a "Donaldson-Fukaya category over the sphere spectrum" F(X; S). The objects are closed exact Lagrangians whose Gauss maps are nullhomotopic compatibly with the ambient stable framing, and the morphisms are bordism classes of framed flow modules over Lagrangian Floer flow categories; this is enriched in modules over the framed bordism ring. We develop an obstruction theory for lifting quasi-isomorphisms in the usual Fukaya category to quasi-isomorphisms in appropriate truncations or quotients of F(X; S). Applications include constraints on the smooth structure of exact Lagrangians in certain plumbings, and the construction of non-trivial symplectic mapping classes which act trivially on the integral Fukaya category for a wide class of affine varieties.</description>

      <title>Quillen (co)homology of divided power algebras over an operad</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barr--Beck cohomology, put into the framework of model categories by Quillen, provides a cohomology theory for any algebraic structure, for example Andr\'e--Quillen cohomology of commutative rings. Quillen cohomology has been studied notably for divided power algebras and restricted Lie algebras, both of which are instances of divided power algebras over an operad $P$: the commutative and Lie operad respectively. In this paper, we investigate the Quillen cohomology of divided power algebras over an operad $P$, identifying Beck modules, derivations, and K\"ahler differentials in that setup. We also compare the cohomology of divided power algebras over $P$ with that of $P$-algebras, and work out some examples.</description>
