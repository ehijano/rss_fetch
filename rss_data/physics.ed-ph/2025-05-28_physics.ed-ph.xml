      <title>Visualization enhances Problem Solving in Multi-Qubit Systems: An Eye-Tracking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science (QIS) is a vast, diverse, and abstract field. In consequence, learners face many challenges. Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education research has found that visualizations are valuable to aid learners in complex matters. The conditions under which visualizations pose benefits are largely unexplored in QIS education. In this eye-tracking study, we examine the conditions under which the visualization of multi-qubit systems in addition to the mathematical symbolic Dirac Notation (DN) is associated with a benefit for solving problems on the ubiquitously used Hadamard gate operation in terms of performance, Extraneous Cognitive Load (ECL) and Intrinsic Cognitive Load (ICL). We find that visualization increases performance and reduces cognitive load for participants with little experience in quantum physics. In addition, representational competence is able to predict reductions in ECL with visualization, but not performance or ICL. Analysis of the eye-tracking results indicates that problem solvers with more transitions between DN and visualization benefit less from it. We discuss the generalizability of the results and practical implications.</description>

      <title>Reflections of Cultural Wealth: Exploring Identity in Physics through Photo Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a photo elicitation project that invites students to explore their identities in STEM and surface the cultural wealth they bring into the physics classroom. Grounded in critical race theory, educational theory, and affective neuroscience, the project asks students to take original photographs representing aspects of their lived experience-such as motivation, belonging, and support systems-and to write short reflections connecting these images to their journey in science. The activity affirms students' backgrounds and values as meaningful resources for learning physics, while also fostering connection, inclusion, and reflective engagement. Practical guidance for implementation is provided. This adaptable, low-barrier practice offers an accessible entry point for instructors seeking to humanize physics education in powerful and inclusive ways.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Based Laser Path Solver Algorithm for Virtual Reality Laboratory Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: femtoPro is an interactive virtual reality (VR) laser laboratory balancing the contrasting challenges of accuracy and computational efficiency in optics simulations. It can simulate linear and nonlinear optical phenomena in real time, a task that pushes the boundaries of current consumer hardware. This paper details the concept, implementation, and evaluation of a dynamic graph-based solution tailored to the specific requirements and challenges of the simulation. Resource usage is optimized through a selective updating strategy that identifies and preserves laser paths unchanged between simulation frames, eliminating the need for unnecessary recalculations. Benchmarking of real-world scenarios confirms that our approach delivers a smooth user experience, even on mobile VR platforms with limited computing power. The methodologies, solutions and insights outlined in this paper may be applicable to other interactive, dynamic graph-based real-time simulations.</description>

      <title>Physics Computational Literacy: Programming, modeling and collaboration at the journeyman level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computation has become an integral part of physics research. However, little is known about how students learn to productively use computation as a tool beyond the introductory level, especially as they transition into physics research. In this study, we apply the theory of Physics Computational Literacy and the Novice-Expert framework to describe the development of expertise in computational physics, as students transition from novice to journeymen computational physicists. We base this description on a thematic analysis of interviews with 13 computational physics master's students with extensive experience using computation. We first describe the most important elements driving the development of computational physics expertise, identifying two distinct transitions of competence during their studies, driven by experience with large computational projects and professional research. We then present an overview of the various skills students attain on this path toward the journeyman level of computational physics expertise. Based on these results, we argue for the need to assist students in collaborative coding and the learning of new tools, as well as the importance of large, scaffolded, computational projects for helping students develop the advanced skills needed for computational research.</description>

      <title>Quantifying interdisciplinary synergy in higher STEM education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to quantify and utilize interdisciplinarity in science and engineering curricula in the case of university-level higher education. We analyze interdisciplinary relations by standardizing large-scale official educational data in Korea using a cutting-edge large language model and constructing knowledge maps for disciplines of scientific education. We design and evaluate single-field and integrated dual-field curricula by adapting pedagogical theory and utilizing information theory-based metrics. We develop standard curricula for individual disciplines and integrated curricula combining two fields, with their interdisciplinarity quantified by the curriculum synergy score. The results indicate higher interdisciplinarity for combinations within or across closely related fields, especially in engineering fields. Based on the analysis, engineering fields constitute the core structure of our design for curriculum interdisciplinarity, while basic natural science fields are located at peripheral stems to provide fundamental concepts.</description>

      <title>SeePhys: Does Seeing Help Thinking? -- Benchmarking Vision-Based Physics Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present SeePhys, a large-scale multimodal benchmark for LLM reasoning grounded in physics questions ranging from middle school to PhD qualifying exams. The benchmark covers 7 fundamental domains spanning the physics discipline, incorporating 21 categories of highly heterogeneous diagrams. In contrast to prior works where visual elements mainly serve auxiliary purposes, our benchmark features a substantial proportion of vision-essential problems (75%) that mandate visual information extraction for correct solutions. Through extensive evaluation, we observe that even the most advanced visual reasoning models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-pro and o4-mini) achieve sub-60% accuracy on our benchmark. These results reveal fundamental challenges in current large language models' visual understanding capabilities, particularly in: (i) establishing rigorous coupling between diagram interpretation and physics reasoning, and (ii) overcoming their persistent reliance on textual cues as cognitive shortcuts.</description>
