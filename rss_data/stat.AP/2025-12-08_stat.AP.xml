      <title>Consistency of Familial DNA Search Results in Southeast Asian Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA databases are widely used in forensic science to identify unknown offenders. When no exact match is found, familial DNA searches can help by identifying first-degree relatives using likelihood ratios. If multiple subpopulations are relevant, likelihood ratios can be computed separately based on allele frequency estimates. Various strategies exist to combine these ratios, such as averaging allele frequencies or taking the average, maximum, or minimum likelihood ratio. While some comparisons have been made in populations like those in the U.S., their effectiveness in other regions remains unclear. This study evaluates likelihood ratio-based strategies in Southeast Asian populations, specifically Thailand, Malaysia, and Singapore. Our findings align with previous research, showing that statistical power varies across strategies. Among Thai subpopulations, the minimum likelihood ratio strategy is preferred, as it maintains high power while minimizing differences between subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-state Modeling of Delay Evolution in Suburban Rail Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Train delays are a persistent issue in railway systems, particularly in suburban networks where operational complexity is heightened by frequent services and high passenger volumes. Traditional delay models often overlook the temporal and structural dynamics of real delay propagation.
  This work applies continuous-time multi-state models to analyze the temporal evolution of delay on the S5 suburban line in Lombardy, Italy. Using detailed operational, meteorological, and contextual data, the study models delay transitions while accounting for observable heterogeneity.
  The findings reveal how delay dynamics vary by travel direction, time slot, and route segment. Covariates such as station saturation and passenger load are shown to significantly affect the risk of delay escalation or recovery. The study offers both methodological advancements and practical results for improving the reliability of rail services.</description>

      <title>Job Satisfaction Through the Lens of Social Media: Rural--Urban Patterns in the U.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a novel large-scale social-media-based measure of U.S. job satisfaction, constructed by applying a fine-tuned large language model to 2.6 billion georeferenced tweets, and link it to county-level labor market conditions (2013-2023). Logistic regressions show that rural counties consistently report lower job satisfaction sentiment than urban ones, but this gap decreases under tight labor markets. In contrast to widening rural-urban income disparities, perceived job quality converges when unemployment is low, suggesting that labor market slack, not income alone, drives spatial inequality in subjective work-related well-being.</description>

      <title>Exchangeable Gaussian Processes with application to epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Bayesian non-parametric framework based on multi-task Gaussian processes, appropriate for temporal shrinkage. We focus on a particular class of dynamic hierarchical models to obtain evidence-based knowledge of infectious disease burden. These models induce a parsimonious way to capture cross-dependence between groups while retaining a natural interpretation based on an underlying mean process, itself expressed as a Gaussian process. We analyse distinct types of outbreak data from recent epidemics and find that the proposed models result in improved predictive ability against competing alternatives.</description>

      <title>A Functional Approach to Testing Overall Effect of Interaction Between DNA Methylation and SNPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a test for the overall effect of interaction between DNA methylation and a set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on a quantitative phenotype. The developed inference procedure is based on a functional approach that extends existing regression models in functional data analysis. Through extensive simulations, we show that the proposed test effectively controls type I error rates and highlights increased empirical power over existing methods, particularly when multiple interactions are present. The use of the proposed test is illustrated with an application to data from obesity patients and controls.</description>

      <title>Developing synthetic microdata through machine learning for firm-level business surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public-use microdata samples (PUMS) from the United States (US) Census Bureau on individuals have been available for decades. However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Naive Bayes Classification to Address Subpopulation Structure in Familial DNA Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Familial DNA search evaluates the genetic relatedness of two individuals by comparing the likelihood of their observed DNA profiles under two competing hypotheses-the null hypothesis that the individuals are unrelated and the alternative hypothesis that they are related-most commonly through the likelihood ratio (LR). Standard LR-based approaches typically assume a uniform genetic background; however, this assumption is rarely valid due to population substructure, where allele frequencies vary among subpopulations and can bias relationship inference. Existing modifications-such as LR calculations based on average allele frequencies (LRLAF) and strategies using maximum, minimum, or average likelihood ratios (LRMAX, LRMIN, LRAVG)-help mitigate these challenges but remain limited in their ability to fully address subpopulation differences. This study introduces a new LR-based statistic, LRCLASS, which incorporates a classification step using the Naive Bayes classifier to account for nuisance parameters associated with unknown subpopulation origins. In LRCLASS, the two DNA profiles being compared are jointly assigned to a subpopulation group via Naive Bayes before LR computation. Empirical evaluations using Thai population data show that LRCLASS achieves higher statistical power for detecting full-sibling relationships than existing LR-based methods. We further assessed multinomial logistic regression as an alternative classifier and found its performance comparable to that of Naive Bayes, suggesting flexibility in classifier choice. Overall, integrating the Naive Bayes classifier with LR computation offers a robust strategy for addressing population substructure in familial DNA search and highlights the broader potential of combining supervised learning techniques with forensic statistical methodologies to enhance the accuracy and reliability of genetic relationship testing.</description>

      <title>Establishing Validity for Distance Functions and Internal Clustering Validity Indices in Correlation Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internal clustering validity indices (ICVIs) assess clustering quality without ground truth labels. Comparative studies consistently find that no single ICVI outperforms others across datasets, leaving practitioners without principled ICVI selection. We argue that inconsistent ICVI performance arises because studies evaluate them based on matching human labels rather than measuring the quality of the discovered structure in the data, using datasets without formally quantifying the structure type and quality. Structure type refers to the mathematical organisation in data that clustering aims to discover. Validity theory requires a theoretical definition of clustering quality, which depends on structure type. We demonstrate this through the first validity assessment of clustering quality measures for correlation patterns, a structure type that arises from clustering time series by correlation relationships. We formalise 23 canonical correlation patterns as the theoretical optimal clustering and use synthetic data modelling this structure with controlled perturbations to evaluate validity across content, criterion, construct, and external validity. Our findings show that Silhouette Width Criterion (SWC) and Davies-Bouldin Index (DBI) are valid for correlation patterns, whilst Calinski-Harabasz (VRC) and Pakhira-Bandyopadhyay-Maulik (PBM) indices fail. Simple Lp norm distances achieve validity, whilst correlation-specific functions fail structural, criterion, and external validity. These results differ from previous studies where VRC and PBM performed well, demonstrating that validity depends on structure type. Our structure-type-specific validation method provides both practical guidance (quality thresholds SWC&gt;0.9, DBI&lt;0.15) and a methodological template for establishing validity for other structure types.</description>

      <title>Sequential Randomization Tests Using E-values: A Betting Approach for Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04366v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential monitoring of randomized trials traditionally relies on parametric assumptions or asymptotic approximations. We present a nonparametric sequential test, the randomization e-process (e-RT), that derives validity solely from the randomization mechanism. Using a betting framework, e-RT constructs a test martingale by sequentially wagering on treatment assignments given observed outcomes. Under the null hypothesis of no treatment effect, the expected wealth cannot grow, guaranteeing anytime-valid Type I error control regardless of stopping rule. We prove validity and present simulation studies demonstrating calibration and power. The e-RT provides a conservative, assumption-free complement to model-based sequential analyses.</description>
