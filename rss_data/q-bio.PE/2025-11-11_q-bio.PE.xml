      <title>An epidemiological model with waning immunity and reinfection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waning immunity and reinfection are critical features of many infectious diseases, but epidemiological models often fail to capture the intricate interaction between an individual's history of immunity and their current infection status; when they do, the approach is usually overly simplistic. We develop a novel dual-age structured model that simultaneously tracks immunity age (time since the last recovery from infection) and infection age (time since infection) to analyze epidemic dynamics under conditions of waning immunity and reinfection. The model is formulated as a system of age-structured partial differential equations that describe susceptible and infected populations stratified by both immunity and infection ages. We derive basic reproduction numbers associated with the model and numerically solve the system using a second-order Runge-Kutta scheme along the characteristic lines. We further extend the model to explore vaccination interventions, specifically targeting individuals according to their immunity age. Numerical results reveal that higher contact rates produce larger amplitude oscillations with longer interepidemic periods. The relationship between initial infection levels and long-term epidemic behavior is nonmonotonic. Vaccination efficiency depends critically on the viral load profile across immunity and infection age, with more pronounced viral load distributions requiring higher vaccination rates for disease elimination. Most efficient vaccination strategies begin with intermediate immunity ages rather than targeting only fully susceptible individuals. The structured dual-age framework provides a flexible approach to analyzing the dynamics of reinfection and evaluating targeted vaccination strategies based on the history of immunity.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework of consumer-resource dynamics: How to incorporate interactions between interactions in evolutionary process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel mathematical framework is proposed to describe the ecological and evolutionary consequences of consumer--resource interactions. Both the consumer and resource are assumed to consist of several (sub)species, which interact between themselves in addition to incorporating the deleterious effects of the consumer on the resource. Separating the ecological and evolutionary time scales, we allow our mathematical model to evolve, with the evolutionary steps chosen according to the (divergent) objective functions of the consumer and the resource. Numerical simulations show that the model, along with the expected outcomes of either consumer or resource winning the evolutionary battle, is capable of producing also the (quasi)stationary state of consumer--resource coexistence with monotone growth of both the consumer and resource fitnesses. Such stable states highlight the importance of the intra-population interactions, which, despite the opposite evolutionary goals of the consumer and the resource, lead to long term ecological stability.</description>

      <title>Emergent self-inhibition governs the landscape of stable states in complex ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species-rich ecosystems often exhibit multiple stable states with distinct species compositions. Yet, the factors determining the likelihood of each state's occurrence remain poorly understood. Here, we characterize and explain the landscape of stable states in the random Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model, in which multistability is widespread. We find that the same pool of species with random initial abundances can result in different stable states, whose likelihoods typically differ by orders of magnitude. A state's likelihood increases sharply with its total biomass, or inverse self-inhibition. We develop a simplified model to predict and explain this behavior, by coarse-graining ecological interactions so that each stable state behaves as a unit. In this setting, we can accurately predict the entire landscape of stable states using only two macroscopic properties: the biomass of each state and species diversity. Our theory also provides insight into the biomass-likelihood relationship: High-biomass states have low self-inhibition and thus grow faster, outcompete others, and become much more likely. These results reveal emergent self-inhibition as a fundamental organizing principle for the attractor landscape of complex ecosystems - and provide a path to predict ecosystem outcomes without knowing microscopic interactions.</description>

      <title>Long-bone microanatomy in elephants: microstructural insights into gigantic beasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the greatest challenges of terrestrial locomotion is resisting gravity. The morphological adaptive features of the limb long-bones of extant elephants, the heaviest living terrestrial animals, have previously been highlighted; however, their bone microanatomy remains largely unexplored. Here we investigate the microanatomy of the six limb long-bones in Elephas maximus and Loxodonta africana, using comparisons of virtual slices as well as robustness analyses, to understand how they were adapted to heavy weight-bearing. We find that the long bones of elephant limbs display a relatively thick cortex and a medullary area almost entirely filled with trabecular bone. This trabecular bone is highly anisotropic with trabecular orientations reflecting the mechanical load distribution along the limb. The respective functional roles of the bones are reflected in their microanatomy through variations of cortical thickness distribution and main orientation of the trabeculae. We find microanatomical adaptations to heavy weight support that are common to other heavy mammals. Despite these shared characteristics, the long bones of elephants are closer to those of sauropods due to their shared columnar posture, which allows a relaxation of morphofunctional constraints, and thus relatively less robust bones with a thinner cortex than would be expected in such massive animals.</description>

      <title>Spatial Selection and the Multiscale Dynamics of Urban Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growth is a multi-layered phenomenon in human societies, composed of socioeconomic and demographic change at many different scales. Yet, standard macroeconomic indicators average over most of these processes, blurring the spatial and hierarchical heterogeneity driving people's choices and experiences. To address this gap, we introduce here a framework based on the Price equation to decompose aggregate growth exactly into endogenous and selection effects across nested spatial scales. We illustrate this approach with population and income data from the Chicago metropolitan area (2014-2019) and show that both growth rates and spatial selection effects are most intense at local levels, fat-tailed and spatially correlated. We also find that selection, defined as the covariance between prevailing income and relative population change, is concentrated in few spatial units and exhibits scaling behavior when grouped by county. Despite the intensity of local sorting, selection effects largely cancel in the aggregate, implying that fast heterogeneous micro-dynamics can yield deceptively stable macro-trends. By treating local spatial units (neighborhoods) as evolving subpopulations under selection, we demonstrate how methods from complex systems provide new tools to classify residential selection processes, such as abandonment and gentrification, in an urban sociological framework. This approach is general and applies to any other nested economic systems such as networks of production, occupations, or innovation enabling a new mechanistic understanding of compositional change and growth across scales of organization.</description>

      <title>Convergence-divergence models: Generalizations of phylogenetic trees modeling gene flow over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees are simple models of evolutionary processes. They describe conditionally independent divergent evolution of taxa from common ancestors. Phylogenetic trees commonly do not have enough flexibility to adequately model all evolutionary processes. For example, introgressive hybridization, where genes can flow from one taxon to another. Phylogenetic networks model evolution not fully described by a phylogenetic tree. However, many phylogenetic network models assume ancestral taxa merge instantaneously to form ``hybrid'' descendant taxa. In contrast, our convergence-divergence models retain a single underlying ``principal'' tree, but permit gene flow over arbitrary time frames. Alternatively, convergence-divergence models can describe other biological processes leading to taxa becoming more similar over a time frame, such as replicated evolution. Here we present novel maximum likelihood-based algorithms to infer most aspects of $N$-taxon convergence-divergence models, many consistently, using a quartet-based approach. The algorithms can be applied to multiple sequence alignments restricted to genes or genomic windows or to gene presence/absence datasets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Re-Analysis of the Phylogenetic Topology of Early SARS-CoV-2 Case Sequences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A much-cited 2022 paper by Pekar et al. claimed that Bayesian analysis of the molecular phylogeny of early SARS-CoV-2 cases indicated that it was more likely that two successful introductions to humans had occurred than that just one had. Here I show that after correcting a fundamental error in Bayesian reasoning the results in that paper give larger likelihood for a single introduction than for two.</description>

      <title>Which Similarity-Sensitive Entropy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A canonical step in quantifying a system is to measure its entropy. Shannon entropy and other traditional entropy measures capture only the information encoded in the frequencies of a system's elements. Recently, Leinster, Cobbold, and Reeve (LCR) introduced a method that also captures the rich information encoded in the similarities and differences among elements, yielding similarity-sensitive entropy. More recently, the Vendi score (VS) was introduced as an alternative, raising the question of how LCR and VS compare, and which is preferable. Here we address these questions conceptually, analytically, and experimentally, using 53 machine-learning datasets. We show that LCR and VS can differ by orders of magnitude and can capture complementary information about a system, except in limiting cases. We demonstrate that both LCR and VS depend on how similarities are scaled and introduce the concept of ``half distance'' to parameterize this dependence. We prove that VS provides an upper bound on LCR for several values of the R\'enyi-Hill order parameter and conjecture that this bound holds for all values. We conclude that VS is preferable only when interpreting elements as linear combinations of a more fundamental set of ``ur-elements'' or when the system or dataset possesses a quantum-mechanical character. In the broader circumstance where one seeks simply to capture the rich information encoded by similarity, LCR is favored; nevertheless, for certain half-distances the two methods can complement each other.</description>
