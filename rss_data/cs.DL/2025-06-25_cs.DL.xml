      <title>The role of preprints in open science: Accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preprints have become increasingly essential in the landscape of open science, facilitating not only the exchange of knowledge within the scientific community but also bridging the gap between science and technology. However, the impact of preprints on technological innovation, given their unreviewed nature, remains unclear. This study fills this gap by conducting a comprehensive scientometric analysis of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints submitted between 2013 and 2021, measuring and accessing the contribution of preprints in accelerating knowledge transfer from science to technology. Our findings reveal a growing trend of patent citations to bioRxiv preprints, with a notable surge in 2020, primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Preprints play a critical role in accelerating innovation, not only expedite the dissemination of scientific knowledge into technological innovation but also enhance the visibility of early research results in the patenting process, while journals remain essential for academic rigor and reliability. The substantial number of post-online-publication patent citations highlights the critical role of the open science model-particularly the "open access" effect of preprints-in amplifying the impact of science on technological innovation. This study provides empirical evidence that open science policies encouraging the early sharing of research outputs, such as preprints, contribute to more efficient linkage between science and technology, suggesting an acceleration in the pace of innovation, higher innovation quality, and economic benefits.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Evolution of Research Contributions using KnoVo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents KnoVo (Knowledge Evolution), an intelligent framework designed for quantifying and analyzing the evolution of research novelty in the scientific literature. Moving beyond traditional citation analysis, which primarily measures impact, KnoVo determines a paper's novelty relative to both prior and subsequent work within its multilayered citation network. Given a target paper's abstract, KnoVo utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to dynamically extract dimensions of comparison (e.g., methodology, application, dataset). The target paper is then compared to related publications along these same extracted dimensions. This comparative analysis, inspired by tournament selection, yields quantitative novelty scores reflecting the relative improvement, equivalence, or inferiority of the target paper in specific aspects. By aggregating these scores and visualizing their progression, for instance, through dynamic evolution graphs and comparative radar charts, KnoVo facilitates researchers not only to assess originality and identify similar work, but also to track knowledge evolution along specific research dimensions, uncover research gaps, and explore cross-disciplinary connections. We demonstrate these capabilities through a detailed analysis of 20 diverse papers from multiple scientific fields and report on the performance of various open-source LLMs within the KnoVo framework.</description>
