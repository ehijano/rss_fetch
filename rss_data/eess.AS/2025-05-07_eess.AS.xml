      <title>The Search for Squawk: Agile Modeling in Bioacoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) has shown great promise in helping ecologists understand the health of animal populations and ecosystems. However, extracting insights from millions of hours of audio recordings requires the development of specialized recognizers. This is typically a challenging task, necessitating large amounts of training data and machine learning expertise. In this work, we introduce a general, scalable and data-efficient system for developing recognizers for novel bioacoustic problems in under an hour. Our system consists of several key components that tackle problems in previous bioacoustic workflows: 1) highly generalizable acoustic embeddings pre-trained for birdsong classification minimize data hunger; 2) indexed audio search allows the efficient creation of classifier training datasets, and 3) precomputation of embeddings enables an efficient active learning loop, improving classifier quality iteratively with minimal wait time. Ecologists employed our system in three novel case studies: analyzing coral reef health through unidentified sounds; identifying juvenile Hawaiian bird calls to quantify breeding success and improve endangered species monitoring; and Christmas Island bird occupancy modeling. We augment the case studies with simulated experiments which explore the range of design decisions in a structured way and help establish best practices. Altogether these experiments showcase our system's scalability, efficiency, and generalizability, enabling scientists to quickly address new bioacoustic challenges.</description>

      <title>Fairness of Automatic Speech Recognition in Cleft Lip and Palate Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech produced by individuals with cleft lip and palate (CLP) is often highly nasalized and breathy due to structural anomalies, causing shifts in formant structure that affect automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance and fairness. This study hypothesizes that publicly available ASR systems exhibit reduced fairness for CLP speech and confirms this through experiments. Despite formant disruptions, mild and moderate CLP speech retains some spectro-temporal alignment with normal speech, motivating augmentation strategies to enhance fairness. The study systematically explores augmenting CLP speech with normal speech across severity levels and evaluates its impact on ASR fairness. Three ASR models-GMM-HMM, Whisper, and XLS-R-were tested on AIISH and NMCPC datasets. Results indicate that training with normal speech and testing on mixed data improves word error rate (WER). Notably, WER decreased from $22.64\%$ to $18.76\%$ (GMM-HMM, AIISH) and $28.45\%$ to $18.89\%$ (Whisper, NMCPC). The superior performance of GMM-HMM on AIISH may be due to its suitability for Kannada children's speech, a challenge for foundation models like XLS-R and Whisper. To assess fairness, a fairness score was introduced, revealing improvements of $17.89\%$ (AIISH) and $47.50\%$ (NMCPC) with augmentation.</description>

      <title>BLAB: Brutally Long Audio Bench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing large audio language models (LMs) capable of understanding diverse spoken interactions is essential for accommodating the multimodal nature of human communication and can increase the accessibility of language technologies across different user populations. Recent work on audio LMs has primarily evaluated their performance on short audio segments, typically under 30 seconds, with limited exploration of long-form conversational speech segments that more closely reflect natural user interactions with these models. We introduce Brutally Long Audio Bench (BLAB), a challenging long-form audio benchmark that evaluates audio LMs on localization, duration estimation, emotion, and counting tasks using audio segments averaging 51 minutes in length. BLAB consists of 833+ hours of diverse, full-length audio clips, each paired with human-annotated, text-based natural language questions and answers. Our audio data were collected from permissively licensed sources and underwent a human-assisted filtering process to ensure task compliance. We evaluate six open-source and proprietary audio LMs on BLAB and find that all of them, including advanced models such as Gemini 2.0 Pro and GPT-4o, struggle with the tasks in BLAB. Our comprehensive analysis reveals key insights into the trade-offs between task difficulty and audio duration. In general, we find that audio LMs struggle with long-form speech, with performance declining as duration increases. They perform poorly on localization, temporal reasoning, counting, and struggle to understand non-phonemic information, relying more on prompts than audio content. BLAB serves as a challenging evaluation framework to develop audio LMs with robust long-form audio understanding capabilities.</description>

      <title>Coupling the Heart to Musical Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biofeedback is being used more recently as a general control paradigm for human-computer interfaces (HCIs). While biofeedback especially from breath has seen increasing uptake as a controller for novel musical interfaces, new interfaces for musical expression (NIMEs), the community has not given as much attention to the heart. The heart is just as intimate a part of music as breath and it is argued that the heart determines our perception of time and so indirectly our perception of music. Inspired by this I demonstrate a photoplethysmogram (PPG)-based NIME controller using heart rate as a 1D control parameter to transform the qualities of sounds in real-time over a Bluetooth wireless HCI. I apply time scaling to "warp" audio buffers inbound to the sound card, and play these transformed audio buffers back to the listener wearing the PPG sensor, creating a hypothetical perceptual biofeedback loop: changes in sound change heart rate to change PPG measurements to change sound. I discuss how a sound-heart-PPG biofeedback loop possibly affords greater control and/or variety of movements with a 1D controller, how controlling the space and/or time scale of sound playback with biofeedback makes for possibilities in performance ambience, and I briefly discuss generative latent spaces as a possible way to extend a 1D PPG control space.</description>

      <title>CoGenAV: Versatile Audio-Visual Representation Learning via Contrastive-Generative Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent synchronization between a speaker's lip movements, voice, and the underlying linguistic content offers a rich source of information for improving speech processing tasks, especially in challenging conditions where traditional audio-only systems falter. We introduce CoGenAV, a powerful and data-efficient model designed to learn versatile audio-visual representations applicable across a wide range of speech and audio-visual tasks. CoGenAV is trained by optimizing a dual objective derived from natural audio-visual synchrony, contrastive feature alignment and generative text prediction, using only 223 hours of labeled data from the LRS2 dataset. This contrastive-generative synchronization strategy effectively captures fundamental cross-modal correlations. We showcase the effectiveness and versatility of the learned CoGenAV representations on multiple benchmarks. When utilized for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) on LRS2, these representations contribute to achieving a state-of-the-art Word Error Rate (WER) of 1.27. They also enable strong performance in Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) with a WER of 22.0 on LRS2, and significantly improve performance in noisy environments by over 70%. Furthermore, CoGenAV representations benefit speech reconstruction tasks, boosting performance in Speech Enhancement and Separation, and achieve competitive results in audio-visual synchronization tasks like Active Speaker Detection (ASD). Our model will be open-sourced to facilitate further development and collaboration within both academia and industry.</description>

      <title>A study on audio synchronous steganography detection and distributed guide inference model based on sliding spectral features and intelligent inference drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rise of short video platforms in global communication, embedding steganographic data in audio synchronization streams has emerged as a new covert communication method. To address the limitations of traditional techniques in detecting synchronized steganography, this paper proposes a detection and distributed guidance reconstruction model based on short video "Yupan" samples released by China's South Sea Fleet on TikTok. The method integrates sliding spectrum feature extraction and intelligent inference mechanisms. A 25 ms sliding window with short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is used to extract the main frequency trajectory and construct the synchronization frame detection model (M1), identifying a frame flag "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF80". The subsequent 32-byte payload is decoded by a structured model (M2) to infer distributed guidance commands. Analysis reveals a low-entropy, repetitive byte sequence in the 36 to 45 second audio segment with highly concentrated spectral energy, confirming the presence of synchronization frames. Although plaintext semantics are not restored, the consistency in command field layout suggests features of military communication protocols. The multi-segment splicing model further shows cross-video embedding and centralized decoding capabilities. The proposed framework validates the effectiveness of sliding spectral features for synchronized steganography detection and builds an extensible inference model for covert communication analysis and tactical guidance simulation on open platforms.</description>

      <title>MGFF-TDNN: A Multi-Granularity Feature Fusion TDNN Model with Depth-Wise Separable Module for Speaker Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In speaker verification, traditional models often emphasize modeling long-term contextual features to capture global speaker characteristics. However, this approach can neglect fine-grained voiceprint information, which contains highly discriminative features essential for robust speaker embeddings. This paper introduces a novel model architecture, termed MGFF-TDNN, based on multi-granularity feature fusion. The MGFF-TDNN leverages a two-dimensional depth-wise separable convolution module, enhanced with local feature modeling, as a front-end feature extractor to effectively capture time-frequency domain features. To achieve comprehensive multi-granularity feature fusion, we propose the M-TDNN structure, which integrates global contextual modeling with fine-grained feature extraction by combining time-delay neural networks and phoneme-level feature pooling. Experiments on the VoxCeleb dataset demonstrate that the MGFF-TDNN achieves outstanding performance in speaker verification while remaining efficient in terms of parameters and computational resources.</description>

      <title>SonicRAG : High Fidelity Sound Effects Synthesis Based on Retrival Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing (NLP) and multimodal learning, with successful applications in text generation and speech synthesis, enabling a deeper understanding and generation of multimodal content. In the field of sound effects (SFX) generation, LLMs have been leveraged to orchestrate multiple models for audio synthesis. However, due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, and the complexity of temproal modeling. current SFX generation techniques still fall short in achieving high-fidelity audio. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework that integrates LLMs with existing sound effect databases, allowing for the retrieval, recombination, and synthesis of audio based on user requirements. By leveraging this approach, we enhance the diversity and quality of generated sound effects while eliminating the need for additional recording costs, offering a flexible and efficient solution for sound design and application.</description>

      <title>SepALM: Audio Language Models Are Error Correctors for Robust Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While contemporary speech separation technologies adeptly process lengthy mixed audio waveforms, they are frequently challenged by the intricacies of real-world environments, including noisy and reverberant settings, which can result in artifacts or distortions in the separated speech. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SepALM, a pioneering approach that employs audio language models (ALMs) to rectify and re-synthesize speech within the text domain following preliminary separation. SepALM comprises four core components: a separator, a corrector, a synthesizer, and an aligner. By integrating an ALM-based end-to-end error correction mechanism, we mitigate the risk of error accumulation and circumvent the optimization hurdles typically encountered in conventional methods that amalgamate automatic speech recognition (ASR) with large language models (LLMs). Additionally, we have developed Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and knowledge distillation techniques to facilitate the reasoning and training processes of the ALM. Our experiments substantiate that SepALM not only elevates the precision of speech separation but also markedly bolsters adaptability in novel acoustic environments.</description>

      <title>Mamba-Diffusion Model with Learnable Wavelet for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent surge in the popularity of diffusion models for image synthesis has attracted new attention to their potential for generation tasks in other domains. However, their applications to symbolic music generation remain largely under-explored because symbolic music is typically represented as sequences of discrete events and standard diffusion models are not well-suited for discrete data. We represent symbolic music as image-like pianorolls, facilitating the use of diffusion models for the generation of symbolic music. Moreover, this study introduces a novel diffusion model that incorporates our proposed Transformer-Mamba block and learnable wavelet transform. Classifier-free guidance is utilised to generate symbolic music with target chords. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves compelling results in terms of music quality and controllability, outperforming the strong baseline in pianoroll generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/jinchengzhanggg/proffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Inverse Drum Machine (IDM), a novel approach to drum source separation that combines analysis-by-synthesis with deep learning. Unlike recent supervised methods that rely on isolated stems, IDM requires only transcription annotations. It jointly optimizes automatic drum transcription and one-shot drum sample synthesis in an end-to-end framework. By convolving synthesized one-shot samples with estimated onsets-mimicking a drum machine-IDM reconstructs individual drum stems and trains a neural network to match the original mixture. Evaluations on the StemGMD dataset show that IDM achieves separation performance on par with state-of-the-art supervised methods, while substantially outperforming matrix decomposition baselines.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Distillation for Speech Denoising by Latent Representation Alignment with Cosine Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech denoising is a generally adopted and impactful task, appearing in many common and everyday-life use cases. Although there are very powerful methods published, most of those are too complex for deployment in everyday and low-resources computational environments, like hand-held devices, intelligent glasses, hearing aids, etc. Knowledge distillation (KD) is a prominent way for alleviating this complexity mismatch and is based on the transferring/distilling of knowledge from a pre-trained complex model, the teacher, to another less complex one, the student. Existing KD methods for speech denoising are based on processes that potentially hamper the KD by bounding the learning of the student to the distribution, information ordering, and feature dimensionality learned by the teacher. In this paper, we present and assess a method that tries to treat this issue, by exploiting the well-known denoising-autoencoder framework, the linear inverted bottlenecks, and the properties of the cosine similarity. We use a public dataset and conduct repeated experiments with different mismatching scenarios between the teacher and the student, reporting the mean and standard deviation of the metrics of our method and another, state-of-the-art method that is used as a baseline. Our results show that with the proposed method, the student can perform better and can also retain greater mismatching conditions compared to the teacher.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel Replay Speech Detection using an Adaptive Learnable Beamformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Replay attacks belong to the class of severe threats against voice-controlled systems, exploiting the easy accessibility of speech signals by recorded and replayed speech to grant unauthorized access to sensitive data. In this work, we propose a multi-channel neural network architecture called M-ALRAD for the detection of replay attacks based on spatial audio features. This approach integrates a learnable adaptive beamformer with a convolutional recurrent neural network, allowing for joint optimization of spatial filtering and classification. Experiments have been carried out on the ReMASC dataset, which is a state-of-the-art multi-channel replay speech detection dataset encompassing four microphones with diverse array configurations and four environments. Results on the ReMASC dataset show the superiority of the approach compared to the state-of-the-art and yield substantial improvements for challenging acoustic environments. In addition, we demonstrate that our approach is able to better generalize to unseen environments with respect to prior studies.</description>

      <title>AudioBench: A Universal Benchmark for Audio Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16020v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce AudioBench, a universal benchmark designed to evaluate Audio Large Language Models (AudioLLMs). It encompasses 8 distinct tasks and 26 datasets, among which, 7 are newly proposed datasets. The evaluation targets three main aspects: speech understanding, audio scene understanding, and voice understanding (paralinguistic). Despite recent advancements, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark for AudioLLMs on instruction following capabilities conditioned on audio signals. AudioBench addresses this gap by setting up datasets as well as desired evaluation metrics. Besides, we also evaluated the capabilities of five popular models and found that no single model excels consistently across all tasks.

      <title>Applications of Artificial Intelligence for Cross-language Intelligibility Assessment of Dysarthric Speech</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15858v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose: Speech intelligibility is a critical outcome in the assessment and management of dysarthria, yet most research and clinical practices have focused on English, limiting their applicability across languages. This commentary introduces a conceptual framework--and a demonstration of how it can be implemented--leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to advance cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech. Method: We propose a two-tiered conceptual framework consisting of a universal speech model that encodes dysarthric speech into acoustic-phonetic representations, followed by a language-specific intelligibility assessment model that interprets these representations within the phonological or prosodic structures of the target language. We further identify barriers to cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech, including data scarcity, annotation complexity, and limited linguistic insights into dysarthric speech, and outline potential AI-driven solutions to overcome these challenges. Conclusion: Advancing cross-language intelligibility assessment of dysarthric speech necessitates models that are both efficient and scalable, yet constrained by linguistic rules to ensure accurate and language-sensitive assessment. Recent advances in AI provide the foundational tools to support this integration, shaping future directions toward generalizable and linguistically informed assessment frameworks.</description>

      <title>Coverage-Guaranteed Speech Emotion Recognition via Calibrated Uncertainty-Adaptive Prediction Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Road rage, often triggered by emotional suppression and sudden outbursts, significantly threatens road safety by causing collisions and aggressive behavior. Speech emotion recognition technologies can mitigate this risk by identifying negative emotions early and issuing timely alerts. However, current SER methods, such as those based on hidden markov models and Long short-term memory networks, primarily handle one-dimensional signals, frequently experience overfitting, and lack calibration, limiting their safety-critical effectiveness. We propose a novel risk-controlled prediction framework providing statistically rigorous guarantees on prediction accuracy. This approach employs a calibration set to define a binary loss function indicating whether the true label is included in the prediction set. Using a data-driven threshold $\beta$, we optimize a joint loss function to maintain an expected test loss bounded by a user-specified risk level $\alpha$. Evaluations across six baseline models and two benchmark datasets demonstrate our framework consistently achieves a minimum coverage of $1 - \alpha$, effectively controlling marginal error rates despite varying calibration-test split ratios (e.g., 0.1). The robustness and generalizability of the framework are further validated through an extension to small-batch online calibration under a local exchangeability assumption. We construct a non-negative test martingale to maintain prediction validity even in dynamic and non-exchangeable environments. Cross-dataset tests confirm our method's ability to uphold reliable statistical guarantees in realistic, evolving data scenarios.</description>
