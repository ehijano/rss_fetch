      <title>Misspecification of Multiple Scattering in Scalar Wave Fields and its Impact in Ultrasound Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01220v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the localization of targets in the presence of multiple scattering. We focus on the often omitted scenario in which measurement data is affected by multiple scattering, and a simpler model is employed in the estimation. We study the impact of such model mismatch by means of the Misspecified Cram\'er-Rao Bound (MCRB). In numerical simulations inspired by tomographic inspection in ultrasound nondestructive testing, the MCRB is shown to correctly describe the estimation variance of localization parameters under misspecification of the wave propagation model. We provide extensive discussion on the utility of the MCRB in the practical task of verifying whether a chosen misspecified model is suitable for localization based on the properties of the maximum likelihood estimator and the nuanced distinction between bias and parameter space differences. Finally, we highlight that careful interpretation is needed whenever employing the classical CRB in the presence of mismatch through numerical examples based on the Born approximation and other simplified propagation models stemming from it.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Dark-Field CT for Lung Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: X-ray grating-based dark-field imaging can sense the small angle scattering caused by an object's micro-structure. This technique is sensitive to lung's porous alveoli and is able to detect lung disease at an early stage. Up to now, a human-scale dark-field CT has been built for lung imaging. Purpose: This study aimed to develop a more thorough optimization method for dark-field lung CT and summarize principles for system design. Methods: We proposed a metric in the form of contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) for system parameter optimization, and designed a phantom with concentric circle shape to fit the task of lung disease detection. Finally, we developed the calculation method of the CNR metric, and analyzed the relation between CNR and system parameters. Results: We showed that with other parameters held constant, the CNR first increases and then decreases with the system auto-correlation length (ACL). The optimal ACL is nearly not influenced by system's visibility, and is only related to phantom's property, i.e., scattering material's size and phantom's absorption. For our phantom, the optimal ACL is about 0.21 {\mu}m. As for system geometry, larger source-detector and isocenter-detector distance can increase the system's maximal ACL, helping the system meet the optimal ACL more easily. Conclusions: This study proposed a more reasonable metric and a task-based process for optimization, and demonstrated that the system optimal ACL is only related to the phantom's property.</description>
