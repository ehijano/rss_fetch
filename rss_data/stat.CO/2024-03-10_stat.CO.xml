      <title>collapse: Advanced and Fast Statistical Computing and Data Transformation in R</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: collapse is a large C/C++-based infrastructure package facilitating complex statistical computing, data transformation, and exploration tasks in R - at outstanding levels of performance and programming efficiency. It also implements a class-agnostic approach to R programming, supporting vector, matrix and data frame-like objects and their popular variants (e.g., factor, ts, xts, tibble, data.table, sf), enabling its seamless integration with large parts of the R ecosystem. This article introduces the package's key components and design principles in a structured way, supported by a rich set of examples. A small benchmark demonstrates its computational performance.</description>

      <title>Automated Efficient Estimation using Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many practical problems involve estimating low dimensional statistical quantities with high-dimensional models and datasets. Several approaches address these estimation tasks based on the theory of influence functions, such as debiased/double ML or targeted minimum loss estimation. This paper introduces \textit{Monte Carlo Efficient Influence Functions} (MC-EIF), a fully automated technique for approximating efficient influence functions that integrates seamlessly with existing differentiable probabilistic programming systems. MC-EIF automates efficient statistical estimation for a broad class of models and target functionals that would previously require rigorous custom analysis. We prove that MC-EIF is consistent, and that estimators using MC-EIF achieve optimal $\sqrt{N}$ convergence rates. We show empirically that estimators using MC-EIF are at parity with estimators using analytic EIFs. Finally, we demonstrate a novel capstone example using MC-EIF for optimal portfolio selection.</description>

      <title>Fast, effective, and coherent time series modeling using the sparsity-ranked lasso</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The sparsity-ranked lasso (SRL) has been developed for model selection and estimation in the presence of interactions and polynomials. The main tenet of the SRL is that an algorithm should be more skeptical of higher-order polynomials and interactions *a priori* compared to main effects, and hence the inclusion of these more complex terms should require a higher level of evidence. In time series, the same idea of ranked prior skepticism can be applied to the possibly seasonal autoregressive (AR) structure of the series during the model fitting process, becoming especially useful in settings with uncertain or multiple modes of seasonality. The SRL can naturally incorporate exogenous variables, with streamlined options for inference and/or feature selection. The fitting process is quick even for large series with a high-dimensional feature set. In this work, we discuss both the formulation of this procedure and the software we have developed for its implementation via the **fastTS** R package. We explore the performance of our SRL-based approach in a novel application involving the autoregressive modeling of hourly emergency room arrivals at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. We find that the SRL is considerably faster than its competitors, while producing more accurate predictions.</description>
