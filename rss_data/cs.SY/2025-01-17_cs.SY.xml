      <title>Reducing real-time complexity via sub-control Lyapunov functions: from theory to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techniques to design control Lyapunov functions (CLF), along with a proper stabilizing feedback, possibly in the presence of constraints, often provide control laws that are too complex for proper implementation online, especially when an optimization problem is involved. In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then a SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control for Discrete-time Stochastic Systems with Flexible Safe Bounds using Affine and Quadratic Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a safe controller synthesis of discrete-time stochastic systems using Control Barrier Functions (CBFs). The proposed condition allows the design of a safe controller synthesis that ensures system safety while avoiding the conservative bounds of safe probabilities. In particular, this study focuses on the design of CBFs that provide flexibility in the choice of functions to obtain tighter bounds on the safe probabilities. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient RAN Intelligent Controllers Through Optimized KPI Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (RAN) paradigm envisions a more flexible, interoperable, and intelligent RAN ecosystem via new open interfaces and elements like the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). However, the impact of these elements on Open RAN's power consumption remains heavily unexplored. This work for the first time evaluates the impact of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring on RIC's power consumption using real traffic and power measurements. By analyzing various RIC-RAN communication scenarios, we identify that RIC's power consumption can become a scalability bottleneck, particularly in large-scale deployments, even when RIC is limited to its core operational functionalities and without incorporating application-specific processes. In this context, also for the first time we explore potential power savings through the elimination of redundant KPI transmissions, extending existing techniques for identical subscription removal and KPI selection, achieving significant power consumption gains exceeding 87\% of the overall RIC power consumption.</description>

      <title>A Dataset Generation Toolbox for Dynamic Security Assessment: On the Role of the Security Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is crucial for ensuring the reliable operation of power systems. However, conventional DSA approaches are becoming intractable for future power systems, driving interest in more computationally efficient data-driven methods. Efficient dataset generation is a cornerstone of these methods. While importance and generic sampling techniques often focus on operating points near the system's security boundary, systematic methods for sampling in this region remain scarce. Furthermore, the impact of sampling near the security boundary on the performance of data-driven DSA methods has yet to be established. This paper highlights the critical role of accurately capturing security boundaries for effective security assessment. As such, we propose a novel method for generating a high number of samples close to the security boundary, considering both AC feasibility and small-signal stability. Case studies on the PGLib-OPF 39-bus and PGLib-OPF 162-bus systems demonstrate the importance of including boundary-adjacent operating points in training datasets while maintaining a balanced distribution of secure and insecure points.</description>

      <title>Design-Agnostic Distributed Timing Fault Injection Monitor With End-to-End Design Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault injection attacks induce hardware failures in circuits and exploit these faults to compromise the security of the system. It has been demonstrated that FIAs can bypass system security mechanisms, cause faulty outputs, and gain access to secret information. Certain types of FIAs can be mounted with little effort by tampering with clock signals and or the chip operating conditions. To mitigate such low cost, yet powerful attacks, we propose a fully synthesizable and distributable in situ fault injection monitor that employs a delay locked loop to track the pulsewidth of the clock. We further develop a fully automated design framework to optimize and implement the FIA monitors at any process node. Our design is fabricated and verified in 65 nm CMOS technology with a small footprint of 1500 um2. It can lock to clock frequencies from 2 MHz to 1.26 GHz while detecting all 12 types of possible clock glitches, as well as timing FIA injections via the supply voltage, electromagnetic signals, and chip temperature.</description>

      <title>Formalising the intentional stance 2: a coinductive approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a stochastic process with inputs and outputs, how might its behaviour be related to pursuit of a goal? We model this using 'transducers', objects that capture only the external behaviour of a system and not its internal state. A companion paper summarises our results for cognitive scientists; the current paper gives formal definitions and proofs.
  To formalise the concept of a system that behaves as if it were pursuing a goal, we consider what happens when a transducer (a 'policy') is coupled to another transducer that comes equipped with a success condition (a 'teleo-environment'). An optimal policy is identified with a transducer that behaves as if it were perfectly rational in the pursuit of a goal; our framework also allows us to model constrained rationality.
  Optimal policies obey a version of Bellman's principle: a policy that's optimal in one time step will again be optimal in the next time step, but with respect to a different teleo-environment (obtained from the original one by a modified version of Bayesian filtering). This property sometimes also applies to the bounded-rational case; we give a sufficient condition.
  A policy is deterministic if and only if there exists a teleo-environment for which it is uniquely optimal among the set of all policies; we relate this to classical representation theorems from decision theory. This result need not hold in the bounded-rational case; we give an example related to the absent-minded driver problem. The formalism is defined using coinduction, following the style proposed by Czajka.</description>

      <title>Estimation-Aware Trajectory Optimization with Set-Valued Measurement Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an optimization-based framework for generating estimation-aware trajectories in scenarios where measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</description>

      <title>Control Barrier Function-Based Safety Filters: Characterization of Undesired Equilibria, Unbounded Trajectories, and Limit Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on safety filters designed based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs): these are modifications of a nominal stabilizing controller typically utilized in safety-critical control applications to render a given subset of states forward invariant. The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</description>

      <title>Robust UAV Path Planning with Obstacle Avoidance for Emergency Rescue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are efficient tools for diverse tasks such as electronic reconnaissance, agricultural operations and disaster relief. In the complex three-dimensional (3D) environments, the path planning with obstacle avoidance for UAVs is a significant issue for security assurance. In this paper, we construct a comprehensive 3D scenario with obstacles and no-fly zones for dynamic UAV trajectory. Moreover, a novel artificial potential field algorithm coupled with simulated annealing (APF-SA) is proposed to tackle the robust path planning problem. APF-SA modifies the attractive and repulsive potential functions and leverages simulated annealing to escape local minimum and converge to globally optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that the effectiveness of APF-SA, enabling efficient autonomous path planning for UAVs with obstacle avoidance.</description>

      <title>Path Planning for a UAV Swarm Using Formation Teaching-Learning-Based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the path planning problem for a group of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to maintain a desired formation during operation. Our approach formulates the problem as an optimization task by defining a set of fitness functions that not only ensure the formation but also include constraints for optimal and safe UAV operation. To optimize the fitness function and obtain a suboptimal path, we employ the teaching-learning-based optimization algorithm and then further enhance it with mechanisms such as mutation, elite strategy, and multi-subject combination. A number of simulations and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the proposed method. The results demonstrate that the algorithm successfully generates valid paths for the UAVs to fly in a triangular formation for an inspection task.</description>

      <title>HpC: A Calculus for Hybrid and Mobile Systems -- Full Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Networked cybernetic and physical systems of the Internet of Things (IoT) immerse civilian and industrial infrastructures into an interconnected and dynamic web of hybrid and mobile devices. The key feature of such systems is the hybrid and tight coupling of mobile and pervasive discrete communications in a continuously evolving environment (discrete computations with predominant continuous dynamics). In the aim of ensuring the correctness and reliability of such heterogeneous infrastructures, we introduce the hybrid {\pi}-calculus (HpC), to formally capture both mobility, pervasiveness and hybridisation in infrastructures where the network topology and its communicating entities evolve continuously in the physical world. The {\pi}-calculus proposed by Robin Milner et al. is a process calculus that can model mobile communications and computations in a very elegant manner. The HpC we propose is a conservative extension of the classical {\pi}-calculus, i.e., the extension is ``minimal'', and yet describes mobility, time and physics of systems, while allowing to lift all theoretical results (e.g. bisimulation) to the context of that extension. We showcase the HpC by considering a realistic handover protocol among mobile devices.</description>

      <title>Intra-day Solar and Power Forecast for Optimization of Intraday Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a general framework for safe control and learning based on the generalized action governor (AG). The AG is a supervisory scheme for augmenting a nominal closed-loop system with the ability of strictly handling prescribed safety constraints. In the first part of this article, we present a generalized AG methodology and analyze its key properties in a general setting. Then, we introduce tailored AG design approaches derived from the generalized methodology for linear and discrete systems. Afterward, we discuss the application of the generalized AG to facilitate safe online learning, which aims at safely evolving control parameters using real-time data to enhance control performance in uncertain systems. We present two safe learning algorithms based on, respectively, reinforcement learning and data-driven Koopman operator-based control integrated with the generalized AG to exemplify this application. Finally, we illustrate the developments with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Predictive Control for the Treatment of Hyperthyroidism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an approach to determine the dosages of antithyroid agents to treat hyperthyroid patients. Instead of relying on a trial-and-error approach as it is commonly done in clinical practice, we suggest to determine the dosages by means of a model predictive control (MPC) scheme. To this end, we first extend a mathematical model of the pituitary-thyroid feedback loop such that the intake of methimazole, a common antithyroid agent, can be considered. Second, based on the extended model, we develop an MPC scheme to determine suitable dosages. In numerical simulations, we consider scenarios in which (i) patients are affected by Graves' disease and take the medication orally and (ii) patients suffering from a life-threatening thyrotoxicosis, in which the medication is usually given intravenously. Our conceptual study suggests that determining the medication dosages by means of an MPC scheme could be a promising alternative to the currently applied trial-and-error approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article investigates the resilient control problem for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) with multiple sensors, where both sides of the communication channels are affected by Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. While previous work focused on characterizing Multi-Channel DoS (MCDoS), this study emphasizes the characterization of Full-Scale DoS (FSDoS). First, a partial observer technique is proposed to address the MCDoS condition. Then, an event-triggered control strategy is designed to handle FSDoS. Finally, the frequency and duration of FSDoS are analyzed to ensure the Input-to-State Stability (ISS) of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Observability for Nonlinear Systems: Connecting Variational Dynamics, Lyapunov Exponents, and Empirical Gramians</title>

Abstract: Observability quantification is a key problem in dynamic network sciences. While it has been thoroughly studied for linear systems, observability quantification for nonlinear networks is less intuitive and more cumbersome. One common approach to quantify observability for nonlinear systems is via the Empirical Gramian (Empr-Gram) -- a generalized form of the Gramian of linear systems. In this paper, we produce three new results. First, we establish that a variational form of discrete-time autonomous nonlinear systems (computed via perturbing initial conditions) yields a so-called Variational Gramian (Var-Gram) that is equivalent to the classic Empr-Gram; the former being easier to compute than the latter. Via Lyapunov exponents derived from Lyapunov's direct method, the paper's second result derives connections between existing observability measures and Var-Gram. The third result demonstrates the applicability of these new notions for sensor selection/placement in nonlinear systems. Numerical case studies demonstrate these three developments and their merits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing based Power Grid Partitioning for Parallel Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph partitioning has many applications in powersystems from decentralized state estimation to parallel simulation. Focusing on parallel simulation, optimal grid partitioning minimizes the idle time caused by different simulation times for the sub-networks and their components and reduces the overhead required to simulate the cuts. Partitioning a graph into two parts such that, for example, the cut is minimal and the subgraphs have equal size is an NP-hard problem. In this paper we show how optimal partitioning of a graph can be obtained using quantum annealing (QA). We show how to map the requirements for optimal splitting to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formulation and test the proposed formulation using a current D-Wave QPU. We show that the necessity to find an embedding of the QUBO on current D-Wave QPUs limits the problem size to under 200 buses and notably affects the time-to-solution. We finally discuss the implications on near-term implementation of QA in combination to traditional CPU or GPU based simulation.</description>

      <title>Lateral String Stability in Autonomous &amp; Connected Vehicle Platoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the lateral control of Autonomous and Connected Vehicles (ACVs) in a platoon executing an Emergency Lane Change (ELC) maneuver. These maneuvers are typically triggered by emergency signals from the front or rear of the platoon in response to the need to avoid obstacles or allow other vehicles to pass. The study assumes that ACVs maintain reliable connectivity, enabling each following vehicle to access GPS position traces of both the lead and immediately preceding vehicles in the platoon. We demonstrate that lateral string stability in the ACV platoon can be achieved using communicated information solely from the lead and preceding vehicles. Additionally, we present a lateral control framework for ACVs, which helps track a discretized preview of the trajectory constructed from the communicated data. This framework involves constructing two distinct trajectories based on the preview data from the lead and preceding vehicles, calculating the associated errors and lateral control actions for each, and then integrating these to generate a steering command. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed lateral control scheme.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Secret and Covert Communications for Multi-User Multi-Antenna Uplink UAV Systems: Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by diverse secure requirements of multi-user in UAV systems, we propose a collaborative secret and covert transmission method for multi-antenna ground users to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communications. Specifically, based on the power domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), two ground users with distinct security requirements, named Bob and Carlo, superimpose their signals and transmit the combined signal to the UAV named Alice. An adversary Willie attempts to simultaneously eavesdrop Bob's confidential message and detect whether Carlo is transmitting or not. We derive close-form expressions of the secrecy connection probability (SCP) and the covert connection probability (CCP) to evaluate the link reliability for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. Furthermore, we bound the secrecy outage probability (SOP) from Bob to Alice and the detection error probability (DEP) of Willie to evaluate the link security for wiretap and covert transmissions, respectively. To characterize the theoretical benchmark of the above model, we formulate a weighted multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the average of secret and covert transmission rates subject to constraints SOP, DEP, the beamformers of Bob and Carlo, and UAV trajectory parameters. To solve the optimization problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm using successive convex approximation and block coordinate descent (SCA-BCD) methods. Our results reveal the influence of design parameters of the system on the wiretap and covert rates, analytically and numerically. In summary, our study fills the gaps in joint secret and covert transmission for multi-user multi-antenna uplink UAV communications and provides insights to construct such systems.</description>
