      <title>Uniform large deviation principles for SDEs under locally weak monotonicity conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a criterion on uniform large deviation principles (ULDP) for stochastic differential equations under locally weak monotone conditions and Lyapunov conditions, which can be applied to stochastic systems with coefficients of polynomial growth and possible degenerate driving noises, including the stochastic Hamiltonian systems. The weak convergence method plays an important role in obtaining the ULDP. This result extends the scope of applications of the main theorem in \cite{WYZZ}.</description>

      <title>On the prospective minimum of the random walk conditioned to stay non-negative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \begin{equation*} S_{0}=0,\quad S_{n}=X_{1}+...+X_{n},\ n\geq 1, \end{equation*} be a random walk whose increments belong without centering to the domain of attraction of a stable law with scaling constants $a_{n}$, that provide convergence as $n\rightarrow \infty $ of the distributions of the elements of the sequence $\left\{ S_{n}/a_{n},n=1,2,...\right\} $ to this stable law. Let $L_{r,n}=\min_{r\leq m\leq n}S_{m}$ be the minimum of the random walk on the interval $[r,n]$. It is shown that \begin{equation*} \lim_{r,k,n\rightarrow \infty }\mathbf{P}\left( L_{r,n}\leq ya_{k}|S_{n}\leq ta_{k},L_{0,n}\geq 0\right) ,\, t\in \left( 0,\infty \right), \end{equation*} can have five different expressions, the forms of which depend on the relationships between the parameters $r,k$ and $n$.</description>

      <title>A spatial model for dormancy in random environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a spatial model for dormancy in random environment via a two-type branching random walk in continuous-time, where individuals can switch between dormant and active states through spontaneous switching independent of the random environment. However, the branching mechanism is governed by a random environment which dictates the branching rates. We consider three specific choices for random environments composed of particles: (1) a Bernoulli field of immobile particles, (2) one moving particle, and (3) a Poisson field of moving particles. In each case, the particles of the random environment can either be interpreted as catalysts, accelerating the branching mechanism, or as traps, aiming to kill the individuals. The different between active and dormant individuals is defined in such a way that dormant individuals are protected from being trapped, but do not participate in migration or branching. We quantify the influence of dormancy on the growth resp. survival of the population by identifying the large-time asymptotics of the expected population size. The starting point for our mathematical considerations and proofs is the parabolic Anderson model via the Feynman- Kac formula. Especially, the quantitative investigation of the role of dormancy is done by extending the Parabolic Anderson model to a two-type random walk.</description>

      <title>A min-max random game on a graph that is not a tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a random game in which two players in turn play a fixed number of moves. For each move, there are two possible choices. To each possible outcome of the game we assign a winner in an i.i.d. fashion with a fixed parameter p. In the case where all different game histories lead to different outcomes, a classical result due to Pearl (1980) says that in the limit when the number of moves is large, there is a sharp threshold in the parameter p that separates the regimes in which either player has with high probability a winning strategy. We are interested in a modification of this game where the outcome is determined by the exact sequence of moves played by the first player and by the number of times the second player has played each of the two possible moves. We show that also in this case, there is a sharp threshold in the parameter p that separates the regimes in which either player has with high probability a winning strategy. Since in the modified game, different game histories can lead to the same outcome, the graph associated with the game is no longer a tree which means independence is lost. As a result, the analysis becomes more complicated and open problems remain.</description>

      <title>Universality theorems for zeros of random real polynomials with fixed coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a monic polynomial of degree $n$ whose subleading coefficients are independent, identically distributed, nondegenerate random variables having zero mean, unit variance, and finite moments of all orders, and let $m \geq 0$ be a fixed integer. We prove that such a random monic polynomial has exactly $m$ real zeros with probability $n^{-b+o(1)}$ as $n\to \infty$ through integers of the same parity as $m$, where $b \approx 0.76$ is a positive constant. More generally, we determine conditions under which a similar asymptotic formula describes the corresponding probability for families of random real polynomials with multiple fixed coefficients. Our work extends well-known universality results of Dembo, Poonen, Shao, and Zeitouni, whose considered the family of real polynomials with all coefficients random.
  As a number-theoretic consequence of these results, we deduce that an algebraic integer $\alpha$ of degree $n$ has exactly $m$ real Galois conjugates with probability $n^{-b+o(1)}$, when such $\alpha$ are ordered by the heights of their minimal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Weak solution for Stochastic Degasperis-Procesi Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the existence of solution to the stochastic Degasperis-Procesi equation on $\mathbb{R}$ with an infinite dimensional multiplicative noise and integrable initial data.
  Writing the equation as a system composed of a stochastic nonlinear conservation law and an elliptic equation, we are able to develop a method based on the conjugation of kinetic theory with stochastic compactness arguments. More precisely, we first apply the stochastic Jakubowski-Skorokhod representation theorem to show the existence of a weak kinetic martingale solution.
  Next, we prove the pathwise uniqueness and invoke the Yamada-Watanabe-Engelbert theorem to conclude that the solution is strong in the probabilistic sense.
  In this framework, the solution is a stochastic process with sample paths in Lebesgue spaces, which are compatible with peakons and wave breaking physical phenomenon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss new bounds for the normal approximation of multivariate Poisson functionals under minimal moment assumptions. Such bounds require one to estimate moments of so-called add-one costs of the functional. Previous works required the estimation of $4^{\text{th}}$ moments, while our result only requires $(2 + \epsilon)$-moments, based on recent improvements introduced by (Trauthwein 2022). As applications, we show quantitative CLTs for two multivariate functionals of the Gilbert, or random geometric, graph. These examples were out of range for previous methods.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems for the monkey walk with steep memory kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monkey walk is a stochastic process defined as the trajectory of a walker that moves on $\mathbb R^d$ according to a Markovian generator, except at some random "relocation" times at which it jumps back to its position at a time sampled randomly in its past, according to some "memory kernel". The relocations make the process non-Markovian and introduce a reinforcement effect (the walker is more likely to relocate in a Borel set in which it has spent a lot of time in the past). In this paper, we focus on "steep" memory kernels: in these cases, the time sampled in the past at each relocation time is likely to be quite recent. One can see this as a way to model the case when the walker quickly "forgets" its past. We prove limit theorems for the position of the walker at large times, which confirm and generalise the estimates available in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations for non-Hermitian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that under the Brownian evolution on large non-Hermitian matrices the log-determinant converges in distribution to a 2+1 dimensional Gaussian field in the Edwards-Wilkinson regularity class, namely it is logarithmically correlated for the parabolic distance. This dynamically extends a seminal result by Rider and Vir\'ag about convergence to the Gaussian free field. The convergence holds out of equilibrium for centered, i.i.d. matrix entries as an initial condition.
  A remarkable aspect of the limiting field is its non-Markovianity, due to long range correlations of the eigenvector overlaps, for which we identify the exact space-time polynomial decay.
  In the proof, we obtain a quantitative, optimal relaxation at the hard edge, for a broad extension of the Dyson Brownian motion, with a driving noise arbitrarily correlated in space.</description>

      <title>Limiting eigenvalue distribution of the general deformed Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the $n\times n$ matrix $X_n=A_n+H_n$, where $A_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix (either deterministic or random) and $H_n$ is a $n\times n$ matrix independent from $A_n$ drawn from complex Ginibre ensemble. We study the limiting eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$. In arXiv:0807.4898 it was shown that the eigenvalue distribution of $X_n$ converges to some deterministic measure. This measure is known for the case $A_n=0$. Under some general convergence conditions on $A_n$ we prove a formula for the density of the limiting measure. We also obtain an estimation on the rate of convergence of the distribution. The approach used here is based on supersymmetric integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long time behavior of second order particle systems interacting through global Lipschitz kernels. Combining hypocoercivity method in [37] and relative entropy method in [25], we are able to overcome the degeneracy of diffusion in position direction by controlling the relative entropy and relative Fisher information together. This implies the uniform-in-time propagation of chaos through the strong convergence of all marginals. Our method works at the level of Liouville equation and relies on the log Sobolev inequality of equilibrium of Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation.</description>

      <title>Exact first passage time distribution for second-order reactions in chemical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first passage time (FPT) is a generic measure that quantifies when a random quantity reaches a specific state. We consider the FTP distribution in nonlinear stochastic biochemical networks, where obtaining exact solutions of the distribution is a challenging problem. Even simple two-particle collisions cause strong nonlinearities that hinder the theoretical determination of the full FPT distribution. Previous research has either focused on analyzing the mean FPT, which provides limited information about a system, or has considered time-consuming stochastic simulations that do not clearly expose causal relationships between parameters and the system's dynamics. This paper presents the first exact theoretical solution of the full FPT distribution in a broad class of chemical reaction networks involving $A + B \rightarrow C$ type of second-order reactions. Our exact theoretical method outperforms stochastic simulations, in terms of computational efficiency, and deviates from approximate analytical solutions. Given the prevalence of bimolecular reactions in biochemical systems, our approach has the potential to enhance the understanding of real-world biochemical processes.</description>

      <title>A refined random matrix model for function field L-functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a refinement of the random matrix model for a certain family of $L$-functions over $\mathbb F_q[u]$, using techniques that we hope will eventually apply to an arbitrary family of $L$-functions. This consists of a probability distribution on power series in $q^{-s}$ which combines properties of the characteristic polynomials of Haar-random unitary matrices and random Euler products over $\mathbb F_q[u]$. The support of our distribution is contained in the intersection of the supports of the two original distributions. The expectations of low-degree polynomials in the coefficients of our series approximate the expectations of the same polynomials in the coefficients of random Euler products, while the expectations of high-degree polynomials approximate the expectations of the same polynomials in the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of random matrices. Furthermore, the expectations of absolute powers of our series approximate the Conrey-Farmer-Keating-Rubinstein-Snaith/Andrade-Keating prediction for the moments of our family of $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Bulk Spectra of Truncated Sample Covariance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), which originate from quantum and statistical physics, are known for modelling diversity. Recent research [Ghosh and Rigollet (2020)] has demonstrated that certain matrix-valued $U$-statistics (that are truncated versions of the usual sample covariance matrix) can effectively estimate parameters in the context of Gaussian DPPs and enhance dimension reduction techniques, outperforming standard methods like PCA in clustering applications. This paper explores the spectral properties of these matrix-valued $U$-statistics in the null setting of an isotropic design. These matrices may be represented as $X L X^\top$, where $X$ is a data matrix and $L$ is the Laplacian matrix of a random geometric graph associated to $X$. The main mathematically interesting twist here is that the matrix $L$ is dependent on $X$. We give complete descriptions of the bulk spectra of these matrix-valued $U$-statistics in terms of the Stieltjes transforms of their empirical spectral measures. The results and the techniques are in fact able to address a broader class of kernelised random matrices, connecting their limiting spectra to generalised Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur laws and free probability.</description>

      <title>Variance Inequalities for Transformed Fr\'echet Means in Hadamard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean (or barycenter) generalizes the expectation of a random variable to metric spaces by minimizing the expected squared distance to the random variable. Similarly, the median can be generalized by its property of minimizing the expected absolute distance. We consider the class of transformed Fr\'echet means with nondecreasing, convex transformations that have a concave derivative. This class includes the Fr\'echet median, the Fr\'echet mean, the Huber loss-induced Fr\'echet mean, and other statistics related to robust statistics in metric spaces. We study variance inequalities for these transformed Fr\'echet means. These inequalities describe how the expected transformed distance grows when moving away from a minimizer, i.e., from a transformed Fr\'echet mean. Variance inequalities are useful in the theory of estimation and numerical approximation of transformed Fr\'echet means. Our focus is on variance inequalities in Hadamard spaces - metric spaces with globally nonpositive curvature. Notably, some results are new also for Euclidean spaces. Additionally, we are able to characterize uniqueness of transformed Fr\'echet means, in particular of the Fr\'echet median.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fractional moments and expectations of power means of complex-valued random variables by using fractional calculus. We deal with both negative and positive orders of the fractional derivatives. The one-dimensional distributions are characterized in terms of the fractional moments without any moment assumptions. We explicitly compute the expectations of the power means for both the univariate Cauchy distribution and the Poincar\'e distribution on the upper-half plane. We show that for these distributions the expectations are invariant with respect to the sample size and the value of the power.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rate Analysis in Limit Theorems for Nonlinear Functionals of the Second Wiener Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to analyze the distribution distance between random vectors derived from the magnitude of the analytic wavelet transform of the squared envelopes of Gaussian processes and their large-scale limits. When the Hurst index of the underlying Gaussian process falls below 1/2, the large-scale limit takes the form of a combination of the second and fourth Wiener chaos. In this case, we employ the non-Stein approach to determine the convergence rate in the Kolmogorov metric. In scenarios where the Hurst index of the underlying Gaussian process exceeds 1/2, the large-scale limit is a correlated chi-distributed random process with two degrees of freedom. The convergence rate in the Wasserstein metric is derived through the application of Malliavin calculus and multidimensional Stein's method. Although the large-scale limits are the same for Hurst indices within the interval (1/2,1), notable differences in the upper bounds of convergence rates are observed among Hurst indices falling within the subintervals (1/2,3/4) and (3/4,1).</description>

      <title>From 0 to 3: Intermediate phases between normal and anomalous spreading of two-type branching Brownian motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logarithmic correction for the order of the maximum of a two-type reducible branching Brownian motion on the real line exhibits a double jump when the parameters (the ratio of the diffusion coefficients of the two types of particles, and the ratio of the branching rates the two types of particles) cross the boundary of the anomalous spreading region identified by Biggins.
  In this paper, we further examine this double jump phenomenon by studying a two-type reducible branching Brownian motion on the real line with its parameters depend on the time horizon t. We show that when the parameters approach the boundaries of the anomalous spreading region in an appropriate way, the order of the maximum can interpolate smoothly between different surrounding regimes. We also determine the asymptotic law of the maximum and characterize the extremal process.</description>

      <title>Spatial Queues with Nearest Neighbour Shifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies queues in a Euclidean space. Consider $N$ servers that are distributed uniformly in $[0,1]^d$. Customers arrive at the servers according to independent stationary processes. Upon arrival, they probabilistically decide whether to join the queue they arrived at, or shift to one of the nearest neighbours. Such shifting strategies affect the load on the servers, and may cause some of the servers to become overloaded. We derive a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the fraction of overloaded servers in the system as the total number of servers $N \to \infty$. Additionally, in the one-dimensional case ($d=1$), we evaluate the expected fraction of overloaded servers for any finite $N$. Numerical experiments are provided to support our theoretical results. Typical applications of the results include electric vehicles queueing at charging stations, and queues in airports or supermarkets.</description>

Abstract: The combination of functional limit theorems with the pathwise analysis of deterministic and stochastic differential equations has proven to be a powerful approach to the analysis of fast-slow systems. In a multivariate setting, this requires rough path ideas, as already suggested in the seminal work [Melbourne-Stuart, Nonlinearity, 24, 2011]. This initiated a program pursued by numerous authors and which has required substantial results on invariance principles (also known as functional central limit theorems) in rough path topologies. We take a unified point of view and provide simple and exact formulas, of the Green-Kubo type, that characterize the relevant Brownian rough path limits and discuss how they naturally apply in different settings.</description>

      <title>Potential Hessian Ascent: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first iterative spectral algorithm to find near-optimal solutions for a random quadratic objective over the discrete hypercube, resolving a conjecture of Subag [Subag, Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 74(5), 2021].
  The algorithm is a randomized Hessian ascent in the solid cube, with the objective modified by subtracting an instance-independent potential function [Chen et al., Communications on Pure and Applied Mathematics, 76(7), 2023].
  Using tools from free probability theory, we construct an approximate projector into the top eigenspaces of the Hessian, which serves as the covariance matrix for the random increments. With high probability, the iterates' empirical distribution approximates the solution to the primal version of the Auffinger-Chen SDE [Auffinger et al., Communications in Mathematical Physics, 335, 2015]. The per-iterate change in the modified objective is bounded via a Taylor expansion, where the derivatives are controlled through Gaussian concentration bounds and smoothness properties of a semiconcave regularization of the Fenchel-Legendre dual to the Parisi PDE.
  These results lay the groundwork for (possibly) demonstrating low-degree sum-of-squares certificates over high-entropy step distributions for a relaxed version of the Parisi formula [Open Question 1.8, arXiv:2401.14383].</description>

      <title>Malliavin calculus on the Clifford algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with Malliavin calculus on the $L^2$ space of the $W^*$-algebra generated by fermion fields (the Clifford algebra). First, we verify the product formula for multiple integrals in It\^o-Clifford calculus, which is It\^o calculus on the Clifford algebra. Using this product formula, we can define the derivation operator and the divergence operator. Anti-symmetric Malliavin calculus thus constructed has properties similar to those of usual Malliavin calculus. The derivation operator and the divergence operator satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations, and the divergence operator serves as an extension of the It\^o-Clifford stochastic integral, satisfying the Clark-Ocone formula. Subsequently, using this calculus, we consider the concentration inequality, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and the fourth-moment theorem. For the concentration inequality, we obtain results that are almost similar to those of the usual case. For the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, we did not achieve significant results. The results concerning the fourth-moment theorem imply that, unlike in the case of the usual Brownian motion, convergence in distribution cannot be deduced from the convergence of the fourth moment.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonparametric Bayesian inference in a multidimensional diffusion model with reflecting boundary conditions based on discrete high-frequency observations. We prove a general posterior contraction rate theorem in $L^2$-loss, which is applied to Gaussian priors. The resulting posteriors, as well as their posterior means, are shown to converge to the ground truth at the minimax optimal rate over H\"older smoothness classes in any dimension. Of independent interest and as part of our proofs, we show that certain frequentist penalized least squares estimators are also minimax optimal.</description>

      <title>Structural Measures of Resilience for Supply Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structural factors that drive cascading failures in production networks, focusing on quantifying these risks with a topological resilience metric corresponding to the largest exogenous systemic shock that the production network can withstand, such that almost all of the network survives with high probability. We model failures using a node percolation process where systemic shocks cause suppliers to fail, leading to further breakdowns. We classify networks into two categories -- resilient and fragile -- based on their ability to handle shocks as the network grows large, and give bounds on their resilience. We show that the main factors affecting resilience are the number of raw products (primary sector), the number of final goods (final sector), and the source and supply dependencies. Further, we give methods to lower bound resilience based on bounding the cascade size with a linear program that can be efficiently calculated. We establish connections between our model, the independent cascade model, the Risk Exposure Index, and the Eisenberg-Noe contagion model. We give an almost linear-time deterministic algorithm to approximate the cascade size, which matches known lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Finally, we design intervention algorithms and show that under reasonable assumptions, targeting nodes based on Katz centrality in the edge-reversed network is optimal. Finally, we account for network heterogeneities and validate our findings with real-world data.</description>

      <title>A microlocal investigation of stochastic partial differential equations for spinors with an application to the Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a $d$-dimensional Riemannian, spin manifold $(M,g)$ we consider non-linear, stochastic partial differential equations for spinor fields, driven by a Dirac operator and coupled to an additive Gaussian, vector-valued white noise. We extend to the case in hand a procedure, introduced in [DDRZ20] for the scalar counterpart, which allows to compute at a perturbative level the expectation value of the solutions as well as the associated correlation functions accounting intrinsically for the underlying renormalization freedoms. This framework relies strongly on tools proper of microlocal analysis and it is inspired by the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. As a concrete example we apply it to a stochastic version of the Thirring model proving in particular that it lies in the subcritical regime if $d\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Tensor product algorithms for inference of contact network from epidemiological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a problem of inferring contact network from nodal states observed during an epidemiological process. In a black--box Bayesian optimisation framework this problem reduces to a discrete likelihood optimisation over the set of possible networks. The cardinality of this set grows combinatorially with the number of network nodes, which makes this optimisation computationally challenging. For each network, its likelihood is the probability for the observed data to appear during the evolution of the epidemiological process on this network. This probability can be very small, particularly if the network is significantly different from the ground truth network, from which the observed data actually appear. A commonly used stochastic simulation algorithm struggles to recover rare events and hence to estimate small probabilities and likelihoods. In this paper we replace the stochastic simulation with solving the chemical master equation for the probabilities of all network states. Since this equation also suffers from the curse of dimensionality, we apply tensor train approximations to overcome it and enable fast and accurate computations. Numerical simulations demonstrate efficient black--box Bayesian inference of the network.</description>

Abstract: We present algorithms for generating small random samples without replacement. We consider two cases. We present an algorithm for sampling a pair of distinct integers, and an algorithm for sampling a triple of distinct integers. The worst-case runtime of both algorithms is constant, while the worst-case runtimes of common algorithms for the general case of sampling $k$ elements from a set of $n$ increase with $n$. Java implementations of both algorithms are included in the open source library $\rho\mu$.</description>
