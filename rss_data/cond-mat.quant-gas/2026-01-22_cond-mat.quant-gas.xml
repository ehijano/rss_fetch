      <title>Ab initio path-integral Monte Carlo results for the one-particle spectral function of the warm dense electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute quasi-exact \emph{ab initio} path-integral Monte Carlo results for the Matsubara Green's function of the uniform electron gas (UEG) at finite temperature over a broad range of coupling strengths ($r_s=1,\dots,10)$. This allows us to present approximation-free results for the static self-energy $\Sigma_\infty(p)$ and spectral function $A(p,\omega)$, and to benchmark previous approximate results for the UEG. In addition, our work opens up intriguing avenues to study the single-particle spectrum and density of states of real warm dense matter systems based on truly first principles.</description>

      <title>Stimulated cooling in non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the experimental observation of stimulated cooling in the non-equilibrium Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of weakly interacting exciton-polaritons from approximately room temperature down to 20K. By resolving the condensate in energy-momentum space and performing interferometric measurements, we distinguish the condensate from thermalized particles yet occupying excited states macroscopically. In contrast to the analytical quantum theories of non-equilibrium BEC [Shishkov et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 065301 (2022)], we observe segmentation of the particle density along the excited states into two fractions both following Bose-Einstein distribution, albeit with different effective temperatures and chemical potentials. Our results indicate that the temperature of the weakly interacting Bose gas is universally set by the density-dependent chemical potential, revealing a defining property of non-equilibrium BECs. Finally, we demonstrate that the stimulated nature of the cooling process directly governs the emergence of quantum coherence of the condensate and shapes the dissipative properties of the excited states.</description>

      <title>The exact dynamical structure factor of one-dimensional hard rods and its universal random matrix behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain an exact analytic expression for the dynamical structure factor of one-dimensional quantum gas of hard rods. Our result is valid for arbitrary many-body state of the system, with finite temperature states and the ground state being important special cases that we analyse in detail. We demonstrate that the expression obeys fundamental relations such like the f-sum rule and the detailed balance. We also reveal the hidden fermionic structure behind the correlator. In the static limit we show that it can be written in terms of universal functions which, at zero temperature, coincide with the level spacing distribution function of the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble. Our work provides a full and exact characterisation of a dynamic correlation function in a strongly correlated interacting quantum many-body system.</description>

      <title>Cooperative stabilization of persistent currents in superfluid ring networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15121v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperative effects in oscillator networks are often associated with enhanced stability of phase-locked solutions, which increases with system size. We show that the stabilization of persistent currents in annular atomic superfluids with periodic barriers is a concrete manifestation of this phenomenon. Under the simplifying assumption of continuity of atomic flow across identical barriers, the system reduces to a ring of locally coupled Kuramoto-like oscillators. We analytically derive the stability diagram of phase-locked configurations and quantify their robustness to noise and small random initial imperfections, finding excellent agreement with experimental observations. These results are inherent to the ring topology and independent of the specific physical platform.</description>

      <title>Increasing the stability of a superfluid in a rotating necklace potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have probed the stability of ring superfluids in the presence of Josephson barriers or Gaussian impurities. Here we present a theoretical analysis that extends beyond the regimes explored so far. We study the onset of dynamical instabilities induced by a one-dimensional potential rotating at an effective angular velocity $\omega$, addressing both the tunneling and the hydrodynamic regimes. We show that the critical angular velocity $\omega_c$ increases almost linearly with the number of barriers, with a slope set by their height and width. When the system is quenched into the dynamically unstable regime, it emits multiple solitons, which can switch or even reverse the direction of circulation. The stabilization mechanism is robust against imperfections of the potential and does not require a perfectly periodic array of barriers. In particular, we find that adding a disordered speckle potential to an ordered array of barriers can further increase $\omega_c$: disorder can therefore make a ring superfluid more resilient to dynamical instabilities.</description>

      <title>Trimer Dynamics in Floquet-driven arrays of Rydberg Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the WAHUHA Floquet protocol recently applied to arrays of Rydberg atoms and derive beyond-leading-order corrections in the high-frequency expansion of the effective spin theory. We find that an appropriate choice of the pulses times can enforce an approximate symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total magnetization. The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floquet terms affect three-body bound states (\emph{trimers}), which gain a significant mobility. We estimate the corresponding enhancement in 1D spin chains and conclude that their dynamics is within experimental reach. Detrimental effects due to the proliferation of particles outside of the trimer magnetization sector are found to occur and spread on time-scales slower than the trimer propagation. Moreover, these can be suppressed in higher dimensional lattices, e.g. in 2D triangular lattices, as the lattice geometry brings these processes off resonance. Our results establish a concrete route to realizing mobile multiparticle bound states in Floquet-engineered Rydberg platforms.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in atomic stratified media: breakdown of the transfer-matrix method at high density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transfer-matrix method is a standard approach to wave propagation in stratified media. With the advent of cold-atom-based quantum and photonic technologies, several experiments and many proposals consider light propagation in one-dimensional optical lattices, using the transfer matrices as the main tool for the simulation. Here, we study the validity of this method by comparing its results to the microscopic coupled-dipole model, which is exact in the linear-optics regime. We show that the transfer-matrix method works very well at low density, even for thin disordered slices, and breaks down at high density because the dipole-dipole interaction induces a collective response from the atoms such that the properties of one layer are influenced by the others. We determine the boundary values of atomic densities for which this method is still applicable for describing experiments. Our findings are relevant for experimental realizations using ultra-cold atoms.</description>

      <title>Dielectric formalism of the 2D uniform electron gas at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the two-dimensional uniform electron gas (2D-UEG or more commonly 2DEG) at finite temperature, spanning a broad range of densities / coupling strengths ($0.01\le{r}_s\le20$) and temperatures / degeneracy parameters ($0.01\le\Theta= k_B T/E_F \le 10$). Within the self-consistent dielectric formalism, we construct two-dimensional versions of the Singwi-Tosi-Land-Sj\"olander (STLS) and hypernetted-chain (HNC) approximation based schemes. We benchmark the accuracy of the STLS and the HNC schemes against new state-of-the-art path-integral Monte Carlo data. We also report structural and thermodynamic properties across the full $(r_s,\Theta)$ phase diagram domain studied, identify regimes in which these schemes remain quantitatively reliable, and provide an accurate parametrization of the exchange--correlation free energy of the finite-temperature 2DEG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15163v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Strong and weak wave turbulence regimes in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19812v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a turbulent Bose-Einstein condensate is driven out-of-equilibrium at a scale much smaller than the system size, nonlinear wave interactions transfer particles towards large scales in an inverse cascade process. In this work, we study numerically wave turbulence in a three-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate increases, thereby increasing the particle flux, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterized by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increases lead to a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogoliubov-type acoustic turbulence. The role of vortices in such a strongly forced state is marginal, which makes this new state very different from the strongly turbulent state composed of a tangle of quantized vortex lines. We then use our predictions and numerical data to formulate a new out-of-equilibrium equation of state for the 3D inverse cascade.</description>

      <title>Generalised BBGKY hierarchy for near-integrable dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00593v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum and classical many-body Hamiltonian systems that combine integrable contact interactions with generic long-range two-body potentials. We show that the dynamics of local observables can be cast into a generalized Bogoliubov-Born-Green-Kirkwood-Yvon (gBBGKY) hierarchy formulated in terms of the quasiparticle densities of the underlying integrable model and their correlations. Starting from an ansatz for the state at time $t$, which we call the correlated fluid-cell ensemble, we derive this hierarchy and prove that it reproduces exactly the time evolution of one- and multi-point correlation functions in perturbed integrable models, at all times. We validate these predictions against microscopic molecular-dynamics simulations, finding perfect agreement. At late times, the one-particle distribution relaxes via a Boltzmann-type scattering integral encoding the interplay between integrable contact processes and long-range collisions, whereas higher-point correlations remain strongly non-thermal on thermalization time scales, indicative of a form of incomplete or generalised thermalisation. Focusing on long-range dipolar quantum gases, where the relevant matrix elements can be obtained explicitly, we show that our collision integral reduces exactly to the Fermi golden rule result and provide a complete theoretical account of the experimental observations of Tang et al. (Phys.Rev.X 8, 021030 (2018)). More broadly, our framework extends the BBGKY program to regimes with strong local interactions, and applies to a wide class of experimentally relevant systems, from one-dimensional dipolar cold-atom gases to Lennard-Jones molecular fluids.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Wavefunction of the Interacting Non-Hermitian Spin-1/2 1D System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an explicit Bethe-ansatz wavefunction to a 1D spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ interacting fermion system, manifesting a many-body resonance resulting from the interplay between interaction and non-Hermitian spin-orbit coupling. In the dilute limit, the Bethe-ansatz wavefunction is factorized into Slater determinants and a Jastrow factor. An effective thermodynamic distribution is constructed with an effective Hamiltonian including a repulsion resulting from Pauli's exclusion principle and a distinctive zigzag potential arising from the resonance. The competition between these effects leads to a transition from a uniformly distributed configuration to a phase separation. Clustering of particles with identical spins is observed in the latter phase, demonstrating that the many-body resonance effect is enhanced by the repulsive interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10344v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02912v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a framework for extracting non-polynomial analytic functions of density matrices in randomized measurement experiments by a method of analytical continuation. A central advantage of this approach, dubbed stabilized analytic continuation (SAC), is its robustness to statistical noise arising from finite repetitions of a quantum experiment, making it well-suited to realistic quantum hardware. As a demonstration, we use SAC to estimate the von Neumann entanglement entropy of a numerically simulated quenched N\'eel state from R\'enyi entropies estimated via the randomized measurement protocol. We then apply the method to experimental R\'enyi data from a trapped-ion quantum simulator, extracting subsystem von Neumann entropies at different evolution times. Finally, we briefly note that the SAC framework is readily generalizable to obtain other nonlinear diagnostics, such as the logarithmic negativity and R\'enyi relative entropies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the creation of optically trapped ultracold heteronuclear p-wave Feshbach molecules in a mixture of 23Na and 87Rb atoms. With loss spectroscopy and binding energy measurements, we systematically characterize the interspecies p-wave Feshbach resonances near 284 G. Leveraging this understanding, we use magneto-association to form p-wave NaRb Feshbach molecules, producing both pure samples and mixtures of molecules in different angular momentum states. Additionally, we investigate the inelastic loss of these molecules, primarily influenced by atom-molecule and molecule-molecule collisions. Our results represent a significant step toward realizing tunable p-wave interactions in heteronuclear ultracold systems and provide a foundation for exploring non-zero angular momentum molecules.</description>
