      <title>Conceptual Design Report for the MATHUSLA Long-Lived Particle Detector near CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Conceptual Design Report (CDR) for the MATHUSLA (MAssive Timing Hodoscope for Ultra-Stable neutraL pArticles) long-lived particle detector at the HL-LHC, covering the design, fabrication and installation at CERN Point 5. MATHUSLA is a 40 m-scale detector with an air-filled decay volume that is instrumented with scintillator tracking detectors, to be located near CMS. Its large size, close proximity to the CMS interaction point and about 100 m of rock shielding from HL-LHC backgrounds allows it to detect LLP production rates and lifetimes that are one to two orders of magnitude beyond the ultimate sensitivity of the HL-LHC main detectors for many highly motivated LLP signals. Data taking is projected to commence with the start of HL-LHC operations. We present a new 40m design for the detector: its individual scintillator bars and wavelength-shifting fibers, their organization into tracking layers, tracking modules, tower modules and the veto detector; define a high-level design for the supporting electronics, DAQ and trigger system, including supplying a hardware trigger signal to CMS to record the LLP production event; outline computing systems, civil engineering and safety considerations; and present preliminary cost estimates and timelines for the project. We also conduct detailed simulation studies of the important cosmic ray and HL-LHC muon backgrounds, implementing full track/vertex reconstruction and background rejection, to ultimately demonstrate high signal efficiency and $\ll 1$ background event in realistic LLP searches for the main physics targets at MATHUSLA. This sensitivity is robust with respect to detector design or background simulation details. Appendices provide various supplemental information.</description>

      <title>ParaFlow: fast calorimeter simulations parameterized in upstream material configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study whether machine-learning models for fast calorimeter simulations can learn meaningful representations of calorimeter signatures that account for variations in the full particle detector's configuration. This may open new opportunities in high-energy physics measurements, for example in the assessment of systematic uncertainties that are related to the detector geometry, in the inference of properties of the detector configuration, or in the automated design of experiments. As a concrete example, we parameterize normalizing-flow-based simulations in configurations of the material upstream of a toy calorimeter. We call this model ParaFlow, which is trained to interpolate between different material budgets and positions, as simulated with Geant4. We study ParaFlow's performance in terms of photon shower shapes that are directly influenced by the properties of the upstream material, in which photons can convert to an electron-positron pair. In general, we find that ParaFlow is able to reproduce the dependence of the shower shapes on the material properties at the few-percent level with larger differences only in the tails of the distributions.</description>

      <title>SBN@CERN: A short-baseline neutrino beam at CERN for high-precision cross-section measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new generation of neutrino cross-section experiments at the GeV scale is crucial in the precision era of oscillation physics and lepton flavor studies. In this document, we present a novel neutrino beam design that leverages the experience and R&amp;D achievements of the NP06/ENUBET and NuTag Collaborations and explore its potential implementation at CERN. This beam enables flux monitoring at the percent level and provides a neutrino energy measurement independent of final state particle reconstruction at the neutrino detector. As a result, it eliminates the two primary sources of systematic uncertainty in cross-section measurements: flux normalization and energy bias caused by nuclear effects. We provide a detailed description of the beam technology and instrumentation, along with an overview of its physics potential, with particular emphasis on cross-sections relevant to DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Low Background Germanium Assay at the Boulby Underground Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we move to an era where next generation low-background particle physics experiments begin to be designed and constructed, the ability to assay materials with high sensitivity and at speed with a variety of techniques will be key. This paper describes the Mirion Technologies (Canberra) specialty ultra-low background detectors installed and commissioned at the Boulby Underground Laboratory between 2017 and 2021. The low background levels of the detectors combine with low background shielding and a radon-reduced dry nitrogen purge system to give sensitivity approaching the best in the world without the need for intricate shielding solutions. For an optimised sample geometry, run for 100 days, it would be possible to reach close to 10 $\mu$Bq/kg ($10^{-12}$ g/g) for background isotopes of interest in neutrinoless double-beta decay.</description>

      <title>Refining Fast Calorimeter Simulations with a Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning-based simulations, especially calorimeter simulations, are promising tools for approximating the precision of classical high energy physics simulations with a fraction of the generation time. Nearly all methods proposed so far learn neural networks that map a random variable with a known probability density, like a Gaussian, to realistic-looking events. In many cases, physics events are not close to Gaussian and so these neural networks have to learn a highly complex function. We study an alternative approach: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge Quality Improvement via Refinement of Existing Lightweight Simulations (SQuIRELS). SQuIRELS leverages the power of diffusion-based neural networks and Schr\"{o}dinger bridges to map between samples where the probability density is not known explicitly. We apply SQuIRELS to the task of refining a classical fast simulation to approximate a full classical simulation. On simulated calorimeter events, we find that SQuIRELS is able to reproduce highly non-trivial features of the full simulation with a fraction of the generation time.</description>

      <title>Beyond the EPICS: comprehensive Python IOC development with QueueIOC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01258v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Architectural deficiencies in EPICS lead to inefficiency in the development and application of EPICS input/output controllers (IOCs). An unintrusive solution is replacing EPICS IOCs with more maintainable and flexible Python IOCs, only reusing the Channel Access (CA) protocol of EPICS. After a digression about GUI development inspired by EPICS operator interfaces (OPIs), the structural similarity between standalone GUI backends, the Mamba backend, EPICS IOCs and other server-like programs is analysed. By combining the caproto library and event loops like those in these programs, the QueueIOC framework for Python IOCs is created, which has the potential to systematically replace most EPICS IOCs currently used. Examples are first given for workalikes of StreamDevice and asyn; examples for seq-like applications include monochromators, motor anti-bumping and motor multiplexing. Also shown is software to use with the ~/iocBoot convention which addresses some issues with a similar solution based on procServ, along with a workalike of procServControl. A QueueIOC-based framework for detector integration, which aims to overcome some architectural limitations of areaDetector while still offering decent performance, is presented in an accompanying paper.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of cosmogenic Ge-68 background in a high purity germanium detector via a time series fitting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ge-68 is a cosmogenic isotope in germanium with a half-life of 270.9 days.Ge-68 and its decay daughter Ga-68 contribute considerable background with energy up to 3 MeV to low background $\gamma$ spectrometers using high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. In this paper, we evaluated the background of Ge-68 and Ga-68 in a $p$-type coaxial HPGe detector operated at China Jinping underground laboratory (CJPL) via a time series fitting method. Under the assumption that Ge-68 and Ga-68 are in radioactive equilibrium and airborne radon daughters are uniformly distributed in the measurement chamber of the spectrometer, we fit the time series of count rate in 1-3 MeV to calculate the Ge-68 activity, radon daughter concentrations, and the time-invariant background component. A total of 90-day measurement data were used in the analysis, a hypothesis test confirmed a significant Ge-68 signal at 99.64% confidence level. The initial activity of Ge-68 is fitted to be 477.0$\pm$112.4 $\mu$Bq/kg, corresponding to an integral count rate of 55.9 count/day in the 1-3 MeV range. During the measurement, Ge-68 activity decreased by about 30%, contributing about 62% of the total background in the 1-3 MeV range. Our method also provides an estimation of the variation of airborne radon daughter concentrations in the measurement chamber, which could be used to monitor the performance of radon reduction measures.</description>

      <title>Concrete and Lead Shielding Requirements for PET Facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate shielding thickness requirements in concrete and lead walls for positron emission tomography (PET) facilities. F\textsuperscript{18}, the most commonly used PET radiotracer, emits two back-to-back 511 keV photons, necessitating effective shielding to protect hospital staff while patients are in treatment rooms and during their hospital stay. Photon transmission measurements were conducted through a standard Israeli B30 concrete wall (3 m high, 20 cm thick) using photons from an F\textsuperscript{18} source. A narrow-beam transmission coefficient of \( T = (3.0 \pm 1.0)\% \) was recorded with the source positioned 0.05 m from the wall, and the detector at distances of 0.05--3.0 m on the opposite side. When the source is 3 meters from the wall, photons within a 0.64 m radius circular disk (wide-beam) strike the wall. This produces a dose ``buildup'' effect, whereby photons striking within the disk reach the dosimeter after Compton scattering within the wall. The wide-beam transmission coefficient was measured as \( T = (8.8 \pm 1.8)\% \), corresponding to a buildup factor \( B = 4.0 \pm 0.8 \), consistent with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations \( B = 3.9 \pm 0.6 \), validating the simulation reliability for this specific setup. Note however that reliance solely on thick concrete walls presents construction challenges due to weight, space, and cost inefficiency. Since ordinary concrete effectively interacts only through Compton scattering, while lead walls interact via the photoelectric effect, lead is preferable for shielding. A 3.3 cm lead wall results in \( &lt; 0.5\% \) transmission, and lead sheets can be supported by a 5 cm gypsum wall, optimizing shielding design. However, considering the environmental toxicity of lead, note that recent studies advocate the use of tungsten carbide.</description>

      <title>Early Career Researcher Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update: White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>Most stringent bound on electron neutrino mass obtained with a scalable low temperature microcalorimeter array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the absolute neutrino mass scale remains a fundamental open question in particle physics, with profound implications for both the Standard Model and cosmology. Direct kinematic measurements, independent of model-dependent assumptions, provide the most robust approach to address this challenge. In this Letter, we present the most stringent upper bound on the effective electron neutrino mass ever obtained with a calorimetric measurement of the electron capture decay of $^{163}$Ho. The HOLMES experiment employs an array of ion-implanted transition-edge sensor (TES) microcalorimeters, achieving an average energy resolution of 6 eV FWHM with a scalable, multiplexed readout technique. With a total of $7\times10^7$ decay events recorded over two months and a Bayesian statistical analysis, we derive an upper limit of $m_{\beta}&lt;27$ eV/c$^2$ at 90% credibility. These results validate the feasibility of $^{163}$Ho calorimetry for next-generation neutrino mass experiments and demonstrate the potential of a scalable TES-based microcalorimetric technique to push the sensitivity of direct neutrino mass measurements beyond the current state of the art.</description>
