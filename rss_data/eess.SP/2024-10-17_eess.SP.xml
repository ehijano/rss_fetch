      <title>Expanding Over-the-Air Computation with Nonlinear Frequency Modulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we introduce Logarithmic Frequency Shift Keying (Log-FSK), a novel frequency modulation for over-the-air computation (AirComp). Log-FSK leverages non-linear signal processing to produce AirComp in the frequency domain, this is, the maximum frequency of the received signal corresponds to the sum of the individual transmitted frequencies. The demodulation procedure relies on the inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and the extraction of the maximum frequency component. Log-FSK enables the computation of functions beyond the sum by incorporating nomographic function representation. Furthermore, unlike existing AirComp modulations, Log-FSK allows to compute several functions in a single transmission. We evaluate the capabilities of the scheme in an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and flat-fading channels. To demonstrate its practicality, we present specific applications and experimental results showcasing the effectiveness of Log-FSK AirComp within linear Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). Our numerical results show that Log-FSK outperform linear analog modulations in terms of MSE and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Restoring Super-High Resolution GPS Mobility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel system for reconstructing high-resolution GPS trajectory data from truncated or synthetic low-resolution inputs, addressing the critical challenge of balancing data utility with privacy preservation in mobility applications. The system integrates transformer-based encoder-decoder models with graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to effectively capture both the temporal dependencies of trajectory data and the spatial relationships in road networks. By combining these techniques, the system is able to recover fine-grained trajectory details that are lost through data truncation or rounding, a common practice to protect user privacy. We evaluate the system on the Beijing trajectory dataset, demonstrating its superior performance over traditional map-matching algorithms and LSTM-based synthetic data generation methods. The proposed model achieves an average Fr\'echet distance of 0.198 km, significantly outperforming map-matching algorithms (0.632 km) and synthetic trajectory models (0.498 km). The results show that the system is not only capable of accurately reconstructing real-world trajectories but also generalizes effectively to synthetic data. These findings suggest that the system can be deployed in urban mobility applications, providing both high accuracy and robust privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Deep Adversarial Learning with Activity-Based User Discrimination Task for Human Activity Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new adversarial deep learning framework for the problem of human activity recognition (HAR) using inertial sensors worn by people. Our framework incorporates a novel adversarial activity-based discrimination task that addresses inter-person variability-i.e., the fact that different people perform the same activity in different ways. Overall, our proposed framework outperforms previous approaches on three HAR datasets using a leave-one-(person)-out cross-validation (LOOCV) benchmark. Additional results demonstrate that our discrimination task yields better classification results compared to previous tasks within the same adversarial framework.</description>

      <title>Precise Ranging: Modeling Bias and Variance of Double-Sided Two-Way Ranging with TDoA Extraction under Multipath and NLOS Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Location-based services such as autonomous vehicles, drones, and indoor positioning require precise and scalable distance estimates. The bias and variance of range estimators inherently influence the resulting localization quality. In this work, we revisit the well-established Double-Sided Two-Way-Ranging (DS-TWR) protocol and the extraction of timing differences (DS-TDoA) at devices overhearing DS-TWR. Under non-line-of-sight (NLOS) and multipath effects, we analytically derive their bias and variance. We conduct numerical simulations and experimental deployments using Ultra-Wideband (UWB) devices in a public testbed. Our results confirm the adequacy of our model, providing centimeter-accurate predictions based on the underlying timestamping noise with a median $R^2$ score of 77% (30% IQR). We find that both DS-TWR and DS-TDoA exhibit reduced variance when response times are symmetric, though DS-TDoA comprises roughly a five-fold increase in variance.</description>

      <title>DOA Estimation-Oriented Joint Array Partitioning and Beamforming Designs for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication has been identified as an enabling technology for forthcoming wireless networks. In an effort to achieve an improved performance trade-off between multiuser communications and radar sensing, this paper considers a dynamically-partitioned antenna array architecture for monostatic ISAC systems, in which each element of the array at the base station can function as either a transmit or receive antenna. To fully exploit the available spatial degrees of freedom for both communication and sensing functions, we jointly design the partitioning of the array between transmit and receive antennas together with the transmit beamforming in order to minimize the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation error, while satisfying constraints on the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio and the transmit power budget. An alternating algorithm based on Dinkelbach's transform, the alternative direction method of multipliers, and majorization-minimization is developed to solve the resulting complicated optimization problem. To reduce the computational complexity, we also present a heuristic three-step strategy that optimizes the transmit beamforming after determining the antenna partitioning. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in significantly reducing the DOA estimation error.</description>

      <title>Sum Secrecy Rate Maximization for Full Duplex ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, the target of interest may \textit{intentionally disguise itself as an eavesdropper}, enabling it to intercept and tap into the communication data embedded in the ISAC waveform. The following paper considers a full duplex (FD)-ISAC system, which involves multiple malicious targets attempting to intercept both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) communications between the dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) base station (BS) and legitimate UL/DL communication users (CUs). For this, we formulate an optimization framework that allows maximization of both UL and DL sum secrecy rates, under various power budget constraints for sensing and communications. As the proposed optimization problem is non-convex, we develop a method called Iterative Joint Taylor-Block cyclic coordinate descent (IJTB) by proving essential lemmas that transform the original problem into a more manageable form. In essence, IJTB alternates between two sub-problems: one yields UL beamformers in closed-form, while the other approximates the solution for UL power allocation, artificial noise covariance, and DL beamforming vectors. This is achieved through a series of Taylor approximations that effectively \textit{"convexify"} the problem, enabling efficient optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solver when compared with benchmarking ones. Our findings reveal that the IJTB algorithm shows fast convergence, reaching stability within approximately $10$ iterations. In addition, all benchmarks reveal a substantial decline in the sum secrecy rate, approaching zero as the eavesdropper distance reaches $17$ meters, underscoring their vulnerability in comparison to IJTB.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Pulse Based UWB ISAC Systems: A Parameter Estimation Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) signals stand out for their high temporal resolution, low cost, and large bandwidth, making them a highly promising option for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we design an ISAC system for a bi-static passive sensing scenario that accommodates multiple targets. Specifically, we introduce two typical modulation schemes, PPM and BPSK, for data transmission. The essential coupling between sensing and communication is examined through the Fisher information matrix (FIM). Accordingly, we introduce a pilot-based decoupling approach that relies on known time-delays, as well as a differential decoupling strategy that uses a known starting symbol position. Finally, we assess the sensing and communication performance under various modulation and demodulation schemes under the constraints of current UWB standards. This assessment utilizes the Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for sensing and the Shannon capacity limit for communication, offering theoretical insights into choosing suitable data signal processing methods in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Active inference and deep generative modeling for cognitive ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) has the unique potential to offer access to medical imaging to anyone, everywhere. Devices have become ultra-portable and cost-effective, akin to the stethoscope. Nevertheless US image quality and diagnostic efficacy are still highly operator- and patient-dependent. In difficult-to-image patients, image quality is often insufficient for reliable diagnosis. In this paper, we put forth that US imaging systems can be recast as information-seeking agents that engage in reciprocal interactions with their anatomical environment. Such agents autonomously adapt their transmit-receive sequences to fully personalize imaging and actively maximize information gain in-situ. To that end, we will show that the sequence of pulse-echo experiments that a US system performs can be interpreted as a perception-action loop: the action is the data acquisition, probing tissue with acoustic waves and recording reflections at the detection array, and perception is the inference of the anatomical and or functional state, potentially including associated diagnostic quantities. We then equip systems with a mechanism to actively reduce uncertainty and maximize diagnostic value across a sequence of experiments, treating action and perception jointly using Bayesian inference given generative models of the environment and action-conditional pulse-echo observations. Since the representation capacity of the generative models dictates both the quality of inferred anatomical states and the effectiveness of inferred sequences of future imaging actions, we will be greatly leveraging the enormous advances in deep generative modelling that are currently disrupting many fields and society at large. Finally, we show some examples of cognitive, closed-loop, US systems that perform active beamsteering and adaptive scanline selection, based on deep generative models that track anatomical belief states.</description>

      <title>On the Sensing Performance of OFDM-based ISAC under the Influence of Oscillator Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a novel capability expected for sixth generation (6G) cellular networks. To that end, several challenges must be addressed to enable both mono- and bistatic sensing in existing deployments. A common impairment in both architectures is oscillator phase noise (PN), which not only degrades communication performance, but also severely impairs radar sensing. To enable a broader understanding of orthogonal-frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based sensing impaired by PN, this article presents an analysis of sensing peformance in OFDM-based ISAC for different waveform parameter choices and settings in both mono- and bistatic architectures. In this context, the distortion of the adopted digital constellation modulation is analyzed and the resulting PN-induced effects in range-Doppler radar images are investigated both without and with PN compensation. These effects include peak power loss of target reflections and higher sidelobe levels, especially in the Doppler shift direction. In the conducted analysis, these effects are measured by the peak power loss ratio, peak-to-sidelobe level ratio, and integrated sidelobe level ratio parameters, the two latter being evaluated in both range and Doppler shift directions. In addition, the signal-to-interference ratio is analyzed to allow not only quantifying the distortion of a target reflection, but also measuring the interference floor level in a radar image. The achieved results allow to quantify not only the PN-induced impairments to a single target, but also how the induced degradation may impair the sensing performance of OFDM-based ISAC systems in multi-target scenarios.</description>

      <title>ChannelGPT: A Large Model to Generate Digital Twin Channel for 6G Environment Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 6G is envisaged to provide multimodal sensing, pervasive intelligence, global coverage, global coverage, etc., which poses extreme intricacy and new challenges to the network design and optimization. As the core part of 6G, wireless channel is the carrier and enabler for the flourishing technologies and novel services, which intrinsically determines the ultimate system performance. However, how to describe and utilize the complicated and high-dynamic characteristics of wireless channel accurately and effectively still remains great hallenges. To tackle this, digital twin is envisioned as a powerful technology to migrate the physical entities to virtual and computational world. In this article, we propose a large model driven digital twin channel generator (ChannelGPT) embedded with environment intelligence (EI) to enable pervasive intelligence paradigm for 6G network. EI is an iterative and interactive procedure to boost the system performance with online environment adaptivity. Firstly, ChannelGPT is capable of utilization the multimodal data from wireless channel and corresponding physical environment with the equipped sensing ability. Then, based on the fine-tuned large model, ChannelGPT can generate multi-scenario channel parameters, associated map information and wireless knowledge simultaneously, in terms of each task requirement. Furthermore, with the support of online multidimensional channel and environment information, the network entity will make accurate and immediate decisions for each 6G system layer. In practice, we also establish a ChannelGPT prototype to generate high-fidelity channel data for varied scenarios to validate the accuracy and generalization ability based on environment intelligence.</description>

      <title>Multi-frame Detection via Graph Neural Networks: A Link Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-frame detection algorithms can effectively utilize the correlation between consecutive echoes to improve the detection performance of weak targets. Existing efficient multi-frame detection algorithms are typically based on three sequential steps: plot extraction via a relative low primary threshold, track search and track detection. However, these three-stage processing algorithms may result in a notable loss of detection performance and do not fully leverage the available echo information across frames. As to applying graph neural networks in multi-frame detection, the algorithms are primarily based on node classification tasks, which cannot directly output target tracks. In this paper, we reformulate the multi-frame detection problem as a link prediction task in graphs. First, we perform a rough association of multi-frame observations that exceed the low threshold to construct observation association graphs. Subsequently, a multi-feature link prediction network is designed based on graph neural networks, which integrates multi-dimensional information, including echo structure, Doppler information, and spatio-temporal coupling of plots. By leveraging the principle of link prediction, we unifies the processes of track search and track detection into one step to reduce performance loss and directly output target tracks. Experimental results show that, compared with traditional single-frame and multi-frame detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves the detection performance of weak targets while suppressing false alarms. Additionally, interpretable analysis indicates that the designed network effectively integrates the utilized features, allowing for accurate associations between targets and false alarms.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Selection and Covariance Matrix Optimization for ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system with a single communication user and multiple targets. For the communication functionality, the achievable rate is employed as the performance metric, while for sensing, we focus on minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) between the designed beampattern and a desired one for tracking the targets. Towards this, and by assuming that there are fewer radiofrequency (RF) chains than antenna elements at the transmitter (Tx), we focus on the joint antenna selection (AS) and covariance matrix (CM) optimization at the Tx. This is a mixed-integer optimization problem, yet we demonstrate that it can be efficiently solved, in polynomial time, by combining convex optimization tools with dynamic programming (DP). By introducing an adjustable trade-off parameter, we formulate a joint objective function that captures both the communication and sensing metric. In this way, different ISAC solutions can be obtained, considering the trade-off among the two functionalities. It is shown that selecting the active antennas with our proposed method is superior than assuming a uniform Tx array with fixed antenna positions. Notably, by individually considering the optimization of either the sensing or the communication system alone, our proposed algorithm outperforms the literature proposals, by incurring only a small increase in complexity.</description>

      <title>Improving the Estimation of Attenuation in Q/V Band Systems with a Kalman-Based Scintillation Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of the Scintillation Filter by Kalman-colored algorithm (SciFi), which is used to remove tropospheric scintillation from Q/V bands total attenuation data series. In contrast to the classical methods using low-pass filters, the SciFi algorithm allows to estimate both the attenuation, its slope and a confidence interval. Moreover, the linear observer structure of the Kalman filter allows it to operate in real time. Therefore, the states and uncertainties estimated by SciFi can be used as input for Fade Mitigation Techniques (FMT) such as Adaptive Coding and Modulation (ACM) or Site Diversity (SD). In this article, we propose a method to tune the noise level based on recommendations approved by the ITU-R. Finally, some results of filtering on Alphasat experimental data are discussed.</description>

      <title>AI-based 3-Lead to 12-Lead ECG Reconstruction: Towards Smartphone-based Public Healthcare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clinicians generally diagnose cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) using standard 12-Lead electrocardiogram (ECG). However, for smartphone-based public healthcare systems, a reduced 3-lead system may be preferred because of (i) increased portability, and (ii) reduced requirement for power, storage and bandwidth. Subsequently, clinicians require accurate 3-lead to 12-Lead ECG reconstruction, which has so far been studied only in the personalized setting. When each device is dedicated to one individual, artificial intelligence (AI) methods such as temporal long short-term memory (LSTM) and a further improved spatio-temporal LSTM-UNet combine have proven effective. In contrast, in the current smartphone-based public health setting where a common device is shared by many, developing an AI lead-reconstruction model that caters to the extensive ECG signal variability in the general population appears a far greater challenge. In this direction, we take a first step, and observe that the performance improvement achieved by a generative model, specifically, 1D Pix2Pix GAN (generative adversarial network), over LSTM-UNet is encouraging.</description>

      <title>Maximal Transmission Rate in Omni-DRIS-Assisted Indoor Visible Light Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the importance of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in next-generation mobile systems, several RIS variants have been proposed in recent years. Omni-digital-RIS (omni-DRIS) is one of the newly introduced variants of optical RIS that can successfully be driven by bit sequences to control lights emerging from simultaneous reflection and refraction processes, impacting both the achievable rate and the required number of omni-DRIS elements. In this paper, we analyze the effects of omni-DRIS-assisted transmission environment parameters to maximize the achievable rate and highlight the corresponding number of omni-DRIS elements. Furthermore, we show that the number of omni-DRIS elements that yields the highest achievable rate largely depends on the number of bits per omni-DRIS control sequence. On the other hand, this rate is determined by the remaining parameters of the transmission system and environmental factors, which include the total transmit power, transmission bandwidth, number of transmitters and users, and the channel DC gain.</description>

      <title>Near-Field LoS/NLoS Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided MU-MIMO Systems: Piece-Wise Low-Rank Approximation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the channel estimation problem for a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) system. In particular, it is assumed that the channel between a RIS and a base station (BS) exhibits a near-field line-of-sight (LoS) channel, which is a dominant signal path in mmWave communication systems. Due to the high-rankness and non-sparsity of the RIS-BS channel matrix in our system, the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, which are constructed based on far-field or near-field non-LoS (NLoS) channel, cannot provide attractive estimation performances. We for the first time propose an efficient near-field LoS/NLoS channel estimation method for RIS-assisted MU-MIMO systems by means of a piece-wise low-rank approximation. Specifically, an effective channel (to be estimated) is partitioned into piece-wise effective channels containing low-rank structures and then, they are estimated via collaborative low-rank approximation. The proposed method is named PW-CLRA. Via simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed PW-CLRA.</description>

      <title>A 1.2 mm$^2$ 416 mW 1.44 Mmat/s 64$\times$16 Matrix Preprocessing ASIC for Massive MIMO in 22FDX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiuser (MU) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) enables concurrent transmission of multiple users to a multi-antenna basestation (BS). To detect the users' data using linear equalization, the BS must perform preprocessing, which requires, among other tasks, the inversion of a matrix whose dimension equals the number of user data streams. Explicit inversion of large matrices is notoriously difficult to implement due to high complexity, stringent data dependencies that lead to high latency, and high numerical precision requirements. We propose a novel preprocessing architecture based on the block-LDL matrix factorization, which improves parallelism and, hence, reduces latency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our architecture through (i) massive MU-MIMO system simulations with mmWave channel vectors and (ii) measurements of a 22FDX ASIC, which is, to our knowledge, the first fabricated preprocessing engine for massive MU-MIMO with 64 BS antennas and 16 single-antenna users. Our ASIC reaches a clock frequency of 870 MHz while consuming 416 mW. At its peak throughput, the ASIC preprocesses 1.44 M 64$\times$16 matrices per second at a latency of only 0.7 $\mu$s.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand in artificial intelligence (AI) for models that are both effective and explainable is critical in domains where safety and trust are paramount. In this study, we introduce MIRA, a transparent and interpretable multi-class rule-based algorithm tailored for radar-based gesture detection. Addressing the critical need for understandable AI, MIRA enhances user trust by providing insight into its decision-making process. We showcase the system's adaptability through personalized rule sets that calibrate to individual user behavior, offering a user-centric AI experience. Alongside presenting a novel multi-class classification architecture, we share an extensive frequency-modulated continuous wave radar gesture dataset and evidence of the superior interpretability of our system through comparative analyses. Our research underscores MIRA's ability to deliver both high interpretability and performance and emphasizes the potential for broader adoption of interpretable AI in safety-critical applications.</description>

      <title>AADNet: An End-to-End Deep Learning Model for Auditory Attention Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) is the process of identifying the attended speech in a multi-talker environment using brain signals, typically recorded through electroencephalography (EEG). Over the past decade, AAD has undergone continuous development, driven by its promising application in neuro-steered hearing devices. Most AAD algorithms are relying on the increase in neural entrainment to the envelope of attended speech, as compared to unattended speech, typically using a two-step approach. First, the algorithm predicts representations of the attended speech signal envelopes; second, it identifies the attended speech by finding the highest correlation between the predictions and the representations of the actual speech signals. In this study, we proposed a novel end-to-end neural network architecture, named AADNet, which combines these two stages into a direct approach to address the AAD problem. We compare the proposed network against the traditional approaches, including linear stimulus reconstruction, canonical correlation analysis, and an alternative non-linear stimulus reconstruction using two different datasets. AADNet shows a significant performance improvement for both subject-specific and subject-independent models. Notably, the average subject-independent classification accuracies from 56.1 % to 82.7 % with analysis window lengths ranging from 1 to 40 seconds, respectively, show a significantly improved ability to generalize to data from unseen subjects. These results highlight the potential of deep learning models for advancing AAD, with promising implications for future hearing aids, assistive devices, and clinical assessments.</description>

      <title>GyroCopter: Differential Bearing Measuring Trajectory Planner for Tracking and Localizing Radio Frequency Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial vehicles can provide efficient and effective solutions for radio frequency (RF) source tracking and localizing problems with applications ranging from wildlife conservation to search and rescue operations. Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive "pseudo-bearing" measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness. To validate our approach, we derived the optimal rotation speed and conducted extensive simulations and field missions with our GyroCopter to track and localize multiple RF sources. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential as a practical and rapid solution for RF source localization tasks.</description>

      <title>Physics-Compliant Modeling and Scaling Laws of Multi-RIS Aided Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a revolutionary technology enabling the control of wireless channels and improving coverage in wireless networks. To further extend coverage, multi-RIS aided systems have been explored, where multiple RISs steer the signal toward the receiver via a multi-hop path. However, deriving a physics-compliant channel model for multi-RIS aided systems is still an open problem. In this study, we fill this gap by modeling multi-RIS aided systems through multiport network theory, and deriving the scaling law of the physics-compliant channel gain. The derived physics-compliant channel model differs from the widely used model, where the structural scattering of the RISs is neglected. Theoretical insights, validated by numerical results, show a significant discrepancy between the physics-compliant and the widely used models. This discrepancy increases with the number of RISs and decreases with the number of RIS elements, reaching 200% in a system with eight RISs with 128 elements each.</description>

      <title>Windowed Compressed Spectrum Sensing with Block sparsity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compressed Spectrum Sensing (CSS) is widely employed in spectral analysis due to its sampling efficiency. However, conventional CSS assumes a standard sparse spectrum, which is affected by Spectral Leakage (SL). Despite the widespread use of CSS, the impact of SL on its performance has not been systematically and thoroughly investigated. This study addresses this research gap by analyzing the Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) of windowed Gaussian measurement matrices and proposing a novel block-sparse CSS model.
  We introduce the Edge Zeroing Coefficient (EZC) to evaluate SL suppression and RIP impact, and the Window Scaling Coefficient (WSC) to quantify the effect on RIP. Our research investigates the influence of Window Function (WF) on signal sparsity and measurement matrices, and presents a block-sparse CSS model that considers component frequency distribution, signal length, windowing, and noise floor. Based on subspace counting theory, we derive sample bound for our model. The findings demonstrate that while WFs reduce SL, excessively small EZC and WSC values can negatively affect RIP quality and cause numerical instability during signal reconstruction. This highlights the delicate balance required when applying WFs in CSS. Our block-sparse approach enables precise compression and reconstruction, particularly for high noise floor and super-sparse signals. This study provides a framework for optimizing CSS performance when dealing with SL and sparse signals, offering insights for improving signal reconstruction quality in various applications</description>

Abstract: Enhancing speech quality under adverse SNR conditions remains a significant challenge for discriminative deep neural network (DNN)-based approaches. In this work, we propose DisCoGAN, which is a time-frequency-domain generative adversarial network (GAN) conditioned by the latent features of a discriminative model pre-trained for speech enhancement in low SNR scenarios. Our proposed method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-arts discriminative methods and also surpasses end-to-end (E2E) trained GAN models. We also investigate the impact of various configurations for conditioning the proposed GAN model with the discriminative model and assess their influence on enhancing speech quality</description>

Abstract: The successful deployment of deep learning-based acoustic echo and noise reduction (AENR) methods in consumer devices has spurred interest in developing low-complexity solutions, while emphasizing the need for robust performance in real-life applications. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to enhance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ULCNet model by integrating time alignment and parallel encoder blocks for the model inputs, resulting in better echo reduction and comparable noise reduction performance to existing SOTA methods. We also propose a channel-wise sampling-based feature reorientation method, ensuring robust performance across many challenging scenarios, while maintaining overall low computational and memory requirements.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Optimization for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-based Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The beamforming optimization in continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-user communications is studied. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete antenna arrays, CAPAs can exploit the full spatial degrees of freedoms (DoFs) by emitting information-bearing electromagnetic (EM) wave through continuous source current distributed across the aperture. Nevertheless, such operation renders the beamforming optimization problem as a non-convex integral-based functional programming problem, which is challenging for conventional discrete optimization methods. A couple of low-complexity approaches are proposed to solve the functional programming problem. 1) Calculus of variations (CoV)-based approach: Closed-form structure of the optimal continuous source patterns are derived based on CoV, inspiring a low-complexity integral-free iterative algorithm for solving the functional programming problem. 2) Correlation-based zero-forcing (Corr-ZF) approach: Closed-form ZF source current patterns that completely eliminate the interuser interference are derived based on the channel correlations. By using these patterns, the original functional programming problem is transformed to a simple power allocation problem, which can be solved using the classical water-filling approach with reduced complexity. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) compared to the state-of-the-art Fourier-based discretization approach, the proposed CoV-based approach not only improves communication performance but also reduces computational complexity by up to hundreds of times for large CAPA apertures and high frequencies, and ii) the proposed Corr-ZF approach achieves asymptotically optimal performance compared to the CoV-based approach.</description>

      <title>Private Counterfactual Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transparency and explainability are two extremely important aspects to be considered when employing black-box machine learning models in high-stake applications. Providing counterfactual explanations is one way of catering this requirement. However, this also poses a threat to the privacy of both the institution that is providing the explanation as well as the user who is requesting it. In this work, we propose multiple schemes inspired by private information retrieval (PIR) techniques which ensure the \emph{user's privacy} when retrieving counterfactual explanations. We present a scheme which retrieves the \emph{exact} nearest neighbor counterfactual explanation from a database of accepted points while achieving perfect (information-theoretic) privacy for the user. While the scheme achieves perfect privacy for the user, some leakage on the database is inevitable which we quantify using a mutual information based metric. Furthermore, we propose strategies to reduce this leakage to achieve an advanced degree of database privacy. We extend these schemes to incorporate user's preference on transforming their attributes, so that a more actionable explanation can be received. Since our schemes rely on finite field arithmetic, we empirically validate our schemes on real datasets to understand the trade-off between the accuracy and the finite field sizes.</description>

      <title>Semi-Blind Receivers for Hybrid Reflecting and Sensing RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has delved into advanced designs for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with integrated sensing functions. One promising concept is the hybrid RIS (HRIS), which blends sensing and reflecting meta-atoms. This enables HRIS to process signals, aiding in channel estimation (CE) and symbol detection tasks. This paper formulates semi-blind receivers for HRIS-aided wireless communications that enable joint symbol and CE at the HRIS and BS. The proposed receivers rely on a new tensor modeling approach for the signals received at both the HRIS and BS while exploiting a tensor signal coding scheme at the transmit side. Specifically, by capitalizing on the multilinear structures of the received signals, we develop iterative and closed-form receiver algorithms for joint estimation of the uplink channels and symbols at both the HRIS and the BS. Enabling joint channel and symbol estimation functionalities, the proposed receivers offer symbol decoding capabilities to the HRIS and ensure ambiguity-free separate CE without requiring an a priori training stage. We also study identifiability conditions ensuring a unique joint channel and symbol recovery and discuss the computational complexities and tradeoffs involved by the proposed semi-blind receivers. Our findings demonstrate the competitive performances of the proposed algorithms at the HRIS and the BS and uncover distinct performance trends based on the possible combinations of HRIS-BS receiver pairs. Finally, extensive numerical results elucidate the interplay between power splitting, symbol recovery, and CE accuracy in HRIS-assisted communications. Such insights are pivotal for optimizing receiver design and enhancing system performance in future HRIS deployments.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose a Multiple Access Control (MAC) protocol for Light-based IoT (LIoT) networks, where the gateway node orchestrates and schedules batteryless nodes duty-cycles based on their location and sleep time. The LIoT concept represents a sustainable solution for massive indoor IoT applications, offering an alternative communication medium through Visible Light Communication (VLC). While most existing scheduling algorithms for intermittent batteryless IoT aim to maximize data collection and enhance dataset size, our solution is tailored for environmental sensing applications, such as temperature, humidity, and air quality monitoring, optimizing measurement distribution and minimizing blind spots to achieve comprehensive and uniform environmental sensing. We propose a Balanced Space and Time-based Time Division Multiple Access scheduling (BST-TDMA) algorithm, which addresses environmental sensing challenges by balancing spatial and temporal factors to improve the environmental sensing efficiency of batteryless LIoT nodes. Our measurement-based results show that BST-TDMA was able to efficiently schedule duty-cycles with given intervals.</description>

      <title>Variational Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Communication</title>

Abstract: Semantic communication technology emerges as a pivotal bridge connecting AI with classical communication. The current semantic communication systems are generally modeled as an Auto-Encoder (AE). AE lacks a deep integration of AI principles with communication strategies due to its inability to effectively capture channel dynamics. This gap makes it difficult to justify the need for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and to explain why performance improves. This paper begins by exploring lossless and lossy communication, highlighting that the inclusion of data distortion distinguishes semantic communication from classical communication. It breaks the conditions for the separation theorem to hold and explains why the amount of data transferred by semantic communication is less. Therefore, employing JSCC becomes imperative for achieving optimal semantic communication. Moreover, a Variational Source-Channel Coding (VSCC) method is proposed for constructing semantic communication systems based on data distortion theory, integrating variational inference and channel characteristics. Using a deep learning network, we develop a semantic communication system employing the VSCC method and demonstrate its capability for semantic transmission. We also establish semantic communication systems of equivalent complexity employing the AE method and the VAE method. Experimental results reveal that the VSCC model offers superior interpretability compared to AE model, as it clearly captures the semantic features of the transmitted data, represented as the variance of latent variables in our experiments. In addition, VSCC model exhibits superior semantic transmission capabilities compared to VAE model. At the same level of data distortion evaluated by PSNR, VSCC model exhibits stronger human interpretability, which can be partially assessed by SSIM.</description>

      <title>Form Follows Function: A Different Approach to Neuron Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03337</link>

Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.</description>
