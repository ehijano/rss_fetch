      <title>Contemporary tensor network approaches to gapless and topological phases in an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of numerically efficient computational methods has facilitated in depth studies of various correlated phases of matter including critical and topological phases. A quantum Monte-Carlo study of an extended Bose-Hubbard ladder has recently been used to identify an exotic phase with hidden order, where superfluid correlations coexist with string order, dubbed a Haldane superfluid (HSF). However, finite-size methods can struggle to uniquely determine the boundaries of quasi-long-range ordered states with nonlocal, e.g. string-like, correlations. In the present Letter, we revisit the HSF scenario using tensor network algorithms specialized for finite/infinite (quasi-)1D systems, \textit{i.e.} the well-governed finite-size density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), and the state-of-the-art infinite-size variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) methods. While DMRG results extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit are compatible with a putative HSF, the results from the VUMPS calculations provide sharper phase boundaries that leave no room for such a topological superfluid. Our results demonstrate the crucial advantage of the VUMPS in characterizing topological and critical interacting phases providing the precise phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Time-tronics: from temporal printed circuit board to quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time crystalline structures can be created in periodically driven systems. They are temporal lattices which can reveal different condensed matter behaviours ranging from Anderson localization in time to temporal analogues of many-body localization or topological insulators. However, the potential practical applications of time crystalline structures have yet to be explored. Here, we pave the way for time-tronics where temporal lattices are like printed circuit boards for realization of a broad range of quantum devices. The elements of these devices can correspond to structures of dimensions higher than three and can be arbitrarily connected and reconfigured at any moment. Moreover, our approach allows for the construction of a quantum computer, enabling quantum gate operations for all possible pairs of qubits. Our findings indicate that the limitations faced in building devices using conventional spatial crystals can be overcome by adopting crystalline structures in time.</description>

      <title>Supersonic shear waves in dipolar supersolids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dipolar supersolids--quantum states that are simultaneously superfluid and solid--have had their superfluid nature rigorously tested, while its solid nature remains uncharted. Arguably, the defining characteristic of a solid is the existence of elastic shear waves. In this work, we investigate transverse wave packet propagation in dipolar supersolids with triangular and honeycomb structure. Remarkably, the honeycomb supersolid displays anomalous dispersion, supporting waves traveling faster than the transverse speed of sound: a supersonic shear wave. While the distinction between anomalous and normal dispersion appears subtle, it has a profound influence on both the transport and scattering properties. For both supersolid phases, we calculate the shear modulus, a key parameter that quantifies the material's rigidity. Our findings are pertinent to current experimental efforts scrutinizing the fundamental properties of supersolids.</description>

      <title>Two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with spin-orbital coupling in thin spherical-shell geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theory of two-component atomic Fermi superfluid with tunable pairing interaction in a thin spherical shell subject to spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By incorporating SOC into the Fermi superfluid in the BCS-Bose Einstein condensation (BEC) crossover, we obtain the energy spectrum and equations of state. While the order parameter and chemical potential are suppressed by SOC on the BCS side, the former remains positive but the latter may be pushed to negative values by SOC. Meanwhile, the compressibility exhibits kinks as the pairing interaction or SOC varies, indicating singular behavior of higher-derivatives of the free energy despite the presence of the superfluid order parameter. The minimum of the energy dispersion indicates a decoupling of the energy gap from the order parameter, and the compressibility kinks occur when the energy gap approaches zero. We found the particle-hole mixing in the Fermi superfluid essential for the compressibility kinks since a Fermi gas with the same SOC but no pairing interaction only exhibits complicated dispersions but no singular behavior. Therefore, our results show that a combination of superfluid, SOC, and geometry can lead to interesting phenomena. We also discuss possible experimental realizations and implications.</description>

      <title>A Family of Self-Dual Quasicrystals with Critical Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for constructing self-dual one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice models with arbitrary-range hoppings and multifractal behaviors. Our framework generates a broad spectrum of quasicrystals, ranging from the off-diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models on one end, to those with long-range power-law hoppings on another. Focusing on models with off-diagonal quasiperiodic hoppings with power-law decay, we exploit the fact that, when the self-dual condition is satisfied, the system must be in the critical state with multifractal properties. This enables the engineering of models with competing extended, critical, and localized phases, with rich mobility edges in between. As an outstanding example, we show that a limiting case of our family of self-dual quasicrystals can be implemented using Rydberg-atom arrays. Our work offers a systematic route toward self-duality and critical phases, and would facilitate their experimental simulation.</description>
