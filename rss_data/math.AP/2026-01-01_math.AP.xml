      <title>A nonlinear instability result to the Navier-Stokes equations with Navier slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the instability of the trivial steady states to the incompressible viscous fluid with Navier-slip boundary conditions. For the linear instability, the existence of infinitely many normal mode solutions to the linearized equations is shown via the operator method of Lafitte and Nguyen (2022). Hence, we prove the nonlinear instability by adapting the framework of Desjardins and Grenier (2003) studying some classes of viscous boundary layers to obtain two separated solutions at escaping time. Our work performs a different approach from that of Ding, Li and Xin (2018).</description>

      <title>A regularity theory for second-order parabolic partial differential equations in weighted mixed norm Sobolev-Zygmund spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an optimal regularity theory for parabolic partial differential equations in weighted mixed norm Sobolev-Zygmund spaces. The results extend the classical Schauder estimates to coefficients that are merely measurable in time and to the critical case of integer-order regularity. In addition, nonzero initial data are treated in the optimal trace space via a sharp trace theorem.</description>

      <title>$L^p$ Estimates for Numerical Approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish $L^p$ error estimates for monotone numerical schemes approximating Hamilton-Jacobi equations on the $d$-dimensional torus. Using the adjoint method, we first prove a $L^1$ error bound of order one for finite-difference and semi-Lagrangian schemes under standard convexity assumptions on the Hamiltonian. By interpolation, we also obtain $L^p$ estimates for every finite $p&gt;1$. Our analysis covers a broad class of schemes, improves several existing results, and provides a unified framework for discrete error estimates.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for the homogeneous Boltzmann equation with moderately soft potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Kac particle system converges, as the number of particles tends to infinity, to the solution of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation, in the regime of moderately soft potentials, $\gamma \in (-2,0)$ with the common notation. This proves the propagation of chaos. We adapt the recent work of Imbert, Silvestre and Villani, to show that the Fisher information is nonincreasing in time along solutions to the Kac master equation. This estimate allows us to control the singularity of the interaction.</description>

      <title>Dirac solitons in one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study a family of one-dimensional stationary cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equations with periodic potentials and linear part displaying Dirac points in the dispersion relation. By introducing a suitable periodic perturbation, one can open a spectral gap around the Dirac-point energy. This allows to construct standing waves of the NLS equation whose leading-order profile is a modulation of Bloch waves by means of the components of a spinor solving an appropriate cubic nonlinear Dirac (NLD) equation. We refer to these solutions as Dirac solitons. Our analysis thus provides a rigorous justification for the use of the NLD equation as an effective model for the original NLS equation.</description>

      <title>An Equivalence Result on the Order of Differentiability in Frobenius' Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the simplest case of total differential equations that appears in the theory of foliation structures, without imposing the smoothness assumptions. This leads to a peculiar asymmetry in the differentiability of solutions. To resolve this asymmetry, this paper focuses on the differentiability of the integral manifold. When the system is locally Lipschitz, a solution is ensured to be only locally Lipschitz, but the integral manifolds must be $C^1$. When the system is $C^k$, we can only ensure the existence of a $C^k$ solution, but the integral manifolds must be $C^{k+1}$. In addition, we see a counterexample in which the system is $C^1$, but there is no $C^2$ solution. Moreover, we characterize a minimizer of an optimization problem whose objective function is a quasi-convex solution to a total differential equation. In this connection, we examine two necessary and sufficient conditions for the system in which any solution is quasi-convex.</description>

      <title>Multi-bump solutions for sublinear elliptic equations with nonsymmetric coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence of nonnegative bump solutions to the sublinear elliptic equation \[ \begin{cases} -\Delta v - K(x)v + |v|^{q-2}v = 0 &amp; \text{in } \mathbb{R}^N, \\ v(x) \to 0 &amp; \text{as } |x| \to \infty, \end{cases} \] where $q \in (1,2)$, $ N \geq 2$, and the potential $K \in L^p_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $p &gt; N/2$ is a function without any symmetry assumptions. Under the condition that $\|K - 1\|_{L^p_{\mathrm{loc}}}$ is sufficiently small, we construct infinitely many solutions with arbitrarily many bumps. The construction is challenged by the sensitive interaction between bumps, whose limiting profiles have compact support. The key to ensuring their effective separation lies in obtaining sharp estimates of the support sets. Our method, based on a truncated functional space, provides precisely such control. We derive qualitative local stability estimates in region-wise maximum norms that govern the size of each bump's essential support, confining its core to a designated region and minimizing overlap. Crucially, these estimates are uniform in the number of bumps, which is the pivotal step in establishing the existence of solutions with infinitely many bumps.</description>

      <title>Mean-Field Limits of Deterministic and Stochastic Flocking Models with Nonlinear Velocity Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mean-field limit for a class of agent-based models describing flocking with nonlinear velocity alignment. Each agent interacts through a communication protocol $\phi$ and a non-linear coupling of velocities given by the power law $A(\bv) = |\bv|^{p-2}\bv$, $p &gt; 2$. The mean-field limit is proved in two settings -- deterministic and stochastic. We then provide quantitative estimates on propagation of chaos for deterministic case in the case of the classical fat-tailed kernels, showing an improved convergence rate of the $k$-particle marginals to a solution of the corresponding Vlasov equation. The stochastic version is addressed with multiplicative noise depending on the local interaction intensity, which leads to the associated Fokker-Planck-Alignment equation.
  Our results extend the classical Cucker-Smale theory to the nonlinear framework which has received considerable attention in the literature recently.</description>

      <title>Stability of the reconstruction of the heat reflection coefficient in the phonon transport equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reflection coefficient is an important thermal property of materials, especially at the nanoscale, and determining this property requires solving an inverse problem based on macroscopic temperature measurements. In this manuscript, we investigate the stability of this inverse problem to infer the reflection coefficient in the phonon transport equation. We show that the problem becomes ill-posed as the system transitions from the ballistic to the diffusive regime, characterized by the Knudsen number converging to zero. Such a stability estimate clarifies the discrepancy observed in previous studies on the well-posedness of this inverse problem. Furthermore, we quantify the rate at which the stability deteriorates with respect to the Knudsen number and confirm the theoretical result with numerical evidence.</description>

      <title>Solvability conditions for some non-Fredholm operators with shifted arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the article we establish the existence in the sense of sequences of solutions in $H^{2}(R)$ for some nonhomogeneous linear differential equation in which one of the terms has the argument translated by a constant. It is shown that under the reasonable technical conditions the convergence in $L^{2}(R)$ of the source terms implies the existence and the convergence in $H^{2}(R)$ of the solutions. The second part of the work deals with the solvability in the sense of sequences in $H^{2}(R)$ of the integro-differential equation in which one of the terms has the argument shifted by a constant. It is demonstrated that under the appropriate auxiliary assumptions the convergence in $L^{1}(R)$ of the integral kernels yields the existence and the convergence in $H^{2}(R)$ of the solutions. Both equations considered involve the second order differential operator with or without the Fredholm property depending on the value of the constant by which the argument gets translated.</description>

      <title>Steady Self-Propelled Motion of a Rigid Body in a Viscous Fluid with Navier-Slip Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the steady self-propelled motion of a rigid body immersed in a three-dimensional incompressible viscous fluid governed by the Navier-Stokes equations. The analysis is performed in a body-fixed reference frame, so that the fluid occupies an exterior domain and the propulsion mechanism is modeled through nonhomogeneous Navier-slip boundary conditions at the fluid-body interface. Such conditions provide a realistic description of propulsion in microfluidic and rough-surface regimes, where partial slip effects are significant. Under suitable smallness assumptions on the boundary flux and on the normal component of the prescribed surface velocity, we establish the existence of weak steady solutions to the coupled fluid-structure system. A key analytical ingredient is the derivation of a Korn-type inequality adapted to exterior domains with rigid-body motion and Navier-slip interfaces, which yields uniform control of both the fluid velocity and the translational and rotational velocities of the body. Beyond existence, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition under which a prescribed slip velocity on the body surface induces nontrivial translational or rotational motion of the rigid body. This is achieved through the introduction of a finite-dimensional thrust space, defined via auxiliary exterior Stokes problems with Navier boundary conditions, which captures the effective contribution of boundary-driven flows to the rigid-body motion. Our results clarify how boundary effects generate propulsion and extend the classical Dirichlet-based theory to the Navier-slip setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct solutions to the three-dimensional Euler equations exhibiting anomalous dissipation in finite time through a vanishing viscosity limit. Inspired by \cite{BDL23} and \cite{cheskidov2023dissipation}, we extend the \(2\frac{1}{2}\)-dimensional constructions and establish an Onsager-critical energy criterion adapted to such flows, showing its sharpness. Moreover, we provide a fully three-dimensional dissipative Euler example, sharp in Onsager's sense, driven by a slightly rough external force, following the framework of \cite{CL21}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss propagation of space-time singularities for the quantum harmonic oscillator with time-dependent metric and potential perturbations. Reformulating the quasi-homogeneous wave front set according to Lascar (1977) in a semiclassical manner, we obtain a characterization of its appearance in comparison with the unperturbed system. The idea of our proof is based on the argument of Nakamura (2009), which was originally devised for the analysis of spatial singularities of the Schr\"odinger equation, however, the application is non-trivial since the time is no more a parameter, but takes a part in the base variables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variational problem for the Landau--Lifshitz energy with Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions arising in 2D micromagnetics, focusing on the Bogomol'nyi regime. We first determine the minimal energy for arbitrary topological degree, thereby revealing two types of phase transitions consistent with physical observations. In addition, we prove the uniqueness of the energy minimizer in degrees $0$ and $-1$, and nonexistence of minimizers for all other degrees. Finally, we show that the homogeneous state remains stable even beyond the threshold at which the skyrmion loses stability, and we uncover a new stability transition driven by the Zeeman energy.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies minimizing solutions to a two dimensional Allen-Cahn system on the upper half plane, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, \begin{equation*}
  \Delta u-\nabla_u W(u)=0, \quad u: \mathbb{R}_+^2\to \mathbb{R}^2,\ u=u_0 \text{ on } \partial \mathbb{R}_+^2, \end{equation*} where $W: \mathbb{R}^2\to [0,\infty)$ is a multi-well potential. We give a complete classification of such half-space minimizing solutions in terms of their blow-down limits at infinity. In addition, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of solutions near the associated sharp interfaces.</description>

      <title>A unified spatiotemporal formulation with physics-preserving structure for time-dependent convection-diffusion problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified four-dimensional (4D) spatiotemporal formulation for time-dependent convection-diffusion problems that preserves underlying physical structures. By treating time as an additional space-like coordinate, the evolution problem is reformulated as a stationary convection-diffusion equation on a 4D space-time domain. Using exterior calculus, we extend this framework to the full family of convection-diffusion problems posed on $H(\textbf{grad})$, $H(\textbf{curl})$, and $H(\text{div})$. The resulting formulation is based on a 4D Hodge-Laplacian operator with a spatiotemporal diffusion tensor and convection field, augmented by a small temporal perturbation to ensure nondegeneracy. This formulation naturally incorporates fundamental physical constraints, including divergence-free and curl-free conditions. We further introduce an exponentially-fitted 4D spatiotemporal flux operator that symmetrizes the convection-diffusion operator and enables a well-posed variational formulation. Finally, we prove that the temporally-perturbed formulation converges to the original time-dependent convection-diffusion model as the perturbation parameter tends to zero.</description>

      <title>$L_p$-estimates for nonlocal equations with general L\'evy measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider nonlocal operators of the form \begin{equation*}
  L_t u(x) = \int_{\mathbb{R}^d} \left( u(x+y)-u(x)-\nabla u(x)\cdot y^{(\sigma)} \right) \nu_t(dy), \end{equation*} where $\nu_t$ is a general L\'evy measure of order $\sigma \in(0,2)$. We allow this class of L\'evy measures to be very singular and impose no regularity assumptions in the time variable. Continuity of the operators and the unique strong solvability of the corresponding nonlocal parabolic equations in $L_p$ spaces are established. We also demonstrate that, depending on the ranges of $\sigma$ and $d$, the operator can or cannot be treated in weighted mixed-norm spaces.</description>

      <title>Global spherically symmetric classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data of the multi-dimensional non-isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1871, Saint-Venant introduced the shallow water equations. Since then, the global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data of the multi-dimensional viscous Saint-Venant system have remained a well-known open problem. It was only recently that [Huang-Meng-Zhang, http:arXiv:2512.15029, 2025], under the assumption of radial symmetry, first proved the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the initial-boundary value problem of the two-dimensional viscous shallow water equations. At the same time, [Chen-Zhang-Zhu, http:arXiv:2512.18545, 2025] also independently proved the existence of global large solutions to the Cauchy problem of this system. Notably, in the work of Huang-Meng-Zhang, they also established the existence of global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations satisfying the BD entropy equality in both two and three dimensions, and the viscous shallow water equations are precisely a specific class of isentropic compressible fluids subject to the BD entropy equality. In this paper, we prove a new BD entropy inequality for a class of non-isentropic compressible fluids, which can be regarded as a generalization of the shallow water equations with transported entropy. Employing new estimates on the lower bound of density different from that of Huang-Meng-Zhang's work, we show the "viscous shallow water system with transport entropy" will admit global classical solutions for arbitrary large initial data to the spherically symmetric initial-boundary value problem in both two and three dimensions. Our results also relax the restrictions on the dimension and adiabatic index imposed in Huang-Meng-Zhang's work on the shallow water equations, extending the range from $N=2,\ \gamma \ge \frac{3}{2}$ to $N=2,\ \gamma &gt; 1$ and $N=3,\ 1&lt;\gamma&lt;3$.</description>

      <title>H\"older continuity of weak solutions to the thin-film equation in $d=2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thin-film equation $\partial_t u = -\nabla \cdot (u^n \nabla \Delta u)$ describes the evolution of the height $u=u(x,t)\geq 0$ of a viscous thin liquid film spreading on a flat solid surface. We prove H\"older continuity of energy-dissipating weak solutions to the thin-film equation in the physically most relevant case of two spatial dimensions $d=2$. While an extensive existence theory of weak solutions to the thin-film equation was established more than two decades ago, even boundedness of weak solutions in $d=2$ has remained a major unsolved problem in the theory of the thin-film equation. Due the fourth-order structure of the thin-film equation, De Giorgi-Nash-Moser theory is not applicable. Our proof is based on the hole-filling technique, the challenge being posed by the degenerate parabolicity of the fourth-order PDE.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study higher-order Bol's inequality for radial normal solutions to a singular Liouville equation. By applying these inequalities along with compactness arguments, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of radial normal solutions to a singular $Q$-curvature problem. Moreover, under suitable assumptions on the $Q$-curvature, we obtain uniform bounds on the total $Q$-curvature.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of Fourier Integral Operators with complex phases on Fourier Lebesgue spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop boundedness estimates for Fourier integral operators on Fourier Lebesgue spaces when the associated canonical relation is parametrised by a complex phase function. Our result constitutes the complex analogue of those obtained for real canonical relations by Rodino, Nicola, and Cordero. We prove that, under the spatial factorization condition of rank $\varkappa$, the corresponding Fourier integral operator is bounded on the Fourier Lebesgue space $\mathcal{F}L^p,$ provided that the order $m$ of the operator satisfies that $ m \leq -\varkappa\left|\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{2}\right|, 1 \leq p \leq \infty. $ This condition on the order $m$ is sharp.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the following chemotaxis-fluid system in a two-dimensional bounded domain $\Omega$: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  n_t + u \cdot \nabla n &amp;= \Delta n - \chi \nabla \cdot \left (n \frac{\nabla c}{c^k} \right ) + r n - \frac{\mu n^2}{\log^\eta(n+e)},
  c_t + u \cdot \nabla c &amp;= \Delta c - \alpha c + \beta n,
  u_t + u \cdot \nabla u &amp;= \Delta u - \nabla P + n \nabla \phi + f,
  \nabla \cdot u &amp;= 0,
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $r, \mu, \alpha, \beta, \chi$ are positive parameters, $k, \eta \in (0,1)$, $\phi \in W^{2,\infty}(\Omega)$, and $f \in C^1\left(\bar{\Omega}\times [0, \infty)\right) \cap L^\infty\left(\Omega \times (0, \infty)\right)$. We show that, under suitable conditions on the initial data and with no-flux/no-flux/Dirichlet boundary conditions, this system admits a globally bounded classical solution. Furthermore, the system possesses an absorbing set in the topology of $C^0(\bar{\Omega}) \times W^{1, \infty}(\Omega) \times C^0(\bar{\Omega}; \mathbb{R}^2)$.</description>

      <title>On exact Observability for Compactly perturbed infinite dimension system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.25041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the observability of compactly perturbed infinite dimensional systems. Assuming that a given infinite-dimensional system with self-adjoint generator is exactly observable we derive sufficient conditions on a compact self adjoint perturbation to guarantee that the perturbed system stays exactly observable. The analysis is based on a careful asymptotic estimation of the spectral elements of the perturbed unbounded operator in terms of the compact perturbation. These intermediate results are of importance themselves.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Galerkin Method and Hierarchical Preconditioning for PDE-constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop efficient hierarchical preconditioners for optimal control problems governed by partial differential equations with uncertain coefficients. Adopting a discretize-then-optimize framework that integrates finite element discretization, stochastic Galerkin approximation, and advanced time-discretization schemes, the approach addresses the challenge of large-scale, ill-conditioned linear systems arising in uncertainty quantification. By exploiting the sparsity inherent in generalized polynomial chaos expansions, we derive hierarchical preconditioners based on truncated stochastic expansion that strike an effective balance between computational cost and preconditioning quality. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed preconditioners significantly accelerate the convergence of iterative solvers compared to existing methods, providing robust and efficient solvers for both steady-state and time-dependent optimal control applications under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A note on the space-time variational formulation for the wave equation with source term in $L^2(Q)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a variational formulation for the scalar wave equation in the second-order formulation on bounded Lipschitz domains and homogeneous initial conditions. We investigate a variational framework in a bounded space-time cylinder $Q$ with a new solution space and the test space $L^2(Q)$ for source terms in $L^2(Q)$. Using existence and uniqueness results in $H^1(Q)$, we prove that this variational setting fits the inf-sup theory, including an isomorphism as solution operator. Moreover, we show that the new solution space is not a subspace of $H^2(Q)$. This new uniqueness and solvability result is not only crucial for discretizations using space-time methods, including least-squares approaches, but also important for regularity results and the analysis of related space-time boundary integral equations, which form the basis for space-time boundary element methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of positive eigenvalues with associated nonnegative mild eigenfunctions for a class of abstract initial value problems in Banach spaces with functional, possibly nonlocal, initial conditions. The framework includes periodic, multipoint, and integral average conditions. Our approach relies on nonlinear analysis, topological methods, and the theory of strongly continuous semigroups, yielding results applicable to a wide range of models. As an illustration, we apply the abstract theory to a reaction-diffusion equation with a nonlocal initial condition arising from a heat flow problem.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Theory for Photonic Hall Effect in Honeycomb Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a mathematical theory for the photonic Hall effect and prove the existence of guided electromagnetic waves at the interface of two honeycomb photonic crystals. The guided wave resembles the edge states in electronic systems: it is induced by the topological Hall effect, and the wave propagates along the interface but not in the bulk media. Starting from a symmetric honeycomb photonic crystal that attains Dirac points at the high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, $K$ and $K'$, we introduce two classes of perturbations for the periodic medium. The perturbations lift the Dirac degeneracy, forming a spectral band valley at the points $K$ and $K'$ with well-defined topological phase that depends on the sign of the perturbation parameters. By employing the layer potential techniques and spectral analysis, we investigate the existence of guided wave along an interface when two honeycomb photonic crystals are glued together. In particular, we elucidate the relationship between the existence of the interface mode and the nature of perturbations imposed on the two periodic media separated by the interface.</description>

      <title>Classification of ancient cylindrical mean curvature flows and the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We resolve the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture for mean curvature flows in all dimensions and for all types of cylindrical singularities. Specifically, we show that if the tangent flow at a singular point is a multiplicity-one cylinder, then in a neighborhood of that point the flow is mean-convex, its time-slices arise as level sets of a continuous function, and all nearby tangent flows are cylindrical. Moreover, we establish a canonical neighborhood theorem near such points, which characterizes the flow via local models. We also obtain a more uniform version of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Conjecture, which only requires closeness to a cylinder at some initial time and yields a quantitative version of this structural description.
  Our proof relies on a complete classification of ancient, asymptotically cylindrical flows. We prove that any such flow is non-collapsed, convex, rotationally symmetric, and belongs to one of three canonical families: ancient ovals, the bowl soliton, or the flying wing translating solitons. Central to our method is a refined asymptotic analysis and a novel \emph{leading mode condition,} together with a new ``induction over thresholds'' argument. In addition, our approach provides a full parameterization of the space of asymptotically cylindrical flows and gives a new proof of the existence of flying wing solitons.
  Our method is independent of prior work and, together with our prequel paper, this work is largely self-contained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the long-time mixing behavior of the stochastic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^d$, $d\le 3$. It is well known that, under a sufficiently strong damping force, the system admits unique ergodicity, although the rate of convergence toward equilibrium has remained unknown. In this work, we address the mixing property in the regime of large damping and establish that solutions are attracted toward the unique invariant probability measure at polynomial rates of arbitrary order. Our approach is based on a coupling strategy with pathwise Strichartz estimates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of classical numerical solvers, such as Petviashvili's method or finite difference with Newton iterations, and neural network-based methods for computing ground states or profiles of solitary-wave solutions to the one-dimensional dispersive PDEs that include the nonlinear Schr\"odinger, the nonlinear Klein-Gordon and the generalized KdV equations. We confirm that classical approaches retain high-order accuracy and strong computational efficiency for single-instance problems in the one-dimensional setting. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are also able to reproduce qualitative solutions but are generally less accurate and less efficient in low dimensions than classical solvers due to expensive training and slow convergence. We also investigate the operator-learning methods, which, although computationally intensive during training, can be reused across many parameter instances, providing rapid inference after pretraining, making them attractive for applications involving repeated simulations or real-time predictions. For single-instance computations, however, the accuracy of operator-learning methods remains lower than that of classical methods or PINNs, in general.</description>

      <title>Heat kernel estimates for Markov processes with jump kernels blowing-up at the boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study purely discontinuous symmetric Markov processes on closed subsets of ${\mathbb R}^d$, $d\ge 1$, with jump kernels of the form $J(x,y)=|x-y|^{-d-\alpha}{\mathcal B}(x,y)$, $\alpha\in (0,2)$, where the function ${\mathcal B}(x,y)$ may blow up at the boundary of the state space. This extends the framework developed recently for conservative self-similar Markov processes on the upper half-space to a broader geometric setting. Examples of Markov processes that fall into our general framework include traces of isotropic $\alpha$-stable processes in $C^{1,\rm Dini}$ sets, processes in Lipschitz sets arising in connection with the nonlocal Neumann problem, and a large class of resurrected self-similar processes in the closed upper half-space.
  We establish sharp two-sided heat kernel estimates for these Markov processes. A fundamental difficulty in accomplishing this task is that, in contrast to the existing literature on heat kernels for jump processes, the tails of the associated jump measures in our setting are not uniformly bounded. Thus, standard techniques in the existing literature used to study heat kernels are not applicable. To overcome this obstacle, we employ recently developed weighted functional inequalities specifically designed for jump kernels blowing up at the boundary.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a correspondence between solutions $\lambda(x,y)$ of the Liouville equation \[ \Delta \lambda = -\varepsilon e^{-4\lambda}, \] and the Weierstrass representations of spacelike ($\varepsilon = 1$) and timelike ($\varepsilon = -1$) minimal surfaces with diagonalizable Weingarten map in the three-dimensional Lorentz--Minkowski space $\mathbb{L}^3$. Using complex and paracomplex analysis, we provide a unified treatment of both causal types. We study the action of pseudo-isometries of $\mathbb{L}^3$ on minimal surfaces via M\"obius-type transformations, establishing a correspondence between these transformations and rotations in the special orthochronous Lorentz group. Furthermore, we show how local solutions of the Liouville equation determine the Gauss map and the associated Weierstrass data. Finally, we present explicit examples of spacelike and timelike minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{L}^3$ arising from solutions of the Liouville equation.</description>

      <title>A finite element approach for minimizing line and surface energies arising in the study of singularities in liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a problem originating in the study of defect structures in nematic liquid crystals, we describe and study a numerical algorithm for the resolution of a Plateau-like problem. The energy contains the area of a two-dimensional surface $T$ and the length of its boundary $\partial T$ reduced by a prescribed curve to make our problem non-trivial. We additionally include an obstacle $E$ for $T$ and pose a surface energy on $E$. We present an algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers that minimizes a discretized version of the energy using finite elements, generalizing existing TV-minimization methods. We study different inclusion shapes demonstrating the rich structure of minimizing configurations and provide physical interpretation of our findings for colloidal particles in nematic liquid crystal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the question of defining a $p$-adic string worldsheet action in genus one, we define a Laplacian operator on the Tate curve, and study its Green's function. We show that the Green's function exists. We provide an explicit formula for the Green's function, which turns out to be a non-Archimedean counterpart of the Archimedean Green's function on a flat torus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerics to construct solitary waves in Dirac--Klein--Gordon (in one and three spatial dimensions) and study the dependence of energy and charge on $\omega$. For the construction, we use the iterative procedure, starting from solitary waves of nonlinear Dirac equation, computing the corresponding scalar field, and adjusting the coupling constant. We also consider the case of massless scalar field, when the iteration procedure could be compared with the shooting method. We use the virial identities to control the error of simulations. We also discuss possible implications from the obtained results for the spectral stability of solitary waves.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness for stochastic differential equations in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a versatile framework to study strong existence and uniqueness for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) in Hilbert spaces with irregular drift. We consider an SDE in a separable Hilbert space $H$ \begin{equation*} dX_t= (A X_t + b(X_t))dt +(-A)^{-\gamma/2}dW_t,\quad X_0=x_0 \in H, \end{equation*} where $A$ is a self-adjoint negative definite operator with purely atomic spectrum, $W$ is a cylindrical Wiener process, $b$ is $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function $H\to H$, and a nonnegative parameter $\gamma$ such that the stochastic convolution takes values in $H$. We show that this equation has a unique strong solution provided that $\alpha &gt; 2\gamma/(1+\gamma)$. This substantially extends the seminal work of Da Prato and Flandoli (2010) as no structural assumption on $b$ is imposed. To obtain this result, we do not use infinite-dimensional Kolmogorov equations but instead develop a new technique combining L\^e's theory of stochastic sewing in Hilbert spaces, Gaussian analysis, and a method of Lasry and Lions for approximation in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>The PDE-ODI principle and cylindrical mean curvature flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.25050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach for analyzing ancient solutions and singularities of mean curvature flow that are locally modeled on a cylinder. Its key ingredient is a general mechanism, called the \emph{PDE--ODI principle}, which converts a broad class of parabolic differential equations into systems of ordinary differential inequalities. This principle bypasses many delicate analytic estimates used in previous work, and yields asymptotic expansions to arbitrarily high order.
  As an application, we establish the uniqueness of the bowl soliton times a Euclidean factor among ancient, cylindrical flows with dominant linear mode. This extends previous results on this problem to the most general setting and is made possible by the stronger asymptotic control provided by our analysis. In the other case, when the quadratic mode dominates, we obtain a complete asymptotic expansion to arbitrary polynomial order, which will form the basis for a subsequent paper. Our framework also recovers and unifies several classical results. In particular, we give new proofs of the uniqueness of tangent flows (due to Colding-Minicozzi) and the rigidity of cylinders among shrinkers (due to Colding-Ilmanen-Minicozzi) by reducing both problems to a single ordinary differential inequality, without using the {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality.
  Our approach is independent of prior work and the paper is largely self-contained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of large-data weak entropy solutions to a nonisothermal immiscible compressible two-phase unsaturated flow model in porous media is proved. The model is thermodynamically consistent and includes temperature gradients and cross-diffusion effects. Due to the fact that some terms from the total energy balance are non-integrable in the classical weak sense, we consider so-called variational entropy solutions. A priori estimates are derived from the entropy balance and the total energy balance. The compactness is achieved by using the Div-Curl lemma.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider axisymmetric, swirl-free solutions of the Euler equation in four and higher dimensions. We show that in dimension $d\geq 4$, axisymmetric, swirl-free solutions of the Euler equation have properties which could allow finite-time singularity formation of a form that is excluded when $d=3$, and we prove a conditional blowup result for axisymmetric, swirl-free solutions of the Euler equation in dimension $d\geq 4$. The condition which must be imposed on the solution in order to imply blowup becomes weaker as $d\to +\infty$, suggesting the dynamics are becoming much more singular as the dimension increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bottleneck in the theory of large-amplitude and multi-d viscous and relaxation shock stability is the development of nonlinear damping estimates controlling higher by lower derivatives. These have traditionally proceeded from time-evolution bounds based on Friedrichs symmetric and Kawashima or Goodman type energy estimates. Here, we propose an alternative program based on frequency-dependent pseudodifferential time-space damping estimates in the spirit of Kreiss. These are seen to be equivalent in the linear case to high-frequency spectral stability, and, just as for the constant-coefficient analysis of Kreiss, sharp in a pointwise, fixed-frequency, sense. This point of view leads to a number of simplifications and extensions using already-existing analysis. We point to the new issue of turning points, analogous to glancing points in the constant-coefficient case as an important direction for further development.</description>

      <title>Relationship between haptotaxis and chemotaxis in cell dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomenon where cells with elongated protrusions, such as neurons, communicate by contacting other cells and arrange themselves appropriately is termed cell sorting through haptotaxis. This phenomenon is described by partial differential equations involving nonlocal advection. In contrast, cell phenomena where cells communicate with other cells via chemical substances and arrange themselves appropriately are termed cell sorting through chemotaxis, typically modeled by chemotactic systems such as the Keller--Segel model. Although there are clear differences between haptotaxis and chemotaxis, similar behaviors are often observed. In this study, we investigate the relationship between haptotaxis and chemotaxis in cell sorting phenomena. Specifically, we analyze the connections between a nonlocal aggregation model for haptotaxis and a Keller--Segel type chemotaxis system. By demonstrating convergence under specific kernel approximations, we show how these distinct mechanisms can lead to comparable dynamic behaviors. In particular, we establish that the gradient of a given kernel can be approximated by linear combinations of gradients of fundamental solutions, which also provides a mathematical contribution of independent interest. This study provides a mathematical framework for understanding the interplay between haptotaxis and chemotaxis in cell sorting phenomena.</description>

      <title>Sharp bilinear eigenfunction estimate, $L^\infty_{x_2}L^p_{t,x_1}$-type Strichartz estimate, and energy-critical NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sharp bilinear eigenfunction estimates for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the standard three-sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$, eliminating the logarithmic loss that has persisted in the literature since the pioneering work of Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov over twenty years ago. This completes the theory of multilinear eigenfunction estimates on the standard spheres. Our approach relies on viewing $\mathbb{S}^3$ as the compact Lie group $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and exploiting its representation theory. Motivated by applications to the energy-critical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLS) on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we also prove a refined anisotropic Strichartz estimate on the cylindrical space $\mathbb{R}_{x_1} \times \mathbb{T}_{x_2}$ of $L^\infty_{x_2}L^4_{t,x_1}$-type, adapted to certain spectrally localized functions. The argument relies on multiple sharp measure estimates and a robust kernel decomposition method. Combining these two key ingredients, we derive a refined bilinear Strichartz estimate on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, which in turn yields small-data global well-posedness for the above mentioned NLS in the energy space.</description>

      <title>Nonradial Quenching Profile for a MEMS Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a quenching solution to the parabolic MEMS model \[ u_t = \Delta u - \frac{1}{u^2} \quad \text{in } \mathcal{B} \times (0,T), \quad u|_{\partial \mathcal{B}} = 1, \] where $\mathcal{B}$ is the unit disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $T &gt; 0$ denotes the quenching time. The constructed solution quenches only at the origin and admits the final profile \[ u(x,T) \sim \left(x_1^2 x_2^2 + \theta(x_1^6 + x_2^6)\right)^{\frac{1}{3}} \quad \text{as } |x| \to 0, \] where $\theta \in (0, \theta^*)$ for some $\theta^* &gt; 0$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a quenching solution with a genuinely non-radial profile. The proof relies on the construction of a good approximate solution, using a perturbative expansion in self-similar variables. We then justify the true solution that remains close to this approximation through a spectral analysis combined with a robust energy method.</description>

      <title>On Type I blowup and $\varepsilon$-regularity criteria of suitable weak solutions to the 3D incompressible MHD equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study interior $\varepsilon$-regularity and Type I blowup criteria for suitable weak solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible MHD equations. Our starting point is a direct iteration scheme for the classical Caffarelli--Kohn--Nirenberg scaled energy quantities $A,E,C$ and $D$, which yields $\varepsilon$-regularity criteria under smallness assumptions on the velocity field $u$ and boundedness assumptions on the magnetic field $b$, with the underlying scaling-invariant quantities chosen independently. As an intermediate step, we prove that finiteness of one such scaling-invariant quantity for each of $u$ and $b$ allows only Type I blowup, in the sense that $A(u,b;r)+E(u,b;r)+C(u,b;r)+D(p;r)&lt;\infty$ for small $r$. This extends Seregin's Type I criteria for the Navier--Stokes equations to the MHD setting and provides a natural point of departure for the analysis of Type II blowup. By interpolation and embedding, we further obtain $\varepsilon$-regularity criteria and Type I characterisations in terms of general scaled mixed Lebesgue norms for $u$ and $b$, with independent exponent choices. While we do not aim to sharpen existing mixed-norm $\varepsilon$-regularity criteria, the present formulation offers a unified and comparatively direct route that is naturally compatible with the Type I framework; in particular, the mixed-norm Type I description does not follow from earlier mixed-norm $\varepsilon$-regularity proofs by a formal replacement of the smallness parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the global exponential stabilization of a degenerate Euler-Bernoulli beam subjected to a non uniform axial force and a delayed feedback control. First, we establish the well-posedness of the system by constructing an appropriate energy space in weighted Sobolev settings. Using L\"umer-Phillips theorem, we prove that the linear operator associated with the problem generates a $\mathcal{C}_0$-semigroup of contractions. Second, we establish the uniform exponential stability of the system. By constructing a novel Lyapunov functional incorporating weighted integral terms, we demonstrate that the energy's system exponentially decays to zero and derive a precise decay rate estimate. This work provides a significant extension to the stability theory for complex distributed parameter systems.</description>

      <title>Non-density of nodal lines in the clamped plate problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in contrast to the case of Laplace eigenfunctions, the nodal set of high energy eigenfunctions of the clamped plate problem is not necessarily dense, and can in fact exhibit macroscopic "nodal voids". Specifically, we show that there are small deformations of the unit disk admitting a clamped plate eigenfunction of arbitrarily high frequency that does not vanish in a disk of radius 0.44.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic equations with fifth-order symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the classification of hyperbolic equations. We study a class of equations of the form $$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x\partial y}=F\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x},\frac{\partial u}{\partial y},u\right),$$ where $u(x,y)$ is the unknown function and $x,y$ are independent variables. The classification is based on the requirement for the existence of higher fifth-order symmetries. As a result, a list of four equations with the required conditions was obtained.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness of Pseudo-Parabolic Gradient Systems with State-Dependent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a general mathematical framework for pseudo-parabolic gradient systems with state-dependent dynamics. The state dependence is induced by variable coefficient fields in the governing energy functional. Such coefficients arise naturally in scientific and technological models, including state-dependent mobilities in KWC-type grain boundary motion and variable orientation-adaptation operators in anisotropic image denoising. We establish two main results: the existence of energy-dissipating solutions, and the uniqueness and continuous dependence on initial data. The proposed framework yields a general well-posedness theory for a broad class of nonlinear evolutionary systems driven by state-dependent operators. As illustrative applications, we present an anisotropic image-denoising model and a new pseudo-parabolic KWC-type model for anisotropic grain boundary motion, and prove that both fit naturally within the abstract structure of $(\mathrm{S})_\nu$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the capillary $L_p$-Christoffel--Minkowski problem in the half-space for $1&lt;p&lt;k+1$ in the class of even hypersurfaces. A crucial ingredient is a non-collapsing estimate that yields lower bounds for both the height and the capillary support function. Our result extends the capillary Christoffel--Minkowski existence result of \cite{HIS25}.</description>

      <title>The Time-Periodic Cahn-Hilliard-Gurtin System on the Half Space as a Mixed-Order System with General Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-posedness and maximal regularity result for the time-periodic Cahn-Hilliard-Gurtin system in the half space is proved. For this purpose, we introduce a novel class of complementing boundary conditions, extending the classical Lopatinski\u{\i}-Shapiro conditions from elliptic and parabolic theory to time-periodic mixed-order systems with general boundary conditions. Moreover, we show that the classical Lopatinski\u{\i}-Shapiro conditions are in general insufficient for well-posedness of mixed-order systems.</description>

      <title>On the zero sets of harmonic polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24116v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider nonzero harmonic functions vanishing on some subsets of $\mathbb R^n$. We give a positive solution to Problem 151 from the Scottish Book posed by R. Wavre in 1936. In more detail, we construct a nonzero harmonic polynomial that vanishes on the edges of the unit cube. Moreover, using harmonic morphisms we build new nontrivial families of harmonic polynomials that vanish at the same set in the unit ball in $\mathbb R^n$ for all $n \geq 4$. This extends certain results by Logunov and Malinnikova. We also present new results on harmonic functions in the space whose zero sets are unions of affine codimension two subspaces.</description>

      <title>Local Laws and Fluctuations for Super-Coulombic Riesz Gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local statistical behavior of the super-Coulombic Riesz gas of particles in Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension, with inverse power distance repulsion integrable near $0$, and with a general confinement potential, in a certain regime of inverse temperature. Using a bootstrap procedure, we prove local laws on the next order energy and control on fluctuations of linear statistics that are valid down to the microscopic lengthscale, and provide controls for instance, on the number of particles in a (mesoscopic or microscopic) box, and the existence of a limit point process up to subsequences.
  As a consequence of the local laws, we derive an almost additivity of the free energy that allows us to exhibit for the first time a CLT for Riesz gases corresponding to small enough inverse powers, at small mesoscopic length scales, which can be interpreted as the convergence of the associated potential to a fractional Gaussian field.
  Compared to the Coulomb interaction case, the main new issues arise from the nonlocal aspect of the Riesz kernel. This manifests in (i) a novel technical difficulty in generalizing the transport approach of Lebl\'e and the second author to the Riesz gas which now requires analyzing a degenerate and singular elliptic PDE, (ii) the fact that the transport map is not localized, which makes it more delicate to localize the estimates, (iii) the need for coupling the local laws and the fluctuations control inside the same bootstrap procedure.</description>
