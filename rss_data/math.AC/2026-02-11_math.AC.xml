      <title>On the Hilbert depth of the quotient ring of the edge ideal of a complete bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $n\geq m$ be two positive integers, $S_{n,m}=K[x_1,\ldots,x_n,y_1,\ldots,y_m]$ and $I_{n,m}=(x_iy_j\;:\;1\leq i\leq n,1\leq j\leq m)\subset S_{n,m}$ the edge ideal of a complete bipartite graph. Denote $h(n,m)=\operatorname{hdepth}(S_{n,m}/I_{n,m})$. We prove that $h(n,m)\geq \left\lceil \frac{n}{2} \right\rceil$ and the equality holds if $m$ belong to a certain interval centered in $\left\lceil \frac{n} {2} \right\rceil$. Also, we find some tight bounds for $h(n,n)$ and we prove several inequalities between $h(n,m)$ and $h(n,m')$.</description>

      <title>Remarks on modules of finite projective dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate homological and depth-theoretic properties of finitely generated modules of finite projective dimension over Noetherian local rings. A central theme is the study of criteria for freeness and reflexivity derived from the torsion-freeness or reflexivity of tensor products of the form \( M \otimes_R M \) and \( M \otimes_R M^* \). Under mild homological assumptions, we prove that such properties of these tensor products impose strong structural constraints on \( M \), often forcing it to be free. These results generalize classical theorems of Auslander beyond the regular case and contribute to the broader understanding of rigidity phenomena in commutative algebra.
  The second part of the paper is devoted to the dimension and support of Ext-modules, particularly \( {Ext}^i_R(M, R) \) for critical values of i, when \( M \) has finite projective dimension. We establish sharp bounds on their Krull dimensions, analyze their behavior for prime and equidimensional modules, and relate these findings to the grade conjecture and other homological conjectures. Applications include new cases of a question of Jorgensen, which asks whether \( {pd}(M) &lt; i \) whenever \({Ext}^i_R(M, M) = 0 \) and M has finite projective dimension over a complete intersection ring.
  Finally, we examine the projective dimension of prime ideals in rings that fail chain conditions. We show that in non-catenary or pathological saturated chain settings, such prime ideals often have infinite projective dimension.</description>

      <title>Homological properties of rings defined by $n+1$ general quadrics in $n$ variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the almost complete intersection ring $R$ defined by $n+1$ general quadrics in a polynomial ring in $n$ variables over a field $\sf{k}$ and a corresponding linked Gorenstein ring $A$. The overarching theme is that, while not Koszul (except for some small values of $n$), these rings have homological properties that extend those of Koszul rings. We establish that finitely generated modules over these rings have rational Poincar\'e series and we give concrete formulas for the Poincar\'e series of $\sf{k}$ over both $A$ and $R$. We also show that $A$ has minimal rate and its Yoneda algebra $\text{Ext}_A(\sf{k},\sf{k})$ is generated by its elements of degrees $1$ and $2$. While the graded Betti numbers of $R$ and $A$ over the polynomial ring are not known when $n$ is odd, our approach provides bounds and yields values for two of these Betti numbers, showing in particular that $R$ is level.</description>

      <title>Generic flatness of the cohomology of thickenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a set of $m$ distinct points in projective space over a field, and $t$ a positive integer, a classical question asks for the least degree of a hypersurface that passes through each point with multiplicity at least $t$. Related to this, it remains unresolved whether there exists a dense open set of $m$-tuples of points for which this least degree is constant for each $t\ge 1$. We formulate a conjecture regarding the generic freeness of certain local cohomology modules that would answer this in the affirmative; we then prove this conjecture for up to $n+2$ points in projective $n$-space over a field. In a related direction, we prove a generic flatness result for the cohomology of thickenings of a closed subscheme of projective space over an integral domain.</description>

      <title>Shellability in Clique-Free Complexes of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study combinatorial and algebraic properties of $t$-clique-free complexes, a family of simplicial complexes associated with finite simple graphs that generalize the classical independence complex. For a graph $G$ and an integer $t \ge 2$, the $t$-clique-free complex $\mathsf{CF}_t(G)$ is the simplicial complex on the vertex set of $G$ whose faces are the subsets inducing no cliques of size $t$.
  Our main results provide sufficient conditions for shellability and related decomposability properties of $t$-clique-free complexes. In particular, we show that if $G$ is a $t$-diamond-free chordal graph (in particular, a block graph), then $\mathsf{CF}_t(G)$ is $(t-2)$-decomposable and hence shellable. We also investigate how graph modifications via clique attachments influence shellability. Generalizing earlier constructions involving whiskers and clique extensions, we introduce the following operation: given a graph $H$, a subset $S \subseteq V(H)$, and an integer $t \ge 2$, we form a graph $\operatorname{Cl}(H,S,t)$ by attaching to each vertex in $S$ a clique of size at least $t$. We prove that $\mathsf{CF}_t(H\setminus S)$ is shellable if and only if $\mathsf{CF}_t(\operatorname{Cl}(H,S,t))$ is shellable. This yields a flexible method for constructing shellable complexes, particularly when $S$ is a cycle cover. In addition, we extend the notion of clique whiskering and show that for any graph admitting a clique vertex-partition, the resulting $t$-clique whiskering produces a pure and shellable, and hence Cohen-Macaulay, $t$-clique-free complex.
  Finally, we establish a Fr\"oberg-type result linking chordality and linear resolutions. We show that for any chordal graph $G$, the edge ideal of the complement $t$-clique clutter $\overline{\mathcal{CH}_t(G)}$ admits a $t$-linear resolution over any field.</description>

      <title>Graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra of surfaces in $\mathbb P^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute an explicit closed formula for the Hilbert polynomial of the Jacobian algebra $M(f)$ of a reduced surface $X:f=0$ in $\mathbb P^3$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of the algebra $M(f)$. When $X$ has only isolated singularities, a result by A. du Plessis and C. T. C. Wall yields new necessary condition for a set of positive integers to be the graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra of such a surface. The comparison with the plane curve case is discussed in detail and additional information is given in the case of nodal surfaces.</description>

      <title>A study of a quadratic almost complete intersection ideal and its linked Gorenstein ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the ideal $I=(x_1^2, \dots, x_n^2, (x_1+\dots+x_n)^2)$ in the polynomial ring $Q=k[x_1, \dots, x_n]$, where $k$ is a field of characteristic zero or greater than $n$. We also study the Gorenstein ideal $G$ linked to $I$ via the complete intersection ideal $(x_1^2, \dots, x_n^2)$. We compute the Betti numbers of $I$ and $G$ over $Q$ when $n$ is odd and extend known computations when $n$ is even. A consequence is that the socle of $Q/I$ is generated in a single degree (thus $Q/I$ is level) and its dimension is a Catalan number. We also describe the generators and the initial ideal with respect to reverse lexicographic order for the Gorenstein ideal $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the implications of the finiteness of homological dimensions for Ext modules, focusing on projective dimension, injective dimension, and their Gorenstein counterpart. In this direction, we establish several finiteness criteria for homological dimensions. Under such finiteness conditions, our main result is a new duality for certain Ext modules when tensored by canonical modules.</description>

      <title>A Weaker Notion of Atomicity in Integral Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In classical factorization theory, an integral domain is called \emph{atomic} if every nonzero nonunit element can be written as a finite product of irreducible elements. Here, we introduce and study a weaker notion of atomicity, which relaxes the requirement that all elements admit a factorization into irreducibles. Namely, we say that an integral domain is \emph{sub-atomic} if every nonunit divisor of an atomic element is also atomic. We further consider several factorization properties associated with this notion. Then, we investigate the basic properties of such domains, provide examples, and explore the behavior of the sub-atomic property under standard constructions such as localization, polynomial rings, and $D+M$ constructions. Our results highlight the independence of the sub-atomic property from other classical factorization properties and introduce an important class of integral domains that lies between atomic and non-atomic domains.</description>
