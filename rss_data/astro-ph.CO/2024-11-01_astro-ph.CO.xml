      <title>The VST ATLAS Quasar Survey II: Halo mass profiles of galaxies, LRGs and galaxy clusters via quasar and CMB lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We cross-correlate a low-contamination subset of the VST ATLAS g &lt; 22.5 quasar catalogue with g &lt; 21.5 galaxy clusters, r &lt; 21 galaxies and r &lt; 19.5 Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) to probe their halo mass profiles via quasar magnification bias caused by weak lensing. In the case of galaxy clusters we find that at small scales their mass profiles are well fitted by Navarro, Frenk and White (NFW) models with masses within the expected range. For the galaxies, we find consistency with previous SDSS-based results for the galaxy-quasar cross-correlation and the galaxy auto-correlation functions. Disagreement as to whether the cross-correlation results are in tension with $\Lambda$CDM appears due to different assumptions as to whether galaxies trace mass. We conclude that halo occupation distribution (HOD) models fit the galaxy - quasar lensing results better than models where galaxies trace the mass. We further test the cluster and galaxy HOD models in the 2-halo range using the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing map, finding that the cross-correlation with both the poorest clusters and the galaxies may be marginally over-predicted by the above HOD models. Finally, we measure the magnification bias of LRGs using both quasar and CMB lensing and find that the observed quasar lensing amplitude may be $\approx 2\times$ too high and, on larger scales, the CMB lensing amplitude may be too low to be explained by a standard LRG HOD model.</description>

      <title>Observable CMB Tensor Modes from Cosmological Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A B-mode polarization signal in the cosmic microwave background is widely regarded as smoking gun evidence for gravitational waves produced during inflation. Here we demonstrate that tensor perturbations from a cosmological phase transition in the post-inflationary universe can nearly mimic the characteristic shape and power of inflationary predictions across a range of observable angular scales. Although phase transitions arise from subhorizon physics, they nevertheless exhibit a white noise power spectrum on superhorizon scales. Thus, while B-mode power is suppressed on these large scales, it is not necessarily negligible. For viable phase transition parameters, the maximal B-mode amplitude at multipole moments around the recombination peak can be comparable to nearly all single-field inflationary predictions that can be tested with current and future experiments. This approximate degeneracy can be broken if a signal is measured at different angular scales, since the inflationary power spectrum is nearly scale invariant while the phase transition predicts a distinct suppression of power on large scales.</description>

      <title>The VST ATLAS Quasar Survey III: Halo mass function via quasar clustering and quasar-CMB lensing cross-clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit the VST ATLAS quasar/QSO catalogue to perform three measurements of the quasar halo mass profile. First, we make a new estimate of the angular auto-correlation function of $\approx230,000$ ATLAS quasars with $z_{photo}\lesssim 2.5$ and $17&lt;g&lt;22$. By comparing with the $\Lambda$CDM mass clustering correlation function, we measure the quasar bias to be $b_Q\approx2.1$, implying a quasar halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx8.5\times10^{11}$h$^{-1} M_\odot$. Second, we cross-correlate these $z\approx1.7$ ATLAS quasars with the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing maps, detecting a somewhat stronger signal at $4'&lt;\theta&lt;60'$ than previous authors. Scaling these authors' model fit to our data we estimate a quasar host halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx8.3\times10^{11}h^{-1}$M$_{\odot}$. Third, we fit Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model parameters to our quasar auto-correlation function and from the derived halo mass function we estimate a quasar halo mass of $M_{halo}\approx2.5\times10^{12}$h$^{-1} M_\odot$. We then compare our HOD model prediction to our quasar-CMB lensing result, confirming their consistency. We find that most ($\approx2/3$) QSOs have halo masses within a factor of $\approx3$ of this average mass. An analysis based on the probability of X-ray detections of AGN in galaxies and the galaxy stellar mass function gives a similarly small mass range. Finally, we compare the quasar halo mass and luminosity functions and suggest that gravitational growth may produce the constant space density with redshift seen in the quasar luminosity function.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Slow-Roll Inflation on the Lattice: Backreaction and Nonlinear Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violating the slow-roll regime during the final stages of inflation can significantly enhance curvature perturbations, a scenario often invoked in models producing primordial black holes and small-scale scalar induced gravitational waves. When perturbations are enhanced, one approaches the regime in which tree-level computations are insufficient, and nonlinear corrections may become relevant. In this work, we conduct lattice simulations of ultra-slow-roll (USR) dynamics to investigate the significance of nonlinear effects, both in terms of backreaction on the background and in the evolution of perturbations. Our systematic study of various USR potentials reveals that nonlinear corrections are significant when the tree-level curvature power spectrum peaks at $\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta} = {\cal O}(10^{-3})-{\cal O}(10^{-2})$, with 5%$-$10% corrections. Larger enhancements yield even greater differences. We establish a universal relation between simulation and tree-level quantities $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm tree}\left(1+\sqrt{\mathcal{P}^{\rm max}_{\zeta,\rm tree}}\right)$ at the end of the USR phase, which is valid in all cases we consider. Additionally, we explore how nonlinear interactions during the USR phase affect the clustering and non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, crucial for understanding the phenomenological consequences of USR, such as scalar-induced gravitational waves and primordial black holes. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of going beyond leading order perturbation theory results, through higher-order or non-perturbative computations, to make robust predictions for inflation models exhibiting a USR phase.</description>

      <title>Are CMB derived cosmological parameters affected by foregrounds associated to nearby galaxies?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform cosmological parameters estimation on Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps masking the recently discovered foreground related to nearby spiral galaxies. In addition, we also analyse the association between these foreground regions and recent claims of cosmological causal horizons in localized CMB parameter estimates. Our analysis shows consistent cosmological parameter values regardless of the masking approach, though reduced sky areas introduce larger uncertainties. By modelling the new extragalactic foreground, we identify a resemblance with local parameter variation maps with a statistical significance at the 3 sigma level, suggesting that a simplified foreground model partially accounts, (40-50)% correlation with 15% uncertainty, for the observed causal horizons. These findings add new evidence to the existence of the new foreground associated with large spiral galaxies and show that estimates of cosmological parameters on smaller patches on the sky can be largely affected by these foregrounds, but that the parameters taken over the full sky are unaltered.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the first detection of fast radio bursts (FRBs) being as recent as 2007, they have already been proven to be a fantastic tool as a unique cosmological probe. In this chapter, after a brief introduction to FRBs and how they are currently detected, we describe various cosmological questions and how FRB research has both aided previous studies and can continue to do so. Topics include placing constraints on cosmological parameters to understanding the distribution of baryons throughout the Universe. We conclude with some notes on the challenges to be overcome and best enable ongoing and future FRB-based studies of cosmology.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the power spectrum turnover scale from the cross-correlation between CMB lensing and {\sl Quaia}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the projected clustering of quasars in the Gaia-unWISE quasar catalog, Quaia, and its cross-correlation with CMB lensing data from Planck, to measure the large-scale turnover of the matter power spectrum, associated with the size of the horizon at the epoch of matter-radiation equality. The turnover is detected with a significance of between $2.3$ and $3.1\sigma$, depending on the method used to quantify it. From this measurement, the equality scale is determined at the $\sim20\%$ level. Using the turnover scale as a standard ruler alone (discarding information from the large-scale curvature of the power spectrum), in combination with supernova data through an inverse distance ladder approach, we measure the current expansion rate to be $H_0=62.7\pm17.2\,{\rm km}\,{\rm s}^{-1}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. The addition of information coming from the power spectrum curvature approximately halves the standard ruler uncertainty. Our measurement in combination with calibrated supernovae from Pantheon$+$ and SH0ES constrains the CMB temperature to be $T_{\rm CMB}=3.10^{+0.48}_{-0.36}\,{\rm K}$, independently of CMB data. Alternatively, assuming the value of $T_{\rm CMB}$ from COBE-FIRAS, we can constrain the effective number of relativistic species in the early Universe to be $N_{\rm eff}=3.0^{+5.8}_{-2.9}$.</description>

      <title>Generative modelling for mass-mapping with fast uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter in the Universe is an important goal of modern cosmology. A key method for probing this distribution is via weak gravitational lensing mass-mapping - a challenging ill-posed inverse problem where one infers the convergence field from observed shear measurements. Upcoming stage IV surveys, such as those made by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and Euclid satellite, will provide a greater quantity and precision of data for lensing analyses, necessitating high-fidelity mass-mapping methods that are computationally efficient and that also provide uncertainties for integration into downstream cosmological analyses. In this work we introduce MMGAN, a novel mass-mapping method based on a regularised conditional generative adversarial network (GAN) framework, which generates approximate posterior samples of the convergence field given shear data. We adopt Wasserstein GANs to improve training stability and apply regularisation techniques to overcome mode collapse, issues that otherwise are particularly acute for conditional GANs. We train and validate our model on a mock COSMOS-style dataset before applying it to true COSMOS survey data. Our approach significantly outperforms the Kaiser-Squires technique and achieves similar reconstruction fidelity as alternative state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. Notably, while alternative approaches for generating samples from a learned posterior are slow (e.g. requiring $\sim$10 GPU minutes per posterior sample), MMGAN can produce a high-quality convergence sample in less than a second.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that is based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and phenomenological modelling of star formation. The model yields BH mass-stellar mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. If the efficiency for BH mergers is high the JWST data prefer light seeds while the pre-JWST data prefers heavy seeds. The fit improves for a smaller merger efficiency, $O(0.1)$, for which both data prefer heavy seeds, while also accommodating the PTA GW background data.</description>

      <title>On the time-dependent density of quadratically coupled dark matter around ordinary matter objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave-like dark matter may feature quadratic couplings to ordinary matter. This carries profound consequences for the phenomenologies of such models. It changes the dark matter density around dense objects made from ordinary matter such as planets and stars, thereby changing the sensitivity of direct detection experiments on Earth as well as implying forces on other ordinary matter objects in the vicinity. In this note we study the time dependence of the dark matter field around spherical objects of ordinary matter. This work indicates the time-scale on which accelerating objects settle into a stationary state and delineates the applicability of stationary solutions for experimental dark matter tests. We also use this to understand (and effectively eliminate) the infinities in energies, forces, and pressures that appear when naively comparing the total energy around objects with different size but the same total number of ordinary matter particles.</description>

      <title>Inferring cosmology from gravitational waves using non-parametric detector-frame mass distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of understanding the Universe's dynamics, particularly the Hubble tension, requires precise measurements of the Hubble constant. Building upon the existing spectral-siren method, which capitalizes on population information from gravitational-wave sources, this paper explores an alternative way to analyze the population data to obtain the cosmological parameters in $\Lambda$CDM. We demonstrated how non-parametric methods, which are flexible models that can be used to agnostically reconstruct arbitrary probability densities, can be incorporated into this framework and leverage the detector-frame mass distribution to infer the cosmological parameters. We tested our method with mock data and applied it to $70$ binary black hole mergers from the third gravitational-wave transient catalog of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Growth of Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Sound Waves in a Universe with Generic Expansion Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derived here the factor $\Upsilon$, which quantifies how the gravitational wave spectrum generated by sound waves in the radiation sector grows over time, in a universe with a generic expanding rate set by another dominant energy content. When the dominant energy density satisfies $\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}$, we found that $\Upsilon$ has a compact analytical expression: $\Upsilon =\frac{2[1-y^{3(w-1)/2}]}{3(1-w)}$, where $y = a(t)/a(t_s)$ which is the ratio of the scale factor at a later time $t$ to that at $t_s$ when gravitational wave production from sound waves starts. This generic result reduces to that derived previously for radiation-dominated and matter-dominated cases, thus generalizing previous formulas to more general cosmological contexts and providing more accurate results. The derivation relies solely on a stationary source, implying that this generic result of $\Upsilon$ serves as an universal factor in describing the growth of the gravitational wave production and can appear beyond cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Perturbative unitarity bounds from momentum-space entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical theories have a limited regime of validity and hence must be accompanied by a breakdown diagnostic to establish when they cease to be valid as parameters are varied. For perturbative theories, estimates of the first neglected order offer valuable guidance, but one is often interested in sharp bounds beyond which perturbation theory necessarily fails. In particle physics, it is common to employ the bounds on partial waves imposed by unitarity as such a diagnostic. Unfortunately, these bounds don't extend to curved spacetime, where scattering experiments are challenging to define. Here, we propose to use the growth of entanglement in momentum space as a breakdown diagnostic for perturbation theory in general field theories. This diagnostic can be readily used in cosmological spacetimes and does not require any flat spacetime limit. More in detail, we consider the so-called purity of the reduced density operator constructed by tracing out all but one of the Fourier modes in an effective theory and we present a diagrammatic technique to compute it perturbatively. Constraints on the theory's regime of validity are then derived when the perturbative purity violates its unitarity bounds.
  In flat spacetime, we compare these purity bounds to those from partial waves. We find general qualitative agreement but with remarkable differences: purity bounds can be sometimes weaker, but other times they exist when no partial wave bounds exist. We then derive purity bounds for scalar field theories in de Sitter spacetime for a variety of interactions that appear in inflationary models. Importantly, our bounds make no reference to time evolution and in de Sitter they depend exclusively on scale-invariant ratios of the physical kinematics.</description>

Abstract: We consider an extended seesaw model which generates active neutrino masses via the usual type-I seesaw and leads to a large number of massless fermions as well as a sterile neutrino dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100) {\rm~keV}$ mass range. The dark sector comes into thermal equilibrium with Standard Model neutrinos after neutrino decoupling and before recombination via a U(1) gauge interaction in the dark sector. This suppresses the abundance of active neutrinos and therefore reconciles sizeable neutrino masses with cosmology. The DM abundance is determined by freeze-out in the dark sector, which allows avoiding bounds from X-ray searches. Our scenario predicts a slight increase in the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$ at recombination, potentially detectable by future CMB missions.</description>

      <title>CEERS: Forging the First Dust -- Transition from Stellar to ISM Grain Growth in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the coevolution of metals and dust for 173 galaxies at 4.0&lt;z&lt;11.4 observed with JWST/NIRSpec. We use the code CIGALE that integrates photometric and spectroscopic data. Our analysis reveals a critical transition at Mstar = 10^8.5 MSun, from galaxies dominated by supernovae and AGB stardust, to those dominated by grain growth. This implies a two-mode building of dust mass, supported by model predictions. The detection of stardust galaxies provides a natural and inherent explanation to the excess of UV-bright galaxies at z&gt;10 by JWST. Besides, we observe that the metallicity of galaxies at z&gt;8 presents a metal-to-stellar mass ratio larger than a few 10^-3, above a floor. This suggests a very fast rise of metals at high redshift, impacting the tentative detections of population III objects.</description>

      <title>Divergent Energy-Momentum Fluxes In Nonlocal Gravity Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the second order perturbations of the Deser-Woodard II (DWII), Vardanyan-Akrami-Amendola-Silvestri (VAAS) and Amendola-Burzilla-Nersisyan (ABN) nonlocal gravity models in an attempt to extract their associated gravitational wave energy-momentum fluxes. In Minkowski spacetime, the gravitational spatial momentum density is supposed to scale at most as $1/r^{2}$, in the $r \rightarrow \infty$ limit, where $r$ is the observer-source spatial distance. The DWII model has a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $1/r$; though this can be avoided when we set to zero the first derivative of its distortion function at the origin. Meanwhile, the ABN model also suffers from a divergent flux because its momentum density goes as $r^{2}$. The momentum density from the VAAS model was computed on a cosmological background expressed in a Fermi-Normal-Coordinate system, and was found to scale as $r$. For generic parameters, therefore, none of these three Dark Energy models appear to yield well-defined gravitational wave energies, as a result of their nonlocal gravitational self-interactions.</description>

      <title>First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES) XVII: Learning the galaxy-halo connection at high redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the galaxy-halo relationship is not only key for elucidating the interplay between baryonic and dark matter, it is essential for creating large mock galaxy catalogues from N-body simulations. High-resolution hydrodynamical simulations are limited to small volumes by their large computational demands, hindering their use for comparisons with wide-field observational surveys. We overcome this limitation by using the First Light and Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a suite of high-resolution (M_gas = 1.8 x 10^6 M_Sun) zoom simulations drawn from a large, (3.2 cGpc)^3 box. We use an extremely randomised trees machine learning approach to model the relationship between galaxies and their subhaloes in a wide range of environments. This allows us to build mock catalogues with dynamic ranges that surpass those obtainable through periodic simulations. The low cost of the zoom simulations facilitates multiple runs of the same regions, differing only in the random number seed of the subgrid models; changing this seed introduces a butterfly effect, leading to random differences in the properties of matching galaxies. This randomness cannot be learnt by a deterministic machine learning model, but by sampling the noise and adding it post-facto to our predictions, we are able to recover the distributions of the galaxy properties we predict (stellar mass, star formation rate, metallicity, and size) remarkably well. We also explore the resolution-dependence of our models' performances and find minimal depreciation down to particle resolutions of order M_DM ~ 10^8 M_Sun, enabling the future application of our models to large dark matter-only boxes.</description>

      <title>Dirac Leptogenesis in Left-Right Symmetric Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Left-right symmetric models which employ a generalized seesaw mechanism to generate quark and charged lepton masses are known to solve the strong CP problem via parity symmetry, without the need for the axion. These models lead to naturally light Dirac neutrinos with their masses arising through radiatve corrections. In this work, we show how baryogenesis via Dirac leptogenesis can be implemented in this framework. A pair of left-right symmetric scalar doublets $\phi_{L,R}$ carrying $(B-L)$ charge of $3$ is introduced for this purpose, which preserves the parity solution to the strong CP problem. Small neutrino masses are generated through one-loop diagrams mediated by these scalars. The decay of vector-like leptons ($E_i$) involved in the seesaw mechanism to generate charged lepton masses, $E_i \rightarrow \overline{\nu}_{jR} \,\phi_R^-$, creates a right-handed neutrino ($\nu_{R}$) asymmetry, while preserving total lepton number. The compensating lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry via electroweak sphalerons. We show that for a large range of model parameters successful baryogenesis can be realized, with the $W_R^\pm$ gauge boson mass being as low as $10^6$ GeV.</description>

      <title>Milky Way satellite velocities reveal the Dark Matter power spectrum at small scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) properties at small scales remain uncertain. Recent theoretical and observational advances have provided the tools to narrow them down. Here, we show for the first time that the correlation between internal velocities and sizes of dwarf galaxies is a sharp probe of small-scale DM properties. We study modified DM power spectra, motivated by DM production during inflation. Using semi-analytic models and scaling relations, we show that such models can change the kinematics and structure of dwarf galaxies without strongly affecting their total abundance. We analyze data from Milky Way classical satellite galaxies and those discovered with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), finding that the DM power spectrum at comoving scales ${4\, \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} &lt; k &lt; 37\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}}$ cannot deviate by more than a factor of $\sim 2.5$ from scale invariance. Our results are robust against baryonic uncertainties such as the stellar mass-halo mass relation, halo occupation fraction, and subhalo tidal disruption; allowing us to independently constrain them. This work thus opens a window to probe both dwarf galaxy formation models and small-scale DM properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04158v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slow first-order phase transitions generate large inhomogeneities that can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs). We show that the gravitational wave (GW) spectrum then consists of a primary component sourced by bubble collisions and a secondary one induced by large perturbations. The latter gives the dominant peak if $\beta/H_0 &lt; 12$, impacting, in particular, the interpretation of the recent PTA data. The GW signal associated with a particular PBH population is stronger than in typical scenarios because of a negative non-Gaussianity of the perturbations and it has a distinguishable shape with two peaks.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Memory Imprints on the CMB from Populations of Massive Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims: To showcase and characterise the rich phenomenology of temperature fluctuation patterns that are imprinted on the CMB by the gravitational wave memory (GWM) of massive black hole (BH) mergers. Methods: We analyse both individual binaries as well as populations of binaries, distributed in local cosmological boxes at a given redshift. Results: The magnitude of the temperature fluctuations scales primarily as a function of binary total mass and pattern angular scale, and accumulates as a random-walk process when populations of mergers are considered. Fluctuations of order $\sim 10^{-10}$ K are easily reached across scales of $\sim 1'$ to $\sim 1^{\circ}$ for realistic volumetric merger rates of 10$^{-3}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, as appropriate for massive galaxies at $z=1$. We determine numerically that GWM temperature fluctuations result in a universal power spectrum with a scaling of $P(k)\propto k^{-2.7}$. Conclusion: While not detectable given the limitations of current all-sky CMB surveys, our work explicitly shows how every black hole merger in the Universe left us its unique faint signature.</description>

      <title>How do Primordial Black Holes change the Halo Mass Function and Structure?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effects of massive primordial black holes (PBHs) on cosmic structure formation, employing both a semi-analytical approach and cosmological simulations. Our simulations incorporate PBHs with a monochromatic mass distribution centered around $10^6 \ \rm M_{\odot}$, constituting a fraction of $10^{-2}$ to $10^{-4}$ of the dark matter (DM) in the universe, with the remainder being collision-less particle dark matter (PDM). Additionally, we conduct a $\Lambda$CDM simulation for comparative analysis with runs that include PBHs. At smaller scales, halos containing PBHs exhibit similar density and velocity dispersion profiles to those without PBHs. Conversely, at larger scales, PBHs can expedite the formation of massive halos and reside at their centers due to the `seed effect'. To analyze the relative distribution of PBH host halos compared to non-PBH halos, we apply nearest-neighbor (NN) statistics. Our results suggest that PBH host halos, through gravitational influence, significantly impact the structure formation process, compared to the $\Lambda$CDM case, by attracting and engulfing nearby newly-formed minihalos. Should PBHs constitute a fraction of DM significantly larger than $\sim$$10^{-3}$, almost all newly-formed halos will be absorbed by PBH-seeded halos. Consequently, our simulations predict a bimodal feature in the halo mass function, with most of the massive halos containing at least one PBH at their core and the rest being less massive non-PBH halos.</description>

      <title>Be careful in multi-messenger inference of the Hubble constant: A path forward for robust inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) are a direct probe of the expansion history of the universe and carry the potential to shed light on the disparity between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. To measure the value of $H_0$ with such observations requires pristine inference of the luminosity distance and the true source redshift with minimal impact from systematics. In this analysis, we carry out joint inference on mock gravitational wave (GW) signals and their electromagnetic (EM) afterglows from BNS coalescences and find that the inclination angle inferred from the afterglow light curve and apparent superluminal motion can be precise, but need not be accurate and is subject to systematic uncertainty that could be as large as $1.5\sigma$. This produces a disparity between the EM and GW inferred inclination angles, which if not carefully treated when combining observations can bias the inferred value of $H_0$. We also find that already small misalignments of $3^{\circ}-6^{\circ}$ between the inherent system inclinations for the GW and EM emission can bias the inference by $\mathcal{O}(1-2\sigma)$ if not taken into account. As multi-messenger BNS observations are rare, we must make the most out of a small number of events and harness the increased precision, while avoiding reduced accuracy. We demonstrate how to mitigate these potential sources of bias by jointly inferring the mismatch between the GW- and EM-based inclination angles and $H_0$.</description>

      <title>2D BAO vs 3D BAO: solving the Hubble tension with an alternative cosmological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary 3D Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) data are model-dependent, requiring the assumption of a cosmological model to calculate comoving distances during data reduction. Throughout the present-day literature, the assumed model is $\Lambda$CDM. However, it has been pointed out in several recent works that this assumption can be inadequate when analyzing alternative cosmologies, potentially biasing the Hubble constant ($H_0$) low, thus contributing to the Hubble tension. To address this issue, 3D BAO data can be replaced with 2D BAO data, which is only weakly model-dependent. The impact of using 2D BAO data, in combination with alternative cosmological models beyond $\Lambda$CDM, has been explored for several phenomenological models, showing a promising reduction in the Hubble tension. In this work, we accommodate these models in the theoretically robust framework of bimetric gravity. This is a modified theory of gravity that exhibits a transition from a (possibly) negative cosmological constant in the early universe to a positive one in the late universe. By combining 2D BAO data with cosmic microwave background and type Ia supernovae data, we find that the inverse distance ladder in this theory yields a Hubble constant of $H_0 = (71.0 \pm 0.9) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$, consistent with the SH0ES local distance ladder measurement of $H_0 = (73.0 \pm 1.0) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$. Replacing 2D BAO with 3D BAO results in $H_0 = (68.6 \pm 0.5) \, \mathrm{km/s/Mpc}$ from the inverse distance ladder. Thus, the choice of BAO data significantly impacts the Hubble tension, with ordinary 3D BAO data exacerbating the tension, while 2D BAO data provides results consistent with the local distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Prediction of the Void and Galaxy Clustering Measurements in the CSST Spectroscopic Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The void power spectrum is related to the clustering of low-density regions in the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe, and can be used as an effective cosmological probe to extract the information of the LSS. We generate the galaxy mock catalogs from Jiutian simulation, and identify voids using the watershed algorithm for studying the cosmological constraint strength of the China Space Station Telescope (CSST) spectroscopic survey. The galaxy and void auto power spectra and void-galaxy cross power spectra at $z=0.3$, 0.6, and 0.9 are derived from the mock catalogs. To fit the full power spectra, we propose to use the void average effective radius at a given redshift to simplify the theoretical model, and adopt the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique to implement the constraints on the cosmological and void parameters. The systematical parameters, such as galaxy and void biases, and noise terms in the power spectra are also included in the fitting process. We find that our theoretical model can correctly extract the cosmological information from the galaxy and void power spectra, which demonstrates its feasibility and effectivity. The joint constraint accuracy of the cosmological parameters can be improved by $\sim20\%$ compared to that from the galaxy power spectrum only. The fitting results of the void density profile and systematical parameters are also well constrained and consistent with the expectation. This indicates that the void clustering measurement can be an effective complement to the galaxy clustering probe, especially for the next generation galaxy surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much of modern cosmology relies on the Cosmological Principle, the assumption that the Universe is isotropic and homogeneous on sufficiently large scales, but it remains worthwhile to examine cosmological models that violate this principle slightly. We examine a class of such spacetimes that maintain homogeneity but break isotropy through their underlying local spatial geometries. These spacetimes are endowed with one of five anisotropic model geometries of Thurston's geometrization theorem, and their evolution is sourced with perfect fluid dust and cosmological constant. We show that the background evolution of these spacetimes induces fluctuations in the observed cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature with amplitudes coupled to the curvature parameter $\Omega_K$. In order for these fluctuations to be compatible with the observed CMB angular power spectrum, we find $|\Omega_K| \lesssim 10^{-5}$ is required in all five geometries. This strongly limits the cosmological consequences of these models.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the scalar-induced one-loop correction to the power spectrum of tensor perturbations produced during single-field slow-roll inflation. We find that the correction is given by the square of the product of the slow-roll parameter and the tree-level scalar power spectrum.

      <title>Primordial black holes generated by fast-roll mechanism in non-canonical natural inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a new fast-roll (FR) mechanism to generate primordial black holes (PBHs) and gravitational waves (GWs) in generalized non-canonical natural inflation is introduced. In this model, choosing a suitable function for non-canonical mass scale parameter $M(\phi)$ gives rise to produce a cliff-like region in the field evolution path. When inflaton rolls down the steep cliff, its kinetic energy during a FR stage increases in comparison with a slow-roll (SR) stage. Hence, seeds of PBH production are born in this transient FR stage. Depending on the position of the cliff, appropriate cases of PBHs for explaining total dark matter (DM), microlensing effects, LIGO-VIRGO events and NANOGrav 15 year data can be formed. The density spectrum of GWs related to one case of the model lies in the NANOGrav 15 year domain and behaves like $\Omega_{\rm GW_0}\sim f^{5-\gamma}$. The spectral index $\gamma=3.42$ for this case satisfies the NANOGrav 15 year constraint. Moreover, regarding reheating considerations, it is demonstrated that PBHs are born in the radiation-dominated (RD) era. Furthermore, viability of the model in light of theoretical swampland criteria and observational constraints on cosmic microwave background (CMB) scales are illustrated.</description>

      <title>Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, optimal transport theory and their link to the Galileons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mathematicians have been proposing for sometimes that Monge-Amp\`ere equation, a nonlinear generalization of the Poisson equation, where trace of the Hessian is replaced by its determinant, provides an alternative non-relativistic description of gravity. Monge-Amp\`ere equation is affine invariant, has rich geometric properties, connects to optimal transport theory, and remains bounded at short distances. Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, that uses a slightly different form of the Monge-Amp\`ere equation, naturally emerges through the application of large-deviation principle to a Brownian system of indistinguishable and independent particles. In this work we provide a physical formulation of this mathematical model, study its theoretical viability and confront it with observations. We show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity cannot replace the Newtonian gravity as it does not withstand the solar-system test. We then show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity can describe a scalar field, often evoked in modified theories of gravity such as Galileons. We show that Monge-Amp\`ere gravity, as a nonlinear model of a new scalar field, is screened at short distances, and behaves differently from Newtonian gravity above galactic scales but approaches it asymptotically. Finally, we write a relativistic Lagrangian for Monge-Amp\`ere gravity in flat space time, which is the field equation of a sum of the Lagrangians of all Galileons. We also show how the Monge-Amp\`ere equation can be obtained from the fully covariant Lagrangian of quartic Galileon in the static limit. The connection between optimal transport theory and modified theories of gravity with second-order field equations, unravelled here, remains a promising domain to further explore.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators and axion dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate collective excitations in magnetic topological insulators (TIs) and their impact on particle axion detection. In the three-dimensional TI model with the Hubbard term, the effective action of magnons and amplitude modes is formulated by dynamical susceptibility under the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states. One of the amplitude modes is identified as ``axionic'' quasi-particle and its effective coupling to the electromagnetic fields turns out to be enhanced by about four orders of magnitude larger than the previous estimate, which may drastically change the sensitivity of the particle axion search using ``axion'' in magnetic TIs.</description>

      <title>New Integrable Chiral Cosmological Models with Two Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct integrable chiral cosmological models with two scalar fields and potentials represented in terms of hyperbolic functions. Using the conformal transformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity terms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed Friedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained general solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of the conformal time.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass. The issue of the gauge coupling unification is also discussed.</description>
