      <title>Opportunities in deep learning methods development for computational biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in molecular technologies underlie an enormous growth in the size of data sets pertaining to biology and biomedicine. These advances parallel those in the deep learning subfield of machine learning. Components in the differentiable programming toolbox that makes deep learning possible are allowing computer scientists to address an increasingly large array of problems with flexible and effective tools. However many of these tools have not fully proliferated into the computational biology and bioinformatics fields. In this perspective we survey some of these advances and highlight exemplary examples of their utilization in the biosciences, with the goal of increasing awareness among practitioners of emerging opportunities to blend expert knowledge with newly emerging deep learning architectural tools.</description>

      <title>ALPHAGMUT: A Rationale-Guided Alpha Shape Graph Neural Network to Evaluate Mutation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In silico methods evaluating the mutation effects of missense mutations are providing an important approach for understanding mutations in personal genomes and identifying disease-relevant biomarkers. However, existing methods, including deep learning methods, heavily rely on sequence-aware information, and do not fully leverage the potential of available 3D structural information. In addition, these methods may exhibit an inability to predict mutations in domains difficult to formulate sequence-based embeddings. In this study, we introduce a novel rationale-guided graph neural network AlphaGMut to evaluate mutation effects and to distinguish pathogenic mutations from neutral mutations. We compute the alpha shapes of protein structures to obtain atomic-resolution edge connectivities and map them to an accurate residue-level graph representation. We then compute structural-, topological-, biophysical-, and sequence properties of the mutation sites, which are assigned as node attributes in the graph. These node attributes could effectively guide the graph neural network to learn the difference between pathogenic and neutral mutations using k-hop message passing with a short training period. We demonstrate that AlphaGMut outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including DeepMind's AlphaMissense, in many performance metrics. In addition, AlphaGMut has the advantage of performing well in alignment-free settings, which provides broader prediction coverage and better generalization compared to current methods requiring deep sequence-aware information.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Uncertainty Quantification in Universal Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning is a new class of approaches that integrate physical knowledge and mechanistic models with data-driven techniques for uncovering governing equations of complex processes. Among the available approaches, Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) are used to combine prior knowledge in the form of mechanistic formulations with universal function approximators, like neural networks. Integral to the efficacy of UDEs is the joint estimation of parameters within mechanistic formulations and the universal function approximators using empirical data. The robustness and applicability of resultant models, however, hinge upon the rigorous quantification of uncertainties associated with these parameters, as well as the predictive capabilities of the overall model or its constituent components. With this work, we provide a formalisation of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for UDEs and investigate important frequentist and Bayesian methods. By analysing three synthetic examples of varying complexity, we evaluate the validity and efficiency of ensembles, variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling as epistemic UQ methods for UDEs.</description>
