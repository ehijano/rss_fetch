      <title>New charged dynamical particles in spatially flat FLRW space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New time-dependent metric tensors with spherical symmetry satisfying the Einstein-Maxwell equations in space-times with FLRW asymptotic behaviour are derived here for the first time. These geometries describe dynamical charged non-rotating black holes hosted by the perfect fluid of the asymptotic FLRW space-times. Their gravitational sources are the stress-energy tensors formed by a contribution of the perfect fluid and an electromagnetic one due to the Coulomb field produced by the time-dependent black-hole charge in the asymptotic FLRW background. The dynamics of these models is determined by the dynamical mass, which may be an arbitrary function of time, and two arbitrary real-valued parameters. The first one simulates the effect of a cosmological constant as in our $\kappa$-models we proposed recently [I. I. Cotaescu, Eur. Phys. J. C (2024) 84:819]. The second parameter relates surprisingly the dynamical black hole charge to the cubic root of the mass function. The role of these parameters is investigated analyzing simple examples of dynamical charged black holes in the matter-dominated universe.</description>

      <title>Rotation of intrinsic orbital angular momentum and the orbital Hall effect for twisted particles in arbitrary gravitational fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For twisted particles in arbitrary gravitational fields, the problems of the rotation of intrinsic orbital angular momentum and the orbital Hall effect are solved in the general case. We need not use the Maxwell equations in curved spacetimes for a description of twisted photons. The exact general equation rigorously defining the OAM dynamics in any Riemannian spacetimes is derived. The general description of different manifestations of the orbital Hall effect for any twisted particles is also presented. Our short analysis shows that the results obtained can find important practical applications.</description>

      <title>A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass ratio inspirals around spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the motion of a small compact object on a nearly circular orbit around a spinning supermassive black hole, which is also interacting with a thin equatorial accretion-disk surrounding the latter, through tools from self-force and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We provide an analytical and relativistically-accurate formalism to calculate the rate of energy and angular momentum exchanged at Lindblad resonances. We show that strong relativistic effects can potentially cause a reversal in the direction of the torque on the small compact object if the surface density gradient is not too large. We analytically explore the dependence of the torque reversal location on the spin of the supermassive black hole and demonstrate that the ratio of the reversal location to the innermost stable circular orbit is approximately insensitive to the spin of the supermassive black hole. Our results show that relativistic torques can be 1--2 order of magnitude larger than the Newtonian torque routinely used in the literature to model disk/small-compact-object interactions close to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of including relativistic effects when modeling environmental effects in extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Wormholes in Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theory with identical spacetime asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within general relativity, we study spherically symmetric configurations with wormhole topology consisting of spinor fields and a Maxwell electric field. For such a system, we construct complete families of regular asymmetric solutions describing wormholes connecting two identical Minkowski spacetimes. The physical properties of such systems are completely determined by the values of three input quantities: the throat parameter, the spinor frequency, and the coupling constant. Depending on the specific values of these parameters, the configurations may have essentially different characteristics, including negative ADM masses.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetic-Hydrodynamics and Turbulence in Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03711v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work tries to establish the theoretical framework for gravitomagnetic-hydrodynamics (GMHD), revealing a fundamental correspondence between geometrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamic phenomena in general relativity. By introducing the gravitoelectromagnetic formalism to relativistic fluids, a set of leading-order GMHD equations is derived that govern the co-evolution of spacetime geometry and matter dynamics in the early Universe. This analysis reveals that, under high-temperature and high-density conditions such as those during the electroweak phase transition, the gravitomagnetic Reynolds number becomes large, leading to a strongly coupled fluid-spacetime system. This coupling supports the emergence of gravitational Alfven waves and a turbulent energy cascade. Our findings suggest that GMHD turbulence may leave imprints on the stochastic gravitational wave background, offering a new window into the nonlinear dynamics of the primordial Universe.</description>

      <title>Loop quantum inflation with inverse volume corrections in light of ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of loop quantum cosmology (LQC), we investigate the effect of inverse volume corrections on the low scale spontaneously broken supersymmetric (SB SUSY) and exponential inflationary potentials. The LQC modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the observational viability of these models against recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Our results indicate that in contrary to the standard model of inflation, in the presence of inverse volume corrections in LQC, the prediction of SB SUSY and exponential potentials in the $r-n_{\rm s}$ plane lie inside the 68\% confidence level interval of the ACT data.</description>

      <title>Effects of the ekpyrotic mechanism on inflationary phase in loop quantum cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bouncing cosmological models, either classical or quantum, the big bang singularity is replaced by a regular bounce. A challenging question in such models is how to keep the shear under control in the contracting phase, as it is well-known that the shear grows as fast as $1/a^{6}$ toward the bounce, where $a$ is the expansion factor of the universe. A common approach is to introduce a scalar field with an ekpyrotic-like potential which becomes negative near the bounce, so the effective equation of state of the scalar field will be greater than one, whereby it dominates the shear and other matter fields in the bounce region. As a result, a homogeneous and isotropic universe can be produced. In this paper, we study how the ekpyrotic mechanism affects the inflationary phase in both loop quantum cosmology (LQC) and a modified loop quantum cosmological model (mLQC-I), because in these frameworks the inflation is generic without such a mechanism. After numerically studying various cases in which the potential of the inflaton consists of two parts, an inflationary potential and an ekpyrotic-like one, we find that, despite the fact that the influence is significant, by properly choosing the free parameters involved in the models, the ekpyrotic-like potential dominates in the bounce region, during which the effective equation of state is larger than one, so the shear problem is resolved. As the time continuously increases after the bounce, the inflationary potential grows and ultimately becomes dominant, resulting in an inflationary phase. This phase can last long enough to solve the cosmological problems existing in the big bang model.</description>

      <title>Accretion Disk Luminosity and Topological Characteristics for a Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by King Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the intricate properties of a Schwarzschild black hole enveloped by King dark matter in an isotropic configuration. The thermodynamic characteristics of this black hole are meticulously analyzed, and the dynamics of massive and massless particles in its vicinity are investigated. In examining the trajectories of massless particles, the shadow cast in the presence of King dark matter is explored, revealing virtual ranges for the corresponding parameters. For the dynamics of massive particles, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit, angular momentum, energy, and angular velocity of a test particle within the King dark matter framework surrounding the black hole are calculated. The effect of King dark matter on the accretion disk energy flux, effective radiation temperature, differential luminosity, and spectral luminosity are then investigated. The stability of the photon sphere in the presence of King dark matter is also studied, and finally, the thermodynamic potentials of this black hole are examined from a topological perspective.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes and boson stars in semiclassical gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a Hamiltonian version of the semiclassical Einstein equation to study classical gravity coupled to a quantum scalar field with potential in spherical symmetry. The system is defined by effective constraints where the matter terms are replaced by their expectation values in a quantum state. For the static case, we find numerically that the resulting equations admit asymptotically flat, de Sitter, and anti-de Sitter boson star and regular black hole solutions. We also show that the Bardeen and Hayward nonsingular black hole proposals (and some generalizations thereof) are not solutions to our equations.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Do Black Holes Exist?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carefully investigate, extend, and shed new light on the McVittie exact solution of Einstein's gravity (EG) with the focus on the implications in the Universe we live in. It turns out that the only known exact solution of EG, which interpolates between an asymptotic homogeneous and isotropic Universe and a Schwarzschild black hole, is actually singular in 2M, namely, the curvature invariants diverge and the spacetime is geodetically incomplete in 2M. Very important: all energy conditions are satisfied except the dominant one (DEC), which is violated inside the radius 8M/3. Notice that 2M is not the event horizon, but a curvature singularity covered by an apparent horizon that, at the actual stage of the Universe, nearly coincides with 2M. Moreover, the curvature singularity is not analytic with respect to the dynamics of the Universe encoded in the Hubble function $H(t)$: for arbitrarily small but not zero $H^\prime(t)$, the curvature invariants are singular, while for $H^\prime(t)$ identically zero, they are regular. Therefore, we can not analytically decouple the black hole from the entire Cosmos, namely, we can not assume the Schwarzschild solution locally and the FRW metric at large scale without violating the analyticity of the metric. Since the spacetime does not exist for $r \leqslant$2M, and since the DEC is violated for r&lt;8M/3, we are allowed to doubt the existence of black holes in our Universe as understood up to now. In particular, the violation of DEC seems catastrophic for the spacetime stability below 8M/3. We build and study a toy model for the gravitational collapse, generalizing the Vaidya to the McVittie-Vaidya metric. Although dynamical, the singularities remain in the same locations. Finally, in order to achieve the curvature smoothness and geodesic completion, we propose two solutions: one in Einstein's conformal gravity, and the other replacing M with M(r).</description>

      <title>Impact of Thermodynamic Corrections on the Stability of Hayward-Anti de Sitter Black Hole Surrounded by a Fluid of Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the modified thermodynamics of a Hayward-Anti de Sitter (H-AdS) black hole in atypical conditions, incorporating a string fluid, Hayward regularisation, and quantum entropy corrections. Our analysis reveals a first-order phase transition between small and large black hole phases, characterised by a swallowtail behaviour in the Gibbs free energy profiles. It is found that the key parameters - string fluid strength, Hayward regularisation scale, and quantum correction coefficients significantly influence the critical temperature and phase stability of the H-AdS system. It is further noticed that a large black hole phase is stabilised by these modifications, with quantum corrections smoothing the transition. This model offers a valuable framework to study quantum gravity effects on black hole thermodynamics with potential implications in analysing black hole evolution and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of minimum orbital periods around d-dimensional charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bounds on the minimum orbital period for test objects around d-dimensional charged black holes in asymptotically flat spacetimes. We find numerically that the minimum orbital period decreases as the charge of the black hole increases. Thus, the upper limit is reached for an uncharged black hole, while the lower limit is attained for a maximally charged one. We then analytically derive the upper and lower bounds for the minimum orbital period. These results improve our understanding of dynamics around d-dimensional black holes and impose constraints on candidate gravity theories.</description>

      <title>$I-$Love$-$Curvature: Exploring compact stars' quasi-universal relation with curvature scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quasi-universal relations in neutron stars linking standard observables, such as tidal deformability ($\Lambda$) and normalized moment of inertia ($\bar{I}$), with normalized curvature scalars in general relativity. These curvature scalars include the Ricci scalar ($\mathcal{R}$), the Ricci tensor contraction ($\mathcal{J}$), the Weyl scalar ($\mathcal{W}$), and the Kretschmann scalar ($\mathcal{K}$). We systematically examine both piecewise polytropic and color-flavor-locked equations of state, finding: (1) significant correlations between both local (central and surface) and global (volume-averaged) curvature scalars with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (2) especially strong correlations between surface and volume-averaged curvature scalars and both $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$; (3) a near equation-of-state-independent maximum for the normalized Ricci scalar, suggesting a link to the trace anomaly; and (4) new universal relations involving normalized central and volume-averaged pressure and energy density, which also correlate strongly with $\bar{I}$ and $\Lambda$. Using constraints from GW170817 and low-mass X-ray binaries, we demonstrate that $\Lambda$ measurements directly constrain both scalar curvature quantities and the interior properties of canonical-mass neutron stars. These findings agree with the literature on equation-of-state-dependent Bayesian inference estimates. Our identified relations thus provide an equation-of-state-insensitive connection between stellar observables, spacetime geometry, and the microphysics of compact stars.</description>

      <title>The Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields on radiative asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a large class of asymptotically flat spacetimes which includes radiative perturbations of Minkowski space, we define a distinguished global Feynman propagator for massive Klein-Gordon fields by means of the microlocal approach to non-elliptic Fredholm theory, working in the de,sc-pseudodifferential algebra due to Sussman. We extend the limiting absorption principle (the "$i\varepsilon$ prescription" for the Feynman propagator) to this setting. Motivated by the complicated Hamilton flow structure arising in this problem, we also prove a new localized radial point estimate in the spirit of Haber-Vasy which, under appropriate nondegeneracy assumptions, allows one to propagate microlocal regularity into a single radial point belonging to a larger radial set which can be a source, sink, or saddle for the Hamilton flow.</description>

      <title>Biased parameter inference of eccentric, spin-precessing binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the majority of gravitational wave (GW) events observed by the LIGO and Virgo detectors are consistent with mergers of binary black holes (BBHs) on quasi-circular orbits, some events are also consistent with non-zero orbital eccentricity, indicating that the binaries could have formed via dynamical interactions. Moreover, there may be GW events which show support for spin-precession, eccentricity, or both. In this work, we study the interplay of spins and eccentricity on the parameter estimation of GW signals from BBH mergers. We inject eccentric signals with no spins, aligned spins, and precessing spins using hybrids, TEOBResumS-DALI, and new Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, respectively, and study the biases in the posteriors of source parameters when these signals are recovered with a quasi-circular precessing-spin waveform model, as opposed to an aligned-spin eccentric waveform model. We find significant biases in the source parameters, such as chirp mass and spin-precession ($\chi_p$), when signals from highly-eccentric BBHs are recovered with a quasi-circular waveform model. Moreover, we find that for signals with both eccentricity and spin-precession effects, Bayes factor calculations confirm that an eccentric, aligned-spin model is preferred over a quasi-circular precessing-spin model. Our study highlights the complex nature of GW signals from eccentric, precessing-spin binaries and the need for readily usable inspiral-merger-ringdown eccentric, spin-precessing waveform models for unbiased parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein-bumblebee gravity is one of the simplest vector-tensor theories that realizes spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. In this work, we first construct an exact dyonic Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole solution in four dimensions, carrying both electric and magnetic charges and admitting general topological horizons. We then study its thermodynamic properties, and employ the Wald formalism to compute the conserved mass and entropy, thereby establishing the first law of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we generalize these results to Taub-Newman-Unti-Tamburino case and higher dimensions case.</description>

      <title>Cosmological dynamics in the theory of gravity both with non-minimal and non-minimal derivative coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores cosmological scenarios in a scalar-tensor theory of gravity, including both a non-minimal coupling with scalar curvature of the form $R\phi^2$ and a non-minimal derivative coupling of the form $G^{\mu\nu}\phi_{,\mu}\phi_{,\nu}$ in the presence of a scalar field potential with the monomial dependence $V(\phi) = V_0\phi^n$. Critical points of the system were obtained and analyzed. In the absence of a scalar field potential, stability conditions for these points were determined. Using methods of dynamical systems theory, the asymptotic behavior of the model was analyzed. It was shown that in the case of $V(\phi)\equiv0$ or $n &lt; 2$, a quasi-de Sitter asymptotic behavior exists, corresponding to an early inflationary universe. This asymptotic behavior in the approximation $V_0 \rightarrow 0,\ \xi \rightarrow 0$ coincides with the value $H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{9|\eta|}}$ obtained in works devoted to cosmological models with non-minimal kinetic coupling. For $|\xi|\ \rightarrow \infty$, this asymptotic behavior tends to the value $H = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3|\eta|}}$. Moreover, unstable regimes with phantom expansion $w_{eff} &lt; -1$ were found for the early dynamics of the model. For the late dynamics, the following stable asymptotic regimes were obtained: a power-law expansion with $w_{eff} \ge 1$, an expansion with $w_{eff} =\frac{1}{3}$ ($V(\phi)\equiv0$), at which the effective Planck mass tends to zero, and an exponential expansion with $w_{eff} = 0$ as $n = 2$. In this case, the asymptotic value of the Hubble parameter depends only on $V_0 = \frac{1}{2}m^2$ and $\xi$. Numerical integration of the model dynamics was performed for specific values of the theory parameters. The results are presented as phase portraits.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearized Einstein-Weyl equations are solved precisely in the context of sandwich gravitational waves. The neutrino's energy-momentum depends on the geometry and composition of the gravitational pulse when it is scattered. Since the background remains unchanged at the test field level, the neutrino's energy density will exhibit fluctuations between positive and negative extremes when traversing the sandwich wave. These variations could provide insights into the behavior of models concerning neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Testing black hole metrics with binary black hole inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave astronomy has opened an unprecedented window onto tests of gravity and fundamental physics in the strong-field regime. In this study, we examine a series of well-motivated deviations from the classical Kerr solution of General Relativity and employ gravitational wave data to place constraints on possible deviations from the Kerr geometry. The method involves calculating the phase of gravitational waves using the effective one-body formalism and then applying the parameterized post-Einsteinian framework to constrain the parameters appearing in these scenarios beyond General Relativity. The effective one-body method, known for its capability to model complex gravitational waveforms, is used to compute the wave phase, and the post-Einsteinian framework allows for a flexible, model-independent approach to parameter estimation. We demonstrate that gravitational wave data provide evidence supporting the Kerr nature of black holes, showing no significant deviations from General Relativity, thereby affirming its validity within the current observational limits. This work bridges theoretical waveform modeling with observational constraints, providing a pathway to test the no-hair theorem and probe the astrophysical viability of modified black holes.</description>

      <title>The Wave Function of the Universe and Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum-cosmological framework in which the inflationary potential emerges from the structure of the wave function of the universe rather than being postulated. Starting from the Wheeler-DeWitt equation for a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker minisuperspace, we express the wave function in terms of an amplitude and a phase and, in a semiclassical regime where the expansion dominates the field's evolution, separate these into purely geometric and purely field-dependent pieces. This yields a closed expression for an emergent potential that makes transparent the roles of the cosmological constant, the momenta associated with expansion and field dynamics, and quantum corrections from the amplitude. Slow-roll conditions follow from properties of the phase and amplitude, leading to wave-function-level expressions for the usual slow-roll parameters and to direct links between cosmic microwave background observables and derivatives of the phase. The approach ties inflation to the quantum state of the universe and suggests testable relationships between cosmological data and features of the wave function.</description>

      <title>Inferring the spins of merging black holes in the presence of data-quality issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from black hole binary mergers carry information about the component spins, but inference is sensitive to analysis assumptions, which may be broken by terrestrial noise transients known as glitches. Using a variety of simulated glitches and gravitational wave signals, we study the conditions under which glitches can bias spin measurements. We confirm the theoretical expectation that inference and subtraction of glitches invariably leaves behind residual power due to statistical uncertainty, no matter the strength (signal-to-noise ratio; SNR) of the original glitch. Next we show that low-SNR glitches - including those below the threshold for flagging data-quality issues - can still significantly bias spin inference. Such biases occur for a range of glitch morphologies, even in cases where glitches and signals are not precisely aligned in phase. Furthermore, we find that residuals of glitch subtraction can result in biases as well. Our results suggest that joint inference of the glitch and gravitational wave parameters, with appropriate models and priors, is required to address these uncertainties inherent in glitch mitigation via subtraction.</description>

      <title>A Holographic prescription for generalized Schwinger-Keldysh contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a holographic prescription to compute real-time thermal correlators with arbitrary operator ordering. In field theory, these correlation functions are captured by a multi-fold Schwinger-Keldysh time contour. We propose a holographic dual for these contours, which generalizes the gravitational Schwinger-Keldysh geometry previously advocated in the literature. Our geometry consists of multiple AdS-black holes glued together at the future and past horizons, with matching conditions determined by unitarity and the KMS condition. As a proof of concept, we solve for a probe scalar field in this geometry and compute bulk-bulk and bulk-boundary propagators, in terms of which we evaluate the 4-point functions at tree-level. We show that in perturbation theory, the lowest-order diagrams that contribute non-trivially to the out-of-time order four-point function are exchange diagrams which explore the full four-fold geometry. Furthermore, these diagrams reduce to a simple factorized expression. We propose a conjecture on the structure of higher order observables and provide a partial proof by studying a subset of the contributing diagrams.</description>

      <title>Covariant cosmography in the presence of local structures: comparing exact solutions and perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational evidence of axially symmetric anisotropies in the local cosmic expansion rate motivates an investigation of whether they can be accounted for within the Lema\^itre-Tolman-Bondi (LTB) framework with an off-center observer. Within this setting, we compute the exact relativistic luminosity distance via the Sachs equation and compare it with the approximate expression obtained from the covariant cosmographic approach (including Hubble, deceleration, jerk and curvature parameters). This comparison allows us to identify the regimes in which the covariant cosmographic method remains reliable. In addition, we compare the LTB relativistic distance for small inhomogeneities with the corresponding result derived from linear perturbation theory (LPT) in the standard cosmological model. This analysis establishes a precise correspondence between the LTB and LPT approaches, offering a consistent dictionary for the interpretation of the observed anisotropies of the large-scale gravitational field. This analysis will be instrumental in interpreting expansion-rate anisotropies, facilitating investigations of the local Universe beyond the FLRW framework with a fully non-perturbative metric approach.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>Finding Supermassive Black Hole Binary Mergers in Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy observations suggest there is about one merger of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHB) throughout the observable universe in a year. Here, we introduce the methodology to search for gravitational waves from these events with Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs).
  Modelling the inspiral, the merger, the ringdown, and the gravitational wave memory components of the signal in simulated data, we demonstrate a proof of principle for detection and parameter estimation. We study a few representative SMBHB mergers with chirp masses spanning $10^{8} - 10^{10}~M_\odot$ at distances from a few Mpc to 100~Mpc to asses their detectability in PTA observations. Assuming the fixed binary inclination angle of $90^{\circ}$ corresponding to the maximum displacement memory signal, these signals appear distinct for a PTA with 25 pulsars timed for 13 years with 100 ns precision.
  We demonstrate the capabilities of PTAs to constrain chirp masses and distances of detected merging binaries, as well as to place limits. The sky position uncertainties of the order of $1^{\circ}$, which we find in this optimistic example, could potentially enable electromagnetic follow-up and multi-messenger observations of SMBHB mergers. Finally, we show that the measurement uncertainties on the parameters of simulated merging binaries depend weakly on the presence of the gravitational wave background with Hellings-Downs correlations in our simulated data.</description>

Abstract: These notes review theoretical models of massive black hole formation, growth and observables. They start with a brief summary of basic properties of massive black hole properties. The current view on massive black holes and active galactic nuclei at high redshift is then summarized, highlighting the JWST ``revolution'' and the questions raised by the recent observations. The notes then touch on massive black hole formation and growth mechanisms, emphasizing the processes at play at early cosmic times. Then techniques for modeling the cosmic massive black hole evolution, are reviewed with an emphasis on cosmological simulations, before approaching how observables are derived from models. They conclude with a section reflecting on the main questions on the JWST-discovered population in light of the material presented in the earlier sections.</description>

      <title>Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined $\Lambda$CDM Halo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.</description>

      <title>Converged simulations of the nozzle shock in tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When debris from a star that experienced a tidal disruption events (TDE) after passing too close to a massive black hole returns to pericenter on the second passage, it is compressed, leading to the formation of nozzle shocks (in the orbital plane) and pancake shocks (perpendicular to the orbital plane). Resolving these shocks is a long-standing problem in the hydrodynamic simulations of parabolic TDEs. Excessive numerical energy dissipation or heating unrealistically expands the stream. In this Letter, we apply adaptive particle refinement to our 3D general relativistic smoothed particle simulations to locally increase the resolution near the pericenter. We achieve resolutions equivalent to $6.55\times10^{11}$ particles, allowing us to converge on the true energy dissipation. We conclude that only $4\times10^{-5}$ of the orbital energy is dissipated in nozzle shocks for a Sun-like star tidally disrupted by a $10^6$ solar-mass black hole, therefore the nozzle shocks are unlikely to be important in the evolution of TDEs.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part IIb. Eigenmodes, correlation matrices, and detectability of non-orientable Euclidean manifolds</title>

Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. In this paper we consider the non-orientable Euclidean topologies \E{7}--\E{10}, \E{13}--\E{15}, and \E{17}, encompassing the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the CMB sky. We find that in manifolds where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about $1.2$ times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB, we expect a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. Our limited selection of manifold parameters are exemplary of interesting behaviors, but not necessarily representative. Future searches for topology will require a thorough exploration of the parameter space to determine what values of the parameters predict statistical correlations that are convincingly attributable to topology.[Abridged]</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and the Joule-Thomson expansion of dilaton black holes in 2+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14875v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study thermodynamics and its applications of a family of static charged dilaton black holes in 2+1 dimensions found by Chan and Mann \cite{Chan:1994qa} and Xu \cite{Xu:2019pap}. There is a dimensionless parameter $N$ in the black hole solutions presented: it is related to the coupling constant for the dialton with the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field. Black hole horizons exists only for $ \frac{2}{3} \leq N &lt; 2$. $N =1$ black hole is a solution to low energy string theory. Thermodynamics are studied in the canonical ensemble where charge is constant. The cosmological constant is considered a thermodynamical variable where the pressure $P = -\frac{\Lambda}{ 8 \pi}$. We computed the first law and the Smarr relations for the black hole and introduced two new thermodynamical parameters in order to satisfy the first law. We computed temperature, thermodynamic volume, specific heat capacities, Gibbs free energy and studied local and global stability of the black hole. Thermodynamic volume differs from the geometric volume. We noticed that thermodynamic behavior falls into two broad categories: For $\frac{2}{3} \leq N &lt; 1$, small black holes are locally stable and large black holes are not. For $ 1 \leq N &lt; 2$ the black hole is locally and globally stable for all values of the horizon radius. In order to demonstrate the two broad categories, we have presented $N =1, \frac{2}{3}$ and $N = \frac{6}{7}$ black holes in detail. There were no phase transitions for the above values of $N$. We have also studied the Joule-Thomson expansion and the Reverse Isoperimetric Inequality of these black holes. We made the observation that the charged dilaton black hole does not violate the Reverse Isoperimetric Inequality for certain values of the parameters of the theory. Finally, we have suggested future work.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Cosmic Anisotropy and its Ramifications I: Killing vector fields and constructing their metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the largest scales, the universe appears to be almost homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. In contrast, on smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropy become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence, and formation of structure in the universe. Moreover, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it necessary to explore the consequences of departure from the ideal, uniform universe on the fundamental level. Thus, in this work, the foundation of spatially homogeneous yet anisotropic universes is studied. Specifically, when given a 3D Lie algebra of \emph{desired} Killing vector fields (as would be the case for a homogeneous yet anisotropic universe), we provide an explicit construction for the metric that has exactly those as its Killing vector fields. This construction is presented accessibly, in a directly-usable, algorithmic fashion. Some examples demonstrating the construction are worked out, including a constructive method to separate out (cosmic) time dependence in spatially homogeneous, anisotropic cosmologies.</description>

Abstract: The macroscopic model for a neutron star (NS) as a liquid drop at the equilibrium
  is used to extend the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations taking into account the gradient terms
  responsible for the system surface. The parameters of the Schwarzschild metric in the spherical case
  are found with these surface corrections to the known leading (zero) order of the leptodermic approximation
  $a/R&lt;&lt;1$, where $a$ is the NS effective-surface (ES) thickness, and $R$ is the effective NS radius.
  The energy density $\mathcal{E}$ is considered in a general form including the functions of the particle number
  density and of its gradient terms. The macroscopic gravitational component $\Phi(\rho)$ of the energy density
  is taken into account in the simplest form as expansion in powers of $\rho-\overline{\rho} $, where
  $\overline{\rho}$ is the saturation density, up to second order, in terms of its contributions to the
  separation particle energy and incompressibility. Density distributions $\rho$ across the NS ES in the
  normal direction to the ES, which are derived in the simple analytical form at the same leading approximation, was
  used for the derivation of the modified TOV (MTOV) equations by accounting for their NS surface corrections.
  The MTOV equations are analytically solved at first order and the results are compared with the standard
  TOV approach of the zero order.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering for different types of Bell-like states in gravitational background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Mitigating Machine Learning Biases for the Gravitational Wave Detection Problem</title>

Abstract: Matched filtering is a long-standing technique for the optimal detection of known signals in stationary Gaussian noise. However, it has known departures from optimality when operating on unknown signals in real noise and suffers from computational inefficiencies in its pursuit of near-optimality. A compelling alternative that has emerged in recent years to address this problem is deep learning. Although it has shown significant promise when applied to the search for gravitational waves (GWs) in detector noise, we demonstrate the existence of learning biases that hinder generalisation and lead to significant loss in detection sensitivity. Our work identifies the sources of a set of 11 interconnected biases present in the supervised learning of the GW detection problem and contributes mitigation tactics and training strategies to concurrently address them. In light of the identified biases, we demonstrate that existing detection sensitivity metrics are not reliable for machine-learning (ML) pipelines and discuss the trustworthiness of previous results. We use GW domain knowledge to build a bespoke ML based binary black hole search pipeline called Sage that addresses these biases. Via the injection study presented in the Machine Learning Gravitational-Wave Search Challenge, we show that Sage detects ~11.2% more signals than the benchmark PyCBC analysis at a false alarm rate of one per month in O3a noise. Moreover, we also show that it can detect ~48.29% more signals than the previous best-performing ML pipeline on the same dataset. We empirically prove that Sage can: [i] effectively handle out-of-distribution noise power spectral densities, [ii] strongly reject non-Gaussian transient noise artefacts, and [iii] achieve higher detection sensitivities using less data than network architectures of a similar size.

Abstract: Space-times exhibiting spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking have recently attracted much attention, with Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity providing a notable example. In this context, we examine the free-fall motion of a test particle toward an electrically charged black hole arising from the coupling of the KR field with the Maxwell one in General Relativity. We investigate how the Lorentz symmetry-breaking parameter affects the free-fall velocity of the particle as it approaches black hole inner regions. Additionally, we analyze the influence of this parameter on the emission and detection of signals by observers in different frames. We furthermore explore modifications to the radial and angular components of tidal forces in this space-time and compare the results with those obtained for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Finally, we analytically solve the geodesic deviation equation under two different conditions, identifying a subtle effect of the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter in the charged KR metric, and compare it with two other space-time metrics with spontaneous symmetry breaking. These findings provide useful insights into how models of spontaneous Lorentz symmetry-breaking influence gravitational dynamics in the space-times of charged black holes.</description>

Abstract: This study explores how the spontaneous violation of Lorentz symmetry -- modeled through a black hole solution in the context of bumblebee gravity -- affects the propagation and dynamics of neutrinos. The investigation centers on three distinct aspects: the rate of energy deposition due to neutrino-antineutrino pair annihilation, modifications to the neutrino oscillation phase driven by the underlying spacetime structure, and the influence of gravitational lensing on flavor conversion probabilities. To support the theoretical considerations, numerical simulations are conducted for oscillation probabilities in a two-flavor framework, taking into account both normal and inverted mass orderings. For comparison, the outcomes are juxtaposed with those obtained in a different Lorentz-violating background, namely, a black hole solution within Kalb-Ramond gravity.</description>

Abstract: Variationality of the equation of conformal geodesics is an important problem in geometry with applications to general relativity. Recently it was proven that, in three dimensions, this system of equations for un-parametrized curves is the Euler-Lagrange equations of a certain conformally invariant functional, while the parametrized system in three dimensions is not variational. We demonstrate that variationality fails in higher dimensions for both parametrized and un-parametrized conformal geodesics, indicating that variational principle may be the selection principle for the physical dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors use state-of-the-art quantum technologies to reduce the noise induced by vacuum fluctuations, via injection of squeezed states of light. Future detectors, such as Einstein Telescope, may require the use of two filter cavities or a 3-mirror coupled filter cavity to achieve a complex rotation of the squeezing ellipse, in order to reduce the quantum noise over the whole detector bandwidth. In this work, we compare the theoretical feasibility and performances of these two optical layouts and their resilience with respect to different degradation sources (optical losses, mismatching, locking precision), analytically and numerically. We extend previous analysis on squeezing degradation and find that the coupled cavity scheme provides similar or better performances than the two-cavity option, in terms of resilience with respect to imperfections and optical losses. We further highlight the role of mode-mismatch phases in limiting squeezing. Finally, we propose a possible two-step implementation scheme for Einstein Telescope using a single filter cavity that can be possibly upgraded into a coupled filter cavity.</description>

      <title>The Fast and the Frame-Dragging: Efficient waveforms for asymmetric-mass eccentric equatorial inspirals into rapidly-spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of gravitational-wave signals emitted by compact binary inspirals provide unique insights into their properties, but their analysis requires accurate and efficient waveform models. Intermediate- and extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (I/EMRIs), with mass ratios $q \gtrsim 10^2$, are promising sources for future detectors such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Modelling waveforms for these asymmetric-mass binaries is challenging, entailing the tracking of many harmonic modes over thousands to millions of cycles. The FastEMRIWaveforms (FEW) modelling framework addresses this need, leveraging precomputation of mode data and interpolation to rapidly compute adiabatic waveforms for eccentric inspirals into zero-spin black holes. In this work, we extend FEW to model eccentric equatorial inspirals into black holes with spin magnitudes $|a| \leq 0.999$. Our model supports eccentricities $e &lt; 0.9$ and semi-latus recta $p &lt; 200$, enabling the generation of long-duration IMRI waveforms, and produces waveforms in $\sim 100$ ms with hardware acceleration. Characterising systematic errors, we estimate that our model attains mismatches of $\sim 10^{-5}$ (for LISA sensitivity) with respect to error-free adiabatic waveforms over most of parameter space. We find that kludge models introduce errors in signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) as great as $^{+60\%}_{-40\%}$ and induce marginal biases of up to $\sim 1\sigma$ in parameter estimation. We show LISA's horizon redshift for I/EMRI signals varies significantly with $a$, reaching a redshift of $3$ ($15$) for EMRIs (IMRIs) with only minor $(\sim10\%)$ dependence on $e$ for an SNR threshold of 20. For signals with SNR $\sim 50$, spin and eccentricity-at-plunge are measured with uncertainties of $\delta a \sim 10^{-7}$ and $\delta e_f \sim 10^{-5}$. This work advances the state-of-the-art in waveform generation for asymmetric-mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Black hole photon ring beyond General Relativity: an integrable parametrization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09882v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the shape of the photon ring in black holes images has been argued to provide a sharp test of the Kerr hypothesis for future black hole imaging missions. In this work, we confront this proposal to beyond Kerr geometries and investigate the degeneracy in the estimations of the black hole parameters using the circlipse shape proposed by Gralla and Lupsasca. To that end, we consider a model-independent parametrization of the deviations to the Kerr black hole geometry, dubbed Kerr off shell (KOS), which preserves the fundamental symmetry structure of Kerr known as the Killing tower. Besides exhibiting a Killing tensor and thus a Carter-like constant, all the representants of this family also possess a Killing-Yano tensor and are of Petrov type D. The allowed deviations to Kerr, selected by the symmetry, are encoded in two free functions which depend respectively on the radial and polar angle coordinates. Using the symmetries, we provide an analytic study of the radial and polar motion of photon trajectories generating the critical curve, to which the subrings composing the photon ring converge. This allows us to derive a ready-to-use closed formula for the parametric critical curve in term of the free functions parametrizing the deviations to Kerr. Using this result, we confront the circlipse fitting function to four examples of Kerr-like objects and we show that it admits a high degree of degeneracy. At a given inclination, the same circlipse can fit both a Kerr black hole of a given mass and spin $(M,a)$ or a modified rotating black hole with different mass and spin parameters $(M,a)$ and a new parameter $\alpha$. Therefore, future tests of the Kerr hypothesis could be achieved only provided one can measure independently the mass and spin of the black hole to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Formation of Bound States in Quintessence Alternative Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation and behaviour of bound states formed outside the horizon of a black hole in the presence of quintessence matter. Calculating the Regge and Wheeler potential for general metric function, we find that the presence of quintessence influences significantly the metric function and the Hawking temperature. We show that large black holes radiate less in the presence of quintessence matter and it seems to live longer, while small black holes radiate more in comparison with the model in the absence of quintessence. Bound states emerge at large enough quintessence parameter $|w|$ or angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Constraining Cubic Curvature Corrections to General Relativity with Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate observational constraints on cubic curvature corrections to general relativity by analyzing quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in accreting black hole systems. In particular, we study Kerr black hole solution corrected by cubic curvature terms parameterized by $\beta_5$ and $\beta_6$. While $\beta_6$ corresponds to a field-redefinition invariant structure, the $\beta_5$ term can in principle be removed via a field redefinition. Nonetheless, since we work in the frame where the accreting matter minimally couples to the metric, $\beta_5$ is in general present. Utilizing the corrected metric, we compute the QPO frequencies within the relativistic precession framework. Using observational data from GRO J1655$-$40 and a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the coupling parameters to $-12.31&lt;\frac{\beta_5}{(5 M_\odot)^4}&lt;24.15$ and $-1.99&lt;\frac{\beta_6}{(5 M_\odot)^4}&lt;0.30$ at 2-$\sigma$. These bounds improve upon existing constraints from big-bang nucleosynthesis and the speed of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Algebraically special perturbations of the Kerr black hole: a metric formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbations of the Kerr black hole are notoriously difficult to describe in the metric formalism and are usually studied in terms of perturbations of the Weyl scalars. In this work, we focus on the algebraically special linear perturbations (ASLP) of the Kerr geometry and show how one can describe this subsector of the perturbations solely using the metric formulation. To that end, we consider the most general twisting algebraically special solution space of vacuum General Relativity. By linearizing around the Kerr solution, we obtain two coupled partial differential wave equations describing the dynamics of the Kerr ASLP. We provide an algorithm to solve them analytically in the small spin approximation up to third order, providing the first exact solution of this kind in the metric formulation. Then, we use this framework to study the stationary zero modes of the Kerr geometry. We present the exact analytical form of the shifts in mass and spin together with the required change of coordinates needed to identify them. Finally, we also provide for the first time closed expressions for the solution-generating perturbations generating the NUT and acceleration charges, thus deforming the Kerr solution to the linearized Kerr-NUT and spinning C-metric. These results provide a first concrete and rare example of perturbations of the Kerr black hole which can be treated entirely in the metric formulation. They can serve as a useful testbed to search for hidden symmetries of the Kerr perturbations.</description>

      <title>New HDE models with higher derivatives of the Hubble parameter $H$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12284v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate two Dark Energy (DE) models characterized by higher-order derivatives of the Hubble parameter $H$, which generalize previously proposed DE scenarios. Assuming a power-law form of the scale factor $a(t)$ given by $a(t)=b_0t^n$, we derive analytical expressions for the DE energy density, pressure, the Equation of State (EoS) parameter, the deceleration parameter and the evolutionary form of the fractional DE density. Both non-interacting and interacting dark sector frameworks are examined, with the interaction modeled through a coupling term proportional to the Dark Matter (DM) energy density. For specific parameter sets corresponding to power-law indices $n=2$, $n=3$, and $n=4$, we compute the present age of the Universe. The values obtained slightly deviate from the observationally inferred age of $\approx 13.8$ Gyr; moreover, a systematic trend is identified, with larger $n$ leading to higher ages. Furthermore, interacting scenarios consistently predict larger ages compared to their non-interacting counterparts. These results highlight the phenomenological viability and limitations of higher-derivative DE models in describing the cosmic evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that a high pressure phase transition of relativistic matter to a state with negative energy density, which leads to the formation of horizonless black hole mimickers, can also give rise to the appearance of ``little red dots''. The energy source for the dots is the release of latent energy from the phase transition, and their redness is a result of this release taking place in a central region of exponentially small positive $g_{00}$, and hence very high gravitational redshift.</description>

      <title>Light propagation in 2PN approximation in the monopole and quadrupole field of a body at rest: The basic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Todays astrometry has reached the micro-arcsecond level in angular measurements of celestial objects. The next generations of astrometric facilities are aiming at the sub-micro-arcsecond scale. Sub-micro-arcsecond astrometry requires a considerable improvement in the theory of light propagation in the curved space-time of the solar system. In particular, it is indispensable to determine light trajectories to the second order of the post-Newtonian scheme, where the monopole and quadrupole structure of some solar system bodies need to be taken into account. In reality, both the light source as well as the observer are located at finite spatial distances from the gravitating body. This fact implies for the need to solve the boundary value problem of light propagation, where the light trajectory is fully determined by the spatial positions of source and observer and its unit direction at past infinity. This problem has been solved in a recent investigation. A practical relativistic model of observational data reduction necessitates the determination of the unit tangent vector along the light trajectory at the spatial position of the observer, which is determined by a sequence of several basic transformations. The determination of this unit tangent vector allows one to calculate the impact of the monopole and quadrupole structure of solar system bodies on light deflection on the sub-micro-arcsecond level, both for stellar light sources as well as for light sources located in the solar system. Numerical values for the magnitude of light deflection caused by the monopole and quadrupole structure of the body are given for grazing light rays at the giant planets. The model GREM is presently used for data reduction of the ESA astrometry mission Gaia. It is shown how the implementation of these basic transformations into GREM would proceed for possible future space astrometry missions.</description>

      <title>From negative to positive cosmological constant through decreasing temperature of the Universe: connection with string theory and spacetime foliation results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String theories naturally predict a negative, while observations on the exponential expansion of the present Universe require a positive value for the cosmological constant. Solution to resolve this discrepancy is known in the framework of string theory however, it might describe unstable worlds. Other options include modified $\Lambda$CDM models with sign switching cosmological constant (known as $\Lambda_s$ cosmology), but the sign flip is introduced into the models manually. Additional studies consider Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity by using Renormalization Group (RG), however their disadvantage is the omission of temperature which is otherwise crucial in the early Universe. Here we present a proposal for resolving this conflict by using a modified thermal RG method where the temperature parameter $T$ is given by the inverse radius of the compactified time-like dimension, similarly to spacetime foliation. In our scenario not the dimensionful $T$, but the dimensionless temperature $\tau = T/k$ is kept constant when the RG scale $k$ is sent to zero and string theory is assumed to take place at very high while AS quantum gravity at intermediate and low temperatures. We show that the modified thermal RG study of AS quantum gravity models at very high temperatures results in a negative cosmological constant while turns it into a positive parameter for low temperatures.</description>

      <title>The Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method for constructing off-diagonal solutions in (modified) Einstein gravity and nonassociative geometric flows and Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is a status report on the Anholonomic Frame and Connection Deformation Method, AFCDM, for constructing generic off-diagonal exact and parametric solutions in general relativity, GR, relativistic geometric flows, and modified gravity theories, MGTs. Such models can be generalized to nonassociative and noncommutative star products on phase spaces and modelled equivalently as nonassociative Finsler-Lagrange-Hamilton geometries. Our approach involves a nonholonomic geometric reformulation of classical models of gravitational and matter fields described by Lagrange and Hamilton densities on relativistic phase spaces. Using nonholonomic dyadic variables, the Einstein equations in GR and MGTs can be formulated as systems of nonlinear partial differential equations(PDEs), which can be decoupled and integrated in some general off-diagonal forms. In this approach, the Lagrange and Hamilton dynamics and related models of classical and quantum evolution are equivalently described in terms of generalized Finsler-like or canonical metrics and (nonlinear) connection structures on deformed phase spaces defined by solutions of modified Einstein equations. New classes of exact and parametric solutions in (nonassociative) MGTs are formulated in terms of generating and integration functions and generating effective/ matter sources. The physical interpretation of respective classes of solutions depends on the type of (non) linear symmetries, prescribed boundary/ asymptotic conditions, or posed Cauchy problems.</description>

Abstract: We show that previous correspondence between some (integrable) statistical field theory quantities and periods of $SU(2)$ $\mathcal{N}=2$ deformed gauge theory still holds if we add $N_f=1,2$ flavours of matter. Moreover, the correspondence entails a new non-perturbative solution to the theory. Eventually, we use this solution to give exact results on quasinormal modes of black branes and holes.</description>

      <title>Beyond holography: the entropic quantum gravity foundations of image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14048v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, thanks to the development of artificial intelligence (AI) there is increasing scientific attention in establishing the connections between theoretical physics and AI. Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has formulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which gravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between two metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow that maximizes the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this algorithm is the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action calculated between two Euclidean metrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image. As the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies that the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration of the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic actions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the maximization of the GfE action is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections between GfE, machine learning and brain research.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Slip in the Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key signature of general relativity is that the two scalar potentials $\Phi$ and $\Psi$, when expressed in the longitudinal gauge, are equal in the absence of fluids with anisotropic stress. This is often expressed by stating that their ratio, the "gravitational slip", is equal to unity. However, the equality of $\Phi$ and $\Psi$ is typically broken in alternative theories of gravity. Observational constraints on the slip parameter are therefore of direct interest for testing Einstein's theory. In this paper we derive theory-independent expressions for the slip parameter on both large and small scales in Friedmann cosmologies, expressing it as a function of the post-Newtonian parameters. This is the final ingredient required for a complete parameterization of dust and dark energy-dominated cosmologies within the framework of Parameterized Post-Newtonian Cosmology (PPNC), which allows for the fully self-consistent modelling of cosmological observables without assuming any specific theory of gravity.</description>

      <title>The area and volume laws for entanglement of scalar fields in flat and cosmological spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the area and volume laws for entanglement of free quantum scalar fields. In addition to the entropy, we use the notion of the capacity of entanglement, which measures entropy fluctuations. We consider flat spacetimes as well as the curved ones relevant for cosmology. Moreover, we put special emphasis on quench phenomena and different geometries of the entangling surfaces. First, we show that, in the Minkowski spacetime, the capacity of entanglement, like entropy, exhibits the area law for two kinds of geometries of the entangling surfaces: the sphere and strip. Moreover, we show that the ratio of both quantities takes the same values for both surfaces. Next, we turn our attention to quenches. Namely, we analyse the dynamics of capacity; in particular, contribution of the volume and surface terms. Moreover, we compare these results with theoretical predictions resulting from the quasiparticles model. In the second part, we consider the above issues for the FLRW spaces; especially, for de Sitter space as well as a metric modeling the transition to radiation-dominated era. Finally, we analyse the abrupt quenches in de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic symmetry structure of two--dimensional dilaton gravity in its $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric extension based on the $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)$ Lie superalgebra. Within the BF theoretical framework, we analyze affine and superconformal boundary conditions for each case and systematically derive the associated asymptotic symmetry algebras. While the classical theory recovers the Virasoro algebra or its affine enhancement, the supersymmetric extension yields a classical $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal algebra, subject to dynamical symmetry breaking mechanisms induced by the dilaton supermultiplet. We find that the boundary behavior of the dilaton not only leads to a reduction of the full affine $\mathfrak{osp}(1|2)_k$ symmetry down to $\tt{O} \tt{S} p(1|2)$, but also introduces an abelian extension through commuting modes. These results reveal a novel interplay between symmetry breaking and symmetry extension in low-dimensional supergravity. Our construction generalizes previous analyses of $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$ dilaton gravity to the supersymmetric domain and offers a consistent foundation for investigating boundary dynamics beyond the Schwarzian regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transparency of Near-extremal Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03398v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the scattering of electromagnetic and gravitational waves off a Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole in the low-temperature regime where the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations. We find that the black hole is transparent to electromagnetic and gravitational radiation of fixed helicity below a certain frequency threshold. This phenomenon arises because the angular momentum of the black hole is quantized, creating an energy gap between the spinless black hole state and the first excited spinning states. Radiation with angular momentum -- such as photons, gravitons, and partial waves of a massless scalar field, which we also study -- must supply enough energy to bridge this gap to be absorbed. Below this threshold, no absorption can occur, rendering the black hole transparent. For frequencies above the gap, the scarcity of black hole states continues to suppress the absorption cross-section relative to semiclassical predictions, making the black hole translucent rather than completely transparent. Notably, electromagnetic absorption is significantly stronger than gravitational absorption, beyond what differences in spin alone would suggest.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Quasi-Periodic Eruptions: LISA Detection Prospects for RX J1301.9+2747</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07961</link>

Abstract: One prominent model for quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) is that they originate from extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) involving stellar-mass objects orbiting around massive black holes and colliding with their accretion disks. We compute the gravitational wave signals from such a model, demonstrating that orbiter-disk interactions result in small frequency shifts and high-frequency tails due to the excitation of non-discrete modes. Interestingly, we show that QPE RX J1301.9+2747 could be detectable by future space-based gravitational wave detectors, provided a moderate eccentricity around $0.25$ and a mass exceeding $35\,M_\odot$ for the orbiter. Moreover, based on this QPE model, we show that the signal-to-noise ratio of the gravitational wave signals from QPEs, if detectable, will be sufficiently high to distinguish such systems from vacuum EMRIs and shed light on the origin of QPEs and environments around massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Triples as Links between Binary Black Hole Mergers, their Electromagnetic Counterparts, and Galactic Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a formation pathway linking black holes (BHs) observed in gravitational-wave (GW) mergers, wide BH-stellar systems uncovered by Gaia, and accreting low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs). In this scenario, a stellar-mass BH binary undergoes isolated binary evolution and merges while hosting a distant, dynamically unimportant tertiary stellar companion. The tertiary becomes relevant only after the merger, when the remnant BH receives a GW recoil kick. Depending on the kick velocity and system configuration, the outcome can be: (i) a bright electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to the GW merger; (ii) an LMXB; (iii) a wide BH-stellar companion resembling the Gaia BH population; or (iv) an unbound, isolated BH. Modeling the three-body dynamics, we find that $\sim 0.02\%$ of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) mergers may be followed by an EM counterpart within $\sim$10 days, produced by tidal disruption of the star by the BH. The flare is likely brightest in the optical-UV and lasts days to weeks; in some cases, partial disruption causes recurring flares with a period of $\sim$2 months. We further estimate that this channel can produce $\sim 1-10\%$ of Gaia BH systems in the Milky Way. This scenario provides the first physically motivated link between GW sources, Gaia BHs, and some X-ray binaries, and predicts a rare but robust pathway for EM counterparts to binary BH mergers, potentially detectable in LVK's O5 run.</description>

      <title>Time-Symmetric Action-at-a-Distance Electrodynamics and the Principle of Action and Reaction for Particles at Relative Rest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a theory of time-symmetric action-at-a-distance electrodynamic or gravitational interactions where the four-forces depend only on the electric charges, the rest masses, the position four-vectors, and the four-velocities of the two interacting particles, but not on their four-accelerations or higher derivatives. The goal is to prove that the principle of action and reaction is obeyed due to the fact that, for a given pair of corresponding infinitesimal segments along the worldlines of the two particles, the impulse of the advanced four-force and the impulse of the retarded four-force are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction. For two particles at relative rest, we derive this result as the outcome of a symmetry operation in flat conformal space. We start by assuming a positive spacetime interval between the two interacting particles, and we perform a conformal inversion (an improper inversion in a hypersphere), after which the two particles exchange their position and time coordinates and their rest masses. Then we perform an improper reflection across the axis connecting the two particles, after which the two particles recover their initial four-velocities, up to a minus sign. Two improper coordinate transformations are needed together in order to obtain a resulting positive Jacobian determinant. In the final step we go to the limit of a null spacetime interval between the endpoints of the corresponding infinitesimal segments. When the two interacting particles are at rest, or move with the same velocity, the initial and the final physical parameters that determine the four-forces are identical. Due to symmetry, the principle of action and reaction emerges. We make the conjecture that another, undetermined yet, symmetry operation must also apply, in order for the principle of action and reaction to hold even for particles moving with different velocities.</description>

      <title>CWT-LSTM Autoencoder: A Novel Approach for Gravitational Wave Detection in LIGO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10505v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detection requires sophisticated signal processing to identify weak astrophysical signals buried in instrumental noise. Traditional matched filtering approaches face computational challenges with diverse signal morphologies and non-stationary noise. This work presents a deep learning methodology integrating Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) preprocessing with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder architecture for gravitational wave detection. The CWT provides optimal time-frequency decomposition capturing chirp evolution and transient characteristics essential for compact binary coalescence identification. We first develop the model using synthetic datasets incorporating binary black hole merger signals with masses ranging from 10 to 80 solar masses. These signals are then embedded in colored Gaussian noise representative of Advanced LIGO sensitivity. The trained model demonstrates strong performance metrics. We then apply the CWT-LSTM model to gravitational wave data from multiple LIGO observing runs. We use 1639 clean noise samples for training the anomaly detection model, while the test dataset contained a mix of 114 confirmed gravitational wave events and 410 noise samples. The model demonstrates strong performance with an AUC of 1.000 and Average Precision (AP) of 1.000, achieving a precision of 1.0 at the optimal threshold with a recall of 1.0. The reconstruction error distribution shows clear separation between noise and gravitational wave signals, with noise samples clustering around lower reconstruction error values and signals around higher reconstruction error values. This unsupervised approach enables discovery of signals with unknown morphologies that could provide complementary "blind search" capability for detecting exotic astrophysical sources and novel physics beyond current theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Dissipation in Open Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the holographic realization of a conformal theory coupled to an external bath realized via a double trace deformation and its gravity dual in terms of transparent boundary conditions in order to map out some basic dissipative properties of this simple open holographic system. In particular, we determine the energy transmission coefficient across the boundary, discover a novel duality relating weak and strong coupling to the external bath, and quantify the dissipation in the system by working out the quasi normal modes.</description>

      <title>Dark-to-black super accretion as a mechanism for early supermassive black hole growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00644v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of supermassive black holes with masses $\gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\gtrsim 10$ challenges conventional formation scenarios based on baryonic accretion and mergers within the first few hundred million years. We propose an alternative channel in which ultralight scalar dark matter undergoes dark-to-black conversion via quasi-bound state depletion around black hole seeds. We estimate the accretion rate of the scalar field as a function of the boson mass parameter $\mu$ and the black hole mass $M_{\rm BH}$, and integrate this rate over cosmological timescales. Our results show that once a critical value of $\mu M_{\rm BH}$ is reached, scalar field accretion becomes highly efficient, enabling substantial black hole growth even from relatively small initial seed masses. For boson masses $\mu \sim 10^{-19}-10^{-16}\,\mathrm{eV}$, black hole seeds of $10^2-10^5 M_\odot$ can reach $10^6-10^8 M_\odot$ within $\sim 10^8$ yr. This dark-to-black mechanism provides a natural pathway for the rapid formation of massive black holes in the early universe, offering a potential probe of the microphysical nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Mass Varying Neutrino Oscillation in Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how matter density affects neutrino oscillations by considering a mass-varying neutrino scenario where the neutrino mass depends on a scalar field. This scalar field is non-minimally coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet (GB) invariant, causing its profile to be implicitly influenced by the surrounding matter distribution. Using data from solar neutrino experiments, we derive constraints on the model parameters, providing new insights into the properties of mass-varying neutrino within the Gauss-Bonnet scalar-tensor framework.</description>
