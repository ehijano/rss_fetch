      <title>An algorithm for accurate and simple-looking metaphorical maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19810v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: "Metaphorical maps" or "contact representations" are visual representations of vertex-weighted graphs that rely on the geographic map metaphor. The vertices are represented by countries, the weights by the areas of the countries, and the edges by contacts/ boundaries among them. The accuracy with which the weights are mapped to areas and the simplicity of the polygons representing the countries are the two classical optimization goals for metaphorical maps. Mchedlidze and Schnorr [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022] presented a force-based algorithm that creates metaphorical maps that balance between these two optimization goals. Their maps look visually simple, but the accuracy of the maps is far from optimal - the countries' areas can vary up to 30% compared to required. In this paper, we provide a multi-fold extension of the algorithm in [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022]. More specifically:
  1. Towards improving accuracy: We introduce the notion of region stiffness and suggest a technique for varying the stiffness based on the current pressure of map regions.
  2. Towards maintaining simplicity: We introduce a weight coefficient to the pressure force exerted on each polygon point based on whether the corresponding point appears along a narrow passage.
  3. Towards generality: We cover, in contrast to [Metaphoric Maps for Dynamic Vertex-weighted Graphs, EuroVis 2022], non-triangulated graphs. This is done by either generating points where more than three regions meet or by introducing holes in the metaphorical map.
  We perform an extended experimental evaluation that, among other results, reveals that our algorithm is able to construct metaphorical maps with nearly perfect area accuracy with a little sacrifice in their simplicity.</description>

      <title>Tight Quantum-Security Bounds and Parameter Optimization for SPHINCS+ and NTRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The imminent threat of quantum computing necessitates quantum-resistant cryptosystems. This paper establishes tight security bounds for two NIST PQC finalists: SPHINCS+ (hash-based) and NTRU (lattice-based). Our key contributions include: (1) A quantum attack model incorporating decoherence effects ($\tau_d$) and parallelization limits; (2) Improved entropy concentration inequalities reducing SPHINCS+ parameters by 15-20\%; (3) Optimized NTRU lattice parameters via quantum lattice entropy $H_Q(\Lambda)$; (4) Tightened NTRU-to-LWE reduction with polynomial-factor improvement. Theoretical results demonstrate significant security enhancement over existing constructions, providing implementable parameters for standardization.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic size of the Karp-Sipser Core in Configuration Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic size of the Karp-Sipser core in the configuration model with arbitrary degree distributions. The Karp-Sipser core is the induced subgraph obtained by iteratively removing all leaves and their neighbors through the leaf-removal process, and finally discarding any isolated vertices \cite{BCC}. Our main result establishes the convergence of the Karp-Sipser core size to an explicit fixed-point equation under general degree assumptions.The approach is based on analyzing the corresponding local weak limit of the configuration model - a unimodular Galton-Watson tree and tracing the evolution process of all vertex states under leaf-removal dynamics by use of the working mechanism of an enhanced version of Warning Propagation along with Node Labeling Propagation.</description>

      <title>Fractional domatic number and minimum degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The domatic number of a graph $G$ is the maximum number of pairwise disjoint dominating sets of $G$. We are interested in the LP-relaxation of this parameter, which is called the fractional domatic number of $G$. We study its extremal value in the class of graphs of minimum degree $d$. The fractional domatic number of a graph of minimum degree $d$ is always at most $d+1$, and at least $(1-o(1))\, d/\ln d$ as $d\to \infty$. This is asymptotically tight even within the class of split graphs. Our main result concerns the case $d=2$; we show that, excluding $8$ exceptional graphs, the fractional domatic number of every connected graph of minimum degree (at least) $2$ is at least $5/2$. We also show that this bound cannot be improved if only finitely many graphs are excluded, even when restricting to bipartite graphs of girth at least $6$. This proves in a stronger sense a conjecture by Gadouleau, Harms, Mertzios, and Zamaraev (2024). This also extends and generalises results from McCuaig and Shepherd (1989), from Fujita, Kameda, and Yamashita (2000), and from Abbas, Egerstedt, Liu, Thomas, and Whalen (2016). Finally, we show that planar graphs of minimum degree at least $2$ and girth at least $g$ have fractional domatic number at least $3 - O(1/g)$ as $g\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Internally-Convex Drawings of Outerplanar Graphs in Small Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known result by Kant [Algorithmica, 1996] implies that n-vertex outerplane graphs admit embedding-preserving planar straight-line grid drawings where the internal faces are convex polygons in $O(n^2)$ area. In this paper, we present an algorithm to compute such drawings in $O(n^{1.5})$ area. We also consider outerplanar drawings in which the internal faces are required to be strictly-convex polygons. In this setting, we consider outerplanar graphs whose weak dual is a path and give a drawing algorithm that achieves $\Theta(nk^2)$ area, where $k$ is the maximum size of an internal facial cycle.</description>

      <title>Growth Forms of Tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growth form (or corona limit) of a tiling is the limit form of its coordination shells, i.e. its set of tiles located at a fixed distance from some tile. We give an overview of current results, conjectures and open questions about growth forms, including periodic, multigrid, substitution, and hat tilings.</description>

      <title>An analogue of Reed's conjecture for digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reed in 1998 conjectured that every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil \frac{\Delta(G)+1+\omega(G)}{2} \rceil$. As a partial result, he proved the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for which every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\Delta(G)+1)+\varepsilon\omega(G) \rceil$. We propose an analogue conjecture for digraphs. Given a digraph $D$, we denote by $\vec{\chi}(D)$ the dichromatic number of $D$, which is the minimum number of colours needed to partition $D$ into acyclic induced subdigraphs. We let $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)$ denote the size of the largest biclique (a set of vertices inducing a complete digraph) of $D$ and $\tilde{\Delta}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \sqrt{d^+(v) \cdot d^-(v)}$. We conjecture that every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil \frac{\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1+\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)}{2} \rceil$, which if true implies Reed's conjecture. As a partial result, we prove the existence of $\varepsilon &gt;0$ for which every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1)+\varepsilon\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) \rceil$. This implies both Reed's result and an independent result of Harutyunyan and Mohar for oriented graphs.
  To obtain this upper bound on $\vec{\chi}$, we prove that every digraph $D$ with $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) &gt; \frac{2}{3}(\Delta_{\max}(D)+1)$, where $\Delta_{\max}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \max(d^+(v),d^-(v))$, admits an acyclic set of vertices intersecting each biclique of $D$, which generalises a result of King.
  We finally give a short proof that all oriented graphs $D$ satisfy $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \Tilde{\Delta}(D) + 2$, improving on a result of Golowich.</description>
