Abstract: The Hurst exponent is a significant indicator for characterizing the self-similarity and long-term memory properties of time sequences. It has wide applications in physics, technologies, engineering, mathematics, statistics, economics, psychology and so on. Currently, available methods for estimating the Hurst exponent of time sequences can be divided into different categories: time-domain methods and spectrum-domain methods based on the representation of time sequence, linear regression methods and Bayesian methods based on parameter estimation methods. Although various methods are discussed in literature, there are still some deficiencies: the descriptions of the estimation algorithms are just mathematics-oriented and the pseudo-codes are missing; the effectiveness and accuracy of the estimation algorithms are not clear; the classification of estimation methods is not considered and there is a lack of guidance for selecting the estimation methods. In this work, the emphasis is put on thirteen dominant methods for estimating the Hurst exponent. For the purpose of decreasing the difficulty of implementing the estimation methods with computer programs, the mathematical principles are discussed briefly and the pseudo-codes of algorithms are presented with necessary details. It is expected that the survey could help the researchers to select, implement and apply the estimation algorithms of interest in practical situations in an easy way.</description>
