      <title>Multiplier scales of a sequence of rational maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the behavior of multipliers of a degenerating sequence of complex rational maps. We show either most periodic points have uniformly bounded multipliers, or most of them have exploding multipliers at a common scale. We further explore the set of scales induced by the growth of multipliers. Using Ahbyankar's theorem, we prove that there can be at most 2d-2 such non-trivial multiplier scales.</description>

      <title>Derivation of a spatial replicator system with environmental heterogeneity from a co-colonization SIS model with N strains and P patches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between local and regional processes in the dynamics of ecological communities remains a challenge to model, analyze and predict. This is especially notable in infectious diseases with multiple strains, where several layers of heterogeneity can interact, including strain biological traits and environmental heterogeneity among locations where disease can spread. Motivated by this challenge, here we study a Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model with co-colonization and multiple interacting strains where hosts move between a set of inter-connected patches. Under strain similarity and slow migration rate, we derive a fast-slow approximation of the global metacommunity dynamics, resulting in a spatial replicator system for N strains across P patches. In contrast to a discretization approach on the spatial slow-fast PDE originally derived in(Le and Madec, 2023), here the slow-fast reduction is managed ab-initio by a new approach using strongly the Perron-Frobenius Theorem for Metzler matrices, which simplifies and clarifies the structure of the co-colonization system.</description>

      <title>Apocalypsis and Apocalyptic Events: The Morphogenetic Ontology of Synchronized Catastrophes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I formalizes the ontology of apocalyptic events as synchronized morphogenetic manifolds within the framework of Thom's catastrophe theory. Local catastrophes (folds, cusps, umbilici) are extended to higher-order systemic collapses through the synchronization of multiple morphogenetic manifolds. The resulting construct is the Apocalypsis: a topological meta-singularity generated by the coherent alignment of local singularities into a global structure of collapse. The mathematical formalization of Apocalyptic events and Apocalypsis integrates dynamical systems theory, topological stability, and probabilistic dependence structures using Archimedean copulas to capture nonlinear interrelations among coupled subsystems. The Existence Theorem demonstrates the existence, genericity, and almost-sure occurrence of Apocalypsis under coupling and stochastic control trajectories.</description>

      <title>Action-minimizing periodic orbits of the Lorentz force equation with dominant vector potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of non-constant periodic solutions to the Lorentz force equation, where no scalar potential is needed to induce the electromagnetic field. Our results extend to cases where a possibly singular scalar potential is present, although the vector potential assumes a leading role. The approach is based on minimizing the action functional associated with the relativistic Lagrangian. The compactness of the minimizing sequences requires the existence of negative values for the functional, which is proven using novel ideas that exploit the sign-indefinite nature of the term involving the vector potential.</description>

      <title>Strong Stability of Linear Functional Equations with Distributed Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers linear functional equations on $\mathbb R^d$ with distributed delays defined by matrix-valued measures of bounded variation. More precisely, we are interested in providing conditions to ensure that the exponential stability of these systems is preserved under small changes of the parameters which define them. In the special case of difference equations, it is known that exponential stability is preserved under small perturbations of the matrices defining the system, but not of the delays, and an additional condition for preservation of exponential stability under perturbation of the delays is given by the Hale--Silkowski criterion (HSC). In this paper, we extend the treatment of these issues to more general systems. For that purpose, we first put forward an appropriate definition of perturbation on the delays and then propose a conjecture in the spirit of (HSC). We prove several partial results related to that conjecture.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Central Configurations in the Concave 4-Body Problem with Two Pairs of Equal Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a single-parameter family of the concave kite central configurations in the 4-body problem with two pairs of equal masses. In such configurations, one pair of the masses must lie on the base of an isosceles triangle, and the other pair on its symmetric axis with one mass positioned inside the triangle formed by the other three. Using a rigorous computer-assisted analytical approach, we prove that for any non-negative mass ratio, the number of such configurations is either zero, one, or two, which can be viewed as a complete classification of this particular family. Furthermore, we show that the unique configuration corresponding to a specific mass ratio is a fold-type bifurcation point within the reduced subspace. We also give a clear and complete bifurcation picture for both symmetric and asymmetric cases of this concave type in the whole planar 4-body configuration space.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of Planar Central Configurations in the $N$-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degeneracy of central configurations in the planar $N$-body problem makes their enumeration problem hard and the related dynamics appealing. The degeneracy is always intertwined with the symmetry of the system of central configurations which makes the problem subtle. By analyzing the Jacobian matrix of the system, we systematically explore the direct method to single out trivial zero eigenvalues associated with translational, rotational and scaling symmetries, thereby isolating the non-trivial part of the Jacobian to study the degeneracy. Three distinct formulations of degeneracy are presented, each tailored to handle different formulation of the system. The method is applied to such well-known examples as Lagrange's equilateral triangle solutions for arbitrary masses, the square configuration for four equal masses and the equilateral triangle with a central mass revealing specific mass values for which degeneracy occurs. Combining with the interval algorithm, the nondegeneracy of rhombus central configurations for arbitrary mass is established.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Dynamics In Optimization Landscape of Shallow Neural Networks with Tunable Leaky ReLU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nonlinear dynamics of a shallow neural network trained with mean-squared loss and leaky ReLU activation. Under Gaussian inputs and equal layer width k, (1) we establish, based on the equivariant gradient degree, a theoretical framework, applicable to any number of neurons k&gt;= 4, to detect bifurcation of critical points with associated symmetries from global minimum as leaky parameter $\alpha$ varies. Typically, our analysis reveals that a multi-mode degeneracy consistently occurs at the critical number 0, independent of k. (2) As a by-product, we further show that such bifurcations are width-independent, arise only for nonnegative $\alpha$ and that the global minimum undergoes no further symmetry-breaking instability throughout the engineering regime $\alpha$ in range (0,1). An explicit example with k=5 is presented to illustrate the framework and exhibit the resulting bifurcation together with their symmetries.</description>

      <title>Can quantum dynamics emerge from classical chaos?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anosov geodesic flows are among the simplest mathematical models of deterministic chaos. In this survey we explain how, quite unexpectedly, quantum dynamics emerges from purely classical correlation functions. The underlying mechanism is the discrete Pollicott Ruelle spectrum of the geodesic flow, revealed through microlocal analysis. This spectrum naturally arranges into vertical bands; when the rightmost band is separated from the rest by a gap, it governs an effective dynamics that mirrors quantum evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a measure equivalence coupling between two finitely generated groups, Delabie, Koivisto, Le Ma\^itre and Tessera have found explicit upper bounds on how integrable the associated cocycles can be. We extend these results to the broader framework of unimodular compactly generated locally compact groups. We also generalize a result by the first-named author, showing that the integrability threshold described in these statements cannot be achieved.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional dynamics in low-dimensional networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many networks in nature and applications have an approximate low-rank structure in the sense that their connectivity structure is dominated by a few dimensions. It is natural to expect that dynamics on such networks would also be low-dimensional. Indeed, theoretical results show that low-rank networks produce low-dimensional dynamics whenever the network is isolated from external perturbations or input. However, networks in nature are rarely isolated. Here, we study the dimensionality of dynamics in recurrent networks with low-dimensional structure driven by high-dimensional inputs or perturbations. We find that dynamics in such networks can be high- or low-dimensional and we derive precise conditions on the network structure under which dynamics are high-dimensional. In many low-rank networks, dynamics are suppressed in directions aligned with the network's low-rank structure, a phenomenon we term ``low-rank suppression.'' We show that several low-rank network structures arising in nature satisfy the conditions for generating high-dimensional dynamics and low-rank suppression. Our results clarify important, but counterintuitive relationships between a recurrent network's connectivity structure and the structure of the dynamics it generates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a Gronwall type inequality for mild solutions of non-autonomous parabolic rough partial differential equations (RPDEs). This inequality together with an analysis of the Cameron-Martin space associated to the noise, allows us to obtain the existence of moments of all order for the solution of the corresponding RPDE and its Jacobian when the random input is given by a Gaussian Volterra process. Applying further the multiplicative ergodic theorem, these integrable bounds entail the existence of Lyapunov exponents for RPDEs. We illustrate these results for stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative boundary noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a triangulated oriented closed connected manifold with universal cover $\widetilde{M}\to M$ and fundamental group $\Gamma=\pi_1(M)$ and consider an essentially free measure preserving action $\Gamma\curvearrowright (X,\mu)$ on a standard Borel probability space. We study the space $\Gamma\backslash(\widetilde{M}\times X)$ equipped with the measured foliation defined by Sauer and the theory of singular foliated simplices in this setting. We define its real singular foliated homology and compare it to classical singular homology. In particular, we construct a foliated fundamental class and prove that its norm coincides with the simplicial volume of $M$, formalizing ideas of Gromov. Passing to the dual chain complex, we define the singular foliated bounded cohomology. When $M$ is aspherical we establish an isometric isomorphism with the measurable bounded cohomology of the action groupoid $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$. As a consequence of a foliated duality principle, we odeduce vanishing criteria for the simplicial volume of $M$ in terms of the vanishing of the measurable bounded cohomology of the action groupoid and/or of its transverse groupoids.</description>

      <title>On the contact type conjecture for exact magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we answer-for a class of magnetic systems-a question now known as the contact type conjecture, whose origin trace back to the 1998 work of Contreras, Iturriaga, Paternain, and Paternain. For a broad class of magnetic systems, we explicitly construct, on any closed manifold, an infinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic systems, which we refer to as magnetic systems of strong geodesic type. For each such system, there exists at least one null-homologous embedded periodic orbit on every energy level, with negative action for energies below the strict Ma\~n\'e critical value. As a consequence, the corresponding energy surfaces are not of contact type below this threshold. Thus, for this class of systems, the contact type conjecture holds true. Moreover, for these systems, both the strict and the lowest Ma\~n\'e critical values can be computed explicitly, and they coincide whenever the aforementioned periodic magnetic geodesic is contractible, without requiring any additional assumptions on the manifold. Several remarkable multiplicity results also hold, guaranteeing arbitrarily large numbers of embedded null-homologous periodic magnetic geodesics on every energy level. We illustrate the richness of this class through two types of examples. First, on any non-aspherical manifold, there exists a dense subset of the space of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, one can construct an infinite-dimensional space of exact magnetic fields yielding magnetic systems of strong geodesic type. Second, on any closed contact manifold for which the strong Weinstein conjecture holds, one can construct an infinite-dimensional space of Riemannian metrics such that, for each such metric, the magnetic system induced by the fixed contact form is of strong geodesic type.</description>
