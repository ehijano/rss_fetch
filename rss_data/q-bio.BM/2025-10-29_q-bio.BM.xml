      <title>Local Electromagnetic Fields Enable Fast Redox Sensing by Physically Accelerating Cysteine Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide oxidises cysteine residues to control protein function, yet bulk rate constants predict hours for changes that occur in cells in seconds. Here, this work shows that local electromagnetic fields (EMFs), ubiquitous in proteins, membranes and nanodomains, can lawfully modulate the Eyring barrier and orientate reactants, accelerating cysteine oxidation without changing the underlying chemistry. Embedding a field term into the Eyring expression, demonstrated that plausible local EMFs with realistic dipole changes accelerate rate constants by orders of magnitude. This local acceleration reconciles the discrepancy between predicted vs. observed rates of H2O2-mediated cysteine oxidation. The framework generates falsifiable predictions, such as vibrational Stark readouts in thiolate peroxide complexes should fall within predicted ranges, and reframes rate-constants as mutable, field conditioned parameters. Cysteine redox sensing is fast not because the chemistry is exotic, but because the physics is local.</description>

      <title>Cation-DNA outer sphere coordination in DNA polymorphism</title>

Abstract: There are two approaches to describing DNA-ions interactions. The physical approach is an analysis of electrostatic interactions between ions and charges on the DNA molecule. The coordination chemistry approach is a search for modes of direct binding of ions to ionophores of DNA. We study both the inner and outer sphere coordination of ions by ionophores of the A and C forms of DNA in molecular dynamics simulations in two low-polarity solvents: in ethanol-water and methanol-water mixtures. We show that the counterion-DNA outer sphere coordination plays a key role in the experimentally observed conformational polymorphism of the DNA molecule: a transition to the A form in ethanol and to the C form in methanol. We identify the ionophores responsible for the existence of the A- and C-complexes. In both the complexes, the ions' inner sphere ligands are mostly water molecules, the ions reside in water clusters. In ethanol-water mixture, the water clusters are large, the major groove of the A-DNA is filled with water, and all ionophores are accessible to ions. In methanol-water mixture, the water clusters are small, and a large number of methanol clusters are present near DNA surface. They interfere with the coordination of ions in one of the ionophores of the major groove, and also with other ionophores near phosphates. Therefore, in methanol, the interaction energy of counterions with A-DNA cannot compensate for the repulsion between closely located phosphates. Therefore, the ions fill more accessible ionophores of the C-complex, converting DNA into the C form.</description>

      <title>ODesign: A World Model for Biomolecular Interaction Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biomolecular interactions underpin almost all biological processes, and their rational design is central to programming new biological functions. Generative AI models have emerged as powerful tools for molecular design, yet most remain specialized for individual molecular types and lack fine-grained control over interaction details. Here we present ODesign, an all-atom generative world model for all-to-all biomolecular interaction design. ODesign allows scientists to specify epitopes on arbitrary targets and generate diverse classes of binding partners with fine-grained control. Across entity-, token-, and atom-level benchmarks in the protein modality, ODesign demonstrates superior controllability and performance to modality-specific baselines. Extending beyond proteins, it generalizes to nucleic acid and small-molecule design, enabling interaction types such as protein-binding RNA/DNA and RNA/DNA-binding ligands that were previously inaccessible. By unifying multimodal biomolecular interactions within a single generative framework, ODesign moves toward a general-purpose molecular world model capable of programmable design.
