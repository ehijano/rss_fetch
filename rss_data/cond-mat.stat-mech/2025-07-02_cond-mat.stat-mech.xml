      <title>The Ising model and random fields of scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random fields of scales result when the class of musical scales is thought as a set of sites, and a site can be in one of two possible states (or spins): On or Off. We present a flexible simulated annealing model that produces generic configurations arising from equilibrium states (or Gibbs measures) associated to hamiltonian energy functions defined in terms of musical interactions with parameters that can be manipulated to customize properties of the scales. The starting point is to think of the set of scales as the combinatorial class of integer compositions and the final result is an effective thermodynamic search engine implemented in an open access application for the 12-TET tuning system: Scaletor.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of quantum Ising chains in the thermodynamic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium Kibble-Zurek (KZ) dynamics in quantum Ising chains in a transverse field, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h(t)=t/t_s$ ($t_s$ is the time scale of the protocol), across their first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) at $h=0$. The KZ protocol starts at time $t_i&lt;0$ from the negatively magnetized ground state for $h_i = t_i/t_s&lt;0$. Then, the system evolves unitarily up to a time $t_f &gt; 0$, such that the magnetization of the state at time $t_f$ is positive. In finite-size systems, the KZ dynamics develops out-of-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) behaviors. Their scaling variables depend either exponentially or with a power law on the size, depending on the boundary conditions (BC). The OFSS functions can be computed in effective models restricted to appropriate low-energy (magnetized and/or kink) states. The KZ scaling behavior drastically changes in the thermodynamic limit (TL), defined as the infinite-size limit keeping $t$ and $t_s$ fixed, which appears substantially unrelated with the OFSS regime, because it involves higher-energy multi-kink states, which are irrelevant in the OFSS limit. The numerical analyses of the KZ dynamics in the TL show the emergence of a quantum spinodal-like scaling behavior at the FOQTs for all considered BC, which is independent of the BC. The longitudinal magnetization changes sign at $h(t)=h*&gt;0$, where $h*$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, as $h*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. Moreover, in the large-$t_s$ limit, the time-dependence of the magnetization is described by a universal function of $\Omega = t/\tau_s$, with $\tau_s = t_s/\ln t_s$.</description>

      <title>Creep failure in heterogeneous materials from the barrier landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stressed under a constant load, materials creep with a final acceleration of deformation and for any given applied stress and material, the creep failure time can strongly vary. We investigate creep on sheets of paper and confront the statistics with a simple fiber bundle model of creep failure in a disordered landscape. In the experiments, acoustic emission event times $t_j$ were recorded, and both this data and simulation event series reveal sample-dependent history effects with log-normal statistics and non-Markovian behavior. This leads to a relationship between $t_j$ and the failure time $t_f$ with a power law relationship, evolving with time. These effects and the predictability result from how the energy gap distribution develops during creep.</description>

      <title>Scaling, Fractal Dynamics and Critical Exponents{: Application} in a non-integer dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving beyond simple associations, researchers need tools to quantify how variables influence each other in space and time. Correlation functions provide a mathematical framework for characterizing these essential dependencies, revealing insights into causality, structure, and hidden patterns within complex systems. In physical systems with many degrees of freedom, such as gases, liquids, and solids, a statistical analysis of these correlations is essential. For a field $\Psi(\vec{x},t)$ that depends on spatial position $\vec{x}$ and time $t$, it is often necessary to understand the correlation with itself at another position and time $\Psi(\vec{x}_0,t_0)$. This specific function is called the autocorrelation function. In this context, the autocorrelation function for order--parameter fluctuations, introduced by Fisher, provides an important mathematical framework for understanding the second-order phase transition at equilibrium. However, his analysis is restricted to a Euclidean space of dimension $d$, and an exponent $\eta$ is introduced to correct the spatial behavior of the correlation function at $T=T_c$. In recent work, Lima et al demonstrated that at $T_c$ a fractal analysis is necessary for a complete description of the correlation function. In this study, we investigate the fundamental physics and mathematics underlying phase transitions. In particular, we show that the application of modern fractional differentials allows us to write down an equation for the correlation function that recovers the correct exponents below the upper critical dimension. We obtain the exact expression for the Fisher exponent $\eta$. Furthermore, we examine the Rushbrooke scaling relation, which has been questioned in certain magnetic systems, and, drawing on results from the Ising model, we confirm that both our relations and the Rushbrooke scaling law hold even when $d$ is not an integer.</description>

      <title>How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11869v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Preparation of cat states in many-body eigenbasis via non-local measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered dissipation offers a promising route to prepare correlated quantum many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access using purely unitary protocols. However, creating superpositions of multiple many-body eigenstates with tunable properties remains a major challenge. We propose to periodically interrupt the many-body evolution by precisely removing a given many-body Fock state through a non-local post-selected measurement protocol. Upon tuning the measurement period, we show that a dark state manifold survives the removal, allowing us to filter the system and generate a coherent superposition within this manifold at long times. As a testbed, we study a non-integrable spin-1 XY chain featuring a solvable family of eigenstates that can differ macroscopically in quasi-particle excitations. Our protocol generates tunable superpositions of these eigenstates, including the spin-1 Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a generalized variant with tunable spatiotemporal order. Under perturbations, the system exhibits an exceptionally long-lived metastable regime where the engineered superpositions remain robust. Our work provides new insight into quantum state preparation via non-local measurements using tools available in current quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Complete Boundary Phase Diagram of the Spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ Chain with Boundary Fields in the Anti-Ferromagnetic Gapped Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the spin $\frac{1}{2}$ XXZ chain with diagonal boundary fields and solve it exactly using Bethe ansatz in the gapped anti-ferromagnetic regime and obtain the complete phase boundary diagram. Depending on the values of the boundary fields, the system exhibits several phases which can be categorized based on the ground state exhibited by the system and also based on the number of bound states localized at the boundaries. We show that the Hilbert space is comprised of a certain number of towers whose number depends on the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. The system undergoes boundary phase transitions when boundary fields are varied across certain critical values. There exist two types of phase transitions. In the first type the ground state of the system undergoes a change. In the second type, named the `Eigenstate phase transition', the number of towers of the Hilbert space changes, which is again associated with the change in the number of boundary bound states exhibited by the system. We use the DMRG and exact diagonalization techniques to probe the signature of the Eigenstate phase transition and the ground state phase transition by analyzing the spin profiles in each eigenstate.</description>

      <title>Conformational properties of strictly two-dimensional equilibrium polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional monodisperse linear polymer chains are known to adopt for sufficiently large chain lengths $N$ and surface fractions $\phi$ compact configurations with fractal perimeters. We show here by means of Monte Carlo simulations of reversibly connected hard disks (without branching, ring formation and chain intersection) that polydisperse self-assembled equilibrium polymers with a finite scission energy $E$ are characterized by the same universal exponents as their monodisperse peers. Consistently with a Flory-Huggins mean-field approximation, the polydispersity is characterized by a Schulz-Zimm distribution with a susceptibility exponent $\gamma=19/16$ for all not dilute systems and the average chain length $&lt;N&gt; \propto \exp(\delta E) \phi^{\alpha}$ thus increases with an exponent $\delta = 16/35$. Moreover, it is shown that $\alpha=3/5$ for semidilute solutions and $\alpha \approx 1$ for larger densities. The intermolecular form factor $F(q)$ reveals for sufficiently large $&lt;N&gt;$ a generalized Porod scattering with $F(q) \propto 1/q^{11/4}$ for intermediate wavenumbers $q$ consistently with a fractal perimeter dimension $d_s=5/4$.</description>

      <title>Structural Order Drives Diffusion in a Granular Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how structural ordering, i.e. crystallization, affects the flow of bidisperse granular materials in a quasi-two-dimensional silo. By systematically varying the mass fraction of two particle sizes, we finely tune the degree of local order. Using high-speed imaging and kinematic modeling, we show that crystallization significantly enhances the diffusion length $b$, a key parameter controlling the velocity profiles within the flowing medium. We reveal a strong correlation between $b$ and the hexatic order parameter $\left&lt;|\psi_6|\right&gt;_t$, highlighting the role of local structural organization in governing macroscopic flow behavior. Furthermore, we demonstrate that pressure gradients within the silo promote the stabilization of orientational order even in the absence of crystallization, thus intrinsically increasing $b$ with height. These findings establish a direct link between microstructural order, pressure, and transport properties in granular silo flows.</description>

      <title>A fast algorithm for 2D Rigidity Percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigidity Percolation is a crucial framework for describing rigidity transitions in amorphous systems. We present a new, efficient algorithm to study central-force Rigidity Percolation in two dimensions. This algorithm combines the Pebble Game algorithm, the Newman-Ziff approach to Connectivity Percolation, as well as novel rigorous results in rigidity theory, to exactly identify rigid clusters over the full bond concentration range, in a time that scales as $N^{1.02}$ for a system of $N$ nodes. Besides opening the way to accurate numerical studies of Rigidity Percolation, our work provides new insights on specific cluster merging mechanisms that distinguish it from the standard Connectivity Percolation problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum simulators permit unitary evolution interspersed with locally resolved mid-circuit measurements. This paves the way for the observation of large-scale space-time structures in quantum trajectories and opens a window for the \emph{in situ} analysis of complex dynamical processes. We demonstrate this idea using a paradigmatic dissipative spin model, which can be implemented, e.g., on Rydberg quantum simulators. Here, already the trajectories of individual experimental runs reveal surprisingly complex statistical phenomena. In particular, we exploit free-energy functionals for trajectory ensembles to identify dynamical features reminiscent of hydrophobic behavior observed near the liquid-vapor transition in the presence of solutes in water. We show that these phenomena are observable in experiments and discuss the impact of common imperfections, such as readout errors and disordered interactions.</description>

      <title>Charge pumps, pivot Hamiltonians and symmetry-protected topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalised charge pumps are topological obstructions to trivialising loops in the space of symmetric gapped Hamiltonians. We show that given mild conditions on such pumps, the associated loop has high-symmetry points which must be in distinct symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. To further elucidate the connection between pumps and SPTs, we focus on closed paths, `pivot loops', defined by two Hamiltonians, where the first is unitarily evolved by the second `pivot' Hamiltonian. While such pivot loops have been studied as entanglers for SPTs, here we explore their connection to pumps. We construct families of pivot loops which pump charge for various symmetry groups, often leading to SPT phases -- including dipole SPTs. Intriguingly, we find examples where non-trivial pumps do not lead to genuine SPTs but still entangle representation-SPTs (RSPTs). We use the anomaly associated to the non-trivial pump to explain the a priori `unnecessary' criticality between these RSPTs. We also find that particularly nice pivot families form circles in Hamiltonian space, which we show is equivalent to the Hamiltonians satisfying the Dolan-Grady relation -- known from the study of integrable models. This additional structure allows us to derive more powerful constraints on the phase diagram. Natural examples of such circular loops arise from pivoting with the Onsager-integrable chiral clock models, containing the aforementioned RSPT example. In fact, we show that these Onsager pivots underlie general group cohomology-based pumps in one spatial dimension. Finally, we recast the above in the language of equivariant families of Hamiltonians and relate the invariants of the pump to the candidate SPTs. We also highlight how certain SPTs arise in cases where the equivariant family is labelled by spaces that are not manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for engineering active quantum matter that involves mimicking the role of self-propulsion through an external trapping potential that is moving along imposed trajectories traced by classical active dynamics. This approach in the presence of dissipation, not only recovers essential dynamical behavior of classical activity, including the ballistic to diffusive cross-over of its mean-square displacement, but also reveals additional features of activity that are of quantum origin. These quantum-active features are revealed in non-dissipative systems, and manifest as novel exponents of the mean-square displacement at short timescales.</description>

Abstract: In a previous work [A simplified Parisi Ansatz, Franchini, S., Commun. Theor. Phys., 73, 055601 (2021)] we introduced a simple method to compute the Random Overlap Structure of Aizenmann, Simm and Stars and the full RSB Parisi formula for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model without using replica theory. The method consists in partitioning the system into smaller sub-systems that we call layers, and iterate the Bayes rule. A central ansatz in our derivation was that these layers could be approximated by Random Energy Models of the Derrida type. In this paper we analyze the properties of the interface in detail, and show the equivalence with the Random Energy Model at any temperature.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Space of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living systems are usually maintained out of equilibrium and consume energy to sustain emergent organized states. Their robust functioning rely on a set of interconnected chemical reaction networks (CRN) in which the external energy supply often comes from fluxes that can keep some species concentrations constant. Hence, to capture the emergent complexity of living systems and the role of their non-equilibrium nature, it is fundamental to uncover constraints and properties of the CRNs underpinning their functions. In particular, while kinetics plays a key role in shaping detailed dynamical phenomena, the range of operations of these underlying CRNs is fundamentally constrained by thermodynamics. Here, we derive universal thermodynamic upper and lower bounds for species concentrations in a generic CRN operating within a given energy budget. The resulting region determines the thermodynamic space of the CRN, a concept we introduce in this work that determines the range of accessible concentrations for the chemical species involved at a given value of non-equilibrium driving. We obtain similar bounds for the affinities, shedding light on how global thermodynamic properties, such as the total dissipation, can limit local non-equilibrium quantities. We illustrate our results in various paradigmatic examples, the Schlogl model for bistability, a minimal self-assembly process, a paradigmatic system exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking, and a multi-molecular model for reaction-diffusion patterns, demonstrating how the onset of complex behaviors is intimately tangled with the presence of non-equilibrium conditions. By providing a general tool for analyzing CRNs, the presented framework constitutes a stepping stone to deepen our ability to predict complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena and design artificial chemical systems, starting from the sole knowledge of the underlying thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Effect of quenched heterogeneity on creep lifetimes of disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of describing creep in heterogeneous materials by an effective temperature by considering more realistic (and complex) non-mean-field elastic redistribution kernels. We show first, from theoretical considerations, that, if elastic stress redistribution and memory effects are neglected, the average creep failure time follows an Arrhenius expression with an effective temperature explicitly increasing with the quenched heterogeneity. Using a thermally activated progressive damage model of compressive failure, we show that this holds true when taking into account elastic interactions and memory effects, however with an effective temperature $T_{eff}$ depending as well on the nature of the (non-democratic) elastic interaction kernel. We observe that the variability of creep lifetimes, for given external conditions of load and temperature, is roughly proportional to the mean lifetime, therefore depends as well on $T$, on quenched heterogeneity, and the elastic kernel. Finally, we discuss the implications of this effective temperature effect on the interpretation of macroscopic creep tests to estimate an activation volume at the microscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09328v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy-regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</description>

      <title>Diffusion and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and heat dissipation in marginally stable linear time-delayed Langevin systems (i.e., the parameters of the system lie on the boundary of the stability conditions). We analytically examine two distinct critical classes: (i) diffusive criticality, where the variance grows linearly with suppressed/enhanced diffusion due to time-delayed forces, and (ii) oscillatory criticality, exhibiting oscillations with diffusing amplitude. Crucially, we derive asymptotic heat dissipation rates, revealing fundamentally different thermodynamic signatures: a constant dissipation rate for diffusive criticality and linear divergence accompanied by oscillations for oscillatory criticality. These results highlight how spectral properties of dynamics govern nonequilibrium thermodynamics in time-delayed systems. Our work bridges dynamics and stochastic thermodynamics at stability boundaries for linear systems, providing foundational insights for extending thermodynamic frameworks to nonlinear time-delayed stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Activation of thermal states by coherently controlled thermalization processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.04034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.04034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermalization processes degrade the states of any working medium, turning any initial state into a passive state from which no work can be extracted. Recently, it has been shown that this degradation can be avoided if two identical thermalization processes take place in coherently controlled order, in a scenario known as the quantum SWITCH. In some situations, control over the order even enables work extraction when the medium was initially in a passive state. This activation phenomenon, however, is subject to a limitation: to extract non-zero work, the initial temperature of the medium should be less than half of the temperature of the reservoirs. Here we analyze this limitation, showing that it still holds true even when the medium interacts with $N\ge 2$ reservoirs in a coherently-controlled order. Then, we show that the limitation can be lifted when the medium and the control systems are initially correlated. In particular, when the medium and control are entangled, work extraction becomes possible for every initial value of the local temperature of the medium.</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Levine and Silvestri that the driven-dissipative activated random walk model on an interval drives itself directly to and then sustains a critical density. This marks the first rigorous confirmation of a sandpile model behaving as in Bak, Tang, and Wiesenfeld's original vision of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Topological data analysis of the deconfinement transition in SU(3) lattice gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the confining and deconfining phases of pure $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ lattice gauge theory with topological data analysis. This provides unique insights into long range correlations of field configurations across the confinement-deconfinement transition. Specifically, we analyze non-trivial structures in electric and magnetic field energy densities as well as Polyakov loop traces and a Polyakov loop-based variant of the topological density. The Betti curves for filtrations based on the electric and magnetic field energy densities reveal signals of electromagnetic dualities. These dualities can be associated with an interchange in the roles of local lumps of electric and magnetic energy densities around the phase transition. Moreover, we show that plaquette susceptibilities can manifest in the geometric features captured by the Betti curves. We also compare these findings against earlier results for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and elaborate on the significant differences. Our results demonstrate that topological data analysis can identify clear differences between phase transitions of first and second order for non-Abelian lattice gauge theories and provides unprecedented insights into the relevant structures in their vicinity.</description>

      <title>A Finite-Time Quantum Otto Engine subject to Control Noise and Enhancement Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of any quantum technology comes a need for precise control of quantum systems. Here, we evaluate the impact of control noise on a quantum Otto cycle. Whilst it is postulated that noiseless quantum engines can approach maximal Otto efficiency in finite times, the existence of white noise on the controls is shown to negatively affect average engine performance. Two methods of quantum enhancement, counterdiabatic driving and quantum lubrication, are implemented and found to improve the performance of the noisy cycle only in specified parameter regimes. To gain insight into performance fluctuations, projective energy measurements are used to construct a noise-averaged probability distribution without assuming full thermalisation or adiabaticity. From this, the variances in thermodynamic currents are observed to increase as average power and efficiency improve, and are also shown to be consistent with known bounds from thermodynamic uncertainty relations. Lastly, by comparing the average functioning of the unmonitored engine to a projectively-measured engine cycle, the role of coherence in work extraction for this quantum engine model is investigated.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions due to Euclidean gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Ising-like models to probe the thermal nature of Euclidean spacetime backgrounds. We determine which properties of the background -- curvature, the presence of a horizon, or temperature -- play a role in phase transitions. The geometries we use are Euclidean Schwarzschild, Rindler, extremal Reissner-N\"{o}rdstrom (ERN), Anti deSitter (AdS), and deSitter (dS). Among these, Rindler is flat, AdS does not have a horizon, and both AdS and ERN have zero temperatures. We find second-order phase transitions as the metric parameter is varied in all cases except for Rindler. Specifically, we find that the transition from order to disorder occurs as the curvature -- or Euclidean gravity -- increases. This supports our conjecture that Euclidean gravity is an essential ingredient for these phase transitions, as opposed to the presence of a horizon or temperature. Separately, since the selected geometries are position-dependent, the Ising-like models constructed on them are inhomogeneous, whereby they generalize the standard Ising model. We find that a consequence of this is that criticality does not correspond to maximal correlation lengths and scale invariance.</description>

      <title>Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.</description>

      <title>Plastic tensor networks for interpretable generative modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed as an alternative paradigm for generative modeling. The NATT scheme, by construction, automatically searches for a tree structure that best fits a given discrete dataset whose features serve as inputs, and has the advantage that it is interpretable as a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences. In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these tensor tree generative models including their information content and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty in AI-driven Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14594v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the study of complex systems, evaluating physical observables often requires sampling representative configurations via Monte Carlo techniques. These methods rely on repeated evaluations of the system's energy and force fields, which can become computationally expensive. To accelerate these simulations, deep learning models are increasingly employed as surrogate functions to approximate the energy landscape or force fields. However, such models introduce epistemic uncertainty in their predictions, which may propagate through the sampling process and affect the system's macroscopic behavior. In our work, we present the Penalty Ensemble Method (PEM) to quantify epistemic uncertainty and mitigate its impact on Monte Carlo sampling. Our approach introduces an uncertainty-aware modification of the Metropolis acceptance rule, which increases the rejection probability in regions of high uncertainty, thereby enhancing the reliability of the simulation outcomes.</description>
