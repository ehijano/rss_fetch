      <title>Operator Analysis of MACD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a rigorous functional-analytic framework for the MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) indicator, a classical tool in technical analysis. We show that MACD, commonly defined as the difference between two moving averages, can be precisely interpreted as a phase-corrected, smoothed derivative operator. By analyzing nested and recursive moving averages, we establish that MACD is structurally equivalent to a band-pass filter and derive exact formulas expressing it as a finite difference of delayed and doubly averaged signals. We prove new operator identities demonstrating that MACD corresponds to the derivative of a phase-centered, double-smoothed average, appropriately delayed to correct for asymmetries introduced by causal averaging. This characterization unifies MACD with concepts from harmonic analysis and operator theory, providing a principled basis for understanding its role in signal detection, filtering, and trend analysis. The framework naturally generalizes to recursive decompositions, culminating in an expansion that expresses MACD as a weighted sum of delayed, smoothed derivatives, thereby revealing the true analytical structure underlying this widely used yet traditionally heuristic indicator.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov equations for stochastic Volterra processes with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We associate backward and forward Kolmogorov equations to a class of fully nonlinear Stochastic Volterra Equations (SVEs) with convolution kernels $K$ that are singular at the origin. Working on a carefully chosen Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_1$, we rigorously establish a link between solutions of SVEs and Markovian mild solutions of a Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) of transport-type. Then, we obtain two novel It\^o formulae for functionals of mild solutions and, as a byproduct, show that their laws solve corresponding Fokker-Planck equations. Finally, we introduce a natural notion of "singular" directional derivatives along $K$ and prove that (conditional) expectations of SVE solutions can be expressed in terms of the unique solution to a backward Kolmogorov equation on $\mathcal{H}_1$. Our analysis relies on stochastic calculus in Hilbert spaces, the reproducing kernel property of the state space $\mathcal{H}_1,$ as well as crucial invariance and smoothing properties that are specific to the SPDEs of interest. In the special case of singular power-law kernels, our conditions guarantee well-posedness of the backward equation either for all values of the Hurst parameter $H,$ when the noise is additive, or for all $H&gt;1/4$ when the noise is multiplicative.</description>

      <title>General CoVaR Based on Entropy Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general CoVaR framework that extends the traditional CoVaR by incorporating diverse expert views and information, such as asset moment characteristics, quantile insights, and perspectives on the relative loss distribution between two assets. To integrate these expert views effectively while minimizing deviations from the prior distribution, we employ the entropy pooling method to derive the posterior distribution, which in turn enables us to compute the general CoVaR. Assuming bivariate normal distributions, we derive its analytical expressions under various perspectives. Sensitivity analysis reveals that CoVaR exhibits a linear relationship with both the expectations of the variables in the views and the differences in expectations between them. In contrast, CoVaR shows nonlinear dependencies with respect to the variance, quantiles, and correlation within these views.
  Empirical analysis of the US banking system during the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes demonstrates the effectiveness of the general CoVaR when expert views are appropriately specified. Furthermore, we extend this framework to the general $\Delta$CoVaR, which allows for the assessment of risk spillover effects from various perspectives.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Climate change is a major threat to the future of humanity, and its impacts are being intensified by excess man-made greenhouse gas emissions. One method governments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with emission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess emissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing and capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be submitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they can be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent Nash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an NP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique Nash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate not only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to climate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings emitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Group Survival Probability under Contagion in Microlending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of micro-finance, a group of individuals undertake business projects that may interfere with one another. A contagious default happens if one person's project failure leads to the default of another group member. In this paper, we apply a probabilistic approach to analyze the impact of such contagion among investment group members. Firstly, a general formula is provided to compute the group survival probability with the presence of contagion effect. Then, special cases of this probability model are examined in detail. In particular, we show that if the investment group is homogeneous, defined in the paper, then including more members into the group will eventually lead to default with probability 1. This differs from the non-contagious scenario, where the default probability decreases monotonically with respect to the group size. Afterwards, we provide an upper bound of the optimal group size under the homogeneous setup; so, one can run a linear search within finite time to locate this optimizer.</description>
