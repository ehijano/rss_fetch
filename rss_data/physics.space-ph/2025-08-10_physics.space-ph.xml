      <title>Modeling Optical Key Distribution over a Satellite-to-Ground Link Under Weak Atmospheric Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the secret key capacity of intensity modulation/direct detection optical key distribution (IM/DD OKD) for a free-space optical (FSO) link between a low-Earth orbit satellite and an optical ground station. Focusing on downlink communication, we account for atmospheric turbulence, which causes random variations in the transmittance of the FSO channel. We implement an atmospheric channel model that accounts for absorption and scattering, geometric losses, pointing errors, and intensity fluctuations. The secret key capacity is quantified under different noise scenarios and reconciliation code efficiencies, assuming a hard decoding scheme. The performance of the IM/DD OKD protocol is compared under direct and reverse reconciliation regimes. Additionally, we examine the impact of weak and strong wind on the strength of atmospheric turbulence, leading to different results of the secret key capacity. Furthermore, we analyze the characteristics of error distributions that arise from protocol optimization. Our results provide insights into optimizing IM/DD OKD protocols for varying atmospheric conditions.</description>

      <title>On the estimation of solar wind velocity under varying solar activity conditions using Akatsuki measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of solar wind dynamics based on Doppler spectral width measurements of X-band radio signals from the Japanese Akatsuki spacecraft. The dataset includes two solar conjunction occultation experiments conducted in 2016 and 2022, capturing the transition from the descending phase of Solar Cycle 24, a period of low solar activity, to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, which exhibited moderate to intense activity. Our study demonstrates the utility of this technique for estimating both slow and fast solar wind velocities across different phases of solar activity. A key focus is the 2022 experiment, which probed the solar corona near coronal holes at heliocentric distances ranging from 1.4 to 10 $R_\odot$. We also investigate the impact of electron density estimates on the accuracy of solar wind speed determinations, underscoring the need for improved electron density modeling to enhance the robustness of such measurements.</description>

      <title>Two Types of $1/f$ Range in Solar Wind Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $1/f$ noise is a ubiquitous phenomenon in natural systems. Since the advent of space exploration, the $1/f$ range has been consistently observed in \textit{in situ} solar wind measurements throughout the heliosphere, sparking decades of debate regarding its origin. Recent Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations near the Alfv\'en surface have revealed a systematic absence of the $1/f$ range in pristine solar wind, providing a unique opportunity to investigate its origin in solar wind turbulence. Despite numerous observations of the $1/f$ range at varying frequencies, no study has systematically examined its properties across different solar wind conditions. Here, we identify two distinct types of $1/f$ ranges in solar wind turbulence: the fast/Alfv\'enic wind type and the slow/mixed wind type. The fast/Alfv\'enic type appears to be an intrinsic feature of Alfv\'enic turbulence, while the slow/mixed type resembles classical flicker noise. For the fast/Alfv\'enic type, we find a near-perfect WKB evolution of the frequency-averaged fluctuation amplitude and an intriguing migration pattern in frequency space. For the slow/mixed type, we examine the solar cycle dependence of the $1/f$ noise using the OMNI-LRO dataset spanning solar cycles 22 to 25. We also analyze the autocorrelation function of the magnetic field vectors and identify a clear relationship between the $1/f$ range and the decline in correlation, as well as unexpected resonance peaks in the autocorrelation function.</description>
