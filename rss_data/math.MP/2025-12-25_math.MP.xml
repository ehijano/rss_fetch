      <title>Propagation Estimates for the Boson Star Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the boson star equation with a general two-body interaction potential $w$ and initial data $\psi_0$ in a Sobolev space. Under general assumptions on $w$, namely that $w$ decomposes as a sum of a finite, signed measure and an essentially bounded function, we prove that the (local in time) solution cannot propagate faster than the speed of light, up to a sharp exponentially small remainder term. If $w$ is short-range and $\psi_0$ is regular and small enough, we prove in addition asymptotic phase-space propagation estimates and minimal velocity estimates for the (global in time) solution, depending on the momentum of the scattering state associated to $\psi_0$.</description>

      <title>Renormalized tropical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce tropical scalar field theory as a model for renormalizable quantum field theory, and examine in detail the case of quartic self-interaction and internal $O(N)$ symmetry. This model arises in a formally zero-dimensional limit of critical long-range models, but nevertheless its Feynman integrals exhibit strong numerical correlations with the ordinary 4-dimensional theory. The tropical theory retains the full complexity of renormalization with nested and overlapping vertex subdivergences and infinitely many primitive graphs.
  We compute the perturbation series of the tropical renormalization group functions exactly to 400 loops and study their asymptotic growth. In the minimal subtraction scheme, we find only an arithmetic sequence of singularities on the negative real axis in the Borel plane. These singularities are confluent and imply that the large-order perturbative asymptotics contain logarithmic and fractional power corrections. The absence of any further singularities suggests these series are Borel summable. In contrast, in a kinematic subtraction scheme, the singularity structure on the negative axis changes, and we find additional singularities on the positive real axis.</description>

      <title>Limits of equi-affine equi-distant loci of planar convex domains with two non-parallel asymptotes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we discuss the novel approach to define equi-affine invariants starting from tropical geometry, where one averages over the space of tropical structures of fixed co-volume. Applied to the tropical distance series, this gives a family of equi-affine invariant functions associated with convex domains which are expected to satisfy a number of remarkable properties. The present note contains a conjecture about the limit structure of corresponding level sets in the compact case, as well as the proof of an analogue of this conjecture for unbounded domains with two non-parallel asymptotes. In addition, we carry out an explicit computation for the arithmetic mean value at center of the unit disk.</description>

      <title>Hamilton-Jacobi as model reduction, extension to Newtonian particle mechanics, and a wave mechanical curiosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics is approached as a model reduction of conservative particle mechanics where the velocity degrees-of-freedom are eliminated. This viewpoint allows an extension of the association of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation from conservative systems to general Newtonian particle systems involving non-conservative forces, including dissipative ones. A geometric optics approximation leads to a dissipative Schr\"odinger equation, with the expected limiting form when the associated classical force system involves conservative forces.</description>

      <title>On Rayleigh scattering in the massless Nelson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic completeness of Rayleigh scattering in models of atoms and molecules of non-relativistic QED is expected, but for a proof we still lack sufficient control on the number of emitted soft photons. So far, this obstacle has only been overcome for the spin-boson model. In a general class of models asymptotic completeness holds provided the expectation value of the photon number $N$ remains bounded uniformly in time. This has been established by Faupin and Sigal. We review and simplify their work, and, more importantly, we replace the bound on $N$ by a weaker assumption on the distribution of $N$ that is both necessary and sufficient for asymptotic completeness.</description>

      <title>The space spinor formalism and estimates for spinor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how the space spinor formalism for 2-component spinors can be used to construct estimates for spinor fields satisfying first order equations. We discuss the connection of the approach presented in this article with other strategies for the construction of estimates. In addition, we recast several concepts related to the notion of hyperbolicity in the context of spinor equations. The approach described in this article can be regarded as an adaptation to first order equations of the method of positive commutators for second order hyperbolic equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Universality in Composite Systems: A Trichotomy of Clifford Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficient classical simulation of Clifford circuits constitutes a fundamental barrier to quantum advantage, typically overcome by injecting explicit non-Clifford "magic" resources. We demonstrate that for high-dimensional quantum systems (qudits), the resources required to break this barrier are strictly governed by the number-theoretic structure of the Hilbert space dimension $d$. By analyzing the adjoint action of the Clifford group, we establish a classification of single-qudit universality as a trichotomy. (I) For prime dimensions, the Clifford group is a maximal finite subgroup, and universality is robustly achieved by any non-Clifford gate. (II) For prime-power dimensions, the group structure fragments, requiring tailored diagonal non-Clifford gates to restore irreducibility. (III) Most notably, for composite dimensions with coprime factors, we demonstrate that standard entangling operations alone -- specifically, generalized intra-qudit CNOT gates -- generate the necessary non-Clifford resources to guarantee a dense subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(d)$ without explicit diagonal magic injection. Our proofs rely on a new geometric criterion establishing that a subgroup with irreducible adjoint action is infinite if it contains a non-scalar element with projective distance strictly less than $1/2$ from the identity. These results establish that "coprime architectures" -- hybrid registers combining subsystems with coprime dimensions -- can sustain universal computation using only classical entangling operations, rendering the explicit injection of magic resources algebraically unnecessary.</description>

      <title>Geometric Approach to Light Rings in Axially Symmetric Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circular photon orbits have become an attractive topic in recent years. They play extremely important roles in black hole shadows, gravitational lensings, quasi-normal modes, and spacetime topological properties. The development of analytical methods for these circular orbits has also drawn extensive attention. In our recent work, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.L021501}{Phys. Rev. D \textbf{106}, L021501 (2022)}, a geometric approach to circular photon orbits was proposed for spherically symmetric spacetimes. In the present study, we give an extension of this geometric approach from spherically symmetric spacetimes to axially symmetric rotational spacetimes. In such a geometric approach, light rings in the equatorial plane are determined through the intrinsic curvatures in the optical geometry of Lorentz spacetime, which gives rise to a Randers-Finsler geometry for axially symmetric spacetimes. Specifically, light rings can be precisely determined by the condition of vanishing geodesic curvature, and the stability of light rings is classified through the intrinsic flag curvature in Randers-Finsler optical geometry. This geometric approach presented in this work is generally applicable to any stationary and axially symmetric spacetime, without imposing any restriction on the spacetime metric forms. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous demonstration to show that our geometric approach yields completely equivalent results with those derived from the conventional approach (based on the effective potential of photons).</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis of Symmetry-Protected Bound States in the Continuum in Waveguide Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a rigorous mathematical analysis for symmetry-based Bound States in the Continuum (BICs) in optical waveguide arrays. Different from existing research, we consider a finite system of horizontally and equidistantly aligned waveguides and transform the wave propagation problem into Nonorthogonal Coupled-Mode Equations (NCME), rather than adopting the tight-binding approximation or orthogonal coupled-mode equations. We derive the exact expressions of the overlap integrals and coupling coefficients by utilizing the addition theorems of Bessel functions. We then generalize the discussion to an infinite waveguide array and rigorously characterize the dispersion relation and continuum with the help of theories in harmonic analysis. In the second part of the paper, we give a strict proof of the existence of BICs in the aforementioned waveguide system with two additional identical vertical waveguides aligned symmetrically above and below the horizontal waveguide array. We further numerically demonstrate the transition from a perfect BIC to a leaky mode by introducing a symmetry-breaking refractive index perturbation and quantitatively analyze the resulting radiation losses. This work gives a comprehensive study of symmetry-protected BICs and provides an efficient and precise computational model for designing such BICs devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define the appropriate homological setting to study deformation theory of complete locally convex (curved) dg-algebras based on Positselski's contraderived categories. We define the corresponding Hochschild complex controlling deformations and prove formality theorems for the Fr\'echet algebras of smooth functions on a manifold, the de Rham algebra and for the Dolbeault algebra of a complex manifold. In the latter case, the Hochschild cohomology is equivalent to Kontsevich's extended deformation complex, the Hochschild cohomology of the derived category in case $X$ is a smooth projective variety and to Gualtieri's deformation complex of $X$ viewed as generalized complex manifold. We also compute the continuous Hochschild cohomology for various categories of matrix factorisations.</description>

      <title>On the triplicity among infinite products, infinite series, and continued fractions; and its applications to divergent series</title>

Abstract: Many identities written by $P=S=C$ are obtained, where $P$ infinite products, $S$ infinite series, and $C$ continued fractions. Such equality is called {\it triplicity}, and it can be used to compute the values of infinite series. It is applied even to obtain sums of divergent series. Many examples of such infinite series are shown, including $1-2+2^3-2^6+\cdots$, which is in Entry 7 of Gauss's diary and its value $0.4275251302\cdots$ is here obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the inhomogeneous kinetic Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) equation, a nonlinear transport equation describing the evolution of phonon density distributions with four-phonon interactions. The equation combines free transport in physical space with a nonlinear collision operator acting in momentum space and exhibiting structural degeneracies. We develop a functional framework that captures the interplay between spatial transport and the degeneracies arising in the collision operator. A key ingredient of the analysis is a dispersive estimate for the transport flow, which quantifies decay effects generated by spatial propagation. Using this dispersive mechanism, we obtain improved bounds for the nonlinear collision operator and show that small solutions near the vacuum can be propagated on time scales significantly longer than those dictated by conservation laws alone. In particular, dispersion allows one to extend the classical quadratic lifespan to a quartic time scale.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a first boundary value problem for a second-order partial differential equation involving the Prabhakar fractional derivative in time. Using structural properties of the Prabhakar kernel and generalized Mittag-Leffler functions, we reduce the problem to a Volterra type integral equation. This reduction enables the explicit construction of the corresponding Green's function. Based on the obtained Green's function, we derive a closed-form integral representation of the solution and prove its existence and uniqueness. The results extend classical Green-function techniques to a wider class of fractional operators and provide analytical tools for further study of boundary and inverse problems associated with Prabhakar-type fractional differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the direct approach to continua in reduced space dimensions, a thin shell is described as a mathematical surface in three-dimensional space. An exploratory kinematic study of such surfaces could be very valuable, especially if conducted with no use of coordinates. Three energy contents have been identified in a thin shell, which refer to three independent deformation modes: stretching, drilling, and bending. We analyze the consequences for the three energy contents produced by metric restrictions imposed on the admissible deformations. Would the latter stem from physical constraints, the elastic response of a shell could be hindered in ways that might not be readily expected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in constructing asymptotically flat vacuum initial data sets in General Relativity via the conformal method, certain asymptotic structures may be prescribed a priori through the specified seed data, including the ADM momentum components, the leading- and next-to-leading-order decay rates, and the anisotropy in the metric's mass term, yielding a recipe to construct initial data sets with desired asymptotics. We numerically construct a simple explicit example of an initial data set, with stronger asymptotics than have been obtained in previous work, such that the evolution of this initial data set does not exhibit the conjectured antipodal symmetry between future and past null infinity.</description>

      <title>Turing instability and 2-D pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems derived from kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Turing instability and pattern formation in two-dimensional domains for two reaction-diffusion models, obtained as diffusive limits of kinetic equations for mixtures of monatomic and polyatomic gases. The first model is of Brusselator type, which, compared with the classical formulation, presents an additional parameter whose role in stability and pattern formation is discussed. In the second framework, the system exhibits standard nonlinear diffusion terms typical of predator-prey models, but differs in reactive terms. In both cases, the kinetic-based approach proves effective in relating macroscopic parameters, often set empirically, to microscopic interaction mechanisms, thereby rigorously identifying admissible parameter ranges for the physical description. Furthermore, weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulations extend previously known one-dimensional results and reveal a wider scenario of spatial structures, including spots, stripes, and hexagonal arrays, that better reflect the richness observed in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Formalism for Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a string field Hamiltonian formalism that associates a class of spectral curves and provides their quantization through the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. As illustrative examples, we present Hamiltonians for the $(2,2m-1)$ minimal discrete and continuum dynamical triangulation (DT) models, the supersymmetric analogue of minimal continuum DT models, the Penner model, and 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theories in the self-dual $\Omega$-background.</description>

      <title>Gauged compact $Q$-balls and $Q$-shells in a multi-component $CP^N$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13076v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains $Q$-balls and $Q$-shells, which are nontopological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, $Q$-shells can shelter another compact $Q$-ball or $Q$-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multicompacton formations is affected by electric charge, with a focus on structures with nonzero or zero total net charge.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Supersonic flows for the steady Euler-Poisson system in divergent nozzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the unique existence of an axisymmetric supersonic solution with nonzero vorticity and nonzero angular momentum density for the steady Euler-Poisson system in three-dimensional divergent nozzles when prescribing the velocity, strength of electric field, and the entropy at the entrance. We first reformulate the problem via the method of the Helmholtz decomposition for three-dimensional axisymmetric flows and obtain a solution to the reformulated problem by the iteration method. Furthermore, we deal carefully with singularity issues related to the polar angle on the axis of the divergent nozzle.</description>

      <title>How Far do Lindbladians Go?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04883v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study controllability of finite-dimensional open quantum systems under a general Markovian control model combining full coherent (unitary) control with tunable dissipative channels. Assuming the Hamiltonian controls is a H\"ormander system that generate $\mathfrak{su}(n)$, we ask how little dissipation suffices to make the full state space $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$ controllable. We show that minimal non-unital noise can break unitary-orbit invariants and, in many cases, a very small set of jump operators yields transitivity on $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$. For multi-qubit systems we prove explicit transitivity results for natural resources such as a single-qubit amplitude-damping jump together with a dephasing channel, and we identify obstructions when only self-adjoint jump operators are available (yielding only unital evolutions).
  We further develop a geometric viewpoint and ask the ``lifting'' question: when can a path of densities be obtained from applying a time-dependent family of Lindbladian to an initial state? For this, we have to analyze the tangent structure of the ``manifold with corners'' and how this tangent structure reflects Lindbldian evolution. Building on this framework, we derive reachability criteria and no-go results based on a norm-decrease alignment condition, including a geometric obstruction arising from the incompatibility between admissible tangent directions and dissipative contraction.</description>

      <title>Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. In the geometric optics approximation, waves follow null geodesics to the singularity. However, outside the geometric optics regime, the behavior of wave propagation can be rich and nuanced, even in such extreme habitats. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that decay before reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

      <title>A strong-weak duality for the 1d long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. In the critical regime, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$, this system realizes a family of nontrivial one-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), whose data vary continuously with $s$. For $s&gt;1$ the model has instead no phase transition at finite temperature, as in the short-range case. In the standard field-theoretic description, involving a generalized free field with quartic interactions, the critical model is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled in the vicinity of the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We introduce a dual formulation that becomes weakly coupled as $s \to 1$. Precisely at $s=1$, the dual description becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition of the two-dimensional free scalar. We present a detailed study of the dual model and demonstrate its effectiveness by computing perturbatively the CFT data near $s=1$, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in $1-s$, by two independent approaches: (i) standard renormalization of our dual field-theoretic description and (ii) the analytic conformal bootstrap. The two methods yield complete agreement.</description>

      <title>Freidel-Maillet type equations on fused K-matrices over the positive part of $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The positive part $U_q^+$ of the quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ has a reflection equation presentation of Freidel-Maillet type, due to Baseilhac 2021. This presentation involves a K-matrix of dimension $2 \times 2$. Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws of nonlinear PDEs arising in elasticity and acoustics in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conservation laws are computed for various nonlinear partial differential equations that arise in elasticity and acoustics. Using a scaling homogeneity approach, conservation laws are established for two models describing shear wave propagation in a circular cylinder and a cylindrical annulus. Next, using the multiplier method, conservation laws are derived for a parameterized system of constitutive equations in cylindrical coordinates involving a general expression for the Cauchy stress. Conservation laws for the Khokhlov-Zabolotskaya-Kuznetsov equation and Westervelt-type equations in various coordinate systems are also presented.</description>
