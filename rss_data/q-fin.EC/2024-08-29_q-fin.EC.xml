      <title>Regional emission dynamics across phases of the EU ETS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the relationship between economic growth and CO$_2$ emissions across European regions from 1990 to 2022, specifically concerning the dynamics of emissions growth rates through different phases of the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). We find that emissions dynamics exhibit significant volatility influenced by changing policy frameworks. Furthermore, the distribution of emissions growth rates is asymmetric and displays fat tails, suggesting the potential for extreme emissions events. We identify marked disparities across regions: less developed regions experience higher emissions growth rates and greater volatility compared to many developed areas, which show a trend of declining emissions and reduced volatility. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of emissions to policy changes and emphasise the need for clear and effective governance in emissions trading schemes.</description>

      <title>Algorithm-Assisted Decision Making and Racial Disparities in Housing: A Study of the Allegheny Housing Assessment Tool</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for housing assistance across the United States far exceeds the supply, leaving housing providers the task of prioritizing clients for receipt of this limited resource. To be eligible for federal funding, local homelessness systems are required to implement assessment tools as part of their prioritization processes. The Vulnerability Index Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) is the most commonly used assessment tool nationwide. Recent studies have criticized the VI-SPDAT as exhibiting racial bias, which may lead to unwarranted racial disparities in housing provision. In response to these criticisms, some jurisdictions have developed alternative tools, such as the Allegheny Housing Assessment (AHA), which uses algorithms to assess clients' risk levels. Drawing on data from its deployment, we conduct descriptive and quantitative analyses to evaluate whether replacing the VI-SPDAT with the AHA affects racial disparities in housing allocation. We find that the VI-SPDAT tended to assign higher risk scores to white clients and lower risk scores to Black clients, and that white clients were served at a higher rates pre-AHA deployment. While post-deployment service decisions became better aligned with the AHA score, and the distribution of AHA scores is similar across racial groups, we do not find evidence of a corresponding decrease in disparities in service rates. We attribute the persistent disparity to the use of Alt-AHA, a survey-based tool that is used in cases of low data quality, as well as group differences in eligibility-related factors, such as chronic homelessness and veteran status. We discuss the implications for housing service systems seeking to reduce racial disparities in their service delivery.</description>
