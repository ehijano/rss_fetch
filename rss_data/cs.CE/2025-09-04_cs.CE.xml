      <title>Use of Physicochemical Modification Methods for Producing Traditional and Nanomodified Polymeric Composites with Improved Operational Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various aspects of the methods of physical and physicochemical modification of components of filled thermoplastic composite materials are analyzed, aimed at improving the surface properties of the fillers and the technological properties of the polymer matrix during their interaction. It is noted that the improvement of the interfacial interaction of the components of polymer reactoplastic composites, including adhesive strength, is a key factor for improving the reliability of the cured filled composite. As a promising area of research, a modification of the surface of the reinforcing fibrous filler and the technological characteristics of the liquid polymer binder, aimed at increasing their contact properties in the composite, was chosen. The effectiveness of the physical method of modifying the components of composites in the form of low-frequency ultrasonic processing is described. The peculiarities of cluster formation and physicochemical modification of epoxy polymers filled with dispersed fillers are analyzed. Attention is focused on the effectiveness of ultrasonic processing in the cavitation mode for deagglomeration and uniform distribution of nanoparticles in a liquid medium during the creation of nanocomposites. Experimentally confirmed is the improvement of the technological properties of liquid epoxy polymers, modified by ultrasound, used for the impregnation of oriented fibrous fillers, as well as the improvement of the physicomechanical properties of the sonicated epoxy matrices. Some issues of biological modifications of components of polymers for functional application are briefly reviewed.</description>

      <title>Use ADAS Data to Predict Near-Miss Events: A Group-Based Zero-Inflated Poisson Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driving behavior big data leverages multi-sensor telematics to understand how people drive and powers applications such as risk evaluation, insurance pricing, and targeted intervention. Usage-based insurance (UBI) built on these data has become mainstream. Telematics-captured near-miss events (NMEs) provide a timely alternative to claim-based risk, but weekly NMEs are sparse, highly zero-inflated, and behaviorally heterogeneous even after exposure normalization. Analyzing multi-sensor telematics and ADAS warnings, we show that the traditional statistical models underfit the dataset. We address these challenges by proposing a set of zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) frameworks that learn latent behavior groups and fit offset-based count models via EM to yield calibrated, interpretable weekly risk predictions. Using a naturalistic dataset from a fleet of 354 commercial drivers over a year, during which the drivers completed 287,511 trips and logged 8,142,896 km in total, our results show consistent improvements over baselines and prior telematics models, with lower AIC/BIC values in-sample and better calibration out-of-sample. We also conducted sensitivity analyses on the EM-based grouping for the number of clusters, finding that the gains were robust and interpretable. Practically, this supports context-aware ratemaking on a weekly basis and fairer premiums by recognizing heterogeneous driving styles.</description>

      <title>Automatic Differentiation of Agent-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) simulate complex systems by capturing the bottom-up interactions of individual agents comprising the system. Many complex systems of interest, such as epidemics or financial markets, involve thousands or even millions of agents. Consequently, ABMs often become computationally demanding and rely on the calibration of numerous free parameters, which has significantly hindered their widespread adoption. In this paper, we demonstrate that automatic differentiation (AD) techniques can effectively alleviate these computational burdens. By applying AD to ABMs, the gradients of the simulator become readily available, greatly facilitating essential tasks such as calibration and sensitivity analysis. Specifically, we show how AD enables variational inference (VI) techniques for efficient parameter calibration. Our experiments demonstrate substantial performance improvements and computational savings using VI on three prominent ABMs: Axtell's model of firms; Sugarscape; and the SIR epidemiological model. Our approach thus significantly enhances the practicality and scalability of ABMs for studying complex systems.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Flow Matching for Symmetry-Breaking Bifurcation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking. Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Fully Differentiable Boundary Element Solver for Hydrodynamic Sensitivity Analysis of Wave-Structure Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately predicting wave-structure interactions is critical for the effective design and analysis of marine structures. This is typically achieved using solvers that employ the boundary element method (BEM), which relies on linear potential flow theory. Precise estimation of the sensitivity of these interactions is equally important for system-level applications such as design optimization. Current BEM solvers are unable to provide these sensitivities as they do not support automatic differentiation (AD). To address these challenges, we have developed a fully differentiable BEM solver</description>

      <title>Quantum Data Encoding and Variational Algorithms: A Framework for Hybrid Quantum Classical Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum computers has been the stimulus that enables the realization of Quantum Machine Learning (QML), an area that integrates the calculational framework of quantum mechanics with the adaptive properties of classical machine learning. This article suggests a broad architecture that allows the connection between classical data pipelines and quantum algorithms, hybrid quantum-classical models emerge as a promising route to scalable and near-term quantum benefit. At the core of this paradigm lies the Classical-Quantum (CQ) paradigm, in which the qubit states of high-dimensional classical data are encoded using sophisticated classical encoding strategies which encode the data in terms of amplitude and angle of rotation, along with superposition mapping. These techniques allow compression of information exponentially into Hilbert space representations, which, together with reduced sample complexity, allows greater feature expressivity. We also examine variational quantum circuits, quantum gates expressed as trainable variables that run with classical optimizers to overcome decoherence, noise, and gate-depth constraints of the existing Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. Experimental comparisons with a Quantum Naive Bayes classifier prove that even small quantum circuits can approximate probabilistic inference with competitive accuracy compared to classical benchmarks, and have much better robustness to noisy data distributionsThis model does not only explain the algorithmic and architectural design of QML, it also offers a roadmap to the implementation of quantum kernels, variational algorithms, and hybrid feedback loops into practice, including optimization, computer vision, and medical diagnostics. The results support the idea that hybrid architectures with strong data encoding and adaptive error protection are key to moving QML out of theory to practice.</description>

      <title>Infrastructure-enabled risk assessment of hazardous road conditions on rural roads during inclement weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19444v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rural roadways often expose Commercial Motor Vehicle (CMV) drivers to hazardous conditions, such as heavy fog, rain, snow, black ice, and flash floods, many of which remain unreported in real time. This lack of timely information, coupled with limited infrastructure in rural areas, significantly increases the risk of crashes. Although various sensing technologies exist to monitor individual hazards like low visibility or surface friction, they rarely assess the combined driving risk posed by multiple simultaneous hazards, nor do they provide actionable recommendations such as safe advisory speeds. To address this critical gap, in this study, we present a roadway hazard risk assessment framework that provides an approach to quantify the probability and severity of crash occurrences due to specific roadway hazards. To evaluate this framework, we presented a case study by constructing a synthetic "year-long" dataset that encompasses every possible pairing of road surface and visibility conditions. Our analysis confirms that the combined ProbabilitySeverity scoring yields a coherent, stepwise risk profile across all hazard scenarios. These results validate the practicality of our risk assessment approach and provide a foundation for deploying graduated safety measures in real-world roadway operations.</description>

      <title>From Metrics to Meaning: Time to Rethink Evaluation in Human-AI Collaborative Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI systems increasingly shape decision making in creative design contexts, understanding how humans engage with these tools has become a critical challenge for interactive intelligent systems research. This paper contributes a challenge to rethink how to evaluate human--AI collaborative systems, advocating for a more nuanced and multidimensional approach. Findings from one of the largest field studies to date (n = 808) of a human--AI co-creative system, The Genetic Car Designer, complemented by a controlled lab study (n = 12) are presented. The system is based on an interactive evolutionary algorithm where participants were tasked with designing a simple two dimensional representation of a car. Participants were exposed to galleries of design suggestions generated by an intelligent system, MAP--Elites, and a random control. Results indicate that exposure to galleries generated by MAP--Elites significantly enhanced both cognitive and behavioural engagement, leading to higher-quality design outcomes. Crucially for the wider community, the analysis reveals that conventional evaluation methods, which often focus on solely behavioural and design quality metrics, fail to capture the full spectrum of user engagement. By considering the human--AI design process as a changing emotional, behavioural and cognitive state of the designer, we propose evaluating human--AI systems holistically and considering intelligent systems as a core part of the user experience -- not simply a back end tool.</description>
