      <title>Theoretical / numerical study of modulated traveling waves in inhibition stabilized networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a principle of linearized stability for traveling wave solutions to neural field equations posed on the real line. Additionally, we provide the existence of a finite dimensional invariant center manifold close to a traveling wave, this allows to study bifurcations of traveling waves. Finally, the spectral properties of the modulated traveling waves are investigated. Numerical schemes for the computation of modulated traveling waves are provided. We then apply these results and methods to study a neural field model in a inhibitory stabilized regime. We showcase Fold, Hopf and Bodgdanov-Takens bifurcations of traveling pulses. Additionally, we continue the modulated traveling pulses as function of the time scale ratio of the two neural populations and show numerical evidences for snaking of modulated traveling pulses.</description>

      <title>Mostly contracting random maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the long-term behavior of the iteration of a random map consisting of Lipschitz transformations on a compact metric space, independently and randomly selected according to a fixed probability measure. Such a random map is said to be \emph{mostly contracting} if all Lyapunov exponents associated with stationary measures are negative. This requires introducing the notion of (maximal) Lyapunov exponent in this general context of Lipschitz transformations on compact metric spaces. We show that this class is open with respect to the appropriate topology and satisfies the strong law of large numbers for non-uniquely ergodic systems, the limit theorem for the law of random iterations, the global Palis' conjecture, and that the associated annealed Koopman operator is quasi-compact. This implies many statistical properties such as central limit theorems, large deviations, statistical stability, and the continuity and H\"older continuity of Lyapunov exponents.
  Examples from this class of random maps include random products of circle $C^1$ diffeomorphisms, interval $C^1$ diffeomorphisms onto their images, and $C^1$ diffeomorphisms of a Cantor set on a line, all considered under the assumption of no common invariant measure. This class also includes projective actions of locally constant linear cocycles under the assumptions of simplicity of the first Lyapunov exponent and some kind of irreducibility.
  One of the main tools to prove the above results is the generalization of Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem and the uniform Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem for general Markov operators. These results are of independent interest, as they may have broad applications in other contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we build some ergodic theorems involving function $\Omega$, where $\Omega(n)$ denotes the number of prime factors of a natural number $n$ counted with multiplicities. As a combinatorial application, it is shown that for any $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and every $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive upper Banach density, there are $a,d\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $$a,a+d,\ldots,a+kd,a+\Omega(d)\in A.$$</description>

      <title>Subsystem Resetting of a Heterogeneous Network of Theta Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting has shown promise in enhancing the stability of dynamical systems. Here, we apply this concept to theta neuron networks with partial resetting, where only a fraction of neurons is intermittently reset. We examine both infinite and finite reset rates, using the averaged firing rate as an indicator of network stability. At infinite reset rates, a high proportion of resetting neurons drives the network to stable rest or spiking states, collapsing the bistable region at the Cusp bifurcation and producing smooth transitions. Finite resetting introduces stochastic fluctuations, leading to complex dynamics that sometimes deviate from theoretical predictions. These insights highlight the role of partial resetting in stabilizing neural dynamics, with applications in biological systems and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <title>On translocal entropy functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2007, Ye \&amp; Zhang introduced a version of local topological entropy. Since their entropy function is, as we show under mild conditions, constant for topologically transitive dynamical systems, we propose to adjust the notion in a way that doesn't neglect the initial transient part of an orbit.
  We investigate the properties of this ``transient'' local entropy and compute it in terms of Lyapunov exponents for various dynamical systems.
  We also investigate how this adjustment affects measure-theoretic local (Brin-Katok) entropy.</description>

      <title>Obstacles to Topological Factoring of Toeplitz shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For every Toeplitz sequence $x$, one can identify a period structure ${\bf p}=(p_i)_{i\geq 0}$ which leads to a Bratteli-Vershik realization of the associated Toeplitz shift; we call this period structure {\it constructive}. Let $(X,\sigma,x)$ and $(Y,\sigma,y)$ be Toeplitz shifts where $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$ are Toeplitz sequences with constructive period structures $(p^n)_{n\geq 1}$ and $(q^n)_{n\geq 1}$, respectively. Using the Bratteli-Vershik realization of factor maps between Toeplitz shifts, We prove that if $p$ and $q$ share the same prime divisors and neither divides the other, there cannot be any topological factoring $ \pi:(X,\sigma)\rightarrow (Y,\sigma)$ with $\pi(x)=y$.</description>

      <title>Neuromodulation and homeostasis: complementary mechanisms for robust neural function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons depend on two interdependent mechanisms-homeostasis and neuromodulation-to maintain robust and adaptable functionality. Homeostasis stabilizes neuronal activity by adjusting ionic conductances, whereas neuromodulation dynamically modifies ionic properties in response to external signals. Combining these mechanisms in conductance-based models often produces unreliable outcomes, particularly when sharp neuromodulation interferes with homeostatic tuning. This study explores how a biologically inspired neuromodulation controller can harmonize with homeostasis to ensure reliable neuronal function. Using computational models of stomatogastric ganglion and dopaminergic neurons, we demonstrate that controlled neuromodulation preserves neuronal firing patterns while maintaining intracellular calcium levels. Unlike sharp neuromodulation, the neuromodulation controller integrates activity-dependent feedback through mechanisms mimicking G-protein-coupled receptor cascades. The interaction between these controllers critically depends on the existence of an intersection in conductance space, representing a balance between target calcium levels and neuromodulated firing patterns. Maximizing neuronal degeneracy enhances the likelihood of such intersections, enabling robust modulation and compensation for channel blockades. We further show that this controller pairing extends to network-level activity, reliably modulating central pattern generators in crustaceans. These findings suggest that targeting neuromodulation pathways-rather than ion channels directly-may offer safer pharmacological strategies to manage neuronal dysfunctions. This study highlights the complementary roles of homeostasis and neuromodulation, proposing a unified control framework for maintaining robust and adaptive neural activity under physiological and pathological conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low-Thrust Orbit Transfers Connecting Gateway with Earth and Moon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gateway will represent a primary logistic infrastructure in cislunar space. The identification of efficient orbit transfers capable of connecting Earth, Moon, and Gateway paves the way for enabling refurbishment, servicing, and utilization of this orbiting platform. This study is devoted to determining two-way minimum-time low-thrust orbit transfers that connect both Earth and Moon to Gateway. Backward time propagation is proposed as a very convenient option for trajectories that approach and rendezvous with Gateway, and a unified formulation is introduced for minimum-time orbit transfers, using either forward or backward propagation. Two-way transfers between Gateway and a specified low-altitude lunar orbit are first determined, using an indirect heuristic method, which employs the necessary conditions for optimality and a heuristic algorithm. Second, two-way orbit transfers that connect Earth and Gateway are addressed. Because these trajectories exist under the influence of two major attracting bodies, the underlying optimal control problem is formulated as a multi-arc trajectory optimization problem, involving three different representations for the spacecraft state. Multi-arc optimal control problems are associated with several corner conditions to be enforced at the junction time that separates distinct arcs. However, these conditions are shown to be solvable sequentially for the problem at hand, leveraging implicit costate transformation. This implies that the multi-arc problem has a set of unknown quantities with the same size as that of a single-arc optimal control problem, with apparent advantages of computational nature. The indirect heuristic method is also applied in this second mission scenario.</description>

      <title>Approximately Jumping Towards the Origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an initial point $x_0 \in \mathbb{R}^d$ and a sequence of vectors $v_1, v_2, \dots$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, we define a greedy sequence by setting $x_{n} = x_{n-1} \pm v_n$ where the sign is chosen so as to minimize $\|x_n\|$. We prove that if the vectors $v_i$ are chosen uniformly at random from $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ then elements of the sequence are, on average, approximately at distance $\|x_n\| \sim \sqrt{\pi d/8}$ from the origin. We show that the sequence $(\|x_n\|)_{n=1}^{\infty}$ has an invariant measure $\pi_d$ depending only on $d$ and we determine its mean and study its decay for all $d$. We also investigate a completely deterministic example in $d=2$ where the $v_n$ are derived from the van der Corput sequence. Several additional examples are considered.</description>

Abstract: For the discounted Hamilton-Jacobi equation,$$\lambda u+H(x,d_x u)=0, \ x \in M, $$we construct $C^{1,1}$ subsolutions which are indeed solutions on the projected Aubry set. The smoothness of such subsolutions can be improved under additional hyperbolicity assumptions. As applications, we can use such subsolutions to identify the maximal global attractor of the associated conformally symplectic flow and to control the convergent speed of the Lax-Oleinik semigroups</description>

      <title>Bounds for Equilibrium States on Amenable Group Subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a result on equilibrium measures for potentials with summable variation on arbitrary subshifts over a countable amenable group. For finite configurations $v$ and $w$, if $v$ is always replaceable by $w$, we obtain a bound on the measure of $v$ depending on the measure of $w$ and a cocycle induced by the potential.
  We then use this result to show that under this replaceability condition, we can obtain bounds on the Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym derivative $d (\mu_\phi \circ \xi ) / d\mu_\phi $ for certain holonomies $\xi$ that generate the homoclinic (Gibbs) relation.
  As corollaries, we obtain extensions of results by Meyerovitch and Garcia-Ramos and Pavlov to the countable amenable group subshift setting. Our methods rely on the exact tiling result for countable amenable groups by Downarowicz, Huczek, and Zhang and an adapted proof technique from Garcia-Ramos and Pavlov.</description>

      <title>A direct proof of the existence of MME for finite horizon Sinai billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sinai billiard map $T$ on the two-torus, i.e., the periodic Lorentz gaz, is a discontinuous map. Assuming finite horizon and another condition we introduce -- namely \emph{negligible singularities} -- we prove that the metric pressure map associated with the billiard map $T$ is upper semi-continuous, as well as the compactness of the set of $T$-invariant measures. In particular, for the potentials $g \equiv 0$ and $g = -h_{\rm top}(\Phi^1) \tau$, we recover the recent results of the existence of measures of maximal entropy (MME) for both the billiard map and flow $\Phi^t$, due to Baladi and Demers for $T$, jointly with Carrand for $\Phi^t$. We prove that the negligible singularities condition is generic among the billiard table with $C^{3+\alpha}$ boundary, with respect to the $C^{3+\alpha}$ topology. For finite horizon Sinai billiards, we provide bounds on the defect of upper semi-continuity of the metric pressure map and on the topological tail entropy. Assuming that singularities are negligible and sparse recurrence hold, we deduce the equidistribution of the periodic orbits with respect to the unique MME. We provide examples of billiard tables satisfying both conditions.</description>

      <title>Computer-Assisted Global Analysis for Vibro-Impact Dynamics: A Reduced Smooth Maps Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for studying the global dynamics of a vibro-impact pair, that is, a ball moving in a harmonically forced capsule. Motivated by a specific context of vibro-impact energy harvesting, we develop the method with broader non-smooth systems in mind. The seeming complications of the impacts of the ball with the capsule are exploited as useful non-smooth features in selecting appropriate return maps. This choice yields a computationally efficient framework for constructing return maps on short-time realizations from the state space of possible initial conditions rather than via long-time simulations often used to generate more traditional maps. The different dynamics in sub-regions in the state space yield a small collection of reduced polynomial approximations. Combined into a piecewise composite map, these capture transient and attracting behaviors and reproduce bifurcation sequences of the full system. Further ``separable'' reductions of the composite map provide insight into both transient and global dynamics. This composite map is valuable for cobweb analysis, which opens the door to computer-assisted global analysis and is realized via conservative auxiliary maps based on the extreme bounds of the maps in each subregion. We study the global dynamics of energetically favorable states and illustrate the potential of this approach in broader classes of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Identifying the onset and decay of quasi-stationary families of almost-invariant sets with an application to atmospheric blocking events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macroscopic features of dynamical systems such as almost-invariant sets and coherent sets provide crucial high-level information on how the dynamics organises phase space. We introduce a method to identify time-parameterised families of almost-invariant sets in time-dependent dynamical systems, as well as the families' emergence and disappearance. In contrast to coherent sets, which may freely move about in phase space over time, our technique focuses on families of metastable sets that are quasi-stationary in space. Our straightforward approach extends successful transfer operator methods for almost-invariant sets to time-dependent dynamics and utilises the Ulam scheme for the generator of the transfer operator on a time-expanded domain. The new methodology is illustrated with an idealised fluid flow and with atmospheric velocity data. We identify atmospheric blocking events in the 2003 European heatwave and compare our technique to existing geophysical methods of blocking diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Closed orbits of MHD equilibria with orientation-reversing symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As a generalisation of the periodic orbit structure often seen in reflection or mirror symmetric MHD equilibria, we consider equilibria with other orientation-reversing symmetries. An example of such a symmetry, which is a not a reflection, is the parity transformation $(x,y,z) \mapsto (-x,-y,-z)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. It is shown under any orientation-reversing isometry, that if the pressure function is assumed to have toroidally nested level sets, then all orbits on the tori are necessarily periodic. The techniques involved are almost entirely topological in nature and give rise to a handy index describing how a diffeomorphism of $\mathbb{R}^3$ alters the poloidal and toroidal curves of an invariant embedded 2-torus.</description>

      <title>Mean dimension theory for infinite dimensional Bedford-McMullen sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tsukamoto (2022) introduced the notion of Bedford-McMullen carpet system, a subsystem of $([0,1]^{\mathbb{N}}\times[0,1]^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ whose metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension does not coincide in general. The aim of this paper is to develop the mean dimension theory for Bedford-McMullen sponge system, which is a subsystem of $(([0,1]^r)^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ with arbitrary $3\leq r\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we compute the metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension of such topological dynamical systems explicitly, extending the results by Tsukamoto. The metric mean dimension is a weighted combination of the standard topological entropy, whereas the mean Hausdorff dimension is expressed in terms of weighted topological entropy. We also exhibit a special situation for which the metric mean dimension and the mean Hausdorff dimension of a sponge system coincide.</description>

      <title>Self-contained relaxation-based dynamical Ising machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical Ising machines are based on continuous dynamical systems evolving from a generic initial state to a state strongly related to the ground state of the classical Ising model on a graph. Reaching the ground state is equivalent to finding the maximum (weighted) cut of the graph, which presents the Ising machines as an alternative way to solving and investigating NP-complete problems. Among the dynamical models, relaxation-based models are distinguished by their relations with guarantees of performance achieved in time scaling polynomially with the problem size. However, the terminal states of such machines are essentially non-binary, necessitating special post-processing relying on disparate computing. We show that an Ising machine implementing a special continuous dynamical system (called the V${}_2$ model) solves the rounding problem dynamically. We prove that the V${}_2$ model, starting from an arbitrary non-binary state, terminates in a state that trivially rounds to a binary state with the cut at least as big as obtained by optimal rounding of the initial state. Besides showing that relaxation-based dynamical Ising machines can be made self-contained, this result presents a non-Boolean realization of solving a non-trivial information processing task on Ising machines. Moreover, we prove that if the initial state of the V${}_2$-machine is a random limited amplitude perturbation of a binary state, the machine progresses to a state with at least as high cut as that of the initial binary state. Since the probability of improving the cut is finite, this shows that the V${}_2$-machine with random agitations converges to a maximum cut state almost surely.</description>

      <title>Approximate Controllability for Nonautonomous Integrodifferential Equations with State-dependent Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the existence of mild solutions and the approximate controllability for nonautonomous integrodifferential equations with state-dependent delay. We assume the approximate controllability of the linear part, and then we use resolvent operator theory to prove the approximate controllability of the nonlinear case. An example of the one-dimensional heat equation with memory is given to illustrate the basic idea our results.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of singular vectors in function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of singular vectors in function fields and bound the Hausdorff dimension of the set of $\varepsilon$-Dirichlet improvable vectors in this setting. This is a function field analogue of the results of Cheung and Chevallier [Duke Math. J. 165 (2016), 2273--2329].</description>

      <title>Le tissu dual d'un pr\'e-feuilletage convexe r\'eduit sur $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ est plat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A holomorphic pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is the data of a reduced complex projective curve $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ and a holomorphic foliation $\mathcal{F}$ on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$. When the foliation $\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex) and the curve $\mathcal{C}$ is invariant by $\mathcal{F}$, we say that the pre-foliation $\mathscr{F}=\mathcal{C}\boxtimes\mathcal{F}$ is convex (resp. reduced convex). We prove that the dual web of a reduced convex pre-foliation on $\mathbb{P}^{2}_{\mathbb{C}}$ is flat. This generalizes our previous result obtained in the case where the associated curve consists only of invariant lines.</description>
