      <title>TRACE: Transformer-based user Representations from Attributed Clickstream Event sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For users navigating travel e-commerce websites, the process of researching products and making a purchase often results in intricate browsing patterns that span numerous sessions over an extended period of time. The resulting clickstream data chronicle these user journeys and present valuable opportunities to derive insights that can significantly enhance personalized recommendations. We introduce TRACE, a novel transformer-based approach tailored to generate rich user embeddings from live multi-session clickstreams for real-time recommendation applications. Prior works largely focus on single-session product sequences, whereas TRACE leverages site-wide page view sequences spanning multiple user sessions to model long-term engagement. Employing a multi-task learning framework, TRACE captures comprehensive user preferences and intents distilled into low-dimensional representations. We demonstrate TRACE's superior performance over vanilla transformer and LLM-style architectures through extensive experiments on a large-scale travel e-commerce dataset of real user journeys, where the challenges of long page-histories and sparse targets are particularly prevalent. Visualizations of the learned embeddings reveal meaningful clusters corresponding to latent user states and behaviors, highlighting TRACE's potential to enhance recommendation systems by capturing nuanced user interactions and preferences</description>

      <title>More Clustering Quality Metrics for ABCDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ABCDE is a technique for evaluating clusterings of very large populations of items. Given two clusterings, namely a Baseline clustering and an Experiment clustering, ABCDE can characterize their differences with impact and quality metrics, and thus help to determine which clustering to prefer. We previously described the basic quality metrics of ABCDE, namely the GoodSplitRate, BadSplitRate, GoodMergeRate, BadMergeRate and DeltaPrecision, and how to estimate them on the basis of human judgements. This paper extends that treatment with more quality metrics. It describes a technique that aims to characterize the DeltaRecall of the clustering change. It introduces a new metric, called IQ, to characterize the degree to which the clustering diff translates into an improvement in the quality. Ideally, a large diff would improve the quality by a large amount. Finally, this paper mentions ways to characterize the absolute Precision and Recall of a single clustering with ABCDE.</description>

      <title>Procedure Model for Building Knowledge Graphs for Industry Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enterprise knowledge graphs combine business data and organizational knowledge by means of a semantic network of concepts, properties, individuals and relationships. The graph-based integration of previously unconnected information with domain knowledge provides new insights and enables intelligent business applications. However, knowledge graph construction is a large investment which requires a joint effort of domain and technical experts. This paper presents a practical step-by-step procedure model for building an RDF knowledge graph that interconnects heterogeneous data and expert knowledge for an industry use case. The self-contained process adapts the "Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining" and uses competency questions throughout the entire development cycle. The procedure model starts with business and data understanding, describes tasks for ontology modeling and the graph setup, and ends with process steps for evaluation and deployment.</description>

      <title>Data Augmentation for Sequential Recommendation: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an essential branch of recommender systems, sequential recommendation (SR) has received much attention due to its well-consistency with real-world situations. However, the widespread data sparsity issue limits the SR model's performance. Therefore, researchers have proposed many data augmentation (DA) methods to mitigate this phenomenon and have achieved impressive progress. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of DA methods for SR. We start by introducing the research background and motivation. Then, we categorize existing methodologies regarding their augmentation principles, objects, and purposes. Next, we present a comparative discussion of their advantages and disadvantages, followed by the exhibition and analysis of representative experimental results. Finally, we outline directions for future research and summarize this survey. We also maintain a repository with a paper list at \url{https://github.com/KingGugu/DA-CL-4Rec}.</description>

      <title>RPAF: A Reinforcement Prediction-Allocation Framework for Cache Allocation in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems are built upon computation-intensive infrastructure, and it is challenging to perform real-time computation for each request, especially in peak periods, due to the limited computational resources. Recommending by user-wise result caches is widely used when the system cannot afford a real-time recommendation. However, it is challenging to allocate real-time and cached recommendations to maximize the users' overall engagement. This paper shows two key challenges to cache allocation, i.e., the value-strategy dependency and the streaming allocation. Then, we propose a reinforcement prediction-allocation framework (RPAF) to address these issues. RPAF is a reinforcement-learning-based two-stage framework containing prediction and allocation stages. The prediction stage estimates the values of the cache choices considering the value-strategy dependency, and the allocation stage determines the cache choices for each individual request while satisfying the global budget constraint. We show that the challenge of training RPAF includes globality and the strictness of budget constraints, and a relaxed local allocator (RLA) is proposed to address this issue. Moreover, a PoolRank algorithm is used in the allocation stage to deal with the streaming allocation problem. Experiments show that RPAF significantly improves users' engagement under computational budget constraints.</description>

      <title>A Unified Causal Framework for Auditing Recommender Systems for Ethical Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As recommender systems become widely deployed in different domains, they increasingly influence their users' beliefs and preferences. Auditing recommender systems is crucial as it not only ensures the continuous improvement of recommendation algorithms but also safeguards against potential issues like biases and ethical concerns. In this paper, we view recommender system auditing from a causal lens and provide a general recipe for defining auditing metrics. Under this general causal auditing framework, we categorize existing auditing metrics and identify gaps in them -- notably, the lack of metrics for auditing user agency while accounting for the multi-step dynamics of the recommendation process. We leverage our framework and propose two classes of such metrics:future- and past-reacheability and stability, that measure the ability of a user to influence their own and other users' recommendations, respectively. We provide both a gradient-based and a black-box approach for computing these metrics, allowing the auditor to compute them under different levels of access to the recommender system. In our experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of methods for computing the proposed metrics and inspect the design of recommender systems through these proposed metrics.</description>

      <title>Contextual Compression in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase remarkable abilities, yet they struggle with limitations such as hallucinations, outdated knowledge, opacity, and inexplicable reasoning. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be a viable solution, leveraging external databases to improve the consistency and coherence of generated content, especially valuable for complex, knowledge-rich tasks, and facilitates continuous improvement by leveraging domain-specific insights. By combining the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases, RAG achieves a synergistic effect. However, RAG is not without its limitations, including a limited context window, irrelevant information, and the high processing overhead for extensive contextual data. In this comprehensive work, we explore the evolution of Contextual Compression paradigms, providing an in-depth examination of the field. Finally, we outline the current challenges and suggest potential research and development directions, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Dense Retrieval Approach for Speech-Based Open-Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech-based open-domain question answering (QA over a large corpus of text passages with spoken questions) has emerged as an important task due to the increasing number of users interacting with QA systems via speech interfaces. Passage retrieval is a key task in speech-based open-domain QA. So far, previous works adopted pipelines consisting of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that transcribes the spoken question before feeding it to a dense text retriever. Such pipelines have several limitations. The need for an ASR model limits the applicability to low-resource languages and specialized domains with no annotated speech data. Furthermore, the ASR model propagates its errors to the retriever. In this work, we try to alleviate these limitations by proposing an ASR-free, end-to-end trained multimodal dense retriever that can work directly on spoken questions. Our experimental results showed that, on shorter questions, our retriever is a promising alternative to the \textit{ASR and Retriever} pipeline, achieving better retrieval performance in cases where ASR would have mistranscribed important words in the question or have produced a transcription with a high word error rate.</description>

      <title>Advancing Event Causality Identification via Heuristic Semantic Dependency Inquiry Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Event Causality Identification (ECI) focuses on extracting causal relations between events in texts. Existing methods for ECI primarily rely on causal features and external knowledge. However, these approaches fall short in two dimensions: (1) causal features between events in a text often lack explicit clues, and (2) external knowledge may introduce bias, while specific problems require tailored analyses. To address these issues, we propose SemDI - a simple and effective Semantic Dependency Inquiry Network for ECI. SemDI captures semantic dependencies within the context using a unified encoder. Then, it utilizes a Cloze Analyzer to generate a fill-in token based on comprehensive context understanding. Finally, this fill-in token is used to inquire about the causal relation between two events. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SemDI, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/hrlics/SemDI.</description>

      <title>Beauty Beyond Words: Explainable Beauty Product Recommendations Using Ingredient-Based Product Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate attribute extraction is critical for beauty product recommendations and building trust with customers. This remains an open problem, as existing solutions are often unreliable and incomplete. We present a system to extract beauty-specific attributes using end-to-end supervised learning based on beauty product ingredients. A key insight to our system is a novel energy-based implicit model architecture. We show that this implicit model architecture offers significant benefits in terms of accuracy, explainability, robustness, and flexibility. Furthermore, our implicit model can be easily fine-tuned to incorporate additional attributes as they become available, making it more useful in real-world applications. We validate our model on a major e-commerce skincare product catalog dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, we showcase how ingredient-based attribute extraction contributes to enhancing the explainability of beauty recommendations.</description>

      <title>Train Once, Use Flexibly: A Modular Framework for Multi-Aspect Neural News Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent neural news recommenders (NNRs) extend content-based recommendation (1) by aligning additional aspects (e.g., topic, sentiment) between candidate news and user history or (2) by diversifying recommendations w.r.t. these aspects. This customization is achieved by ``hardcoding`` additional constraints into the NNR's architecture and/or training objectives: any change in the desired recommendation behavior thus requires retraining the model with a modified objective. This impedes widespread adoption of multi-aspect news recommenders. In this work, we introduce MANNeR, a modular framework for multi-aspect neural news recommendation that supports on-the-fly customization over individual aspects at inference time. With metric-based learning as its backbone, MANNeR learns aspect-specialized news encoders and then flexibly and linearly combines the resulting aspect-specific similarity scores into different ranking functions, alleviating the need for ranking function-specific retraining of the model. Extensive experimental results show that MANNeR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs on both standard content-based recommendation and single- and multi-aspect customization. Lastly, we validate that MANNeR's aspect-customization module is robust to language and domain transfer.</description>

      <title>Exploring Information Retrieval Landscapes: An Investigation of a Novel Evaluation Techniques and Comparative Document Splitting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in information retrieval is significantly influenced by the characteristics of the documents being processed. In this study, the structured nature of textbooks, the conciseness of articles, and the narrative complexity of novels are shown to require distinct retrieval strategies. A comparative evaluation of multiple document-splitting methods reveals that the Recursive Character Splitter outperforms the Token-based Splitter in preserving contextual integrity. A novel evaluation technique is introduced, utilizing an open-source model to generate a comprehensive dataset of question-and-answer pairs, simulating realistic retrieval scenarios to enhance testing efficiency and metric reliability. The evaluation employs weighted scoring metrics, including SequenceMatcher, BLEU, METEOR, and BERT Score, to assess the system's accuracy and relevance. This approach establishes a refined standard for evaluating the precision of RAG systems, with future research focusing on optimizing chunk and overlap sizes to improve retrieval accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Relevance of Item-Co-Exposure For Exposure Bias Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through exposing items to users, implicit feedback recommender systems influence the logged interactions, and, ultimately, their own recommendations. This effect is called exposure bias and it can lead to issues such as filter bubbles and echo chambers. Previous research employed the multinomial logit model (MNL) with exposure information to reduce exposure bias on synthetic data.
  This extended abstract summarizes our previous study in which we investigated whether (i) these findings hold for human-generated choices, (ii) other discrete choice models mitigate bias better, and (iii) an item's estimated relevance can depend on the relevances of the other items that were presented with it. We collected a data set of biased and unbiased choices in a controlled online user study and measured the effects of overexposure and competition.
  We found that (i) the discrete choice models effectively mitigated exposure bias on human-generated choice data, (ii) there were no significant differences in robustness among the different discrete choice models, and (iii) only multivariate discrete choice models were robust to competition between items. We conclude that discrete choice models mitigate exposure bias effectively because they consider item-co-exposure. Moreover, exposing items alongside more or less popular items can bias future recommendations significantly and item exposure must be tracked for overcoming exposure bias. We consider our work vital for understanding what exposure bias it, how it forms, and how it can be mitigated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09603v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Commercial organisations are holding and processing an ever-increasing amount of personal data. Policies and laws are continually changing to require these companies to be more transparent regarding the collection, storage, processing and sharing of this data. This paper reports our work of taking Booking.com as a case study to visualise personal data flows extracted from their privacy policy. By showcasing how the company shares its consumers' personal data, we raise questions and extend discussions on the challenges and limitations of using privacy policies to inform online users about the true scale and the landscape of personal data flows. This case study can inform us about future research on more data flow-oriented privacy policy analysis and on the construction of a more comprehensive ontology on personal data flows in complicated business ecosystems.</description>

      <title>TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</description>
