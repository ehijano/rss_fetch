      <title>Revisiting Audio-language Pretraining for Learning General-purpose Audio Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-language pretraining holds promise for general-purpose audio understanding, yet remains underexplored compared to its vision counterpart. While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research. To accelerate progress, we release data preparation recipes, training protocols, and pretrained models, paving the way toward universal audio understanding.</description>

      <title>Robot Confirmation Generation and Action Planning Using Long-context Q-Former Integrated with Multimodal LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human-robot collaboration towards a shared goal requires robots to understand human action and interaction with the surrounding environment. This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.</description>

      <title>The Artist is Present: Traces of Artists Resigind and Spawning in Text-to-Audio AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) systems are rapidly transforming music creation and distribution, with platforms like Udio and Suno generating thousands of tracks daily and integrating into mainstream music platforms and ecosystems. These systems, trained on vast and largely undisclosed datasets, are fundamentally reshaping how music is produced, reproduced and consumed. This paper presents empirical evidence that artist-conditioned regions can be systematically microlocated through metatag-based prompt design, effectively enabling the spawning of artist-like content through strategic prompt engineering. Through systematic exploration of metatag-based prompt engineering techniques this research reveals how users can access the distinctive sonic signatures of specific artists, evidencing their inclusion in training datasets. Using descriptor constellations drawn from public music taxonomies, the paper demonstrates reproducible proximity to artists such as Bon Iver, Philip Glass, Panda Bear and William Basinski. The results indicate stable text-audio correspondences consistent with artist-specific training signals, enabling precise traversal of stylistic microlocations without explicitly naming artists. This capacity to summon artist-specific outputs shows that artists' creative works fuction as foundational material from which these systems generate new content, often without explicit consent or attribuition. Conceptually, the work clarifies how textual descriptors act as navigational cues in high-dimensional representation spaces; methodologically, it provides a replicable protocol for auditing stylistic inducibility. The findings raise immediate queestions for governance-attribution, consent and disclosure standards-and for creative practice, where induced stylistic proximity complicates boundaries between ownership, reproduction, imitation, creative agency and the ethics of algorithmic creation.</description>

      <title>AI in Music and Sound: Pedagogical Reflections, Post-Structuralist Approaches and Creative Outcomes in Seminar Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a pedagogical and conceptual account of the course AI in Music and Sound: Modalities, Tools and Creative Applications, offered within the Music Informatics and Media Art module of an M.Sc. in Audio Communication. The course engaged students with a range of AI modalities such as symbolic composition, voice synthesis, timbre transfer, neural audio synthesis, and text-to-audio systems, combining theoretical reflection with practice-based experimentation. Its central pedagogical move is a paired-\'etudes design: each modality is approached first through its intended affordances and then through a deliberately reframed or "misused" exercise that surfaces representational limits and alternative behaviours. Framed by medium theory and post-structuralist inquiry, we treated AI as a transmodal conduit-a system that translates and perturbs musical signs across textual, symbolic, timbral and audio domains. Evidence from student work and reflection indicates growth in technical fluency, medium awareness, and critical literacy, alongside the cultivation of experimental method and process-oriented listening. The paper outlines the course architecture, assessment design, and representative projects, and distils a set of design patterns for AI-music pedagogy (eg., prompt-conditioned interplays and semantic destabilisation in text-to-audio; latent space materialism in timbre transfer). It concludes with pedagogical recommendations that integrate creative practice with medium awareness and with cultural-epistemic analysis of AI technologies, preparing students to participate in how AI is understood, developed, and deployed with creative communities.</description>

      <title>Semantic and Semiotic Interplays in Text-to-Audio AI: Exploring Cognitive Dynamics and Musical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the emerging text-to-audio paradigm in artificial intelligence (AI), examining its transformative implications for musical creation, interpretation, and cognition. I explore the complex semantic and semiotic interplays that occur when descriptive natural language prompts are translated into nuanced sound objects across the text-to-audio modality. Drawing from structuralist and post-structuralist perspectives, as well as cognitive theories of schema dynamics and metacognition, the paper explores how these AI systems reconfigure musical signification processes and navigate established cognitive frameworks. The research analyzes some of the cognitive dynamics at play in AI-mediated musicking, including processes of schema assimilation and accommodation, metacognitive reflection, and constructive perception. The paper argues that text-to-audio AI models function as quasi-objects of musical signification, simultaneously stabilizing and destabilizing conventional forms while fostering new modes of listening and aesthetic reflexivity.Using Udio as a primary case study, this study explores how these models navigate the liminal spaces between linguistic prompts and sonic outputs. This process not only generates novel musical expressions but also prompts listeners to engage in forms of critical and "structurally-aware listening.", encouraging a deeper understanding of music's structures, semiotic nuances, and the socio-cultural contexts that shape our musical cognition. The paper concludes by reflecting on the potential of text-to-audio AI models to serve as epistemic tools and quasi-objects, facilitating a significant shift in musical interactions and inviting users to develop a more nuanced comprehension of the cognitive and cultural foundations of music.</description>

      <title>Omni-R1: Do You Really Need Audio to Fine-Tune Your Audio LLM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose Omni-R1 which fine-tunes a recent multi-modal LLM, Qwen2.5-Omni, on an audio question answering dataset with the reinforcement learning method GRPO. This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU and MMAR benchmarks. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance.</description>

      <title>AV-Lip-Sync+: Leveraging AV-HuBERT to Exploit Multimodal Inconsistency for Deepfake Detection of Frontal Face Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal manipulations (also known as audio-visual deepfakes) make it difficult for unimodal deepfake detectors to detect forgeries in multimedia content. To avoid the spread of false propaganda and fake news, timely detection is crucial. The damage to either modality (i.e., visual or audio) can only be discovered through multimodal models that can exploit both pieces of information simultaneously. However, previous methods mainly adopt unimodal video forensics and use supervised pre-training for forgery detection. This study proposes a new method based on a multimodal self-supervised-learning (SSL) feature extractor to exploit inconsistency between audio and visual modalities for multimodal video forgery detection. We use the transformer-based SSL pre-trained Audio-Visual HuBERT (AV-HuBERT) model as a visual and acoustic feature extractor and a multi-scale temporal convolutional neural network to capture the temporal correlation between the audio and visual modalities. Since AV-HuBERT only extracts visual features from the lip region, we also adopt another transformer-based video model to exploit facial features and capture spatial and temporal artifacts caused during the deepfake generation process. Experimental results show that our model outperforms all existing models and achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the FakeAVCeleb and DeepfakeTIMIT datasets.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Alignment Framework for Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01588v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) alignment is critical for applications like medical speech analysis and language learning tools relying on automatic speech recognition (ASR). State-of-the-art end-to-end (E2E) ASR systems, such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and transducer-based models, suffer from peaky behavior and alignment inaccuracies. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable alignment framework based on one-dimensional optimal transport, enabling the model to learn a single alignment and perform ASR in an E2E manner. We introduce a pseudo-metric, called Sequence Optimal Transport Distance (SOTD), over the sequence space and discuss its theoretical properties. Based on the SOTD, we propose Optimal Temporal Transport Classification (OTTC) loss for ASR and contrast its behavior with CTC. Experimental results on the TIMIT, AMI, and LibriSpeech datasets show that our method considerably improves alignment performance compared to CTC and the more recently proposed Consistency-Regularized CTC, though with a trade-off in ASR performance. We believe this work opens new avenues for seq2seq alignment research, providing a solid foundation for further exploration and development within the community.
