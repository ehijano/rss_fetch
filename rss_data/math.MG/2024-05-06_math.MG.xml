      <title>Stability in the Banach isometric conjecture and nearly monochromatic Finsler surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Banach isometric conjecture asserts that a normed space with all of its $k$-dimensional subspaces isometric, where $k\geq 2$, is Euclidean. The first case of $k=2$ is classical, established by Auerbach, Mazur and Ulam using an elegant topological argument. We refine their method to arrive at a stable version of their result: if all $2$-dimensional subspaces are almost isometric, then the space is almost Euclidean. Furthermore, we show that a $2$-dimensional surface, which is not a torus or a Klein bottle, equipped with a near-monochromatic Finsler metric, is approximately Riemannian. The stability is quantified explicitly using the Banach-Mazur distance.</description>

      <title>Variations on a Theme of Makowski</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We distinguish the axiomatic study of proofs in geometry from study about geometry from general axioms for mathematics. We briefly report on an abuse of that distinction and its unfortunate effect on US high school education. We review a number of 20th century approaches to synthetic geometry. In doing so, we disambiguate (in the Wikipedia sense) the terms: metric, orthogonal, isotropic and hyperbolic. With some of these systems we are able to axiomatize `affine geometry' over the complex field (The argument is trivial from [Wu94] or [Szm78], but not remarked by either of them.). We examine the general question of the connections between axioms for Affine geometries and the stability classification of associated complete first order theories of fields. We conclude with reminiscences of a half-century friendship with Jan\'{o}s.</description>

      <title>Quantitative bordism over acyclic groups and Cheeger-Gromov $\rho$-invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11885v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a bordism version of Gromov's linearity conjecture over a large family of acyclic groups, for manifolds with arbitrary dimension. Every group embeds into one of these acyclic groups, and thus it follows that the conjecture is true if one allows to enlarge a given group. Our result holds in both PL and smooth categories, and for both oriented and unoriented cases. In the PL case, our results hold without assuming bounded local geometry. As an application, we prove that there is a universal linear bound for the Cheeger-Gromov $L^2$ $\rho$-invariants of PL $(4k-1)$-manifolds associated with arbitrary regular covers. We also show that the minimum number of simplices in a PL triangulation of $(4k-1)$-manifolds with a fixed simple homotopy type is unbounded if the fundamental group has nontrivial torsion. The proof of our main results builds on quantitative algebraic and geometric techniques over the simplicial classifying spaces of groups.</description>

      <title>Similar point configurations via group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for $d\ge 2,\, k\ge 2$, if the Hausdorff dimension of a compact set $E\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is greater than $\frac{d^2}{2d-1}$, then, for any given $r &gt; 0$, there exist $(x^1, \dots, x^{k+1})\in E^{k+1}$, $(y^1, \dots, y^{k+1})\in E^{k+1}$, a rotation $\theta \in \mathrm{O}_d(\mathbb{R})$, and a vector $a \in \mathbb{R}^d$ such that $rx^j = \theta y^j - a$ for $1 \leq j \leq k+1$. Such a result on existence of similar $k$-simplices in thin sets had previously been established under a more stringent dimensional threshold in Greenleaf, Iosevich and Mkrtchyan \cite{GIM21}. The argument we are use to prove the main result here was previously employed in Bhowmik and Rakhmonov \cite{BR23} to establish a finite field version. We also show the existence of multi-similarities of arbitrary multiplicity in $\R^d$, show how to extend these results from similarities to arbitrary proper continuous maps, as well as explore a general group-theoretic formulation of this problem in vector spaces over finite fields.</description>

      <title>General harmonic measures for distance-expanding dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Partially motivated by the study of I. Binder, N. Makarov, and S. Smirnov [BMS03] on dimension spectra of polynomial Cantor sets, we initiate the investigation on some general harmonic measures, inspired by Sullivan's dictionary, for distance-expanding dynamical systems. Let $f\colon X\to X$ be an open distance-expanding map on a compact metric space $(X,\rho)$. A Gromov hyperbolic tile graph $\Gamma$ associated to the dynamical system $(X,f)$ is constructed following the ideas from M. Bonk, D. Meyer [BM17] and P. Ha\"issinsky, K. M. Pilgrim [HP09]. We consider a class of one-sided random walks associated with $(X,f)$ on $\Gamma$. They induce a Martin boundary of the tile graph, which may be different from the hyperbolic boundary. We show that the Martin boundary of such a random walk admits a surjection to $X$. We provide a class of examples to show that the surjection may not be a homeomorphism. Such random walks also induce measures on $X$ called harmonic measures. When $\rho$ is a visual metric, we establish an equality between the fractal dimension of the harmonic measure and the asymptotic quantities of the random walk.</description>

      <title>Effective volume growth of three-manifolds with positive scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove an effective linear volume growth for complete three-manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive scalar curvature. This recovers the results obtained by Munteanu-Wang. Our method builds upon recent work by Chodosh-Li-Stryker, which utilizes the technique of $\mu$-bubbles and the almost-splitting theorem by Cheeger-Colding.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness when the $L_p$ curvature is close to be a constant for $p\in[0,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For fixed positive integer $n$, $p\in[0,1]$, $a\in(0,1)$, we prove that if a function $g:\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\to \mathbb{R}$ is sufficiently close to 1, in the $C^a$ sense, then there exists a unique convex body $K$ whose $L_p$ curvature function equals $g$. This was previously established for $n=3$, $p=0$ by Chen, Feng, Liu \cite{CFL22} and in the symmetric case by Chen, Huang, Li, Liu \cite{CHLL20}. Related, we show that if $p=0$ and $n=4$ or $n\leq 3$ and $p\in[0,1)$, and the $L_p$ curvature function $g$ of a (sufficiently regular, containing the origin) convex body $K$ satisfies $\lambda^{-1}\leq g\leq \lambda$, for some $\lambda&gt;1$, then $\max_{x\in\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}h_K(x)\leq C(p,\lambda)$, for some constant $C(p,\lambda)&gt;0$ that depends only on $p$ and $\lambda$. This also extends a result from Chen, Feng, Liu \cite{CFL22}. Along the way, we obtain a result, that might be of independent interest, concerning the question of when the support of the $L_p$ surface area measure is lower dimensional. Finally, we establish a strong non-uniqueness result for the $L_p$-Minkowksi problem, for $-n&lt;p&lt;0$.</description>
