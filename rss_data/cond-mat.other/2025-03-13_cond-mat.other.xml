      <title>Quantum Averaging for High-Fidelity Quantum Logic Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08886v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling M{\o}lmer-S{\o}rensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.</description>

      <title>Space-time Supercrystals from Non-Abelian Electric Translation Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic supercrystals can form in spatial or temporal dimensions where traditional mechanisms usually require many-body interactions, such as Wigner crystals or discrete time crystals. We propose a novel approach for electronic supercrystals in 1+1D without requiring many-body interactions, but arising from the competition between characteristic space-time areas in periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices under electric fields. Utilizing the non-Abelian dynamical symmetries described by the electric translation group, the area competition is characterized by fractal spectra and replicated bands, furnished with eigenstates crystallized in enlarged space-time unit cells forming space-time supercrystals under perturbations. We also report robust dynamical localization of electrons arising from the static topology of the SSH lattice.</description>
