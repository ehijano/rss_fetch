      <title>Integrated user scheduling and beam steering in over-the-air federated learning for mobile IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising popularity of Internet of things (IoT) has spurred technological advancements in mobile internet and interconnected systems. While offering flexible connectivity and intelligent applications across various domains, IoT service providers must gather vast amounts of sensitive data from users, which nonetheless concomitantly raises concerns about privacy breaches. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising decentralized training paradigm to tackle this challenge. This work focuses on enhancing the aggregation efficiency of distributed local models by introducing over-the-air computation into the FL framework. Due to radio resource scarcity in large-scale networks, only a subset of users can participate in each training round. This highlights the need for effective user scheduling and model transmission strategies to optimize communication efficiency and inference accuracy. To address this, we propose an integrated approach to user scheduling and receive beam steering, subject to constraints on the number of selected users and transmit power. Leveraging the difference-of-convex technique, we decompose the primal non-convex optimization problem into two sub-problems, yielding an iterative solution. While effective, the computational load of the iterative method hampers its practical implementation. To overcome this, we further propose a low-complexity user scheduling policy based on characteristic analysis of the wireless channel to directly determine the user subset without iteration. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of aggregation error and learning performance over existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Tetris: Efficient Intra-Datacenter Calls Packing for Large Conferencing Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conference services like Zoom, Microsoft Teams, and Google Meet facilitate millions of daily calls, yet ensuring high performance at low costs remains a significant challenge. This paper revisits the problem of packing calls across Media Processor (MP) servers that host the calls within individual datacenters (DCs). We show that the algorithm used in Teams -- a large scale conferencing service as well as other state-of-art algorithms are prone to placing calls resulting in some of the MPs becoming hot (high CPU utilization) that leads to degraded performance and/or elevated hosting costs. The problem arises from disregarding the variability in CPU usage among calls, influenced by differences in participant numbers and media types (audio/video), compounded by bursty call arrivals. To tackle this, we propose Tetris, a multi-step framework which (a) optimizes initial call assignments by leveraging historical data and (b) periodically migrates calls from hot MPs using linear optimization, aiming to minimize hot MP usage. Evaluation based on a 24-hour trace of over 10 million calls in one DC shows that Tetris reduces participant numbers on hot MPs by at least 2.5X.</description>

      <title>SwarnRaft: Leveraging Consensus for Robust Drone Swarm Coordination in GNSS-Degraded Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms are increasingly used in critical applications such as aerial mapping, environmental monitoring, and autonomous delivery. However, the reliability of these systems is highly dependent on uninterrupted access to the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signals, which can be disrupted in real-world scenarios due to interference, environmental conditions, or adversarial attacks, causing disorientation, collision risks, and mission failure. This paper proposes SwarnRaft, a blockchain-inspired positioning and consensus framework for maintaining coordination and data integrity in UAV swarms operating under GNSS-denied conditions. SwarnRaft leverages the Raft consensus algorithm to enable distributed drones (nodes) to agree on state updates such as location and heading, even in the absence of GNSS signals for one or more nodes. In our prototype, each node uses GNSS and local sensing, and communicates over WiFi in a simulated swarm. Upon signal loss, consensus is used to reconstruct or verify the position of the failed node based on its last known state and trajectory. Our system demonstrates robustness in maintaining swarm coherence and fault tolerance through a lightweight, scalable communication model. This work offers a practical and secure foundation for decentralized drone operation in unpredictable environments.</description>

      <title>Learning Like Humans: Resource-Efficient Federated Fine-Tuning through Cognitive Developmental Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated fine-tuning enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt to downstream tasks while preserving data privacy, but its resource-intensive nature limits deployment on edge devices. In this paper, we introduce Developmental Federated Tuning (DevFT), a resource-efficient approach inspired by cognitive development that progressively builds a powerful LLM from a compact foundation. DevFT decomposes the fine-tuning process into developmental stages, each optimizing submodels with increasing parameter capacity. Knowledge from earlier stages transfers to subsequent submodels, providing optimized initialization parameters that prevent convergence to local minima and accelerate training. This paradigm mirrors human learning, gradually constructing comprehensive knowledge structure while refining existing skills. To efficiently build stage-specific submodels, DevFT introduces deconfliction-guided layer grouping and differential-based layer fusion to distill essential information and construct representative layers. Evaluations across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DevFT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 4.59$\times$ faster convergence, 10.67$\times$ reduction in communication overhead, and 9.07% average performance improvement, while maintaining compatibility with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Quality-of-Service Aware LLM Routing for Edge Computing with Multiple Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, leading to a significant increase in user demand for LLM services. However, cloud-based LLM services often suffer from high latency, unstable responsiveness, and privacy concerns. Therefore, multiple LLMs are usually deployed at the network edge to boost real-time responsiveness and protect data privacy, particularly for many emerging smart mobile and IoT applications. Given the varying response quality and latency of LLM services, a critical issue is how to route user requests from mobile and IoT devices to an appropriate LLM service (i.e., edge LLM expert) to ensure acceptable quality-of-service (QoS). Existing routing algorithms fail to simultaneously address the heterogeneity of LLM services, the interference among requests, and the dynamic workloads necessary for maintaining long-term stable QoS. To meet these challenges, in this paper we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based QoS-aware LLM routing framework for sustained high-quality LLM services. Due to the dynamic nature of the global state, we propose a dynamic state abstraction technique to compactly represent global state features with a heterogeneous graph attention network (HAN). Additionally, we introduce an action impact estimator and a tailored reward function to guide the DRL agent in maximizing QoS and preventing latency violations. Extensive experiments on both Poisson and real-world workloads demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly improves average QoS and computing resource efficiency compared to existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Decentralized Secure Aggregation with Collusion Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (FL), multiple clients collaboratively learn a shared machine learning (ML) model by leveraging their privately held datasets distributed across the network, through interactive exchange of the intermediate model updates. To ensure data security, cryptographic techniques are commonly employed to protect model updates during aggregation. Despite growing interest in secure aggregation, existing works predominantly focus on protocol design and computational guarantees, with limited understanding of the fundamental information-theoretic limits of such systems. Moreover, optimal bounds on communication and key usage remain unknown in decentralized settings, where no central aggregator is available. Motivated by these gaps, we study the problem of decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) from an information-theoretic perspective. Specifically, we consider a network of $K$ fully-connected users, each holding a private input -- an abstraction of local training data -- who aim to securely compute the sum of all inputs. The security constraint requires that no user learns anything beyond the input sum, even when colluding with up to $T$ other users. We characterize the optimal rate region, which specifies the minimum achievable communication and secret key rates for DSA. In particular, we show that to securely compute one symbol of the desired input sum, each user must (i) transmit at least one symbol to others, (ii) hold at least one symbol of secret key, and (iii) all users must collectively hold no fewer than $K - 1$ independent key symbols. Our results establish the fundamental performance limits of DSA, providing insights for the design of provably secure and communication-efficient protocols in distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>FedGuard: A Diverse-Byzantine-Robust Mechanism for Federated Learning with Major Malicious Clients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning is a distributed training framework vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, particularly when over 50% of clients are malicious or when datasets are highly non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). Additionally, most existing defense mechanisms are designed for specific attack types (e.g., gradient similarity-based schemes can only defend against outlier model poisoning), limiting their effectiveness. In response, we propose FedGuard, a novel federated learning mechanism. FedGuard cleverly addresses the aforementioned issues by leveraging the high sensitivity of membership inference to model bias. By requiring clients to include an additional mini-batch of server-specified data in their training, FedGuard can identify and exclude poisoned models, as their confidence in the mini-batch will drop significantly. Our comprehensive evaluation unequivocally shows that, under three highly non-IID datasets, with 90% of clients being Byzantine and seven different types of Byzantine attacks occurring in each round, FedGuard significantly outperforms existing robust federated learning schemes in mitigating various types of Byzantine attacks.</description>

      <title>Adacc: Adaptive Compression and Activation Checkpointing for LLM Memory Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training large language models often employs recomputation to alleviate memory pressure, which can introduce up to 30% overhead in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose Adacc, a novel memory management framework that combines adaptive compression and activation checkpointing to reduce the GPU memory footprint. It comprises three modules: (1) We design layer-specific compression algorithms that account for outliers in LLM tensors, instead of directly quantizing floats from FP16 to INT4, to ensure model accuracy. (2) We propose an optimal scheduling policy that employs MILP to determine the best memory optimization for each tensor. (3) To accommodate changes in training tensors, we introduce an adaptive policy evolution mechanism that adjusts the policy during training to enhance throughput. Experimental results show that Adacc can accelerate the LLM training by 1.01x to 1.37x compared to state-of-the-art frameworks, while maintaining comparable model accuracy to the Baseline.</description>

      <title>SGEMM-cube: Emulating FP32 GEMM on Ascend NPUs Using FP16 Cube Units with Precision Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-precision matrix engines, such as FP16 cube, offer high throughput but lack support for full-precision computation. In this work, we propose SGEMM-cube, a high-performance algorithm for emulating FP32 general matrix-matrix multiplication (GEMM) using only FP16 computation units on a representative AI accelerator. The method decomposes each FP32 operand into two FP16 values and compensates for numerical errors through a tunable scaling strategy. A detailed analysis of numerical errors, including underflow conditions and precision loss, guides the selection of scaling parameters to preserve up to 22 bits of mantissa accuracy. We further investigate the effect of computation order on accuracy and demonstrate that a term-wise accumulation scheme improves numerical stability over conventional FP32 GEMM in low-exponent regimes. Finally, a cache-aware blocking strategy and double-buffered pipeline are introduced to overlap memory transfers with computation, enabling SGEMM-cube to achieve up to 77\% of the theoretical FP32-equivalent peak performance on Ascend 910A NPU lacking native FP32 support. Extensive numerical experiments confirm that our method not only recovers the accuracy of native FP32 GEMM but also exhibits superior numerical stability under certain conditions, due to its structured and error-aware computation order.</description>

      <title>TensorSocket: Shared Data Loading for Deep Learning Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep learning models is a repetitive and resource-intensive process. Data scientists often train several models before landing on a set of parameters (e.g., hyper-parameter tuning) and model architecture (e.g., neural architecture search), among other things that yield the highest accuracy. The computational efficiency of these training tasks depends highly on how well the training data is supplied to the training process. The repetitive nature of these tasks results in the same data processing pipelines running over and over, exacerbating the need for and costs of computational resources. In this paper, we present TensorSocket to reduce the computational needs of deep learning training by enabling simultaneous training processes to share the same data loader. TensorSocket mitigates CPU-side bottlenecks in cases where the collocated training workloads have high throughput on GPU, but are held back by lower data-loading throughput on CPU. TensorSocket achieves this by reducing redundant computations and data duplication across collocated training processes and leveraging modern GPU-GPU interconnects. While doing so, TensorSocket is able to train and balance differently-sized models and serve multiple batch sizes simultaneously and is hardware- and pipeline-agnostic in nature. Our evaluation shows that TensorSocket enables scenarios that are infeasible without data sharing, increases training throughput by up to 100%, and when utilizing cloud instances, achieves cost savings of 50% by reducing the hardware resource needs on the CPU side. Furthermore, TensorSocket outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions for shared data loading such as CoorDL and Joader; it is easier to deploy and maintain and either achieves higher or matches their throughput while requiring fewer CPU resources.</description>

      <title>Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</description>

      <title>ExclaveFL: Providing Transparency to Federated Learning using Exclaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In federated learning (FL), data providers jointly train a model without disclosing their training data. Despite its inherent privacy benefits, a malicious data provider can simply deviate from the correct training protocol without being detected, potentially compromising the trained model. While current solutions have explored the use of trusted execution environments (TEEs) to combat such attacks, they usually assume side-channel attacks against the TEEs are out of scope. However, such side-channel attacks can undermine the security properties of TEE-based FL frameworks, not by extracting the FL data, but by leaking keys that allow the adversary to impersonate as the TEE whilst deviating arbitrarily from the correct training protocol.
  We describe ExclaveFL, an FL platform that provides end-to-end integrity and transparency, even in the presence of side-channel attacks on TEEs. We propose a new paradigm in which existing TEEs are used as exclaves -- integrity-protected execution environments that do not contain any secrets, making them immune to side-channel attacks. Whereas previous approaches attest the TEE itself and bind this attestation to a key held by the TEE, ExclaveFL attests individual data transformations at runtime. These runtime attestations form an attested dataflow graph, which can be checked to ensure the FL training job satisfies claims, such as deviations from the correct computation. We implement ExclaveFL by extending the popular NVFlare FL framework to use exclaves, and show experimentally that ExclaveFL introduces less than 10% overhead compared to the same FL framework without TEEs, whilst providing stronger security guarantees.</description>
