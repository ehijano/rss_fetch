      <title>Nested Shadows of Anyons:A Framework for Identifying Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1-form symmetries in two-dimensional topological systems are ``shadowed'' as global symmetries in their one-dimensional quantum transfer matrices. In this work, we introduce a distinct shadow effect arising from the pair-creation of anyons, which manifests as a local symmetry of the quantum transfer matrix. The interplay between these two shadow effects provides a powerful framework for characterizing topological phases without extensive numerical simulations. Specifically, we derive the phase diagram of the filtered toric code state and precisely identify phase boundaries using the nested shadows of anyons. Additionally, we reveal that a class of topological states host gapless edge modes protected by 1-form symmetry rather than global symmetry. Finally, we apply our approach to the three-dimensional toric code and X-cube states, uncovering a nontrivial path in phase space that connects them through a subdimensional critical point, which is highly challenging to detect numerically due to the complexity of simulating three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly in the Weyl semimetal TaRhTe$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TaRhTe$_4$ is a type-IIWeyl semimetal, exhibiting fourWeyl points in proximity to the Fermi level. In this article, we report our results of a systematic study of longitudinal magnetoresistance in TaRhTe$_4$. Our findings indicate that magnetoresistance becomes negative only when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the electric field. By rotating E (as well as B), we show that its origin is consistent with the prediction of the chiral anomaly, while the current jetting effect and weak localization could be excluded. The negative magnetoresistance persists up to room temperature, suggesting that TaRhTe4 exhibits distinctive properties within the family of Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>U(1) Dirac quantum spin liquid candidate in triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquid represents an intriguing state where electron spins are highly entangled yet spin fluctuation persists even at 0 K. Recently, the hexaaluminates \textit{R}MgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ (\textit{R} = rare earth) have been proposed to be a platform for realizing the quantum spin liquid state with dominant Ising anisotropic correlations. Here, we report detailed low-temperature magnetic susceptibility, muon spin relaxation, and thermodynamic studies on the CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ single crystal. Ising anisotropy is revealed by magnetic susceptibility measurements. Muon spin relaxation and ac susceptibility measurements rule out any long-range magnetic ordering or spin freezing down to 50 mK despite the onset of spin correlations below $\sim$0.8 K. Instead, the spins keep fluctuating at a rate of 1.0(2) MHz at 50 mK. Specific heat results indicate a gapless excitation with a power-law dependence on temperature, $C_m(T) \propto T^{\alpha}$. The quasi-quadratic temperature dependence with $\alpha$ = 2.28(4) in zero field and linear temperature dependence in 0.25 T support the possible realization of the U(1) Dirac quantum spin liquid state.</description>

      <title>Spin and pair density waves in 2D altermagnetic metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a recently proposed and experimentally confirmed class of magnetic order, features collinear compensated magnetism with unconventional d-, g-, or i-wave spin order. Here, we show that in a metallic 2D d-wave altermagnet with combined two-fold spin and four-fold lattice rotational symmetry $[C_2||C_4]$, secondary instabilities can arise. Using an unbiased functional renormalization group approach, we analyze the weak-coupling instabilities of a 2D Hubbard model with a preexisting altermagnetic order inspired by our ab initio electronic structure calculations of realistic material candidates from V$_2$X$_2$O (X = Te, Se) family. We identify two distinct spin density wave (SDW) states that break the underlying altermagnetic $[C_2||C_4]$ symmetry. Additionally, we find spin-fluctuation-induced instabilities leading to a singlet d-wave superconducting state and an unconventional commensurate pair density wave (PDW) state with extended s-wave and spin-triplet symmetry. We establish a general criterion for the unusual exchange statistics for these pair density waves and characterize their excitation spectrum, which exhibits Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces or nodal points depending on the gap size.</description>

      <title>Gauging the complex SYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by SYK-like models describing near-BPS black holes in string/M-theory, we consider gauging the U$(1)$ symmetry of the complex SYK model in the presence of a Wilson line with charge $k$. At a fixed background gauge field, solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations display vastly different properties from those at a fixed real chemical potential. In the partition function and the two-point function, the integral over the gauge field is performed either directly or via a large $N$ saddle point approximation, and both results are consistent with exact diagonalization data. From the behaviour of the two-point function at large $N$, we deduce that the conformal symmetry at low energies is preserved at fixed $\kappa = k/N = 0$, but broken at $\kappa\neq 0$. In addition, we find that there is maximal chaos for all $k$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Symbolic Construction of Matrix Product Operators and Tree Tensor Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces an improved framework for constructing matrix product operators (MPOs) and tree tensor network operators (TTNOs), crucial tools in quantum simulations. A given (Hamiltonian) operator typically has a known symbolic "sum of operator strings" form that can be translated into a tensor network structure. Combining the existing bipartite-graph-based approach and a newly introduced symbolic Gaussian elimination preprocessing step, our proposed method improves upon earlier algorithms in cases when Hamiltonian terms share the same prefactors. We test the performance of our method against established ones for benchmarking purposes. Finally, we apply our methodology to the model of a cavity filled with molecules in a solvent. This open quantum system is cast into the hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM) setting to obtain an effective Hamiltonian. Construction of the corresponding TTNO demonstrates a sub-linear increase of the maximum bond dimension.</description>

      <title>Theory of interaction-induced charge order in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CrSBr is a layered van der Waals insulator with a quasi one-dimensional electronic structure and in-plane ferromagnetic order. Recent experimental work on Li-doped CrSBr reveals quasi-1D charge modulated states. In this study, we develop ab initio effective models for CrSBr to investigate these states and solve them using mean-field theory and density matrix embedding theory. The models are parametrized using density functional theory, the constrained random phase approximation, and the Rytova-Keldysh form of the long-range Coulomb interaction. Our simulations indicate the emergence of a charge density wave state characterized by cosine-like intra-chain density modulations and inter-chain phase shifts that minimize the Coulomb repulsion. Notably, at a doping level corresponding to $1/n$ electron per CrSBr unit, the most stable pattern exhibits a periodicity of $n$ cells, in agreement with experimental observations and Peierls' instability arguments. Moreover, we demonstrate that the inter-chain order is sensitive to the range of Coulomb interactions. If the interaction is hard-truncated to a short-ranged form, some localized stripe-like states are computationally favored. This work provides an ab initio framework for understanding the interplay of competing electronic and magnetic phases in CrSBr and related materials.</description>

      <title>Gate-Voltage-Driven Quantum Phase Transition at $0.7 (2e^2/h)$ in Quantum Point Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex gate-voltage-dependent differential conductance in quantum point contacts, shaped by entangled-state tunneling, was demonstrated through the movement of a localized spin. This spin responds to variations in side gate voltage, triggering a quantum phase transition (QPT) between symmetric and asymmetric Kondo coupling states, with the states separated by conductance regions $G \geq 0.7 G_0$ and $G \leq 0.7 G_0$, where $G_0 = 2e^2/h$, respectively. The asymmetric state has two Kondo temperatures, while the symmetric state has only one. The presence of two Kondo temperatures in the asymmetric state clarifies previously unresolved issues, such as the indeterminate Kondo temperature and anomalous behavior in the width of the zero-bias anomaly (ZBA) in the $G \leq 0.7 G_0$ region. The QPT was investigated by analyzing the gate-voltage-dependent ZBA energy, calculated using the corresponding local density of states at the site of the localized spin, obtained during the replication of the differential conductance.</description>

      <title>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>

      <title>High-Pressure Tuning of Electrical Transport in Freestanding Oxide Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrical transport of oxide films under high pressure is largely unexplored due to the absence of a universal strategy. In this work, we have developed an in-house route to investigate the electrical transport properties of oxide films under high pressures, by improving the elasticity of freestanding oxide films and the robustness of high-pressure techniques on nano-devices. As a showcase, we investigated the electrical resistivity of perovskite SrIrO3 films under high pressures, and found a pressure-driven semimetal-to-insulator transition and an insulator-to-metal transition. At the monolayer-limit, the SrIrO3 films directly transform from an insulating state to a metallic state, highlighting the intriguing interplay of dimensionality and hydrostatic pressure in correlated oxides, which can be unveiled through the universal high-pressure strategy.</description>

      <title>Emergent fractals in hBN-encapsulated graphene based supermoir\'e structures and their experimental signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermoir\'e structures (SMS), formed by overlapping moir\'e-patterns in van der Waals heterostructures, display complex behaviour that lacks a comprehensive low-energy theoretical description. We demonstrate that these structures can form emergent fractals under specific conditions and identify the parameter space where this occurs in hexagonal trilateral SMS. This fractality enables a reliable calculation of low-energy band counts, which are crucial for understanding both single-particle and correlation effects. Using an effective Hamiltonian that includes in- and out-of-plane lattice relaxation, we analyze SMS in hBN-encapsulated single and bilayer graphene. We prescribe methods to experimentally verify these fractals and extract their fractal dimension through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).</description>

      <title>Oddities in the Entanglement Scaling of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties of the Quantum Six-Vertex Model on a cylinder, focusing on the Shannon-Renyi entropy in the limit of Renyi order $n = \infty$. This entropy, calculated from the ground state amplitudes of the equivalent XXZ spin-1/2 chain, allows us to determine the Renyi entanglement entropy of the corresponding Rokhsar-Kivelson wavefunctions, which describe the ground states of certain conformal quantum critical points. Our analysis reveals a novel logarithmic correction to the expected entanglement scaling when the system size is odd. This anomaly arises from the geometric frustration of spin configurations imposed by periodic boundary conditions on odd-sized chains. We demonstrate that the scaling prefactor of this logarithmic term is directly related to the compactification radius of the low-energy bosonic field theory description, or equivalently, the Luttinger parameter. Thus, this correction provides a direct probe of the underlying Conformal Field Theory (CFT) describing the critical point. Our findings highlight the crucial role of system size parity in determining the entanglement properties of this model and offer insights into the interplay between geometry, frustration, and criticality.</description>

      <title>From pure to mixed: Altermagnets as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using altermagnetic phases as intrinsic symmetry-breaking indicators. The transmutation of pure into mixed altermagnets in the presence of spin-orbit coupling and the concomitant development of an anomalous Hall response can be associated with the breaking of specific lattice symmetries by external fields or the development of subleading order parameters. We introduce the basic ideas in the context of RuO$_2$ and discuss the case of surface magnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Our study suggests that if Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ hosts a pure altermagnet on its surface, the onset of specific superconducting states could transmute this altermagnet from pure to mixed and account for the apparent onset of time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) at the superconducting transition temperature, without necessarily ascribing TRSB to the superconducting state. Further investigation of this unusual scenario could provide essential steps toward a more coherent picture of the phenomenology of this material.</description>

      <title>Dynamical cluster-based optimization of tensor network algorithms for quantum circuit simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We optimize Matrix-Product State (MPS)-based algorithms for simulating quantum circuits with finite fidelity, specifically the Time-Evolving Block Decimation (TEBD) and the Density-Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithms, by exploiting the irregular arrangement of entangling operations in circuits. We introduce a variation of the standard TEBD algorithm, we termed "cluster-TEBD", which dynamically arranges qubits into entanglement clusters, enabling the exact contraction of multiple circuit layers in a single time step. Moreover, we enhance the DMRG algorithm by introducing an adaptive protocol which analyzes the entanglement distribution within each circuit section to be contracted, dynamically adjusting the qubit grouping at each iteration. We analyze the performances of these enhanced algorithms in simulating both stabilizer and non-stabilizer random circuits, with up to $1000$ qubits and $100$ layers of Clifford and non-Clifford gates, and in simulating Shor's quantum algorithm with tens of thousands of layers. Our findings show that, even with reasonable computational resources per task, cluster-based approaches can significantly speed up simulations of large-sized quantum circuits and improve the fidelity of the final states.</description>

      <title>The chiral SYK model in three-dimensional holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated realization of the holographic principle posits an approximate duality between the $(0+1)$-dimensional quantum mechanical SYK model and two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, mediated by the Schwarzian action as an effective low energy theory common to both systems. We here propose a generalization of this correspondence to one dimension higher. Starting from different microscopic realizations of effectively chiral $(1+1)$-dimensional generalizations of the SYK model, we derive a reduction to the Alekseev-Shatashvilli (AS)-action, a minimal extension of the Schwarzian action which has been proposed as the effective boundary action of three-dimensional gravity. In the bulk, we show how the same action describes fluctuations around the Euclidean BTZ black hole configuration, the dominant stationary solution of three-dimensional gravity. These two constructions allow us to match bulk and boundary coupling constants, and to compute observables. Specifically, we apply semiclassical techniques inspired by condensed matter physics to the computation of out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs), demonstrating maximal chaos in the chiral SYK chain and its gravity dual.</description>

      <title>Tunable Josephson diode effect in singlet superconductor-altermagnet-triplet superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered phase of collinear magnet called, altermagnet breaks time reversal symmetry (TRS), exhibits momentum-dependent spin-splitting of band structure with zero net magnetization. In this work, we theoretically investigate the Josephson junction (JJ) of spin singlet superconductor (SC)/altermagnet/spin triplet SC and demonstrate that it manifests field free Josephson diode effect (JDE). We illustrate that there are four key requisites to have JDE in such JJs, namely, broken TRS, left and right SC in the JJ shall be non-identical, presence of spin orbit interaction, and anisotropy in spin polarization at the Fermi surface or anisotropy in pair potential of the SC. It has also been shown that by applying a gate potential in the altermagnetic regime, one can not only reverse the sign of efficiency but also modulate its magnitude. Our system can be used as a superconducting rectifier that can be tuned efficiently using gate voltage and system parameters without having external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Renormalized density matrix downfolding: A rigorous framework in learning emergent models from ab initio many-body calculations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalized framework, renormalized density matrix downfolding (RDMD), to derive systematically improvable, highly accurate, and nonperturbative effective models from ab initio calculations. This framework moves beyond the common role of ab initio calculations as calculating the parameters of a proposed Hamiltonian. Instead, RDMD provides the capability to decide whether a given effective Hilbert space can be identified from the ab initio data and assess the relative quality of ansatz Hamiltonians. Any method of ab initio solution can be used as a data source, and as the ab initio solutions improve, the resultant model also improves. We demonstrate the framework in an application to the downfolding of a hydrogen chain to a spin model, in which we find the interatomic separations for which a nonperturbative mapping can be made even in the strong coupling regime where standard methods fail, and compute a renormalized spin model Hamiltonian that quantitatively reproduces the ab initio dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering competing interactions of Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ system in clusters: part I -- static properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the Kitaev-Heisenberg-$\Gamma$ system has been used to explore various aspects of Kitaev spin liquid physics. Here, we consider a few small clusters of up to twelve sites and study them in detail to unravel many interesting findings due to the competition between all possible signs and various magnitudes of these interactions under the influence of an external magnetic field. When Heisenberg interaction is taken anti-ferromagnetic, one obtains plateaus in correlation functions where, surprisingly, the exact groundstate reduces to the eigenstate of Heisenberg interaction as well. On the other hand, for ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction, its competition with Kitaev interaction results in non-monotonicity in the correlation functions. We discuss, in detail, the competing effects on low energy spectrum, flux operator, magnetization, susceptibility, and specific heat. Finally, we discuss how our findings could be helpful to explain some of the recent experimental and theoretical findings in materials with Kitaev interactions.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary master equation approach to the Anderson-Holstein impurity problem out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method based on auxiliary master equation for solving the problem of an impurity with local electron-electron and electron-phonon interaction embedded between two conduction leads with a finite bias voltage. The Anderson-Holstein Hamiltonian is transformed to a corresponding Lindblad equation with a reduced set of sites providing an optimal approximation of the hybridization function. The problem is solved in the superfermion representation using configuration interaction for fermions and bosons. The phonon basis is shifted and rotated with the intention of permitting a low phonon basis cutoff even in the strong-coupling regime. We benchmark this approach with the numerical renormalization group in equilibrium, finding excellent agreement. We observe, however, that the rotation brings no advantage beyond the bare shift. This is even more apparent out of equilibrium, where issues in convergence with respect to the size of the phononic Hilbert space occur only in the rotated basis. As an application of the method, we explore the evolution of the phononic peak in the differential conductance spectra with changing phonon frequency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00062v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that nonlinear transport responses in strange metals are strong, larger by a factor of $E_F/T$ than in Fermi liquids. Within the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model of a Fermi surface with a spatially random coupling to a critical scalar, the third order conductivity is found to diverge as $1/T$ at low $T$, indicating the existence of a voltage-temperature scaling regime in the conductance. Its frequency and orientation dependence contains information on relaxation times of heat and electron distribution deformations, providing a new set of tools to characterize strange metals.</description>

      <title>Giant Impurity Effects on Charge Loop Current Order States in Kagome Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exotic electronic states in the charge loop current (cLC) phase, in which the permanent charge current breaks the time-reversal symmetry, have been attracting increasing attention in recently discovered kagome metals AV3Sb5 (A = Cs, Rb, K). Interestingly, the cLC state is sensitively controlled by applying a small magnetic field as well as a tiny uniaxial strain. In addition, many experiments indicate that the cLC state is sensitive to the small number of impurities. To understand the impurity effects on the cLC electronic states accurately, we analyze the giant unit-cell (up to 1200 sites) kagome lattice model with single impurity potential. The loop current is found to be strongly suppressed within the current correlation length $\xi_J$ centered on the impurity site, where $\xi_J$ increases as the cLC order parameter $\eta$ decreases. (The cLC order is the pure imaginary hopping integral modulation $\delta t_{i,j}=\pm i\eta$.) In addition, both the uniform orbital magnetization $M_{orb}$ and the anomalous Hall conductivity $\sigma_{xy}$ are drastically suppressed by dilute impurities. Especially, the suppression ratio $R=-\Delta M_{orb}/M_{orb}^0$ can exceed 50% with the introduction of 1% impurities. Unexpectedly, the ratio $R$ is qualitatively insensitive to $\eta$, in highly contrast to a naive expectation that $R$ is proportional to the current suppression area $\pi \xi_J^2$. The resulting giant impurity effect of $M_{orb}$ would originates from the nonlocal contribution of the itinerant circulation of electrons. The present study gives a natural explanation of why the cLC electronic states in kagome metals are sensitive to dilute impurities.</description>

      <title>Fermion-fermion interaction driven phase transitions in rhombohedral trilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of short-range fermion-fermion interactions on the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene are comprehensively investigated using the momentum-shell renormalization group method. We take into account all one-loop corrections and establish the energy-dependent coupled evolutions of independent fermionic couplings that carry the physical information stemming from the interplay of various fermion-fermion interactions. With detailed numerical analysis, we observe that the ferocious competition among all fermion-fermion interactions can drive fermionic couplings to four distinct fixed points, dubbed $\textrm{FP}_{1}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, $\textrm{FP}_{3}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, in the interaction-parameter space. These fixed points primarily dictate the fate of the system in the low-energy regime and are always associated with some instabilities characterized by specific symmetry breakings, leading to certain phase transitions. To determine the favorable states arising from the potential phase transitions, we introduce a number of fermion-bilinear source terms to characterize the underlying candidate states. By comparing their related susceptibilities, we find that the dominant states correspond to spin-singlet superconductivity, spin-triplet pair-density-waves, and spin-triplet superconductivity for fixed points $\textrm{FP}_{1,3}$, $\textrm{FP}_{2}$, and $\textrm{FP}_{4}$, respectively. These provide valuable insights into the low-energy properties of rhombohedral trilayer graphene and analogous materials.</description>

      <title>Mott insulators appearing at thickness period corresponding to nesting in CaRuO_3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The typical material bismuth shows a several-fold change in electrical resistivity at 4 K over a 400 {\AA} film thickness period. In 2021, we discovered a novel size effect with a period of 25 {\AA} on strongly correlated compound CaRuO_3. The change in film thickness of only one nanometer leads to an increase in electrical resistivity at 4 K by a factor of several billion. However, the excitation energy of 2.4 eV on insulating CaRuO_3 is too large to explain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify that the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice expansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane X-ray diffraction on CaRuO_3 films and found a 24.8 {\AA} periodic thickness oscillation of the lattice spacing d_{(004)}. We determined the nesting vector from the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period equivalent to the size effect. We concluded that the antiferromagnetic correlation appearing in the boundary conditions triggers the periodic Mott insulators depending on the film thickness.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on the trivalent heptagonal Hurwitz hyperbolic tiling. The presence of odd-length loops in the tiling is responsible for a spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Interestingly, at the isotropic point, the two degenerate ground states (Kramers pair) are shown to be gapped chiral spin liquids and the elementary excitations are non-Abelian Ising anyons.</description>

      <title>Re-entrant topological order in strongly correlated nanowire due to Rashba spin-orbit coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effect of the Rashba spin orbit coupling (RSOC) on the topological properties of the one-dimensional (1D) extended $s$-wave superconducting Hamiltonian, in the presence of strong electron-electron correlation, is investigated. It is found that a non-zero RSOC increases the periodicity of the effective Hamiltonian, which results in the folding of the Brillouin zone (BZ), and consequently in the emergence of an energy gap at the boundary of the BZ. Essentially the initial single band is divided into number of sub-bands. If the chemical potential lies inside the energy gaps (sub-bands) then the phase is topologically trivial (non trivial). This is the origin of re-entrant nature of the existent topological properties. The emergence of sub-bands allows us to drive the system in and out of the topological phase by the proper tuning of the chemical potential. A heterostructure involving van der Waals materials and a 1D Moire pattern for an investigation of the predicted effect has also been proposed. We also discuss how in-plane magnetic field can be used to control the RSOC coupling and induced periodicity in depleted InAs nanowire in which evidence of strong electron-electron correlation has been found.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.</description>

Distinct anomalous behaviours imprinted in the Hilbert space are identified with the distinct cohomology "layers" that appear in the classification of anomalies in terms of cobordism groups. We illustrate the manifestation of the layers in the Hilbert for a variety of anomalous symmetries and spacetime dimensions, including time-reversal symmetry, and both in systems of fermions and in anomalous topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) in 2+1d. We argue that anomalies can imply an exact bose-fermi degeneracy in the Hilbert space, thus revealing a supersymmetric spectrum of states; we provide a sharp characterization of when this phenomenon occurs and give nontrivial examples in various dimensions, including in strongly coupled QFTs. Unraveling the anomalies of TQFTs leads us to develop the construction of the Hilbert spaces, the action of operators and the modular data in spin TQFTs, material that can be read on its own.</description>

Abstract: Open quantum systems with many interacting degrees of freedom pose a formidable challenge for presently available theoretical methods, especially when dissipative environment imposes non-Markovian dynamics on them with memory effects and revival of genuine quantum properties. Even the archetypical spin-boson model, where a single spin-1/2 interacts with an infinite bosonic bath, requires switching between methods for different choice of system and bath parameters. Here, we construct a field-theoretic framework as a single methodology that can handle many mutually interacting quantum spins of arbitrary value S, spatial dimensionality, system-bath coupling, bath temperature and spectral properties of the bath. Our framework combines Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT) with two-particle irreducible (2PI) action resumming a class of Feynman diagrams to an infinite order originating from 1/N expansion, where N is the number of Schwinger bosons to which the spin is mapped. Remarkably, the SKFT+2PI approach closely tracks numerically exact benchmarks for spin-boson in the non-Markovian regime obtained from hierarchical equations of motion or tensor network methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the ability of our SKFT+2PI framework to compute two-spin correlators of an antiferromagnetic quantum spin chain whose edge spins are coupled to a set of three bosonic baths (one for each spin component) at different temperatures. The favorable numerical cost of solving integro-differential equations produced by SKFT+2PI framework with increasing number of spins, time steps or spatial dimensionality makes it a promising route for simulation of driven-dissipative systems in quantum computing or quantum magnonics and quantum spintronics in the presence of a single or multiple dissipative environments.</description>
