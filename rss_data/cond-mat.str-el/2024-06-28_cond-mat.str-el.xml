      <title>Flat band physics in the charge-density wave state of $1T$-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 1$T$-TaS$_2$ is the only insulating transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with an odd number of electrons per unit cell. This insulating state is non-magnetic, making it a potential spin-liquid candidate. The unusual electronic behavior arises from a naturally occurring nearly flat mini-band, where the properties of the strongly correlated states are significantly influenced by the microscopic starting point, necessitating a detailed and careful investigation. We revisit the electronic band structure of 1$T$-TaS$_2$, starting with the tight-binding model without CDW order. Symmetry dictates the nature of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which, unlike in the 2H TMD structure, allows for strong off-diagonal "spin-flip" terms as well as Ising SOC. Incorporating the CDW phase, we construct a 78$\times$78 tight-binding model to analyze the band structure as a function of various parameters. Our findings show that an isolated flat band is a robust feature of this model. Depending on parameters such as SOC strength and symmetry-allowed orbital splittings, the flat band can exhibit non-trivial topological classifications. These results have significant implications for the strongly correlated physics emerging from interacting electrons in the half-filled or doped flat band.</description>

      <title>Dynamically localized but deconfined excitations in strained classical spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study classical spin ice under uniaxial strain along the $[111]$ crystallographic axis. Remarkably, such strain preserves the extensive ice degeneracy and the corresponding classical Coulomb phase. The emergent monopole excitations remain thermodynamically deconfined exactly as in the isotropic case. However, their motion under local heat bath dynamics depends qualitatively on the sign of the strain. In the low-temperature limit for negative strain, the monopoles diffuse, while for positive strain, they localize. Introducing additional ring exchange dynamics into the ice background transforms the localized monopoles into sub-dimensional excitations whose motion is restricted to diffusion in the $(111)$-plane. The phenomena we identify are experimentally accessible in rare-earth pyrochlores under uniaxial pressure as well as in tripod kagome materials. The diffusive versus localized nature of the monopoles manifests in characteristic magnetic noise spectra, which we compute.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Response of Dipolar-Octupolar Quantum Spin Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dipolar-octupolar (DO) pyrochlore systems Ce$_2$(Zr,Sn,Hf)$_2$O$_7$ have garnered much attention as recent investigations suggest that they may stabilize a novel quantum spin ice (QSI), a quantum spin liquid (QSL) with an emergent $U(1)$ gauge field. In particular, the experimentally estimated microscopic exchange parameters place Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ in the $\pi$-flux QSI regime, and recent neutron scattering experiments have corroborated some key theoretical predictions. On the other hand, to make a definitive conclusion, more multifaceted experimental signatures are desirable. In this regard, recent neutron scattering investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the spin correlations in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ may provide valuable information. However, there have not been any comprehensive theoretical studies for comparison. In this work, we provide such information using gauge mean-field theory (GMFT), allowing for theoretical investigation beyond the perturbative regime. In particular, we construct the phase diagrams for the [110], [111], and [001] field directions. Furthermore, we demonstrate the distinctive evolution of the equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors as a function of the magnetic field for each field direction. These predictions will help future experiments confirm the true nature of the DO-QSI.</description>

      <title>Topological bound on structure factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the static structure factor of general many-body systems with $U(1)$ symmetry has a lower bound determined only by the ground state Chern number. Our bound relies only on causality and non-negative energy dissipation, and holds for a wide range of systems. We apply our theory to (fractional) Chern insulators, (fractional) quantum spin Hall insulators, topological superconductors, and chiral spin liquids. Our results uncover a universal feature of topological phases beyond the quantized response.</description>

      <title>Orbital magnetic field driven metal-insulator transition in strongly correlated electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Mott metal-insulator transition in the Hubbard-Hofstadter model as a function of the orbital magnetic field, exploiting dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). Considering interaction strengths between the electrons for which this model is in the Mott insulating state in the field-free case, we find that for sufficiently large magnetic fields a metallic phase emerges. Upon decreasing the field, we observe a metal-insulator transition from this metallic to an insulating state. This effect can be understood by a magnetic field induced increase of the kinetic energy due to the formation of magnetic mini-bands which enhances the ratio between the kinetic and potential energy and can, thus, trigger a transition between a metallic and insulating phase. Our findings are in good qualitative agreement with a recent experiment [Nature Communications 11, 3591] on vanadium oxide (VO$_2$) where a magnetic field driven insulator-to-metal transition has been observed at strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP) calls for a minimal mechanism with no role for spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The long phonon mean-free-path leaves little room for scattering by point-like symmetry breaking defects. we show that the signal peaks when the magnetic field is oriented along one of the two diagonal orientations of the puckered honeycomb plane and argue that this can be understood as the sum of two distinct contributions each parallel to a mirror plane. This angular dependence as well as the order of magnitude of the observed signal points to the torque exerted by magnetic field on electric dipoles traveling with heat-carrying phonons as the driver of the effect.</description>

      <title>Exotic 4f Correlated Electronic States of Ferromagnetic Kondo Lattice Compounds ReRh$_6$Ge$_4$ (Re=Ce, Ho, Er, Tm)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ stands out as the first stoichiometric metallic compound with a ferromagnetic quantum critical point, thereby garnering significant attention. Ferromagnetic Kondo lattice compounds ReRh$_6$Ge$_4$ (Re=Ce, Ho, Er, Tm) have been systematically investigated with density functional theory incorporating Coulomb interaction U and spin-orbital coupling. We determined the magnetic easy axis of CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ is within the ab plane, which is in agreement with previous magnetization measurements conducted under external magnetic field and muSR experiments. We also predicted the magnetic easy axes for the other three compounds. For TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$, the magnetic easy axis aligns along the c axis, thus preserving the $C_3$ rotational symmetry of the c axis. Especially, there are triply degenerate nodal points along the $\Gamma-A$ direction in the band structure including spin-orbital coupling. A possible localized to itinerant crossover is revealed as $4f$ electrons increase from CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ to TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$. Specifically, the $4f$ electrons of TmRh$_6$Ge$_4$ contribute to the formation of a large Fermi surface, indicating their participation in the conduction process. Conversely, the $4f$ electrons in HoRh$_6$Ge$_4$, ErRh$_6$Ge$_4$ and CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ remain localized, which result in smaller Fermi surfaces for these compounds. These theoretical investigations on electronic structure and magnetic properties shed deep insight into the unique nature of $4f$ electrons, providing critical predictions for subsequent experimental studies.</description>

      <title>Optical conductivity of the metallic pyrochlore iridate Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$: Influence of spin-orbit coupling and electronic correlations on the electronic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy of strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions gives rise to unconventional topological states, such as topological Mott insulator, Weyl semimetal, and quantum spin liquid. In this study, we have grown single crystals of the pyrochlore iridate Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and explored its magnetic, lattice dynamical, and electronic properties. While Raman spectroscopy data reveal six phonon modes confirming the cubic \textit{Fd$\bar{3}$m} crystal symmetry, dc magnetic susceptibility data show no anomalies and hence indicate the absence of magnetic phase transitions down to 2~K. Both temperature-dependent electric transport and optical conductivity data reveal the metallic character of Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The optical conductivity spectrum contains a mid-infrared absorption band, which becomes more pronounced with decreasing temperature due to spectral weight transfer from high to low energies. The presence of the mid-infrared band hints at the importance of correlation physics. The optical response furthermore suggests that Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is close to the Weyl semimetal phase.</description>

      <title>Exact Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics across a quantum critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By setting the inverse temperature $\beta$ loose to occupy the complex plane, Michael E. Fisher showed that the zeros of the complex partition function $Z$, if approaching the real $\beta$ axis, reveal a thermodynamic phase transition. More recently, Fisher zeros have been used to mark the dynamical phase transition in quench dynamics. The success of Fisher zeros however seems limited, and it is unclear how they can be employed to shed light on quantum phase transitions or the non-unitary dynamics of open quantum systems. Here we answer this question by a comprehensive analysis of the (analytically continued) one-dimensional transverse field Ising model. We exhaust all the Fisher zeros to show that in the thermodynamic limit they congregate into a remarkably simple pattern in the form of continuous open or closed lines. These Fisher lines evolve smoothly as the coupling constant is tuned, and a qualitative change identifies the quantum critical point. By exploiting the connection between $Z$ and the thermofield double states, we obtain analytical expressions for the short- and long-time dynamics of the survival amplitude and the scaling of recurrence time at the quantum critical point. We further point out $Z$ can be realized and probed in monitored quantum circuits. The analytical results are corroborated by numerical tensor renormalization group which elevates the approach outlined here to a powerful tool for interacting quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Phonon dynamics in the site-disordered Kitaev spin liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model provides a paradigmatic example of an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid
  (QSL), in which the spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into itinerant Majorana fermions coupled to a static background of $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ gauge fluxes. This model has attracted significant attention in recent years due to the possibility of its experimental realization in some spin-orbit Mott insulators such as $ \alpha $-RuCl$ _3 $. Among various experimental probes, ultrasound experiments measuring sound attenuation have emerged as a promising avenue to unveil the fractionalization of spins in these materials. Yet, candidate materials often deviate from the ideal Kitaev model due to the presence of disorder, leading to the emergence of localized modes governing low-energy physics. To provide further insight into the effects of these defect-induced modes on the phonon dynamics, we calculate the sound attenuation coefficient in the site-disordered Kitaev honeycomb model with an applied magnetic field, which breaks the time-reversal symmetry. In order to obtain a more accurate perspective on the temperature-dependent sound attenuation in this model, the impact of thermally excited fluxes on the disordered system is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Competition between metal bonding and strain in tetragonal V$_{1-x}$M$_x$O$_2$ (M = Nb, Mo)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Though the effects of metal dopants on the electrostructural transition of rutile VO$_2$ have been studied for many decades, there is still no consensus explanation for the observed trends. A major challenge has been to separate the impact of a dopant's size from other factors such as its electronic configuration, which stems from the difficulty in directly probing the local bonding environment around a dopant atom. This work addresses the special case of larger dopant ions by combining X-ray total scattering experiments on V$_{0.83}$Mo$_{0.17}$O$_2$ and V$_{0.89}$Nb$_{0.11}$O$_2$ single crystals with multiple Monte Carlo method models to simulate local size effects in the high-temperature tetragonal phase (R). We find that sufficiently long apical metal-oxygen bonds (M$-$O$_{ap}$) induce a strain field in the neighboring chains that locally resembles the metal-metal dimer formation present in the low-temperature distorted structure of VO$_2$ (M1). The dimer mode in the M1 structure is antisymmetric along M$-$O$_{ap}$, however, while the strain-induced pseudodimer motif is symmetric. The implied direct competition between motifs is verified experimentally. This finding provides a new mechanistic parameter toward understanding the phase transition. More generally, the work highlights how local strain fields around dopants can lead to complex distortions that are ordinarily attributed to electronic origins.</description>

      <title>Fractal Subsystem Symmetries, Anomalies, Boundaries, and Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports an extensive study of three-dimensional topological ordered phases that, in one of the directions behave like usual topological order concerning mobility of excitations, but in the perpendicular plane manifest type-II fracton physics dictated by a fractal subsystem symmetry. We obtain an expression for the ground state degeneracy, which depends intricately on the sizes of the plane, signaling a strong manifestation of ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The ground state degeneracy can be interpreted in terms of spontaneous/explicit breaking of fractal subsystem symmetries. We also study the boundary physics, which in turn is useful to understand the connection with certain two-dimensional phases. Finally, we derive a low-energy but not long-distance effective field theory, by Higgsing a fractal $U(1)$ symmetry and taking the deep IR limit. This description embodies in a natural way several aspects of the phases, such as the content of generalized global symmetries, the role of fractal symmetries on the mobility of excitations, the anomalies, and the boundary physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide the phase diagram of a 2-parameter spin-1 chain that has a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Haldane phase using computational algorithms along with tensor-network tools. We improve previous results, showing the existence of a new phase and new triple points. New striking features are the triple end of the Haldane phase and the complexity of phases bordering the Haldane phase in proximity allowing moving to nearby non-SPT phases via small perturbations. These characteristics make the system, which appears in Rydberg excitons, e.g. in Cu$_2$O, a prime candidate for applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing with Nanoelectronics: Fisher Information for an Adiabatic Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems used for metrology can offer enhanced precision over their classical counterparts. The design of quantum sensors can be optimized by maximizing the quantum Fisher information (QFI), which characterizes the precision of parameter estimation for an ideal measurement. Here we consider the response of a quantum system as a means to estimate the strength of an external perturbation that has been switched on slowly. General expressions for the QFI are derived, which also hold for interacting many-body systems in the thermodynamic limit at finite temperatures, and can be related to linear-response transport coefficients. For quantum dot nanoelectronics devices, we show that electron interactions can lead to exponential scaling of the QFI with system size, highlighting that quantum resources can be utilized in the full Fock space. The precision estimation of voltages and fields can also be achieved by practical global measurements, such as the electric current, making quantum circuits good candidates for metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram in Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films$\colon$ the effects of Bi stoichiometry on superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bi${-}$Ni binary system has been of interest due to possible unconventional superconductivity aroused therein, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking in Bi/Ni bilayers or the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi$_3$Ni crystals. While Ni acts as a ferromagnetic element in such systems, the role of strong spin-orbit-coupling element Bi in superconductivity has remained unexplored. In this work, we systematically studied the effects of Bi stoichiometry on the superconductivity of Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films (${x} \approx$ 0.5 to 0.9) fabricated via a composition-spread approach. The superconducting phase map of Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films exhibited a superconducting composition region attributable to the intermetallic Bi$_3$Ni phase with different amount of excess Bi, revealed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis. Interestingly, the mixed phase region with Bi$_3$Ni and Bi showed unusual increases in the superconducting transition temperature and residual resistance ratio as more Bi impurities were included, with the maximum ${T}_{c}$ ($=$ 4.2 K) observed at $x \approx$ 0.79. A correlation analysis of structural, electrical, and magneto-transport characteristics across the composition variation revealed that the unusual superconducting $"$dome$"$ is due to two competing roles of Bi$\colon$ impurity scattering and carrier doping. We found that the carrier doping effect is dominant in the mild doping regime (0.74 $\leq {x} \leq$ 0.79), while impurity scattering becomes more pronounced at larger Bi stoichiometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exactly solvable spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg distorted diamond chain in the presence of the external magnetic field is investigated for the case of antiferromagnetic Ising and ferromagnetic XXZ Heisenberg interactions. The influence of quantum fluctuations and the distortion on the ground state, magnetic and thermal properties of the model are studied in detail. In particular, it is established that the zero-temperature magnetization curve may involve intermediate plateaus just at zero and 1/3 of the saturation magnetization. It is demonstrated that the temperature dependence of the specific heat reveals up to four distinct peaks at zero magnetic field and up to five distinct peaks at a weak magnetic field. The physical origin of all observed additional peaks of the specific heat has been clarified on the grounds of dominating thermal excitations. We have shown that the quantum fluctuations give rise to an effective geometrical frustration in this chain.</description>

      <title>Scalable approach to monitored quantum dynamics and entanglement phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits have stimulated activity in a diverse research community. However, the study of measurement-induced dynamics, due to the requirement of exponentially complex postselection, has been experimentally limited to small or specially designed systems that can be efficiently simulated classically. We present a solution to this outstanding problem by introducing a scalable protocol in $U(1)$ symmetric circuits that facilitates the observation of entanglement phase transitions \emph{directly} from experimental data, without detailed assumptions of the underlying model or benchmarking with simulated data. Thus, the method is applicable to circuits which do not admit efficient classical simulation and allows a reconstruction of the full entanglement entropy curve with minimal theoretical input. Our approach relies on adaptive circuits and a steering protocol to approximate pure-state trajectories with mixed ensembles, from which one can efficiently filter out the subsystem $U(1)$ charge fluctuations of the target trajectory to obtain its entanglement entropy. The steering protocol replaces the exponential costs of postselection and state tomography with a scalable overhead which, for fixed accuracy $\epsilon$ and circuit size $L$, scales as $\mathcal{N}_s\sim L^{5/2}/\epsilon$.</description>

Abstract: Magnetism of oxide antiferromagnets (AFMs) has been studied in single crystals and extended thin films. The properties of AFM nanostructures still remain underexplored. Here, we report on the fabrication and magnetic imaging of granular 100-nm-thick magnetoelectric Cr$_2$O$_3$ films patterned in circular bits with diameters ranging from 500 down to 100 nm. With the change of the lateral size, the domain structure evolves from a multidomain state for larger bits to a single domain state for the smallest bits. Based on spin-lattice simulations, we show that the physics of the domain pattern formation in granular AFM bits is primarily determined by the energy dissipation upon cooling, which results in motion and expelling of AFM domain walls of the bit. Our results provide a way towards the fabrication of single domain AFM-bit-patterned memory devices and the exploration of the interplay between AFM nanostructures and their geometric shape.</description>

      <title>Theory of superconductivity in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, robust superconductivity has been independently observed in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers by two separate groups [Y. Xia et al., arXiv:2405.14784; Y. Guo et al., arXiv:2406.03418.]. In light of this, we explore the possibility of a universal superconducting pairing mechanism in twisted WSe$_2$ bilayers. Using a continuum band structure model and a phenomenological boson-mediated effective electron-electron attraction, we find that intervalley intralayer pairing predominates over interlayer pairing. Notably, despite different experimental conditions, both twisted WSe$_2$ samples exhibit a comparable effective attraction strength. This consistency suggests that the dominant pairing glue is likely independent of the twist angle and layer polarization, pointing to a universal underlying boson-induced pairing mechanism.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems: strong, weak, and strong-to-weak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Depending on the coupling to the environment, symmetries of open quantum systems manifest in two distinct forms, the strong and the weak. We study the spontaneous symmetry breaking among phases with different symmetries. Concrete Liouvillian models with strong and weak symmetry are constructed, and different scenarios of symmetry-breaking transitions are investigated from complementary approaches. It is demonstrated that strong symmetry always spontaneously breaks into the corresponding weak symmetry. For strong $U(1)$ symmetry, we show that strong-to-weak symmetry breaking leads to gapless Goldstone modes dictating diffusion of the symmetry charge in translational invariant systems. We conjecture that this relation among strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, gapless modes, and symmetry-charge diffusion is general for continuous symmetries. It can be interpreted as an "enhanced Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem" for open quantum systems, according to which the gapless spectrum does not require non-integer filling. We also investigate the scenario where the strong symmetry breaks completely. In the symmetry-broken phase, we identify an effective Keldysh action with two Goldstone modes, describing fluctuations of the order parameter and diffusive hydrodynamics of the symmetry charge, respectively. For a particular model studied here, we uncover a transition from a symmetric phase with a "Bose surface" to a symmetry-broken phase with long-range order induced by tuning the filling. It is also shown that the long-range order of $U(1)$ symmetry breaking is possible in spatial dimension $d\geq 3$, in both weak and strong symmetry cases. Our work outline the typical scenarios of spontaneous symmetry breaking in open quantum systems, and highlights their physical consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices (and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)], and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories, and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.</description>

      <title>Fragile 3D Order in V$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$O$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.12704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) in rutile VO$_2$ has proven uniquely difficult to characterize because of the complex interplay between electron correlations and atomic structure. Here we report the discovery of the sudden collapse of three-dimensional order in the low-temperature phase of V$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$O$_2$ at $x=0.17$ and the emergence of a novel frustrated two-dimensional order at $x=0.19$, with only a slight change in electronic properties. Single crystal diffuse x-ray scattering reveals that this transition from the 3D M1 phase to a 2D variant of the M2 phase results in long-range structural correlations along symmetry-equivalent (11L) planes of the tetragonal rutile structure, yet extremely short-range correlations transverse to these planes. These findings suggest that this two-dimensionality results from a novel form of geometric frustration that is essentially structural in origin.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Gross-Neveu quantum criticality: Interaction-induced SO(3)-biadjoint insulator and emergent SU(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I point out that Gross-Neveu theory with SO(3) isospin in three spacetime dimensions -- proposed recently, for instance, as an effective description of the N\'eel transition in certain spin-orbital liquids -- also hosts quantum criticality of a more exotic kind. The ordered phase breaks SO(3) spontaneously, but the SO(3)-N\'eel order parameter vanishes. The fermionic bilinear order parameter is, instead, a biadjoint with respect to SO(3); unlike its N\'eel cousin, it constitutes an interaction-induced insulator. Furthermore, I show that the N\'eel and biadjoint order parameters can be combined to transform as an adjoint under SU(3) symmetry; the symmetry is emergent at the critical point separating the symmetric semimetal and the biadjoint insulator, but only if the flavour number is small enough, suggesting order-parameter fluctuations and the interplay between different channels play a crucial role in stabilizing the enlarged symmetry. In candidate SO(3) spin-orbital liqiuds, thermodynamic critical exponents carry fingerprints of "spinons". The existence of an independent universality class in addition to the N\'eel transition opens the possibility of posing further constraints on spinon properties from thermodynamic measurements near criticality alone.</description>

Abstract: The formalism of composite and intertwined orders has been remarkably successful in discussing the complex phase diagrams of strongly correlated materials and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we propose that composite orders are also realized in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials when lattice anisotropy is taken into account. This composite order emerges above the ferroic phase transition, and its existence is determined by the easy axis of magnetization or polarization, respectively. In multiferroic materials, where polarization and magnetization are coupled, composites of both orders are possible. This formalism of composite orders naturally accounts for magnetoelectric monopole, toroidal, and quadrupole orders. More broadly, composite orders may explain precursor phenomena in incipient (multi)ferroic materials, arising at temperatures above the ferroic phase transition and potentially contributing to the characterization of currently hidden orders.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Taming Dynamical Entanglement Growth in Purified Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement properties of purified quantum states are of key interest for two reasons. First, in quantum information theory, minimally entangled purified states define the Entanglement of Purification as a fundamental measure for the complexity of the corresponding physical mixed state. Second, dynamical entanglement growth in purified states represents the main bottleneck for calculating dynamical physical properties on classical computers in the framework of tensor network states. Here, we demonstrate how geometric methods including parallel transport may be harnessed to reduce such dynamical entanglement growth, and to obtain a general prescription for maintaining (locally) optimal entanglement entropy when time-evolving a purified state. Adapting and extending by higher order skew corrections the notion of Uhlmann geometric phases, we reveal the relation between dynamical entanglement growth and the geometry of the Hilbert-Schmidt bundle as the mathematical foundation of purified states. With benchmarks on a non-integrable spin chain model, we compare the computational performance of matrix product state algorithms based on our present geometric disentangling method to previous approaches for taming entanglement growth in purified states. Our findings provide numerical evidence that geometric disentanglers are a powerful approach, superior in various aspects to known methods for disentangling purified states in a range of physically relevant computational scenarios. To exclude the effect of algorithmic imperfections, we also provide a numerically exact analysis for systems of moderate size.</description>

Abstract: Open quantum systems display unusual phenomena not seen in closed systems, such as new topological phases and unconventional phase transitions. An interesting example was studied for a quantum spin liquid in the Kitaev model [K. Yang, S. C. Morampudi, and E. J. Bergholtz, Phys. Rev. Lett. ${\bf 126}$, 077201 (2021)]; an effective non-Hermitian Kitaev model, which incorporates dissipation effects, was shown to give rise to a gapless spin liquid state with exceptional points in the Majorana dispersions. Given that an external magnetic field induces a gapped Majorana topological state in the Hermitian case, the exceptional points may bring about intriguing quantum phenomena under a magnetic field. Here we investigate the non-Hermitian Kitaev model perturbed by the magnetic field. We show that the exceptional points remain gapless up to a finite critical magnetic field, in stark contrast to the Hermitian case where an infinitesimal field opens a gap. The gapless state is stable over a wide range of the magnetic field for some particular parameter sets, and in special cases, undergoes topological transitions to another gapless state with different winding number around the exceptional points without opening a gap. In addition, in the system with edges, we find that the non-Hermitian skin effect is induced by the magnetic field, even for the parameters where the skin effect is absent at zero field. The chirality of edge states is switched through the exceptional points, similarly to the surface Fermi arcs connected by the Weyl points in three-dimensional Weyl semimetals. Our results provide a new possible route to stabilize topological gapless quantum spin liquids under the magnetic field in the presence of dissipation.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit operator representation (via a sequential circuit and projection to symmetry subspaces) of Kramers-Wannier duality transformation in higher-dimensional subsystem symmetric models generalizing the construction in the 1D transverse-field Ising model. Using the Kramers-Wannier duality operator, we also construct the Kennedy-Tasaki transformation that maps subsystem symmetry-protected topological phases to spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking phases, where the symmetry group for the former is either $\mathbb{Z}_2\times\mathbb{Z}_2$ or $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This generalizes the recently proposed picture of one-dimensional Kennedy-Tasaki transformation as a composition of manipulations involving gauging and stacking symmetry-protected topological phases to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of excitonic quantum phase transitions describing the evolution of a bilayer metallic state to an inter-layer coherent state where excitons condense. We argue that such transitions can be continuous and exhibit a non-Fermi liquid counterflow response ${\rho_{\mathrm{counterflow}}(\omega)\sim\omega^{2/z}}$ that directly encodes the dynamical critical exponent $z$. Our calculations are performed within a controlled expansion around $z = 2$. This physics is relevant to any system with spin, valley, or layer degrees of freedom. We consider two contexts for excitonic quantum criticality: (1) a weakly interacting graphene bilayer, and (2) a system of two narrow, half-filled Chern bands at zero external magnetic field, with total Chern number $C_{\mathrm{tot}}=0$, which may soon be realizable in moir\'{e} materials. The latter system hosts a time-reversed pair of composite Fermi liquid states, and the condensation of excitons of the composite fermions leads to an exotic exciton insulator* state with a charge neutral Fermi surface. Our work sheds new light on the physics of inter-layer coherence transitions in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Vertex corrections to conductivity in the Holstein model: A numerical-analytical study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optical-conductivity profile carries information on electronic dynamics in interacting quantum many-body systems. Its computation is a formidable task that is usually approached by invoking the single-particle (bubble) approximation and neglecting the vertex corrections, the importance of which remains elusive even in model Hamiltonian calculations. Here, we combine analytical arguments with our recent breakthroughs in numerically exact and approximate calculations of finite-temperature real-time correlation functions to thoroughly assess the importance of vertex corrections in the one-dimensional Holstein polaron model. We find, both analytically and numerically, vanishing vertex corrections to optical conductivity in the limits of zero electron--phonon interaction, zero electronic bandwidth, and infinite temperature. Furthermore, our numerical results show that vertex corrections to the electron mobility also vanish in many parameter regimes between these limits. In some of these cases, the vertex corrections still introduce important qualitative changes to the optical-conductivity profile in comparison to the bubble approximation even though the self-energy remains approximately local. We trace these changes back to the bubble approximation not fully capturing a time-limited slow-down of the electron on intermediate time scales between ballistic and diffusive transport. We find that the vertex corrections are overall most pronounced for intermediate electron--phonon interaction and may increase or decrease the bubble-approximation mobility depending on the values of model parameters.</description>

The Tl and In analogues undergo a superconducting transition whereas the alkali metal analogues show charge gapping of another, not well understood type. We report the results of inelastic neutron scattering on polycrystalline In$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ ($T_c=2.85\,$K) and Rb$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ (non-superconducting) samples, which reveal a column of intensity with linear dispersion from [0 0 1/2] to [0 0 1] in both compounds. The observed temperature and |$Q$| independence together suggest the presence of unconventional carriers with a spin contribution to the excitation. This is contrary to the prevailing model for these materials, which is that they are non-magnetic. The excitation has similar dispersion and $S(Q,E,T)$ behavior as one observed in the structurally related superconducting compounds A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ and A$_2$Mo$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which has been interpreted as magnetic in origin and related to Fermi surface nesting. The connection is unexpected because the calculated Fermi surface of the arsenides differs substantially from the A$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ compounds, and many consider them distinct classes of materials. The new observation suggests a hidden link in the physics between both classes of superconductors, perhaps originating from their quasi-low-dimensional character.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic ions in the thermal Hall effect of the paramagnetic insulator TmVO$_{4}$</title>

Abstract: In a growing number of materials, phonons have been found to generate a thermal Hall effect, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Inspired by previous studies that revealed the importance of Tb$^{3+}$ ions in generating the thermal Hall effect in a family of pyrochlores, we investigated the role of Tm$^{3+}$ ions in TmVO$_{4}$, a paramagnetic insulator with a different crystal structure. We observe a negative thermal Hall conductivity in TmVO$_{4}$ with a magnitude such that the Hall angle, $|\kappa_{xy}$/$\kappa_{xx}|$, is approximately 1 x 10$^{-3}$ at $H$ = 15 T and $T$ = 20 K, typical for a phonon-generated thermal Hall effect. In contrast to the negligible $\kappa_{xy}$ found in the nonmagnetic pyrochlore analog (where the Tb$^{3+}$ ions are replaced with Y$^{3+}$), we observe a negative $\kappa_{xy}$ in YVO$_{4}$ with a Hall angle of magnitude comparable to that of TmVO$_{4}$. This shows that the Tm$^{3+}$ ions are not essential for the thermal Hall effect in this family of materials. Interestingly, at an intermediate Y concentration of $x$ = 0.3 in Tm$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$VO$_{4}$, $\kappa_{xy}$ was found to have a positive sign, pointing to the importance of impurities in the thermal Hall effect of phonons.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics in lattices above one dimension: the free fermionic case</title>

Abstract: We begin a systematic investigation of quench dynamics in higher-dimensional lattice systems considering the case of non-interacting fermions with conserved particle number. We prepare the system in a translational-invariant non-equilibrium initial state -- the simplest example being a classical configuration with fermions at fixed positions on the lattice -- and let it to evolve in time. We characterise the system's dynamics by measuring the entanglement between a finite connected region and its complement. We observe the transmutation of entanglement entropy into thermodynamic entropy and investigate how this process depends on the shape and orientation of the region with respect to the underlying lattice. Interestingly, we find that irregular regions display a distinctive multi-slope entanglement growth, while the dependence on the orientation angle is generically fairly weak. This is particularly true for regions with a large (discrete) rotational symmetry group. The main tool of our analysis is the celebrated quasiparticle picture of Calabrese and Cardy, which we generalise to describe the case at hand. Specifically, we show that for generic initial configurations (even when restricting to classical ones) one has to allow for the production of multiplets involving ${n&gt;2}$ quasiparticles and carrying non-diagonal correlations. We obtain quantitatively accurate predictions -- tested against exact numerics -- and propose an efficient Monte Carlo-based scheme to evaluate them for arbitrary connected regions of generic higher dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect arising from antiferromagnetic structure revealed by high-quality NbMnP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05058</link>

Abstract: The large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials arises from symmetry breaking equivalent to a ferromagnetic (FM) state. Consequently, this suggests that the observed AHE is induced by the intrinsic mechanism of the band structure effect, which in turn induces dissipationless transverse conductivity. Confirmation of impurity-insensitive anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is crucial to conclude this interpretation; however, experimental investigations in AF materials are limited by the lack of high quality systems. In this study, we show that the AF material NbMnP, which exhibits a large AHE, offers a high quality single crystal. Our findings clearly revealed that the large AHC and the tiny net magnetization of $\sim10^{-3} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$/Mn are inherent in this material, irrespective of disorder. NbMnP is a novel AF material that generates FM responses in the regime where there is less impurity scattering.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence rectification and high harmonic generation in molecular junctions</title>

Abstract: The field of molecular electronics has emerged from efforts to understand electron propagation through single molecules and to use them in electronic circuits. Serving as a testbed for advanced theoretical methods, it reveals a significant discrepancy between the operational time scales of experiments (static to GHz frequencies) and theoretical models (femtoseconds). Utilizing a recently developed time-linear nonequilibrium Green's functions formalism, we model molecular junctions on experimentally accessible timescales. Our study focuses on the quantum pump effect in a Benzenedithiol molecule connected to two copper electrodes and coupled with cavity photons. By calculating both electric and photonic current responses to an ac bias voltage, we observe pronounced electroluminescence and high harmonic generation in this setup. The mechanism of the latter effect is more analogous to that from solids than from isolated molecules, with even harmonics being suppressed or enhanced depending on the symmetry of the driving field.</description>
