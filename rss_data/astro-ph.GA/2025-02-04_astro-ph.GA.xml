      <title>Hypervelocity Stars Trace a Supermassive Black Hole in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypervelocity stars (HVSs) are produced by the Hills mechanism when a stellar binary is disrupted by a supermassive black hole (SMBH). The HVS Survey detected 21 unbound B-type main-sequence stars in the Milky Way's outer halo that are consistent with ejection via the Hills mechanism. We revisit the trajectories of these stars in light of proper motions from {\it Gaia} DR3 and modern constraints on the Milky Way -- Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) orbit. We find that half of the unbound HVSs discovered by the HVS Survey trace back not the Galactic Center, but to the LMC. Motivated by this finding, we construct a forward-model for HVSs ejected from an SMBH in the LMC and observed through the selection function of the HVS Survey. The predicted spatial and kinematic distributions of simulated HVSs are remarkably similar to the observed distributions. In particular, we reproduce the conspicuous angular clustering of HVSs around the constellation Leo. This clustering occurs because HVSs from the LMC are boosted by $\sim300\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}}$ by the orbital motion of the LMC, and stars launched parallel to this motion are preferentially selected as HVS candidates. We find that the birth rate and clustering of LMC HVSs cannot be explained by supernova runaways or dynamical ejection scenarios not involving a SMBH. From the ejection velocities and relative number of Magellanic vs. Galactic HVSs, we constrain the mass of the LMC SMBH to be $10^{5.8^{+0.2}_{-0.4}} M_{\odot}$ ($\simeq 6\times10^5 M_{\odot}$).</description>

      <title>Using Neural Networks to Automate the Identification of Brightest Cluster Galaxies in Large Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) lie deep within the largest gravitationally bound structures in existence. Though some cluster finding techniques identify the position of the BCG and use it as the cluster center, other techniques may not automatically include these coordinates. This can make studying BCGs in such surveys difficult, forcing researchers to either adopt oversimplified algorithms or perform cumbersome visual identification. For large surveys, there is a need for a fast and reliable way of obtaining BCG coordinates. We propose machine learning to accomplish this task and train a neural network to identify positions of candidate BCGs given no more information than multiband photometric images. We use both mock observations from The Three Hundred project and real ones from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), and we quantify the performance. Training on simulations yields a squared correlation coefficient, R$^2$, between predictions and ground truth of R$^2 \approx 0.94$ when testing on simulations, which decreases to R$^2 \approx 0.60$ when testing on real data due to discrepancies between datasets. Limiting the application of this method to real clusters more representative of the training data, such those with a BCG r-band magnitude $r_{\text{BCG}} \leq 16.5$, yields R$^2 \approx 0.99$. The method performs well up to a redshift of at least $z\approx 0.6$. We find this technique to be a promising method to automate and accelerate the identification of BCGs in large datasets.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the evolution of the MHI-M* scaling relation combining CHILES and MIGHTEE-HI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The improved sensitivity of interferometric facilities to the 21-cm line of atomic hydrogen (HI) enables studies of its properties in galaxies beyond the local Universe. In this work, we perform a 21 cm line spectral stacking analysis combining the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys in the COSMOS field to derive a robust HI-stellar mass relation at z=0.36. In particular, by stacking thousands of star-forming galaxies subdivided into stellar mass bins, we optimize the signal-to-noise ratio of targets and derive mean HI masses in the different stellar mass intervals for the investigated galaxy population. We combine spectra from the two surveys, estimate HI masses, and derive the scaling relation log10(MHI) = (0.32 +- 0.04)log10(M*) + (6.65 +- 0.36). Our findings indicate that galaxies at z=0.36 are HI richer than those at z=0, but HI poorer than those at z=1, with a slope consistent across redshift, suggesting that stellar mass does not significantly affect HI exchange mechanisms. We also observe a slower growth rate HI relative to the molecular gas, supporting the idea that the accretion of cold gas is slower than the rate of consumption of molecular gas to form stars. This study contributes to understanding the role of atomic gas in galaxy evolution and sets the stage for future development of the field in the upcoming SKA era.</description>

      <title>Caught in the Act of Quenching: A Population of Post-Starburst Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of post-starburst ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), identified through spectroscopic analysis with KCWI at the Keck II Telescope. Our analysis is based on a sample of 44 candidate UDGs selected from the Systematically Measuring Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies (SMUDGes) program. Our measured spectroscopic redshifts reveal $\sim 80\%$ of the entire KCWI sample exhibit large physical sizes ($R_{e} \gtrsim 1~{\rm kpc}$) and low surface brightnesses ($24 \lesssim \mu_{0,g} \lesssim 25$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$) which categorize them as UDGs. We find $20\%$ of the confirmed UDG population contain post-starburst (or K+A) features, characterized by minimal to no emission in H$\beta$ indicative of quenched star formation and a predominant presence of spectral A-type stars. Studying the local environments of the post-starburst UDGs, we find that half are isolated systems, including two systems that reside $2-3~R_{\rm vir}$ away from potential nearby massive hosts ($M_{\star} &gt;10^{10}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). Without the influence of external environmental mechanisms, these post-starburst UDGs may represent systems experiencing star formation feedback such that a recent burst may lead to (at least temporary) quenching. Overall, our results highlight the potentially diverse quenching pathways of UDGs in the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Linking stellar populations to HII regions across nearby galaxies. II. Infrared Reprocessed and UV Direct Radiation Pressure in HII Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation pressure is a key mechanism by which stellar feedback disrupts molecular clouds and drives HII region expansion. This includes direct radiation pressure exerted by UV photons on dust grains, pressure associated with photoionization, and infrared (IR) radiation pressure on grains due to dust-reprocessed IR photons. We present a new method that combines high resolution mid-IR luminosities from JWST-MIRI, optical attenuation and nebular line measurements from VLT-MUSE, and HST H$\alpha$-based region sizes to estimate the strength of radiation pressure in $\approx 18,000$ HII regions across 19 nearby star-forming galaxies. This is the most extensive and direct estimate of these terms beyond the Local Group to date. In the disks of galaxies, we find that the total reprocessed IR pressure is on average 5% of the direct UV radiation pressure. This fraction rises to 10% in galaxy centers. We expect reprocessed IR radiation pressure to dominate over UV radiation pressure in regions where $L_{\rm F2100W}/L_{\rm H\alpha}^{\rm corr} \gtrsim 75$. Radiation pressure due to H ionizations is lower than pressure on dust in our sample, but appears likely to dominate the radiation pressure budget in dwarf galaxies similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud. The contribution from all radiation pressure terms appears to be subdominant compared to thermal pressure from ionized gas, reinforcing the view that radiation pressure is most important in compact, heavily embedded, and young regions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manual is specific to the procedure of reducing galaxy long-slit spectroscopic data from the Boller and Chivens Spectrograph aboard the 90 inch Bok telescope at Kitt Peak National Observatory. The Image Reduction Analysis Facility (IRAF) is utilized to complete the steps of image reduction. This manual will discuss methods of removing instrumental signatures, correcting for radiation events from environmental conditions, and the data frames for wavelength calibration for the particular data presented. As a result, the reduced and calibrated image with a zoomed-in figure will present the h-alpha emission line and continuum of a galaxy.</description>

      <title>Radial Gradients and Intrinsic Scatter in MaNGA Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive stellar population parameters and their radial gradients within 0.65 R$_e$ for spatially resolved spectra of 2417 early-type galaxies from the MaNGA survey with stellar velocity dispersions ($\sigma$) between 50 kms$^{-1}$ and 340 kms$^{-1}$. We invert a grid of metallicity-composite stellar population models to find mean age and the abundances of C, N, Na, Mg, and Fe. These models have significant improvements compared to past models, including isochrones that respond to individual element abundances.
  Globally, age rises with $\sigma$ while [Fe/H] gently falls. Individual light element abundances strengthen with $\sigma$ but strengthen faster for log($\sigma$)$&gt;$2.0. [Fe/H] shows a maximum at log($\sigma$)$\approx$2.0, falling to either side. Light element [X/Fe] anticorrelate with [Fe/H]. Heterogeneity as measured by astrophysical scatter is highest in low-$\sigma$ galaxies, most dramatically for age, Fe, and N.
  For galaxy-internal parameters, age shows nearly flat radial gradients in low-$\sigma$ galaxies, slightly negative at high $\sigma$. The mean radial gradient in [Fe/H] is negative and light element [X/Fe]s fall. Intrinsic scatter in gradients is highest in high-$\sigma$ galaxies, most dramatically for age and Fe. Evidently, nearly as many galaxies form inside-out as form outside-in.
  A near-zero radial gradient in age and light elements coupled with a mild [Fe/H] gradient supports the hierarchical merging scenario for ETG evolution. IllustrisTNG hierarchical simulations reproduce the age structure we find, show the abundance slope changes at log($\sigma$)$\approx$2.0 that we observe, and exhibit flat gradients similar to those we derive, although the abundances predicted by IllustrisTNG are significantly higher than our observations overall.</description>

      <title>Correlation between formaldehyde and methanol in prestellar cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formaldehyde is a key precursor in the formation routes of many complex organic molecules (COMs) in space. It is also an intermediate step in CO hydrogenation sequence that leads to methanol formation on the surface of interstellar grains in cold dense prestellar cores where pristine ices are formed. Various chemical models successfully reproduce the COMs abundances in cold cores, however, they consistently overpredict the abundance of formaldehyde by an order of magnitude. This results in an inverse H2CO:CH3OH abundance ratios obtained in the astrochemical simulations as compared to the observed values. In this work, we present a homogeneous data set of formaldehyde observational maps obtained towards seven dense cores in the L1495 filament with the IRAM 30 m telescope. Resolving the spatial distribution of the molecules is essential to test the chemical models. We carefully estimate the formaldehyde column densities and abundances to put reliable observational constraints on the chemical models of cold cores. Through numerous tests, we aim to constrain the updated chemical model MONACO to better align with the observed formaldehyde abundance and its ratio to methanol. In particular, we elaborate on the branching ratio of the CH3 + O reaction at low temperatures. The revised MONACO model reproduces abundances of both methanol and formaldehyde within an order of magnitude. However the model tends to overproduce formaldehyde and underpredict methanol. Consequently, the model systematically overestimates the H2CO:CH3OH ratio, although it remains within an order of magnitude of the values derived from observations.</description>

      <title>Unions with UNIONS: Using galaxy-galaxy lensing to probe galaxy mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (ABRIDGED) We use galaxy-galaxy lensing to investigate how the dark matter (DM) haloes and stellar content of galaxies with $0.012 \leq z \leq 0.32$ and $10 \leq \log_{10}(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \leq 12$ change as a result of the merger process. To this end, we construct two samples of galaxies obtained from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), comprising 1 623 post-mergers and $\sim$30 000 non-merging controls, that live in low-density environments to use as our lenses. These samples are weighted to share the same distributions of stellar mass, redshift, and geometric mean distance to a galaxy's three nearest neighbours to ensure differences in the lensing signal are due to the merger process itself. We do not detect a significant difference in the excess surface density profile of post-mergers and non-merging controls with current data. Fitting haloes composed of a point-like stellar mass component and an extended DM structure described by a Navarro-Frenk-White profile to the lensing measurements yields, for both samples, halo masses of $M_\text{halo}\sim 4\times10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a moderately negative correlation between $M_\text{halo}$ and concentration $c$. . . . Extreme merger-induced starbursts, in which more than 60 percent of the stars are formed in the burst, are ruled out at the 95 per cent confidence level. Although we do not find merger-induced differences in the DM haloes and stellar content of galaxies with our current data, application of our methods to upcoming surveys that are able to provide samples $\sim$10$\times$ larger than our current catalogue are expected to detect the weak-lensing signatures of mergers and further constrain their properties.</description>

      <title>SIGNALS on the mixing of oxygen and nitrogen in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of the SIGNALS survey, which comprises a sample of approximately 40 nearby galaxies observed with the Fourier transform spectrometer SITELLE, we present a study of metal mixing in the spiral galaxy NGC 6946. Taking advantage of the blue sensitivity of our setup, we measure the oxygen and nitrogen abundances of 638 H II regions, and focus our analysis on the abundance fluctuations about the radial gradients. We detect an azimuthal variation of about 0.1 dex in these abundances across the NE spiral arm, with the leading edge being more metal-poor than the trailing edge. This result aligns with galaxy simulations, where radial gas flows along the spiral arms lead to dilution on the leading edge and enrichment on the trailing edge, due to the presence of radial metallicity gradients. Our 2D analysis reveals that oxygen and nitrogen exhibit comparable spatial correlation scales, despite the different injection energies and distinct nucleosynthetic origins -- core-collapse supernovae in the case of oxygen and primarily AGB stars for nitrogen. The observed similarity suggests that stellar processes drive these two elements into the ISM over equivalent spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Green peas in the southern sky: Broad-band color selection and spectroscopic follow up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for 1696 Green Pea (GP) galaxy candidates in the southern hemisphere selected from the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2) and provide preliminary results from spectroscopic follow-up observations of 26 targets chosen among them. Our selection criteria include the colors in $gri$-bands and compact morphology in the color composite images. The multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution fitting shows that the selected GP candidates exhibit star formation rates up to several tens $\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. With the mean stellar mass of $\mathrm{log}\,M_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot=8.6$, GP candidates are located at roughly 1 dex above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at $z\sim0.3$. Spectroscopic follow-up observations of the GP candidates with Gemini/GMOS are underway. All 26 targets are spectroscopically confirmed to be at $z=0.3-0.41$ and have [OIII] equivalent width larger than 85$\r{A}$, classified to be starbursts with low to moderate dust attenuation. These confirmed GPs show a lower metallicity offset from the mass-metallicity relation of local star-forming galaxies, indicating that GPs are less chemically evolved systems at their early stage of evolution.</description>

      <title>The survey of planetary nebulae in Andromeda (M31) VII. Predictions of a major merger simulation model compared with chemodynamical data of the disc and inner halo substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearest spiral galaxy, M31, exhibits a kinematically hot stellar disc, a global star formation episode ~2-4 Gyr ago, and conspicuous substructures in its stellar halo, suggestive of a recent accretion event. Recent chemodynamical measurements in the M31 disc and inner halo can be used as additional constraints for N-body hydrodynamical simulations that successfully reproduce the disc age-velocity dispersion relation and star formation history, together with the morphology of the inner halo substructures. We combine an available N-body hydrodynamical simulation of a major merger (mass ratio 1:4) with a well-motivated chemical model to predict abundance distributions and gradients in the merger remnant at z=0. We computed the projected phase space and the [M/H] distributions for the substructures in the M31 inner halo, i.e. the GS, the NE-, W- Shelves. We compare these chemodynamical properties of the simulated M31 remnant with recent measurements for the M31 stars in the inner halo. This major merger model predicts (i) distinct multiple components within each of the substructure; (ii) a high mean metallicity and large spread in the GS, NE- and W- Shelves, explaining various photometric and spectroscopic metallicity measurements; (iii) simulated phase space diagrams that qualitatively reproduce various features identified in the projected phase space of the substructures in published data from the DESI; (iv) a large distance spread in the GS, as suggested by previous tip of the RGB measurements, and (v) phase space ridges caused by several wraps of the secondary, as well as up-scattered main M31 disc stars, that also have plausible counterparts in the observed phase spaces. These results provide further independent arguments for a major satellite merger in M31 ~3 Gyr ago and a coherent explanation for many of the observational results that make M31 look so different from the MW.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmic Rays at AGN Jet-Driven Shock Fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is a key physical mechanism proposed to regulate star formation, primarily in massive galaxies. In particular, cosmic rays associated with AGN jets have the potential to efficiently suppress cooling flows and quench star formation. The locus of cosmic ray production and their coupling to gas play a crucial role in the overall self-regulation process. To investigate this in detail, we conduct high-resolution, non-cosmological MHD simulations of a massive $10^{14} {\rm M_\odot}$ halo using the FIRE-2 (Feedback In Realistic Environments) stellar feedback model. We explore a variety of AGN jet feedback scenarios with cosmic rays, examining different values for the cosmic ray energy fraction in jets, cosmic ray coupling sites (in the black hole vicinity versus at the large-scale jet-driven shock front), and jet precession parameters. Our findings indicate that when cosmic rays are injected near the black hole, they efficiently inhibit black hole accretion by suppressing the density before the jet propagates out to large radii. As a result, this leads to episodic black hole accretion, with the jet not having sufficient energy flux to reach large radii and impact cooling flows. Conversely, if the cosmic rays are injected at the jet-driven shock front, not only does the jet sustain a higher overall energy flux for an extended period, but it also disperses cosmic rays out to larger radii, more effectively suppressing the cooling flow. Furthermore, the period and angle of jet precession can influence the position of shock fronts. We identify an optimal range of jet precession periods ($\sim$ tens of Myr) that generates shocks at the inner circumgalactic medium, where cooling flows are most severe. We report that this specific configuration offers the most effective scenario for cosmic rays at the shock front to suppress the cooling flow and star formation.</description>

      <title>QUOKKA-based understanding of outflows (QED) -- III. Outflow loading and phase structure as a function of galactic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a suite of 3D high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of supernova-driven outflows from galactic disc regions with a range of gas surface density, metallicity, and supernova scale height. We use this suite to quantify how outflow properties -- particularly the loading factors for mass, metallicity, and energy -- vary with these parameters. We find that the winds fall into three broad categories: steady and hot, multiphase and moderately bursty, and cool and highly bursty. The first of these is characterised by efficient metal and energy loading but weak mass loading, the second by moderate loading of mass, metals, and energy, and the third by negligible metal and energy loading but substantial mass loading. The most important factor in determining the kind of wind a galaxy will produce is the ratio of supernova to gas gas scale heights, with the latter set by a combination of supernova rate, metallicity-dependent cooling rate, and the gravitational potential. These often combine in counterintuitive ways -- for example increased cooling causes cold clouds to sink into the galactic midplane more rapidly, lowering the volume-filling factor of dense gas and making the environment more favourable for strong winds. Our findings suggest that the nature of galactic winds is likely highly sensitive to phenomena such as runaway stars occuring at a large height and dense gas and are poorly captured in most simulations, and that metal loading factors for type Ia supernovae may be substantially larger than those for type II, with important implications for galactic chemical evolution.</description>

      <title>The Gravitational Wave Background from Massive Black Holes in the ASTRID Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent pulsar timing array (PTA) observations have detected nanohertz gravitational waves, likely originating from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). The detected amplitude is unexpectedly higher than inferred from the electromagnetic measurements. We present new gravitational wave background (GWB) results from the ASTRID simulation. Its large volume and on-the-fly dynamical friction for MBHs provide new insights into the MBHB population, offering a more accurate assessment of its contribution to the observed GWB. ASTRID predicts a GWB from MBHBs of $h_c=2.8\times10^{-15}$, or $\sim45\%$ of the observed amplitude at $\sim 4\,{\rm nHz}$ and $h_c=2.5\times10^{-16}$ ($5\%$) with $h_c\propto f^{-1.6}$ at $\sim 30\,{\rm nHz}$. These predictions remain below current PTA constraints but align with previous empirical models based on the observed MBH mass functions. By comparison, TNG300 with post-processed MBH dynamics yields a range between $70-90\%$ ($20\% - 30\%$) of the observed levels at low (high) frequencies. At low frequencies, ASTRID predicts that the bulk of the GWB originates from MBHB with masses $M_{\rm tot}=1-3\times 10^9\,M_\odot$ peaking at $z\approx 0.3$, consistent with TNG300. Notably, both simulations predict significant GWB contribution from minor mergers ($q&lt;0.2$) by up to $\sim 40\%$. By tracing the full merger trees of local MBHs in ASTRID, we show that they generate GWs at $\sim 10\%-80\%$ of the maximum signal assuming no accretion and recent equal-mass mergers. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of on-the-fly MBH dynamics, the lack of which leads to $3- 5$ times excessive mass growth by merger, and a similar boost to the GWB prediction.</description>

      <title>A Pristine View of Galactic Globular Clusters and their Peripheries: Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central regions of the globular cluster Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) have been extensively studied, but its outer regions and tidal structure have been less so. Gaia's astrometry uncovered substantial tidal substructure associated with $\omega$ Cen, yet the lack of chemical tagging makes these associations tenuous. In this paper, we utilise the Gaia-Synthetic CaHK-band photometry, metallicities from the Pristine survey and Gaia's astrometry to explore up to a clustercentric radius of 5 degrees from $\omega$ Cen. We identify $\omega$ Cen-like stars based on proper motion, colour-magnitude and colour-colour space, exploring the morphology, and stellar populations of the outer regions. Our probabilistic approach recovers the tidal tails of $\omega$ Cen, and we investigate the metallicity distribution of $\omega$ Cen ranging from a radius of 15 arcmin to the tidal radius, and beyond into the tidal tails. We present (1) two components between 15 arcmin and tidal radius at -1.83 and -1.45 dex which are also the dominant populations within 15 arcmin, and (2) the first evidence that the same two populations in the outer regions of the cluster are present outside the tidal radius and into the tidal tails. These populations are mixed about the stream, and are typically amongst the faintest stars in our sample; all indicating that the tidal tails are made of tidally stripped $\omega$ Cen stars.</description>

      <title>The cold neutral medium in filaments at high Galactic latitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The HI distribution at high Galactic latitudes is found to be filamentary and closely related to the far infrared (FIR) in caustics with coherent velocity structures. These structures trace the orientation of the magnetic field lines. Aims. Recent absorption observations with the Australian SKA Pathfinder Telescope have led to major improvements in our understanding of the physical properties of the cold neutral medium (CNM) at high Galactic latitudes. We use these results to explore how far the physical state of the CNM may be related with caustics in HI and FIR. Methods. We trace filamentary FIR and HI structures and probe the absorption data for coincidences in position and velocity. Results. 57 percent of the absorption positions are associated with known FIR/HI caustics, filamentary dusty structures with a coherent velocity field. The remaining part of the absorption sample is coincident in position and velocity with genuine HI filaments that are closely related to the FIR counterparts. Thus, within the current sensitivity limitations, all of the positions with HI absorption lines are associated with filamentary structures in FIR and/or HI. We summarize physical parameters for then CNM along filaments in the framework of filament velocities that have been determined from a Hessian analysis of FIR and HI emission data. Velocity deviations between absorption components and filament velocities are due to local turbulence and we determine for the observed CNM an average turbulent velocity dispersion of 2.48 &lt; delta_vturb &lt; 3.9 km/s. The CNM has a mean turbulent Mach number of Mt = 3.4 +/- 1.6 km/s. Conclusions. Most, if not all, of the CNM in the diffuse ISM at high Galactic latitudes is located in filaments, identified as caustics with the Hessian operator.</description>

      <title>The Membership and Age of the Planet-hosting Young Star IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A transiting planet was recently discovered around a star in the Taurus star-forming region, IRAS 04125+2902, making it one of the youngest known planets. The discovery paper cited two age estimates for IRAS 04125+2902, one based on a comparison to two sets of model isochrones in the Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram and a second age reported by an earlier study for a putative population in Taurus that includes IRAS 04125+2902 (D4-North). However, the model isochrones in question differ significantly for most temperatures and luminosities of young low-mass stars, and do not reproduce the observed sequences for the TW Hya and 32 Ori associations (10 and 21 Myr). Meanwhile, as found in my previous work, D4-North is a collection of field stars and fragments of several distinct Taurus groups and older associations, so its quoted age is not meaningful. The true parent population for IRAS 04125+2902 is a small group that is ~35 pc behind the L1495 and B209 clouds (B209N). I have analyzed the age of B209N through a comparison to TW Hya and 32 Ori. The M star sequences in the latter two associations have the same shapes, but the sequence for B209N is flatter, indicating that &gt;M4 stars at ages of &lt;10 Myr fade more quickly than stars at earlier types and older ages. For the one member of B209N that is earlier than M4 (IRAS 04125+2902), I estimate an age of 3.0+/-0.4 Myr based on its offsets from TW Hya and 32 Ori, which by happenstance is similar to the value derived through the comparison to model isochrones.</description>

      <title>Can the dynamo of spiral-arm galaxies be explained by anisotropic conductivity ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of generating a magnetic field by dynamo effect with anisotropic electrical conductivity rather than turbulent flow has been demonstrated theoretically (Plunian &amp; Alboussi\`ere 2020) and experimentally (Alboussi\`ere et al. 2022). If the electrical conductivity is anisotropic, the electrical currents will flow preferentially in certain directions rather than others, and a simple differential rotation will suffice to generate a magnetic field. In a galaxy with spiral arms, it is reasonable to assume that the electrical conductivity will be twice larger along the arms than in the perpendicular direction, suggesting the possibility of an anisotropic dynamo. However, a further geometrical criterion must be satisfied to obtain a dynamo (Plunian &amp; Alboussi\`ere 2022). It is given by $\Omega' \cdot\sin p &gt; 0$, where $p$ is the pitch angle of the spiral arms, with $p \in[-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]$, and $\Omega'$ is the radial shear of the angular velocity. We find that the usual spiral arms galaxies, which satisfy $|\Omega'|&lt;0$, do not satisfy this dynamo condition because they have trailing arms instead of leading arms. Even the galaxy NGC 4622, which has both trailing and leading arms, does not satisfy this dynamo condition either. This is confirmed by numerical simulations of the induction equation. Thus, for all the spiral arms galaxies known to date, the anisotropy of the spiral arms cannot explain the existence of galactic magnetic fields until further notice.</description>

      <title>Deep Constraints on [CII]158$\mu$m in JADES-GS-z14-0: Further Evidence for a Galaxy with Low Gas Content at z=14.2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present deep ALMA observations targeting the [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ line in JADES-GS-z14-0, the most distant known galaxy at z=14.1793. We do not detect the [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ line in our deep observations, implying a luminosity of $&lt;$6$\times10^7$ L$_{\odot}$ (3$\sigma$) for the target. Comparing this with the detected [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$ line, we constrain the [OIII]/[CII] ratio to be $&gt;$3.5, significantly improving our probe of the ionization parameter $U$. The observed ratio is higher than analogues in the local universe, but consistent with galaxies at $z\approx6$-9. Through ISM modeling, we infer extreme ionizing conditions with log(U)$&gt;-$2.0, likely requiring a young stellar population. Our modeling also indicates a relatively low gas density ($51_{-32}^{+116}$ cm$^{-3}$), significantly lower than expected from lower redshift trends. We infer a relatively high gas-phase metallicity (16$\pm$6\% solar) consistent with previous results and implying a rapid build-up of metals. Finally, using [CII]$_{158\mu m}\,$ as a molecular/cold gas mass tracer, we infer a low gas fraction ($f_\mathrm{gas} &lt; 0.77$), consistent with previous estimates of the dynamical mass from [OIII]$_{88\mu m}\,$. Combined with the low observed gas density, lack of dust and high ionization parameter, this suggests strong feedback processes are playing an important role in the evolution of this galaxy. Our observations show that JADES-GS-z14-0 is a rapidly evolving galaxy with extreme ISM conditions, shedding light on the earliest phases of galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Diverse Rotation Curves of Galaxies in a Simulated Universe: the Observed Dependence on Stellar Mass and Morphology Reproduced</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the IllustrisTNG cosmological hydrodynamical simulation to study the rotation curves of galaxies in the local universe. To do that, we first select the galaxies with 9.4 $&lt;$ $\log{(M_\mathrm{star}/M_\odot)}$ $&lt;$ 11.5 to make a sample comparable to that of SDSS/MaNGA observations. We then construct the two-dimensional line-of-sight velocity map and conduct the fit to determine the rotational velocity and the slope of the rotation curve in the outer region ($R_\mathrm{t}&lt;r&lt;3\times r_\mathrm{half,*}$). The outer slopes of the simulated galaxies show diverse patterns that are dependent on morphology and stellar mass. The outer slope increases as galaxies are more disky, and decreases as galaxies are more massive, except for the very massive early-type galaxies. The outer slope of the rotation curves shows a correlation with the dark matter fraction, slightly better than for the gas mass fraction. Our study demonstrates that the observed dependence of galaxy rotation curves on morphology and stellar mass can be successfully reproduced in cosmological simulations, and provides a hint that dark matter plays an important role in shaping the rotation curve. The sample of simulated galaxies in this study could serve as an important testbed for the subsequent study tracing galaxies back in time, enabling a deeper understanding of the physical origin behind the diverse rotation curves.</description>

      <title>Efficient Search for Extremely Metal Poor Galaxies in the Local Universe using Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs) allow us to study primitive galaxy formation and evolution in greater detail than is possible at high redshift. This work, for the first time, promotes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to efficiently search for XMPs in multi-band imaging data based on their predicted N2 index (N2\,$\equiv\log$\{\rNii/\Ha\}). We developed a sequential characterisation pipeline, composed of three CNN procedures: (i) a classifier for metal-poor galaxies, (ii) a classifier for XMPs, and (iii) an N2 predictor. The pipeline is applied to over 7.7 million SDSS DR17 imaging data without SDSS spectroscopy. The predicted N2 values are used to select promising candidates for observations. This approach was validated by new observations of 45 candidates with redshifts less than 0.065 using the 2.54~m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) and the 4.1~m Southern Astrophysical Research (SOAR) Telescope between 2023 and 2024. All 45 candidates are confirmed to be metal-poor, including 28 new discoveries. There are 18/45 galaxies lacking detectable \rNii\ lines ($S/N&lt;2$); for these, we report $2\sigma$ upper limits on their oxygen abundance. Our XMPs have estimated oxygen abundances of $7.1\leq$\OH$\leq8.7$ ($2\sigma$ upper limit), based on the N2 index, and 21 of them with estimated metallicity $&lt;0.1~Z_{\odot}$. Additionally, we identified 4 potential candidates of low-metallicity AGNs at $\lesssim0.1Z_{\odot}$. Finally, we found that our observed samples are mostly brighter in the $g-$band compared to other filters, similar to blueberry (BB) galaxies, resembling green pea galaxies and high-redshift Ly$\alpha$ emitters.</description>

      <title>Hyperluminous Supersoft X-ray Sources in the Chandra Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources, such as bright extragalactic sources characterized by particularly soft X-ray spectra, offer a unique opportunity to study accretion onto supermassive black holes in extreme conditions. Examples of hyperluminous supersoft sources are tidal disruption events, systems exhibiting quasi-periodic eruptions, changing-look AGN, and anomalous nuclear transients. Although these objects are rare phenomena amongst the population of X-ray sources, we developed an efficient algorithm to identify promising candidates exploiting archival observations. In this work, we present the results of a search for hyperluminous supersoft X-ray sources in the recently released Chandra catalog of serendipitous X-ray sources. This archival search has been performed via both a manual implementation of the algorithm we developed and a novel machine-learning-based approach. This search identified a new tidal disruption event, which might have occurred in an intermediate-mass black hole. This event occurred between 2001 and 2002, making it one of the first tidal disruption events ever observed by Chandra.</description>

      <title>An embedded Disk (eDisk) in the IceAge: Investigating the jet and outflow from CED 110 IRS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the large-scale structure, jet and outflow morphology, and kinematics of the Class 0/I protostellar binary Ced 110 IRS4, using JWST NIRCam (F150W and F410M) and MIRI MRS observations from the JWST ERC program IceAge, along with ALMA data from the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. NIRCam images, combined with ALMA continuum and CO data, reveal arc-like structures ($\sim$1100 au), suggesting a dense envelope around the protostars. We detect disk shadows from both protostars in F150W. The MIRI MRS IFU data reveal a jet from both protostars in multiple [Fe II] lines, [Ar II] 6.99 $\mu$m and [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m, marking the first detection of a jet from the system. The [Fe II] (5.34 $\mu$m) jet from Ced 110 IRS4A has a width of $\leq$ 51~au at the protostellar location, with a large opening angle of 23\arcdeg{} $\pm$ 4\arcdeg. After inclination correction, the jet velocity is 124 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to a dynamical timescale of 25 years. The molecular H$_2$ outflow displays a distinct morphology resembling two hemispheres placed back-to-back. The consistent H$_2$ emission extent across transitions, differing from previous observations of protostellar outflows detected with JWST, suggests that MHD disk winds may not drive the observed outflow. We find that the upper limit to the width of the outflow at the protostellar location is 130 $\pm$ 10 au which is smaller than the disk diameter of 183.4 {$\pm$ 0.4 au} but much larger than the width of the [Fe II] jet.</description>

      <title>Predicting the number density of heavy seed massive black holes due to an intense Lyman-Werner field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detections of a large number of candidate active galactic nuclei at high redshift (i.e. $z \gtrsim 4$) has increased speculation that heavy seed massive black hole formation may be a required pathway. Here we re-implement the so-called Lyman-Werner (LW) channel model of Dijkstra et al. (2014) to calculate the expected number density of massive black holes formed through this channel. We further enhance this model by extracting information relevant to the model from the $\texttt{Renaissance}$ simulation suite. $\texttt{Renaissance}$ is a high-resolution suite of simulations ideally positioned to probe the high-$z$ universe. Finally, we compare the LW-only channel against other models in the literature. We find that the LW-only channel results in a peak number density of massive black holes of approximately $\rm{10^{-4} \ cMpc^{-3}}$ at $z \sim 10$. Given the growth requirements and the duty cycle of active galactic nuclei, this means that the LW-only is likely incompatible with recent JWST measurements and can, at most, be responsible for only a small subset of high-$z$ active galactic nuclei. Other models from the literature seem therefore better positioned, at present, to explain the high frequency of massive black holes at high $z$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based Photometric Redshifts for Galaxies in the North Ecliptic Pole Wide field: catalogs of spectroscopic and photometric redshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform an MMT/Hectospec redshift survey of the North Ecliptic Pole Wide (NEPW) field covering 5.4 square degrees, and use it to estimate the photometric redshifts for the sources without spectroscopic redshifts. By combining 2572 newly measured redshifts from our survey with existing data from the literature, we create a large sample of 4421 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the NEPW field. Using this sample, we estimate photometric redshifts of 77755 sources in the band-merged catalog of the NEPW field with a random forest model. The estimated photometric redshifts are generally consistent with the spectroscopic redshifts, with a dispersion of 0.028, an outlier fraction of 7.3%, and a bias of -0.01. We find that the standard deviation of the prediction from each decision tree in the random forest model can be used to infer the fraction of catastrophic outliers and the measurement uncertainties. We test various combinations of input observables, including colors and magnitude uncertainties, and find that the details of these various combinations do not change the prediction accuracy much. As a result, we provide a catalog of 77755 sources in the NEPW field, which includes both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts up to z~2. This dataset has significant legacy value for studies in the NEPW region, especially with upcoming space missions such as JWST, Euclid, and SPHEREx.</description>

      <title>Fifteen Years of M31* X-ray Variability and Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We append an additional fifteen years (2009-2024) to the Chandra X-ray light curve of M31*, the supermassive black hole at the center of M31, the Andromeda galaxy. Extending and expanding on the work in Li et al. 2011, we show that M31* has remained in an elevated X-ray state from 2006 through at least 2016 (when regular Chandra monitoring ceased) and likely through 2024, with the most recent observations still showing an elevated X-ray flux. We identify one moderate flare in 2013 where the other nuclear X-ray sources are in low-flux states, making that flare a valuable target for followup with multiwavelength and multimessenger archival data. We extract a mostly uncontaminated spectrum for M31* from this observation, showing that its X-ray properties are similar to those observed at Sgr A* in its quiescent state by Baganoff et al. 2003. Furthermore, we find no substantial change in the source's hardness ratio in the 2006 and 2013 flares compared to the post-2006 elevated state, suggesting the these flares are increases in the regular X-ray emission mechanisms instead of entirely new emission modes. Our extended light curve for M31* provides valuable context for multimessenger or multiwavelength observations of nearby supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Stellar- and AGN-Driven Outflows in JWST Galaxies at z=3-9: Implications of More Spherical Galactic Fountains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study outflows in 130 galaxies with -22&lt;MUV&lt;-16 at z=3-9 identified in JWST NIRSpec and NIRCam WFSS data taken by the ERO, CEERS, FRESCO, GLASS, and JADES programs. We identify 30 out of the 130 galaxies with broad components of FWHM~200-700 km s$^{-1}$ in the emission lines of H${\alpha}$ and [OIII] that trace ionized outflows, and find no excesses from the star-formation main sequence. Four out of the 30 outflowing galaxies are Type-1 AGN whose H${\alpha}$ emission lines include line profile components as broad as FWHM&gt;1000 km s$^{-1}$ while one galaxy is identified as a Type-2 AGN by high ionization emission lines. With the velocity shift and line widths of the outflow broad lines, we obtain ~80-500 km s$^{-1}$ for the outflow velocities. We find that the outflow velocities are slower than low-z galaxies with similar SFRs, which may be explained by the low stellar masses of high-z galaxies. The outflow velocities of AGNs are large but not significantly different from the others. Interestingly, these outflow velocities are typically not high enough to escape from the galactic potentials, suggestive of fountain-type outflows. We estimate mass loading factors ${\eta}$ to be 0.1-1 that are not particularly large, but comparable with those of z~1 outflows. The large fraction of galaxies with outflows (30% with high resolution data) provides constraints on outflow parameters, suggesting a wide opening angle of &gt;45 deg and a large duty-cycle of &gt;30%, which gives a picture of more frequent and spherical outflows in high-z galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer occurs between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the Star Formation Main Sequence with redshift unfolded by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the correlation between stellar mass (M*) and star formation rate (SFR) across the stellar mass range log10(M*/Msun)~6-11. We consider almost 50,000 star-forming galaxies at z~3-7, leveraging data from COSMOS/SMUVS, JADES/GOODS-SOUTH, and MIDIS/XDF. This is the first study spanning such a wide stellar mass range without relying on gravitational lensing effects. We locate our galaxies on the SFR-M* plane to assess how the location of galaxies in the star-formation main sequence (MS) and starburst (SB) region evolves with stellar mass and redshift. We find that the two star-forming modes tend to converge at log10(M*/Msun) &lt; 7, with all galaxies found in the SB mode. However, deeper observations will be instrumental for reaching lower SFRs and Msun to further validate this scenario. By dissecting our galaxy sample in stellar mass and redshift, we show that the emergence of the star-formation MS is stellar-mass dependent: while in galaxies with log10(M*/Msun) &gt; 9 the MS is already well in place at z = 5-7, for galaxies with log10(M*/Msun)~7-8 it only becomes significant at z&lt;4. Overall, our results are in line with previous findings that the SB mode dominates amongst low stellar-mass galaxies. The earlier emergence of the MS for massive galaxies is consistent with galaxy downsizing.</description>

      <title>Probing 3D magnetic fields using starlight polarization and grain alignment theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization of starlight induced by dust grains aligned with the magnetic field (hereafter B-field) is widely used to measure the two-dimensional B-fields projected onto the plane-of-sky. Here, we introduce a new method to infer three-dimensional B-fields using starlight polarization. We show that the inclination angle or line-of-sight (LOS) component of B-fields can be constrained by the starlight polarization efficiency from observations, the alignment degree provided by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory, and the effect of B-field tangling. We first perform synthetic observations of starlight polarization of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a filamentary cloud with our updated POLARIS code incorporating the modern MRAT theory. We test the new technique with synthetic observations and find that the B-field inclination angles can be accurately determined by the synthetic starlight polarization efficiency once the effects of grain alignment, dust properties, and B-field fluctuations are well characterized. The technique can provide an accurate constraint on B-field inclination angles using optical polarization in low-density regions $A_{\rm V}&lt; 3$ with efficient MRAT alignment, whereas the technique can infer further to high-density regions with significant alignment loss at $A_{\rm V} \sim 8 - 30$ by using near-infrared polarization. Our new technique unlocks the full potential of tracing 3D B-fields and constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics on multiple scales of the diffuse interstellar medium and star-forming regions using multi-wavelength starlight polarization observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a detailed multiphase analysis of HZ4, a main-sequence star-forming galaxy at z ~ 5.5, known for being a turbulent rotating disk and having a detection of a [CII] outflow in the ALMA observations. We exploit JWST/NIRSpec observations in the integral field spectroscopy mode with low- and high-spectral resolution that allow us for the first time to spatially resolve the rest-frame UV and optical emission of the galaxy to investigate the galaxy properties. In particular, the high-resolution dataset allows us to study the kinematics of the ionized gas phase, and the conditions of the interstellar medium, such as the excitation mechanism, dust attenuation, and metallicity. The lower-spectral resolution observations allow us to study the continuum emission and infer the stellar populations' ages and properties. Our findings suggest that HZ4 is a galaxy merger rather than a rotating disk as previously inferred from lower resolution [CII] data. The merger is associated with an extended broad, blueshifted emission, potentially indicative of an outflow originating from a region of intense star formation and extending up to 4 kpc. In light of these new observations we reanalyzed the ALMA data to compare the multiphase gas properties. If we interpret the broad components seen in [CII] and [OIII]$\lambda$5007\.A as outflows, the neutral and ionized components are co-spatial, the mass loading factor of the ionized phase is significantly lower than that of the neutral phase, aligning with trends observed in multi-phase systems at lower redshifts. Nonetheless, additional observations and larger statistical samples are essential to determine the role of mergers and outflows in the early Universe and to clarify the origin of the broad emission components observed in this system.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam analysis of a gravitationally-lensed galaxy ($\rm \mu=17-21$) at redshift 6.14 magnified by the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS J0416. The target galaxy is overall a typical compact and UV-faint ($\rm M_{UV}=-17.8$) Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter, yet the large magnification allows the detailed characterization of structures on sub-galactic scales (down to a few parsecs). Prominent optical $\rm H\alpha$, $\rm H\beta$ and [OIII]$\lambda\lambda4959,5007$ lines are spatially resolved with the high spectral resolution grating (G395H, R~2700), with large equivalent widths, EW($\rm H\beta$+[OIII])$\gtrsim1000$ \AA, and elevated ionising photon production efficiencies $\rm log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz)=25.2-25.7$. NIRCam deep imaging reveals the presence of compact rest-UV bright regions along with individual star clusters of $\rm R_{eff}=3-8~pc$ in size and $\rm M\sim2\cdot10^5-5\cdot10^{6}~M_\odot$ in mass. These clusters are characterised by steep UV slopes, $\rm\beta_{UV}\lesssim-2.5$, which in some cases are associated with a dearth of line emission, indicating possible leaking of the ionizing radiation, as also supported by a Lyman-$\rm \alpha$ emission peaking at $\rm \sim100~km~s^{-1}$ from the systemic redshift. While the entire system is characterised by low-metallicity, $\sim0.1~Z_\odot$, the NIRSpec-IFU map also reveals the presence of a low-luminosity, metal-poor region with $\rm Z\lesssim2\%~Z_\odot$, barely detected in NIRCam imaging; this region is displaced by $\rm &gt;200~pc$ from one of the brightest structures of the system in UV, and would have been too faint to detect if not for the large magnification of the system.</description>

      <title>Two Channels of Metal-Rich Compact Stellar System Formation: Starbursts under High Ram Pressure versus Tidal Stripping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most galaxies follow well-defined scaling relations of metallicity and stellar mass; however, some outliers at the low mass end of the observed galaxy population exhibit unusually high metallicity for their mass. Understanding how these objects get to be so metal-rich is vital for understanding the role of feedback in galaxy formation. Using the TNG50 simulation, we explore the origins of this phenomenon. We identify 227 metal-rich, compact stellar systems (CSSs) that deviate significantly from this scaling relation. These CSSs are satellites located in the vicinity of massive host galaxies, with stellar masses ranging from $10^{8} M_{\odot}$ to $10^{10}\ M_{\odot}$ (including six systems that are close analogs of the M31-M32 system). Contrary to the previously assumed scenario that such objects are predominantly products of tidal stripping, our results suggest a more prevalent role for ram pressure in their formation. Indeed, 76% (173) of these CSSs are formed through a burst of star formation occurring around the time of the first pericentric passage, typically at redshifts $z\lesssim1$, aided by strong ram pressure and tidal forces. The high ram pressure, resulting from the CSSs' rapid motion near the halo center, facilitates metal enrichment, producing high-metallicity CSSs by confining the metal-rich gas from bursty star formation, which leads to distinct stellar populations characterized by enhanced metallicity as well as high $\alpha$-abundance. Only the remaining 24% (54) of metal-rich CSSs are generated through the tidal stripping of massive progenitors. Our results further indicate that M32 is more likely to have formed through intense star formation events rather than through gradual, tidal stripping, thereby providing crucial insights into the nature of low mass, compact galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Probing the rest-frame wavelength dependence of quasar variability : Insights from the Zwicky Transient Facility Survey</title>

Abstract: Quasar variability can potentially unlock crucial insights into the accretion process. Understanding how this variability is influenced by wavelength is crucial for validating and refining quasar variability models.This paper aims to enhance the understanding of the dependence of variability on the rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda_{RF}$) by isolating the variance in different timescales in well-defined wavelength bins and examining the corona-heated accretion disk (CHAR) model.
  We investigated the relation between variance and rest-frame wavelength ($\lambda_{RF}$) using optical $g$- and $r$-band light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) Data Release 15 (DR15) for $\sim 5000$ quasars within narrow ranges of the black hole mass ($M_{BH}$) and Eddington ratio ($R_{Edd}$). A spectral model taking into account disk continuum emission, Balmer transitions, Fe II pseudo-continuum emission, and other emission lines is necessary to best interpret the variance spectrum.
  Our analysis indicates a strong anticorrelation between median variance and $\lambda_{RF}$ for quasars with $M_{BH} = 10^{8} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{Edd} = 10^{-1}$ at different timescales. This anticorrelation is more pronounced at shorter timescales. The results align well with a bending power-law power spectral density (PSD) model with both the damping timescale and the high-frequency slope of the PSD depending on the wavelength. The predictions provided by the CHAR model on the variance spectrum across most timescales studied showcase its potential in constraining temperature variations within the accretion disk.

      <title>Formation of giant radio sources in galaxy clusters</title>

Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates. We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). Finally, we also study the energy transport processes of different jets. We find the "lower power-larger bubble" effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

      <title>The evolution of [OIII]$+\rm{H}\beta$ equivalent width from $\mathbf{z\simeq3-8}$: implications for the production and escape of ionizing photons during reionization</title>

Abstract: Accurately quantifying the ionizing photon production efficiency ($\xi_\rm{ion}$) of $z&gt;6$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is necessary to understand their contribution to reionization. We investigate the ionizing properties of N=279 SFGs selected at $z=6.9-7.6$ from the JWST Cycle-1 imaging programmes; PRIMER and JADES. We use BAGPIPES to consistently infer the equivalent widths of their [OIII]+$\rm{H\beta}$ emission lines ($W_\lambda$) and their physical properties. To supplement our high-redshift galaxies, we measure $W_\lambda$ photometrically for a sample of N=253 $z=3.2-3.6$ SFGs selected from the VANDELS spectroscopic survey. Comparing these samples, we find a strong apparent redshift evolution in their median $W_\lambda$, increasing from $W_\lambda =310\pm25\,\r{A}$ in VANDELS to $W_\lambda =540\pm25\,\r{A}$ in our JWST-based sample. In the JWST sample at $z&gt;7$, we find that $W_\lambda$ correlates with both stellar mass and UV luminosity, with high-mass, $M_{ UV}-$faint galaxies producing systematically weaker emission lines. Moreover, we discover a departure from the standard log-normal shape of the $W_\lambda$ distribution, characterised by a more pronounced tail at lower $W_\lambda$, consistent with increasingly bursty star formation. Using $W_\lambda$ as a proxy for $\xi_\rm{ion}$, and UV spectral slope as a proxy for LyC escape fraction ($f_\rm{esc}$), we find a minority of galaxies with high $\xi_\rm{ion}$ and $f_\rm{esc}$ (e.g., $\rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.6$ and $f_\rm{esc}\sim0.15$). However, we find that the LyC photon budget at $z&gt;7$ is dominated by galaxies with more moderate output, close to the sample median of $\rm{log(\xi_{ion}/erg^{-1}Hz})\sim25.3$ and $f_\rm{esc}\sim0.05$. This is consistent with estimates for the number of LyC photons required to power reionization at $z&gt;7$, with no evidence for over or under-production.</description>

      <title>A recent confirmation of the wide binary gravitational anomaly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concerning recent published studies exploring the presence or otherwise of a gravitational anomaly at low accelerations in wide binary stars
  as observed by the {\it Gaia} satellite, the paper published by Cookson on the subject last year presents an interesting case. In that study,
  RMS values of binned relative internal velocities in 1D for wide binaries are compared to Newtonian predictions for that quantity, with the
  author concluding that the data presented show no indication of any inconsistency with Newtonian expectations. However, the comparison presented
  is critically flawed, as the Newtonian predictions used refer to wide binaries with mean total masses of 2.0 $M_{\odot}$. This is larger than
  the 1.56 $M_{\odot}$ value which applies to the data used in said paper. In this short note we correct the error mentioned above and show that
  the data and error bars as given by Cookson are in fact inconsistent with Newtonian expectations. Contrary to the assertion in that study,
  the data presented there actually show a clear anomaly in the low acceleration gravitational regime, { with the overall slope of the
  velocity-separation scaling being inconsistent with Newtonian expectations at a 3.3$\sigma$ level.} Based on the data presented in the paper
  by Cookson, wide binary systems show a clear Milgromian deviation from Newtonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Galaxies or Cirrus? Decomposition of Galactic Cirrus in Deep Wide-Field Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00933v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffuse Galactic cirrus, or Diffuse Galactic Light (DGL), can be a prominent component in the background of deep wide-field imaging surveys. The DGL provides unique insights into the physical and radiative properties of dust grains in our Milky Way, and it also serves as a contaminant on deep images, obscuring the detection of background sources such as low surface brightness galaxies. However, it is challenging to disentangle the DGL from other components of the night sky. In this paper, we present a technique for the photometric characterization of Galactic cirrus, based on (1) extraction of its filamentary or patchy morphology and (2) incorporation of color constraints obtained from Planck thermal dust models. Our decomposition method is illustrated using a $\sim$10 deg$^2$ imaging dataset obtained by the Dragonfly Telephoto Array, and its performance is explored using various metrics which characterize the flatness of the sky background. As a concrete application of the technique, we show how removal of cirrus allows low surface brightness galaxies to be identified on cirrus-rich images. We also show how modeling the cirrus in this way allows optical DGL intensities to be determined with high radiometric precision.</description>

      <title>Galaxy evolution in the post-merger regime. III -- The triggering of active galactic nuclei peaks immediately after coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galaxy mergers have been shown to trigger AGN in the nearby universe, but the timescale over which this process happens remains unconstrained. The Multi-Model Merger Identifier (MUMMI) machine vision pipeline has been demonstrated to provide reliable predictions of time post-merger (T_PM) for galaxies selected from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared and Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) up to T_PM=1.76 Gyr after coalescence. By combining the post-mergers identified in UNIONS with pre-coalescence galaxy pairs, we can study the triggering of AGN throughout the merger sequence. AGN are identified using a range of complementary metrics: mid-IR colours, narrow emission lines and broad emission lines, which can be combined to provide insight into the demographics of dust and luminosity of the AGN population. Our main results are: 1) Regardless of the metric used, we find that the peak AGN excess (compared with a matched control sample) occurs immediately after coalescence, at 0 &lt; T_PM &lt; 0.16 Gyr. 2) The excess of AGN is observed until long after coalescence; both the mid-IR selected AGN and broad line AGN are more common than in the control sample even in the longest time bin of our sample (0.96 &lt; T_PM &lt; 1.76 Gyr). 3) The AGN excess is larger for more luminous and bolometrically dominant AGN, and we find that AGN in post-mergers are generally more luminous than secularly triggered events. 4) A deficit of broad line AGN in the pre-merger phase, that evolves into an excess in post-mergers is consistent with evolution of the covering fraction of nuclear obscuring material. Before coalescence, tidally triggered inflows increase the covering fraction of nuclear dust; in the post-merger regime feedback from the AGN clears (at least some of) this material. 5) The statistical peak in the triggering of starbursts occurs contemporaneously with AGN, within 0.16 Gyr of coalescence.</description>

      <title>Conditions for Super-Eddington Accretion onto the First Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of supermassive black holes at high redshift challenge our understanding of the evolution of the first generation of black holes (BHs) in proto-galactic environments. One possibility is that they grow much more rapidly than current estimates of feedback and accretion efficiency permit. Following our previous analysis of super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes in mini-haloes under no-feedback conditions, we now investigate whether this can be sustained when thermal feedback is included. We use four sets of cosmological simulations at sub-pc resolution with initial black hole masses varying from $1 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^4 M_\odot$, exploring a range of feedback efficiencies. We also vary the feedback injection radius to probe the threshold of numerical overcooling. We find that super-Eddington growth sustained on the order of $\sim$$100 \, \rm kyr$ is possible with very weak thermal feedback efficiency in all environments and moderate efficiency for two of the BHs. Trans-Eddington growth is possible for a $3 \times 10^3 - 6 \times 10^3 M_\odot$ BH at moderate feedback efficiencies. We discuss the effectiveness of thermal feedback in heating the gas, suppressing accretion, and driving outflows at these parameter configurations. Our results suggest that super-Eddington growth may be possible in the presence of thermal feedback for black holes formed from the first stars.</description>

Abstract: We present new radio observations of the galaxy cluster merger CIZA J0107.7+5408 (CIZA0107), a large, roughly equal mass, post-core passage, dissociative binary system at z = 0.1066. CIZA0107 is an elongated, disturbed system, hosting two subclusters with optical galaxy number density peaks offset from their associated X-ray density peaks and double-peaked diffuse radio structure. We present new 240-470 MHz and 2.0-4.0 GHz Very Large Array observations of CIZA0107. We image the diffuse emission at high resolution, constrain its integrated spectrum, and map the spectral index distribution. We confirm the presence of steep-spectrum ($\alpha$ $\sim$ -1.3) emission on a scale of about 0.5 Mpc in both subclusters. We identify two smaller ultra-steep spectrum ($\alpha$ $&lt;$ -2) regions, superimposed on larger-scale radio emission associated with the southwestern subcluster. At 340 MHz, we detect a radio edge bounding the emission to the south and show that it is coincident with a weak (M $\sim$ 1.2) shock identified in the Chandra image. At 3 GHz, the emission does not show any corresponding edge-like feature, and in fact it extends beyond the shock. We investigate the nature of the emission in CIZA0107 and find that, while the system may host a double halo structure, we cannot rule out a scenario in which the emission arises from two relics projected on the central cluster regions.</description>

      <title>H$\alpha$-X-ray Surface Brightness Correlation for Filaments in Cooling Flow Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive galaxies in cooling flow clusters display clear evidence of feedback from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Joint X-ray and radio observations have shown that AGN radio jets push aside the surrounding hot gas and form cavities in the hot intracluster medium (ICM). These systems host complex, kiloparsec-scale, multiphase filamentary structures, from warm ionized (10,000 K) to cold molecular ($&lt;$100 K). These striking clumpy filaments are believed to be a natural outcome of thermally unstable cooling from the hot ICM, likely triggered by feedback processes while contributing to feeding the AGN via Chaotic Cold Accretion (CCA). However, the detailed constraints on the formation mechanism of the filaments are still uncertain, and the connection between the different gas phases has to be fully unveiled. By leveraging a sample of seven X-ray bright cooling-flow clusters, we have discovered a tight positive correlation between the X-ray surface brightness and the H$\alpha$ surface brightness of the filaments over two orders of magnitude, as also found in stripped tails.</description>

      <title>On the abiotic origin of dimethyl sulfide: discovery of DMS in the Interstellar Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the discovery of dimethyl sulfide (CH$_3$SCH$_3$, DMS) signatures in comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, we report the first detection of this organosulfur species in the interstellar medium, during the exploration of an ultradeep molecular line survey performed toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 with the Yebes 40$\,$m and IRAM 30$\,$m telescopes. We derive a molecular column density of $N$ = (2.6 $\pm$ 0.3)$\times$10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$, yielding a fractional abundance relative to H$_2$ of $\sim$1.9$\times$10$^{-10}$. This implies that DMS is a factor of $\sim$1.6 times less abundant than its structural isomer CH$_3$CH$_2$SH and $\sim$30 times less abundant than its O-analogue dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$) toward this cloud, in excellent agreement with previous results on various O/S pairs. Furthermore, we find a remarkable resemblance between the relative abundance of DMS/CH$_3$OH in G+0.693-0.027 ($\sim$1.7$\times$10$^{-3}$) and in the comet ($\sim$1.3$\times$10$^{-3}$). Although the chemistry of DMS beyond Earth is yet to be fully disclosed, this discovery provides conclusive observational evidence on its efficient abiotic production in the interstellar medium, casting doubts about using DMS as a reliable biomarker in exoplanet science.</description>

      <title>Intervening nuclear obscuration changing the X-ray look of the $z\approx6$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the optically selected $z=6.025$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor $\gtrsim7$ from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among $z&gt;6$ QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at $z&gt;6$. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor $&gt;20$. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at $z&gt;6$ will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Making Sense of Gravitational Thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: The use of statistical methods to model gravitational systems is crucial to physics practice, but the extent to which thermodynamics and statistical mechanics genuinely apply to these systems is a contentious issue. This paper provides new conceptual foundations for gravitational thermodynamics by reconsidering the nature of key concepts like equilibrium and advancing a novel way of understanding thermodynamics. The challenges arise from the peculiar characteristics of the gravitational potential, leading to non-extensive energy and entropy, negative heat capacity, and a lack of standard equilibrium. Hence it has been claimed that only non-equilibrium statistical mechanics is warranted in this domain, whereas thermodynamics is inapplicable. We argue instead that equilibrium statistical mechanics applies to self-gravitating systems at the relevant scale, as they display equilibrium in the form of metastable quasi-equilibrium states. We then develop a minimal framework for thermodynamics that can be applied to these systems and beyond. Thermodynamics applies in the sense that we can devise macroscopic descriptions and explanations of the behaviour of these systems in terms of coarse-grained quantities like energy and temperature within equilibrium statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>Dealing with data gaps for TianQin with massive black hole binary signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors like TianQin might encounter data gaps due to factors like micrometeoroid collisions or hardware failures. Such events will cause discontinuity in the data, presenting challenges to the data analysis for TianQin, especially for massive black hole binary mergers. Since the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) accumulates in a non-linear way, a gap near the merger could lead to a significant loss of SNR. It could introduce bias in the estimate of noise properties, and the results of the parameter estimation. In this work, using simulated TianQin data with injected a massive black hole binary merger, we study the window function method, and for the first time, the inpainting method to cope with the data gap, and an iterative estimate scheme is designed to properly estimate the noise spectrum. We find that both methods can properly estimate noise and signal parameters. The easy-to-implement window function method can already perform well, except that it will sacrifice some SNR due to the adoption of the window. The inpainting method is slower, but it can minimize the impact of the data gap.</description>

      <title>X-Ray Bright Active Galactic Nuclei in Local Dwarf Galaxies: Insights from eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although supermassive black holes (SMBHs) reside in the heart of virtually every massive galaxy, it remains debated whether dwarf galaxies commonly host SMBHs. Because low-mass galaxies may retain memory of the assembly history of their black holes (BHs), probing the BH occupation fraction of local dwarf galaxies might offer insights into the growth and seeding mechanisms of the first BHs. In this work, we exploit the Western half of the eROSITA all-sky survey (covering 20,000 deg$^2$) and compile a catalog of accreting SMBHs in local ($D&lt;200$ Mpc) dwarf galaxies. Cleaning our sample from X-ray background sources, X-ray binaries, and ultraluminous X-ray sources, we identify 74 AGN-dwarf galaxy pairs. Using this large and uniform sample, we derive a luminosity function of dwarf galaxy AGN, fitting it with a power law function and obtaining dN/d$L_{\rm X} = (15.9\pm2.2)\times L_{\rm X}^{-1.63\pm0.05}$. Measuring the offset between the dwarf galaxies centroids and the X-ray sources, we find that $\approx50\%$ of the AGN are likely off-nuclear, in agreement with theoretical predictions. We compare the BH-to-stellar mass relation of our sample with the local and high-redshift relations, finding that our sources better adhere to the former, suggesting that local AGN across different mass scales underwent a similar growth history. Finally, we compare our sources with semi-analytical models: while our sample's shallowness prevents distinguishing between different seeding models, we find that the data favor models which keep SMBH in dwarf galaxies active at a moderate rate, motivating model improvement by comparison to AGN in the dwarf galaxy regime.</description>

      <title>Ray-tracing vs. Born approximation in full-sky weak lensing simulations of the MillenniumTNG project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08540v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for precision tests of cosmology. As the expected deflection angles are small, predictions based on non-linear N-body simulations are commonly computed with the Born approximation. Here we examine this assumption using ${\small DORIAN}$, a newly developed full-sky ray-tracing scheme applied to high-resolution mass-shell outputs of the two largest simulations in the MillenniumTNG suite, each with a 3000 Mpc box containing almost 1.1 trillion cold dark matter particles in addition to 16.7 billion particles representing massive neutrinos. We examine simple two-point statistics like the angular power spectrum of the convergence field, as well as statistics sensitive to higher order correlations such as peak and minimum statistics, void statistics, and Minkowski functionals of the convergence maps. Overall, we find only small differences between the Born approximation and a full ray-tracing treatment. While these are negligibly small at power-spectrum level, some higher order statistics show more sizable effects; ray-tracing is necessary to achieve percent level precision. At the resolution reached here, full-sky maps with 0.8 billion pixels and an angular resolution of 0.43 arcmin, we find that interpolation accuracy can introduce appreciable errors in ray-tracing results. We therefore implemented an interpolation method based on nonuniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFT) along with more traditional methods. Bilinear interpolation introduces significant smoothing, while nearest grid point sampling agrees well with NUFFT, at least for our fiducial source redshift, $z_s=1.0$, and for the 1 arcmin smoothing we use for higher-order statistics.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter Radio Signal from the Milky Way Electron Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Thomson-like processes between dark matter dark photons and free electrons in the Milky Way. The result is a radio signal background that can be detectable with current or future radio telescope arrays. In particular, we computed sensitivity prospects for the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) radio telescope and for the future Square Kilometer Array (SKA), concluding that unconstrained parameter space in a wide range of dark photon masses can be probed.</description>

      <title>Observational bounds on a possible electron-to-proton mass ratio variation and constraints in the lepton-specific 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we test a possible redshift variation of the electron-to-proton mass ratio, $\mu = m_e/m_p$, directly from galaxy cluster gas mass fraction measurements and type Ia supernovae observations. Our result reveals no variation of $\mu$ within 1~$\sigma$. From the point of view of Particle Physics, we can use the precision on these results to constrain the parameter space of models beyond the Standard Model of electroweak interactions. We exemplify this by focusing on a specific Two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM), where the second scalar doublet couples exclusively to leptons. An important parameter in the model concerns the ratio between its vacuum expectation values, defined by $\tan\beta\equiv v_2/v_1$. In our approach, we can constrain the inverse parameter $(\cot\beta)$ to an optimal value, $(\cot\beta)= (2.003 \pm 0.081)\cdot 10^{-3}$, with the highest vacuum expectation value for 2HDM, $v_2$, estimated at around $240.57 \pm 2.93$~GeV. Also, by taking into account the discrepancy in the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon found between theory and experiment, we can reduce the validity region for this model and establish bounds on the scalar masses, in light of our findings from galaxy cluster data for $\mu$. This study contributes valuable insights to the understanding of the interface between Particle Physics and Astrophysics, establishing a new interrelationship between data on the large-scale structure of the Universe and subatomic Physics.</description>

      <title>Stellar Loci. VIII. Photometric Metallicities for 100 Million Stars Based on Synthetic Gaia Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19895v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the stellar locus method to synthetic $(BP-RP)_{XPSP}$ and $(BP-G)_{XPSP}$ colors derived from corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra to obtain precise estimates of metallicity for about 100 million stars in the Milky Way (34 million giants in the color range $0.6 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.75$ and 65 million dwarfs in the color range $0.2 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.5$). The sub milli-magnitude precision of the derived synthetic stellar colors enables estimates of metallicity for stars as low as [Fe/H] $\sim -4$. Multiple validation tests indicate that the typical metallicity precision is between 0.05 -- 0.1 dex for both dwarfs and giants at [Fe/H] = 0 as faint as G $\sim$ 16, and decreases to 0.15 -- 0.25 dex at [Fe/H] = $-$2.0. For $-4.0 &lt; $[Fe/H]$&lt; -3.0$, the typical metallicity precision decreases to on the order of 0.4 -- 0.5 dex, based on the results from the reference sample. Our achieved precision is comparable to or better than previous efforts using the entire XP spectra, and about three times better than our previous work based on Gaia EDR3 colors. This opens up new opportunities for investigations of stellar populations, the formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the chemistry of stars and star clusters, and the identification of candidate stars for subsequent high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up. The catalog is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.12149/101548.</description>

      <title>Can Dark Stars account for the star formation efficiency excess at very high redshifts?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has recently conducted observations of massive galaxies at high redshifts, revealing a notable anomaly in their star formation efficiency (SFE). Motivated by the recent identification of three $\sim 10^{6}M_\odot$ dark star candidates, we investigate whether dark stars can be the origin of the SFE excess. It turns out that the excess can be reproduced by a group of dark stars with $M \gtrsim 10^{3}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, because of their domination in generating primary UV radiation in high-redshift galaxies. The genesis of these dark stars is attributed to the capture of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) within a mass range of tens of GeV to a few TeV. However, if the top-heavy initial mass function of dark stars holds up to $\sim 10^{5}M_\odot$, the relic black holes stemming from their collapse would be too abundant to be consistent with the current observations of Massive Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs). We thus suggest that just a small fraction of SFE excess may be contributed by the very massive dark stars and the majority likely originated from other reasons such as the Population III stars in view of their rather similar UV radiation efficiencies.</description>
