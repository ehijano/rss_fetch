      <title>Diagnostics of the condensate fraction in a clustered supersonic argon jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new method for determining the condensate fraction and cluster density in absolute units has been proposed and tested for a supersonic argon jet, which can also be applied to supersonic jets of other gases. The method is based on measuring the absolute intensities of the Ar II resonance lines (93.2 and 92.0 nm) when the supersonic jet is excited by an electron beam with constant current density. Knowing the absolute intensities of the lines and their emission cross sections, we determined the density of the noncondensed atomic component in the supersonic argon jet and the evolution of the condensate fraction over the whole temperature range investigated.</description>

      <title>Imaging transient molecular configurations in UV-excited diiodomethane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtosecond structural dynamics of diiodomethane ($\mathrm{CH_2I_2}$) triggered by ultraviolet (UV) photoabsorption at 290 nm and 330 nm are studied using time-resolved coincident Coulomb explosion imaging driven by a near-infrared probe pulse. We map the dominant single-photon process, the cleavage of the carbon-iodine bond producing rotationally excited $\mathrm{CH_2I}$ radical, identify the contributions of the three-body ($\mathrm{CH_2} + \mathrm{I} + \mathrm{I}$) dissociation and molecular iodine formation channels, which are primarily driven by the absorption of more than one UV photon, and demonstrate the existence of a weak reaction pathway involving the formation of short-lived transient species resembling iso-$\mathrm{CH_2I{-}I}$ geometries with a slightly shorter I-I separation compared to the ground-state $\mathrm{CH_2I_2}$. These transient molecular configurations, which can be separated from the other channels by applying a set of conditions on the correlated momenta of three ionic fragments, are formed within approximately 100 fs after the initial photoexcitation and decay within the next 100 fs.</description>

      <title>High- and low-energy many-body effects of graphene in a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the many-body features of graphene band structure and electronic response can be accurately evaluated by applying many-body perturbation theory to a tight-binding (TB) model. In particular, we compare TB results for the optical conductivity with previous ab-initio calculations, showing a nearly perfect agreement both in the low energy region near the Dirac cone ($\sim 100$ meV), and at the higher energies of the {\pi} plasmon ($\sim 5$ eV). A reasonable agreement is reached also for the density-density response at the Brillouin zone corner. With the help of the reduced computational cost of the TB model, we study the effect of self-consistency on the screened interaction (W) and on the quasi-particle corrections, a task that is not yet achievable in ab-initio frameworks. We find that self-consistency is important to reproduce the experimental results on the divergence of the Fermi velocity, while it marginally affects the optical conductivity. Finally, we study the robustness of our results against doping or the introduction of a uniform dielectric environment.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous imaging of vibrational, rotational, and electronic wave packet dynamics in a triatomic molecule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light-induced molecular dynamics often involve the excitation of several electronic, vibrational, and rotational states. Since the ensuing electronic and nuclear motion determines the pathways and outcomes of photoinduced reactions, our ability to monitor and understand these dynamics is crucial for molecular physics, physical chemistry, and photobiology. However, characterizing this complex motion represents a significant challenge when different degrees of freedom are strongly coupled. In this Letter, we demonstrate how the interplay between vibrational, rotational, and electronic degrees of freedom governs the evolution of molecular wave packets in the low-lying states of strong-field-ionized sulfur dioxide. Using time-resolved Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) and quantum mechanical wave packet simulations, we directly map the bending vibrations of the molecule, show how the vibrational wave packet is influenced by molecular alignment, and elucidate the consequences of nuclear motion for the coupling between the two lowest electronic states of the cation. Our results demonstrate that multi-coincident CEI can be an efficient experimental tool for characterizing coupled electronic and nuclear motion in polyatomic molecules.</description>
