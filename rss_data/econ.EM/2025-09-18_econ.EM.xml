      <title>Generalized Covariance Estimator under Misspecification and Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the Generalized Covariance (GCov) estimator under misspecification and constraints with application to processes with local explosive patterns, such as causal-noncausal and double autoregressive (DAR) processes. We show that GCov is consistent and has an asymptotically Normal distribution under misspecification. Then, we construct GCov-based Wald-type and score-type tests to test one specification against the other, all of which follow a $\chi^2$ distribution. Furthermore, we propose the constrained GCov (CGCov) estimator, which extends the use of the GCov estimator to a broader range of models with constraints on their parameters. We investigate the asymptotic distribution of the CGCov estimator when the true parameters are far from the boundary and on the boundary of the parameter space. We validate the finite sample performance of the proposed estimators and tests in the context of causal-noncausal and DAR models. Finally, we provide two empirical applications by applying the noncausal model to the final energy demand commodity index and also the DAR model to the US 3-month treasury bill.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Heterogeneous Treatment Effects in Event Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the identification and estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects in event studies, emphasizing the importance of both lagged dependent variables and treatment effect heterogeneity. We show that omitting lagged dependent variables can induce omitted variable bias in the estimated time-varying treatment effects. We develop a novel semiparametric approach based on a short-T dynamic linear panel model with correlated random coefficients, where the time-varying heterogeneous treatment effects can be modeled by a time-series process to reduce dimensionality. We construct a two-step estimator employing quasi-maximum likelihood for common parameters and empirical Bayes for the heterogeneous treatment effects. The procedure is flexible, easy to implement, and achieves ratio optimality asymptotically. Our results also provide insights into common assumptions in the event study literature, such as no anticipation, homogeneous treatment effects across treatment timing cohorts, and state dependence structure.</description>

      <title>Distributional Treatment Effect with Latent Rank Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treatment effect heterogeneity is of a great concern when evaluating policy impact: "is the treatment Pareto-improving?", "what is the proportion of people who are better off under the treatment?", etc. However, even in the simple case of a binary random treatment, existing analysis has been mostly limited to an average treatment effect or a quantile treatment effect, due to the fundamental limitation that we cannot simultaneously observe both treated potential outcome and untreated potential outcome for a given unit. This paper assumes a conditional independence assumption that the two potential outcomes are independent of each other given a scalar latent variable. With a specific example of strictly increasing conditional expectation, I label the latent variable as 'latent rank' and motivate the identifying assumption as 'latent rank invariance.' In implementation, I assume a finite support on the latent variable and propose an estimation strategy based on a nonnegative matrix factorization. A limiting distribution is derived for the distributional treatment effect estimator, using Neyman orthogonality.</description>

      <title>From Predictive Algorithms to Automatic Generation of Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How can we extract theoretical insights from machine learning algorithms? We take a familiar lesson: researchers often turn their intuitions into theoretical insights by constructing "anomalies" -- specific examples highlighting hypothesized flaws in a theory, such as the Allais paradox and the Kahneman-Tversky choice experiments for expected utility. We develop procedures that replace researchers' intuitions with predictive algorithms: given a predictive algorithm and a theory, our procedures automatically generate anomalies for that theory. We illustrate our procedures with a concrete application: generating anomalies for expected utility theory. Based on a neural network that accurately predicts lottery choices, our procedures recover known anomalies for expected utility theory and discover new ones absent from existing work. In incentivized experiments, subjects violate expected utility theory on these algorithmically generated anomalies at rates similar to the Allais paradox and common ratio effect.</description>

      <title>Canonical correlation analysis of stochastic trends via functional approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for semiparametric inference on the number $s$ of common trends and their loading matrix $\psi$ in $I(1)/I(0)$ systems. It combines functional approximation of limits of random walks and canonical correlations analysis, performed between the $p$ observed time series of length $T$ and the first $K$ discretized elements of an $L^2$ basis. Tests and selection criteria on $s$, and estimators and tests on $\psi$ are proposed; their properties are discussed as $T$ and $K$ diverge sequentially for fixed $p$ and $s$. It is found that tests on $s$ are asymptotically pivotal, selection criteria of $s$ are consistent, estimators of $\psi$ are $T$-consistent, mixed-Gaussian and efficient, so that Wald tests on $\psi$ are asymptotically Normal or $\chi^2$. The paper also discusses asymptotically pivotal misspecification tests for checking model assumptions. The approach can be coherently applied to subsets or aggregations of variables in a given panel. Monte Carlo simulations show that these tools have reasonable performance for $T\geq 10 p$ and $p\leq 300$. An empirical analysis of 20 exchange rates illustrates the methods.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Averaging in Causal Instrumental Variable Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13520v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instrumental variables are a popular tool to infer causal effects under unobserved confounding, but choosing suitable instruments is challenging in practice. We propose gIVBMA, a Bayesian model averaging procedure that addresses this challenge by averaging across different sets of instrumental variables and covariates in a structural equation model. Our approach extends previous work through a scale-invariant prior structure and accommodates non-Gaussian outcomes and treatments, offering greater flexibility than existing methods. The computational strategy uses conditional Bayes factors to update models separately for the outcome and treatments. We prove that this model selection procedure is consistent. By explicitly accounting for model uncertainty, gIVBMA allows instruments and covariates to switch roles and provides robustness against invalid instruments. In simulation experiments, gIVBMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate its usefulness in two empirical applications: the effects of malaria and institutions on income per capita and the returns to schooling. A software implementation of gIVBMA is available in Julia.</description>

      <title>Anytime-Valid Inference in Adaptive Experiments: Covariate Adjustment and Balanced Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive experiments such as multi-armed bandits offer efficiency gains over traditional randomized experiments but pose two major challenges: invalid inference on the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) due to adaptive sampling and low statistical power for sub-optimal treatments. We address both issues by extending the Mixture Adaptive Design framework (arXiv:2311.05794). First, we propose MADCovar, a covariate-adjusted ATE estimator that is unbiased and preserves anytime-valid inference guarantees while substantially improving ATE precision. Second, we introduce MADMod, which dynamically reallocates samples to underpowered arms, enabling more balanced statistical power across treatments without sacrificing valid inference. Both methods retain MAD's core advantage of constructing asymptotic confidence sequences (CSs) that allow researchers to continuously monitor ATE estimates and stop data collection once a desired precision or significance criterion is met. Empirically, we validate both methods using simulations and real-world data. In simulations, MADCovar reduces CS width by up to $60\%$ relative to MAD. In a large-scale political RCT with $\approx32,000$ participants, MADCovar achieves similar precision gains. MADMod improves statistical power and inferential precision across all treatment arms, particularly for suboptimal treatments. Simulations show that MADMod sharply reduces Type II error while preserving the efficiency benefits of adaptive allocation. Together, MADCovar and MADMod make adaptive experiments more practical, reliable, and efficient for applied researchers across many domains. Our proposed methods are implemented through an open-source software package.</description>
