      <title>Generalisation of the Navier-slip boundary condition to arbitrary directions: Application to 3D oblique geodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although boundary conditions are mandatory to solve partial differential equations, they also represent a transfer of information between the domain being modelled and its surroundings. In the case of isolated or closed systems, these can be formulated using free- or no-slip conditions. However, for open systems, the information transferred through the boundaries is essential to the dynamics of the system and can have a first order impact on its evolution. This work addresses regional geodynamic modelling simulating the evolution of an Earth's piece over millions of years by solving non-linear Stokes flow. In this open system, we introduce a new approach to impose oblique boundary conditions generalising the Navier-slip boundary conditions to arbitrary directions in 3D. The method requires defining both slip and stress constraints. The stress constraint is imposed utilising a coordinate transformation to redefine the stress tensor along the boundaries according to the arbitrary direction chosen while for the slip constraint we utilise Nitsche's method in the context of the finite element method, resulting in a symmetrised and penalised weak form. We validate our approach through a series of numerical experiments of increasing complexity, starting with 2D and 3D linear models. Then, we apply those boundary conditions to a 3D non-linear geodynamic model of oblique extension that we compare with a standard model utilising Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our results show that using Dirichlet boundary conditions strongly influences the evolution of the system and generates artefacts near and along the boundaries. In comparison, the model using the generalised Navier-slip boundary conditions behaves closely to a model with an unbounded domain, providing a physically interpretable solution near and along the boundaries.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing tracer transport in convective penetration of a stably stratified layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use large-eddy simulations to study the penetration of a buoyant plume carrying a passive tracer into a stably stratified layer with constant buoyancy frequency. Using a buoyancy-tracer volume distribution, we develop a method for objectively partitioning plume fluid in buoyancy-tracer space into three regions, each of which corresponds to a coherent region in physical space. Specifically, we identify a source region where undiluted plume fluid enters the stratified layer, a transport region where much of the transition from undiluted to mixed fluid occurs in the plume cap, and an accumulation region corresponding to a radially spreading intrusion. This method enables quantification of different measures of turbulence and mixing within each of the three regions, including potential energy and turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rates, an activity parameter, and the instantaneous mixing efficiency. We find that the most intense buoyancy gradients lie in a thin layer at the cap of the penetrating plume. This provides the primary stage of mixing between plume and environment and exhibits a mixing efficiency around 50%. Newly generated mixtures of environmental and plume fluid join the intrusion and experience relatively weak turbulence and buoyancy gradients. As the intrusion spreads radially, environmental fluid surrounding the intrusion is mixed into the intrusion with moderate mixing efficiency. This dominates the volume of environmental fluid entrained into the region containing plume fluid. However, the 'strongest' entrainment, as measured by the specific entrainment rate, is largest in the plume cap where the most buoyant environmental fluid is entrained.</description>

      <title>Source regions of carbonaceous meteorites and NEOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present work aims to determine the source regions of carbonaceous chondrites (CM, CI, CO, CV, CK, CR, CH, CB, or C-ungrouped). We studied 38 individual asteroid families, including young and old ones, and determined their contributions to the NEO populations at metre and kilometre sizes using collisional and orbital models. Our models are in agreement with spectroscopic observations of NEOs, cosmic-ray exposure ages of meteorites, statistics of bolides, infrared emission from dust bands, composition of interplanetary dust particles (IDPs), or abundance of extraterrestrial helium-3. We identified the Veritas, Polana and Eos families as the primary sources of CM/CR, CI and CO/CV/CK chondrites, respectively. Substantial contributions are also expected from CM-like K\"onig and CI-like Clarissa, Misa and Hoffmeister families. The source regions of kilometre-sized bodies are generally different. The Adeona family is by far the main source of CM-like NEOs, whereas the Polana (low-i) and Euphrosyne (high-i) families are at the origin of most CI-like NEOs. The Polana family is the likely source of both Ryugu and Bennu. We were able to link spectroscopically and dynamically several NEOs to the Baptistina family. Finally, it appears that the pre-atmospheric flux of carbonaceous chondrites at metre sizes is about the same as that of ordinary chondrites. Given the difference in fall statistics between the two groups (80\% versus 4.4\%), this implies either substantial atmospheric fragmentation of carbonaceous bodies at the level of ${\sim}0.5\,{\rm MPa}$, or destruction by thermal cracking and water desorption. The source regions of most meteorites and kilometre-sized NEOs have now been determined; including some minor classes like enstatite chondrites and achondrites (Nysa, Hungaria), acapulcoites/lodranites (Iannini).</description>
