      <title>A Computational Framework and Implementation of Implicit Priors in Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving Bayesian inverse problems typically involves deriving a posterior distribution using Bayes' rule, followed by sampling from this posterior for analysis. Sampling methods, such as general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), are commonly used, but they require prior and likelihood densities to be explicitly provided. In cases where expressing the prior explicitly is challenging, implicit priors offer an alternative, encoding prior information indirectly. These priors have gained increased interest in recent years, with methods like Plug-and-Play (PnP) priors and Regularized Linear Randomize-then-Optimize (RLRTO) providing computationally efficient alternatives to standard MCMC algorithms. However, the abstract concept of implicit priors for Bayesian inverse problems is yet to be systematically explored and little effort has been made to unify different kinds of implicit priors. This paper presents a computational framework for implicit priors and their distinction from explicit priors. We also introduce an implementation of various implicit priors within the CUQIpy Python package for Computational Uncertainty Quantification in Inverse Problems. Using this implementation, we showcase several implicit prior techniques by applying them to a variety of different inverse problems from image processing to parameter estimation in partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>pySigLib -- Fast Signature-Based Computations on CPU and GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signature-based methods have recently gained significant traction in machine learning for sequential data. In particular, signature kernels have emerged as powerful discriminators and training losses for generative models on time-series, notably in quantitative finance. However, existing implementations do not scale to the dataset sizes and sequence lengths encountered in practice. We present pySigLib, a high-performance Python library offering optimised implementations of signatures and signature kernels on CPU and GPU, fully compatible with PyTorch's automatic differentiation. Beyond an efficient software stack for large-scale signature-based computation, we introduce a novel differentiation scheme for signature kernels that delivers accurate gradients at a fraction of the runtime of existing libraries.</description>
