      <title>Neuralized Fermionic Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a class of neuralized fermionic tensor network states (NN-fTNS) that introduce non-linearity into fermionic tensor networks through configuration-dependent neural network transformations of the local tensors. The construction uses the fTNS algebra to implement a natural fermionic sign structure and is compatible with standard tensor network algorithms, but gains enhanced expressivity through the neural network parametrization. Using the 1D and 2D Fermi-Hubbard models as benchmarks, we demonstrate that NN-fTNS achieve order of magnitude improvements in the ground-state energy compared to pure fTNS with the same bond dimension, and can be systematically improved through both the tensor network bond dimension and the neural network parametrization. Compared to existing fermionic neural quantum states (NQS) based on Slater determinants and Pfaffians, NN-fTNS offer a physically motivated alternative fermionic structure. Furthermore, compared to such states, NN-fTNS naturally exhibit improved computational scaling and we demonstrate a construction that achieves linear scaling with the lattice size.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Origin of Native Ring Anisotropy in Amorphous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Native ring structures within amorphous networks play a critical role in determining structural and optical properties, in part due to their ability to host dopants such as rare earth ions in silicate systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the universal features of structural anisotropy in amorphous networks can be efficiently simulated using a model based on stochastically deformed, edge sharing N member native ring structures. This model isolates and characterizes the structural anisotropy generated during the annealing quenching process that is independent of any constituent specific interactions. We refer to this computational framework as Indistinguishable Simulated Folding (ISF), a stochastic process that mimics a simulated annealing quenching procedure. Formulated as a Markov process, ISF is governed by two physically meaningful parameters: the number of Markov steps, representing the mean duration of each ring folding event, and the stochastic deformation magnitude, which quantifies thermally induced structural changes per event. Furthermore, we show that the logarithm of any positive valued anisotropy measure generated by ISF is a skewed random variable, reflecting the growing entropy production rate during the Markov evolution. ISF provides both a conceptual framework for understanding the universal stochastic origin of structural anisotropy in amorphous networks and a practical tool for simulating constituent independent features, without requiring full scale molecular dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectroscopic fingerprints of disorder in an incompressible magnetic state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disorder significantly impacts the electronic properties of conducting quantum materials by inducing electron localization and thus altering the local density of states and electric transport. In insulating quantum magnetic materials the effects of disorder are less understood and can drastically impact fluctuating spin states like quantum spin liquids. In the absence of transport tools, disorder is typically characterized using chemical methods or by semi-classical modeling of spin dynamics. This requires high magnetic fields that may not always be accessible. Here, we show that magnetization plateaus -- incompressible states found in many quantum magnets -- provide an exquisite platform to uncover otherwise undetectable amounts of disorder, regardless of the origin of the plateau. Using optical magneto-spectroscopy on the Ising-Heisenberg triangular-lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$ exhibiting a 1/3 magnetization plateau, we identify sharp spectroscopic lines, the fine structure of which serves as a hallmark signature of disorder. Through analytical and numerical modeling, we show that these fingerprints not only enable us to quantify minute amounts of disorder but also reveal its nature -- as dilute vacancies. Remarkably, this model explains all details of the thermomagnetic response of our system, including the existence of multiple plateaus. Our findings provide a new approach to identifying disorder in quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Correcting a noisy quantum computer using a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers require error correction to achieve universal quantum computing. However, current decoding of quantum error-correcting codes relies on classical computation, which is slower than quantum operations in superconducting qubits. This discrepancy makes the practical implementation of real-time quantum error correction challenging. In this work, we propose a decoding scheme that leverages the operations of the quantum circuit itself. Given a noisy quantum circuit $A$, we train a decoding quantum circuit $B$ using syndrome measurements to identify the logical operators needed to correct errors in circuit $A$. The trained quantum circuit $B$ can be deployed on quantum devices, such as superconducting qubits, to perform real-time decoding and error correction. Our approach is applicable to general quantum codes with multiple logical qubits and operates efficiently under various noise conditions, and the decoding speed matches the speed of the quantum circuits being corrected. We have conducted numerical experiments using surface codes up to distance 7 under circuit-level noise, demonstrating performance on par with the classical minimum-weight perfect matching algorithm. Interestingly, our method reveals that the traditionally classical task of decoding error-correcting codes can be accomplished without classical devices or measurements. This insight paves the way for the development of self-correcting quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Developing a Neural Network Machine Learning Interatomic Potential for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of La-Si-P Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While molecular dynamics (MD) is a very useful computational method for atomistic simulations, modeling the interatomic interactions for reliable MD simulations of real materials has been a long-standing challenge. In 2007, Behler and Perrinello first proposed and demonstrated an artificial neural network machine learning (ANN-ML) scheme, opening a new paradigm for developing accurate and efficient interatomic potentials for reliable MD simulation studies of the thermodynamics and kinetics of materials. In this paper, we show that an accurate and transferable ANN-ML interatomic potential can be developed for MD simulations of La-Si-P system. The crucial role of training data in the ML potential development is discussed. The developed ANN-ML potential accurately describes not only the energy versus volume curves for all the known elemental, binary, and ternary crystalline structures in La-Si-P system, but also the structures of La-Si-P liquids with various compositions. Using the developed ANN-ML potential, the melting temperatures of several crystalline phases in La-Si-P system are predicted by the coexistence of solid-liquid phases from MD simulations. While the ANN-ML model systematically underestimates the melting temperatures of these phases, the overall trend agrees with experiment. The developed ANN-ML potential is also applied to study the nucleation and growth of LaP as a function of different relative concentrations of Si and P in the La-Si-P liquid, and the obtained results are consistent with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic flat-band model constructed by molecular-orbital representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a tight-binding model that hosts both a quasi-periodic nature and marcoscopically-dengenerate zero-energy modes. The model can be regarded as a counterpart of the Aubry-Andr\'{e}-Harper (AAH) model, which is a paradigmatic example of the quasi-periodic tight-binding model. Our main focus is on the many-body state where the flat-band-like degenerate zero-energy modes are fully occupied. We find a characteristic sublattice dependence of the particle density distribution. Further, by analyzing the hyperuniformity of the particle density distribution, we find that it belongs to the class-I hyperuniform distribution, regardless of the model parameter. We also show that, upon changing the parameter, the finite-energy modes exhibit the same extended-to-localized transition as that for the original AAH model.</description>

      <title>Leveraging chaos in the training of artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional algorithms to optimize artificial neural networks when confronted with a supervised learning task are usually exploitation-type relaxational dynamics such as gradient descent (GD). Here, we explore the dynamics of the neural network trajectory along training for unconventionally large learning rates. We show that for a region of values of the learning rate, the GD optimization shifts away from purely exploitation-like algorithm into a regime of exploration-exploitation balance, as the neural network is still capable of learning but the trajectory shows sensitive dependence on initial conditions -- as characterized by positive network maximum Lyapunov exponent --. Interestingly, the characteristic training time required to reach an acceptable accuracy in the test set reaches a minimum precisely in such learning rate region, further suggesting that one can accelerate the training of artificial neural networks by locating at the onset of chaos. Our results -- initially illustrated for the MNIST classification task -- qualitatively hold for a range of supervised learning tasks, learning architectures and other hyperparameters, and showcase the emergent, constructive role of transient chaotic dynamics in the training of artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>Solving excited states for long-range interacting trapped ions with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of excited states in strongly interacting quantum many-body systems is of fundamental importance. Yet, it is notoriously challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the system size. Here, we introduce a neural network-based algorithm that can simultaneously output multiple low-lying excited states of a quantum many-body spin system in an accurate and efficient fashion. This algorithm, dubbed the neural quantum excited-state (NQES) algorithm, requires no explicit orthogonalization of the states and is generally applicable to higher dimensions. We demonstrate, through concrete examples including the Haldane-Shastry model with all-to-all interactions, that the NQES algorithm is capable of efficiently computing multiple excited states and their related observable expectations. In addition, we apply the NQES algorithm to two classes of long-range interacting trapped-ion systems in a two-dimensional Wigner crystal. For non-decaying all-to-all interactions with alternating signs, our computed low-lying excited states bear spatial correlation patterns similar to those of the ground states, which closely match recent experimental observations that the quasi-adiabatically prepared state accurately reproduces analytical ground-state correlations. For a system of up to 300 ions with power-law decaying antiferromagnetic interactions, we successfully uncover its gap scaling and correlation features. Our results establish a scalable and efficient algorithm for computing excited states of interacting quantum many-body systems, which holds potential applications ranging from benchmarking quantum devices to photoisomerization.</description>

      <title>How transformers learn structured data: insights from hierarchical filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the learning process and the embedded computation in transformers is becoming a central goal for the development of interpretable AI. In the present study, we introduce a hierarchical filtering procedure for data models of sequences on trees, allowing us to hand-tune the range of positional correlations in the data. Leveraging this controlled setting, we provide evidence that vanilla encoder-only transformers can approximate the exact inference algorithm when trained on root classification and masked language modeling tasks, and study how this computation is discovered and implemented. We find that correlations at larger distances, corresponding to increasing layers of the hierarchy, are sequentially included by the network during training. By comparing attention maps from models trained with varying degrees of filtering and by probing the different encoder levels, we find clear evidence of a reconstruction of correlations on successive length scales corresponding to the various levels of the hierarchy, which we relate to a plausible implementation of the exact inference algorithm within the same architecture.</description>

Abstract: We propose a universal framework for classifying quantum states based on their scale-resolved correlation structure. Using the recently introduced information lattice, which provides an operational definition of the total amount of correlations at each scale, we define intrinsic characteristic length scales of quantum states. We analyze ground and midspectrum eigenstates of the disordered interacting Kitaev chain, showing that our framework provides a novel unbiased approach to quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks with nodes and links. Often the nodes are segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here, by means of numerical simulations, I show that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_ \kappa$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. Using the stochastic block model and Infomap methods for community detection, I show that networks generated by local rules have finite $r_ \kappa$ values while their randomized versions do not have emergent communities. I conjecture that network communities are an emergent property of networks evolving with local rules.</description>

      <title>Optimal Spectral Transitions in High-Dimensional Multi-Index Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of how many samples from a Gaussian multi-index model are required to weakly reconstruct the relevant index subspace. Despite its increasing popularity as a testbed for investigating the computational complexity of neural networks, results beyond the single-index setting remain elusive. In this work, we introduce spectral algorithms based on the linearization of a message passing scheme tailored to this problem. Our main contribution is to show that the proposed methods achieve the optimal reconstruction threshold. Leveraging a high-dimensional characterization of the algorithms, we show that above the critical threshold the leading eigenvector correlates with the relevant index subspace, a phenomenon reminiscent of the Baik-Ben Arous-Peche (BBP) transition in spiked models arising in random matrix theory. Supported by numerical experiments and a rigorous theoretical framework, our work bridges critical gaps in the computational limits of weak learnability in multi-index model.</description>

      <title>Fermi energy sensitive universal conductance fluctuations in anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Universal conductance fluctuations (UCF) are a hallmark of quantum interference in mesoscopic devices. According to the Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory, the amplitude of UCF remains independent of system parameters such as Fermi energy and disorder strength. However, recent experiments have demonstrated a significant variation in UCF with respect to Fermi energy in the anisotropic Dirac semimetal $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, suggesting a dependence on band anisotropy. In this work, we reconcile the discrepancy between theoretical predictions and experimental observations through a detailed study of UCF versus Fermi energy using a tight-binding model with tunable anisotropy parameters. Near the band edge, the Hamiltonian is simplified to an anisotropic free electron gas model, recovering the generalized Altshuler-Lee-Stone theory. However, as the Fermi energy shifts toward the band center, where rotational symmetry breaks into $C_4$ (four-fold rotational) symmetry, the UCF amplitude deviates from the standard theory. Our findings reveal that UCF becomes increasingly sensitive to Fermi energy as the anisotropy grows stronger. Furthermore, using realistic parameters for $\mathrm{Cd_3As_2}$, our calculations demonstrate an increase in UCF away from the Dirac point, in qualitative agreement with experimental results. The enhancement of UCF occurs in two perpendicular transport directions that we have calculated, albeit with quantitative differences in magnitude, which can be tested in future experiments. Given the prevalence of anisotropic materials and technical advances in engineering anisotropy through strain or twist, our results offer a valuable reference for characterizing intrinsic electronic properties via UCF.</description>
