      <title>Learning the physics of open quantum systems from experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis explores adaptive inference as a tool to characterize quantum systems using experimental data, with applications in sensing, calibration, control, and metrology. I propose and test algorithms for learning Hamiltonian and Kraus operators using Bayesian experimental design and advanced Monte Carlo techniques, including Sequential and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Application to the characterization of quantum devices from IBMQ shows a robust performance, surpassing the built-in characterization functions of Qiskit for the same number of measurements. Introductions to Bayesian statistics, experimental design, and numerical integration are provided, as well as an overview of existing literature.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Markov length: a diagnostic for fault tolerance via mixed-state phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.</description>

      <title>Graph State Fission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are a fundamental entanglement resource for multipartite quantum applications which are in general challenging to transform efficiently. While fusion operations for merging entangled states are well-developed, no direct protocol exists for the reverse process, which we term fission. We introduce a simple, yet powerful, protocol that achieves this, allowing a qubit to split while preserving selective connections with minimum entanglement overhead. This tool offers flexible entanglement management with potential applications in secure communication, error correction and adaptive entanglement distribution.</description>

      <title>Contextuality Can be Verified with Noncontextual Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover new features of generalized contextuality by connecting it to the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution. Quantum states can be represented by KD distributions, which take values in the complex unit disc. Only for ``KD-positive'' states are the KD distributions joint probability distributions. A KD distribution can be measured by a series of weak and projective measurements. We design such an experiment and show that it is contextual iff the underlying state is not KD-positive. We analyze this connection with respect to mixed KD-positive states that cannot be decomposed as convex combinations of pure KD-positive states. Our result is the construction of a noncontextual experiment that enables an experimenter to verify contextuality.</description>

      <title>Randomness-free Detection of Non-projective Measurements: Qubits &amp; beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-projective measurements are resourceful in several information-processing protocols. In this work, we propose an operational task involving space-like separated parties to detect measurements that are neither projective nor a classical post-processing of data obtained from a projective measurement. In the case of qubits, we consider a bipartite scenario and different sets of target correlations. While some correlations in each of these sets can be obtained by performing non-projective measurements on some shared two-qubit state it is impossible to simulate correlation in any of them using projective simulable measurements on bipartite qubit states or equivalently one bit of shared randomness. While considering certain sets of target correlations we show that the detection of qubit non-projective measurement is robust under arbitrary depolarising noise (except in the limiting case). For qutrits, while considering a similar task we show that some correlations obtained from local non-projective measurements are impossible to be obtained while performing the same qutrit projective simulable measurements by both parties. We provide numerical evidence of its robustness under arbitrary depolarising noise. For a more generic consideration (bipartite and tripartite scenario), we provide numerical evidence for a projective-simulable bound on the reward function for our task. We also show a violation of this bound by using qutrit POVMs. From a foundational perspective, we extend the notion of non-projective measurements to general probabilistic theories (GPTs) and use a randomness-free test to demonstrate that a class of GPTs, called square-bits or box-world are unphysical.</description>

      <title>Examining a Quantum System Subject to Energy Decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the energy decoherence of an interacting quantum system. It first reviews the experiments that motivated the postulates of quantum mechanics. It then discusses a decoherence that occurs dynamically in a closed system. This effect is studied in interacting quantum systems consisting of an oscillator and spins using analytical and numerical methods. The subsequent results are contrasted with cases with no decoherence. Connections of energy decoherence with thermodynamics are explored.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Quantum Embedding using Genetic Algorithm for QML Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Embeddings (QE) are essential for loading classical data into quantum systems for Quantum Machine Learning (QML). The performance of QML algorithms depends on the type of QE and how features are mapped to qubits. Traditionally, the optimal embedding is found through optimization, but we propose framing it as a search problem instead. In this work, we use a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to search for the best feature-to-qubit mapping. Experiments on the MNIST and Tiny ImageNet datasets show that GA outperforms random feature-to-qubit mappings, achieving 0.33-3.33 (MNIST) and 0.5-3.36 (Tiny ImageNet) higher fitness scores, with up to 15% (MNIST) and 8.8% (Tiny ImageNet) reduced runtime. The GA approach is scalable with both dataset size and qubit count. Compared to existing methods like Quantum Embedding Kernel (QEK), QAOA-based embedding, and QRAC, GA shows improvements of 1.003X, 1.03X, and 1.06X, respectively.</description>

      <title>Controller-decoder system requirements derived by implementing Shor's algorithm with surface code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is widely regarded as the most promising path towards quantum advantage, with significant advances in QEC codes, decoding algorithms, and physical implementations. The success of QEC relies on achieving quantum gate fidelities below the error threshold of the QEC code, while accurately decoding errors through classical processing of the QEC stabilizer measurements. In this paper, we uncover the critical system-level requirements from a controller-decoder system (CDS) necessary to successfully execute the next milestone in QEC, a non-Clifford circuit. Using a representative non-Clifford circuit, of Shor factorization algorithm for the number 21, we convert the logical-level circuit to a QEC surface code circuit and finally to the physical level circuit. By taking into account all realistic implementation aspects using typical superconducting qubit processor parameters, we reveal a broad range of core requirements from any CDS aimed at performing error corrected quantum computation. Our findings indicate that the controller-decoder closed-loop latency must remain within tens of microseconds, achievable through parallelizing decoding tasks and ensuring fast communication between decoders and the controller. Additionally, by extending existing simulation techniques, we simulate the complete fault-tolerant factorization circuit at the physical level, demonstrating that near-term hardware performance, such as a physical error rate of 0.1% and 1000 qubits, are sufficient for the successful execution of the circuit. These results are general to any non-Clifford QEC circuit of the same scale, providing a comprehensive overview of the classical components necessary for the experimental realization of non-Clifford circuits with QEC.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for unstructured search of ranked targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grover's quantum algorithm can find a marked item from an unstructured database faster than any classical algorithm, and hence it has been used for several applications such as cryptanalysis and optimization. When there exist multiple marked items, Grover's algorithm has the property of finding one of them uniformly at random. To further broaden the application range, it was generalized so that it finds marked items with probabilities according to their priority by encoding the priority into amplitudes applied by Grover's oracle operator. In this paper, to achieve a similar generalization, we examine a different encoding that incorporates the priority into phases applied by the oracle operator. We compare the previous and our oracle operators and observe that which one performs better depends on priority parameters. Since the priority parameters can be considered as the magnitude of the correlated phase error on Grover's oracle operator, the analysis of our oracle operator also reveals the robustness of the original Grover's algorithm against correlated noises. We further numerically show that the coherence between multiple marked items increases the probability of finding the most prioritized one in Grover's algorithm with our oracle operator.</description>

      <title>Resolving Schr\"{o}dinger's analysis of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox: an incompleteness criterion and weak elements of reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox was presented as an argument that quantum mechanics is an incomplete description of physical reality. However, the premises on which the argument is based are falsifiable by Bell experiments. In this paper, we examine the EPR paradox from the perspective of Schrodinger's reply to EPR. Schrodinger pointed out that the correlated states of the paradox enable the simultaneous measurement of $\hat{x}$ and $\hat{p}$, one by direct, the other by indirect measurement. Schrodinger's analysis takes on a timely importance because a recent experiment realizes these correlations for macroscopic atomic systems. Different to the original argument, Schrodinger's analysis applies to the experiment at the time when the measurement settings have been fixed. In this context, a subset of local realistic assumptions (not negated by Bell's theorem) implies that $x$ and $p$ are simultaneously precisely defined. Hence, an alternative EPR argument can be presented that quantum mechanics is incomplete, based on a set of (arguably) nonfalsifiable premises. As systems are amplified, macroscopic realism can be invoked, and the premises are referred to as weak macroscopic realism (wMR). In this paper, we propose a realization of Schrodinger's gedanken experiment where field quadrature phase amplitudes $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{P}$ replace position and momentum. Assuming wMR, we derive a criterion for the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, showing that the criterion is feasible for current experiments. Questions raised by Schrodinger are resolved. By performing simulations based on an objective-field ($Q$-based) model for quantum mechanics, we illustrate the emergence on amplification of simultaneous predetermined values for $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{P}$. The values can be regarded as weak elements of reality, along the lines of Bell's macroscopic beables.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithm for non-Markovian quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The simulation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics plays an important role in the understanding of charge and exciton dynamics in the condensed phase environment, and yet it remains computationally expensive on classical computers. We have developed a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The algorithm captures the non-Markovian effect by employing the Ehrenfect trajectories in the path integral formulation and the Monte Carlo sampling of the thermal distribution. We tested the algorithm with the spin-boson model on the quantum simulator and the results match well with the exact ones. The algorithm naturally fits into the parallel computing platform of the NISQ devices and is well suited for anharmonic system-bath interactions and multi-state systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we developed a rigorous procedure for mapping the exact non-Markovian propagator to the generalized Lindblad form. It allows us to extract the negative decay rate that is the indicator of the non-Markovian effect. As a consequence, we can investigate the influence of the non-Markovian bath on the system's properties such as coherence and equilibrium state distribution. The understanding of the non-Markovian contribution to the dynamical process points to the possibility of leveraging non-Markovianity for quantum control.</description>

      <title>Quantum Active Learning for Structural Determination of Doped Nanoparticles -- a Case Study of 4Al@Si$_{11}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active learning (AL) has been widely applied in chemistry and materials science. In this work we propose a quantum active learning (QAL) method for automatic structural determination of doped nanoparticles, where quantum machine learning (QML) models for regression are used iteratively to indicate new structures to be calculated by DFT or DFTB and this new data acquisition is used to retrain the QML models. The QAL method is implemented in the Quantum Machine Learning Software/Agent for Material Design and Discovery (QMLMaterial), whose aim is using an artificial agent (defined by QML regression algorithms) that chooses the next doped configuration to be calculated that has a higher probability of finding the optimum structure. The QAL uses a quantum Gaussian process with a fidelity quantum kernel as well as the projected quantum kernel and different quantum circuits. For comparison, classical AL was used with a classical Gaussian process with different classical kernels. The presented QAL method was applied in the structural determination of doped Si$_{11}$ with 4 Al (4Al@Si$_{11}$) and the results indicate the QAL method is able to find the optimum 4Al@Si$_{11}$ structure. The aim of this work is to present the QAL method -- formulated in a noise-free quantum computing framework -- for automatic structural determination of doped nanoparticles and materials defects.</description>

      <title>Noisy Cyclic Quantum Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore static noise in a discrete quantum random walk over a homogeneous cyclic graph, focusing on the spectral and dynamical properties of the system. Using a three-parameter unitary coin, we control the spectral properties of the noiseless step operator on the unit circle in the complex plane. One parameter governs the probability amplitudes and induces two spectral bands, with a gap proportional to its value. The half-sum of the two phase parameters rotates the spectrum and induces twofold degeneracy under specific conditions. Degenerate spectra yield eigenstates with sinusoidal probability distributions, whereas non-degenerate spectra produce flat distributions. By using the eigenstate participation ratio, we predict the behavior of a walker under static phase noise in the coin and sites, showing a correlation between low participation ratios and localization, and high ratios with delocalization. Our results show that the average eigenstate participation ratio provides insights equivalent to computationally intensive mean squared displacement calculations. We observe a transition from super-diffusive to sub-diffusive behavior for uniformly distributed noise within the range $-\pi/3$ to $\pi/3$ and saturation of the mean square distance when the number of steps exceeds the graph size by an order of magnitude. Finally, we propose a quantum circuit implementation of our model.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for approximating the expected value of a random-exist quantified oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum amplitude amplification and estimation have shown quadratic speedups to unstructured search and estimation tasks. We show that a coherent combination of these quantum algorithms also provides a quadratic speedup to calculating the expectation value of a random-exist quantified oracle. In this problem, Nature makes a decision randomly, i.e. chooses a bitstring according to some probability distribution, and a player has a chance to react by finding a complementary bitstring such that an black-box oracle evaluates to $1$ (or True). Our task is to approximate the probability that the player has a valid reaction to Nature's initial decision. We compare the quantum algorithm to the average-case performance of Monte-Carlo integration over brute-force search, which is, under reasonable assumptions, the best performing classical algorithm. We find the performance separation depends on some problem parameters, and show a regime where the canonical quadratic speedup exists.</description>

Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models use non-linear stochastic modifications of the Schroedinger equation to suppress superpositions of eigenstates of the measured observable and drive the state to an eigenstate. It was recently demonstrated that the Born rule for transition probabilities can be modeled using the linear Schroedinger equation with a Hamiltonian represented by a random matrix from the Gaussian unitary ensemble. The matrices representing the Hamiltonian at different time points throughout the observation period are assumed to be independent. Instead of suppressing superpositions, such Schroedinger evolution makes the state perform an isotropic random walk on the projective space of states. The relative frequency of reaching different eigenstates of an arbitrary observable in the random walk is shown to satisfy the Born rule. Here, we apply this methodology to investigate the behavior of a particle in the context of the double-slit experiment with measurement. Our analysis shows that, in this basic case, the evolution of the particle's state can be effectively captured through a random walk on a two-dimensional submanifold of the state space. This random walk reproduces the Born rule for the probability of finding the particle near the slits, conditioned on its arrival at one of them. To ensure that this condition is satisfied, we introduce a drift term representing a change in the variance of the position observable for the state. A drift-free model, based on equivalence classes of states indistinguishable by the detector, is also considered. The resulting random walk, with or without drift, serves as a suitable model for describing the transition from the initial state to an eigenstate of the measured observable in the experiment, offering new insights into its potential underlying mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein chromatography is an important technique in biopharmaceutical manufacturing that separates proteins by filtering them through a tightly packed column of gels. Tighter packings yield better protein separation. To this end, we model chromatography as sphere packing, formulating three models, each with increasing complexity. The first, homogeneous circle packing, is recast as maximum independent set and solved by the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm on a quantum computer. The second, heterogeneous circle packing, is formulated as a graphical optimization problem and solved via classical simulations, accompanied by a road map to a quantum solution. An extension to the third, heterogeneous sphere packing, is formulated mathematically in a manner suitable to a quantum solution, and detailed resource scaling is conducted to estimate the quantum resources required to simulate this most realistic model, providing a pathway to quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Quantum Convolutional Neural Network with Flexible Stride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional neural network is a crucial tool for machine learning, especially in the field of computer vision. Its unique structure and characteristics provide significant advantages in feature extraction. However, with the exponential growth of data scale, classical computing architectures face serious challenges in terms of time efficiency and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel quantum convolutional neural network algorithm. It can flexibly adjust the stride to accommodate different tasks while ensuring that the required qubits do not increase proportionally with the size of the sliding window. First, a data loading method based on quantum superposition is presented, which is able to exponentially reduce space requirements. Subsequently, quantum subroutines for convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers are designed, fully replicating the core functions of classical convolutional neural networks. Among them, the quantum arithmetic technique is introduced to recover the data position information of the corresponding receptive field through the position information of the feature, which makes the selection of step size more flexible. Moreover, parallel quantum amplitude estimation and swap test techniques are employed, enabling parallel feature extraction. Analysis shows that the method can achieve exponential acceleration of data scale in less memory compared with its classical counterpart. Finally, the proposed method is numerically simulated on the Qiskit framework using handwritten digital images in the MNIST dataset. The experimental results provide evidence for the effectiveness of the model.</description>

      <title>Quantum kernel learning Model constructed with small data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim to use quantum machine learning to detect various anomalies in image inspection by using small size data. Assuming the possibility that the expressive power of the quantum kernel space is superior to that of the classical kernel space, we are studying a quantum machine learning model. Through trials of image inspection processes not only for factory products but also for products including agricultural products, the importance of trials on real data is recognized. In this study, training was carried out on SVMs embedded with various quantum kernels on a small number of agricultural product image data sets collected in the company. The quantum kernels prepared in this study consisted of a smaller number of rotating gates and control gates. The F1 scores for each quantum kernel showed a significant effect of using CNOT gates. After confirming the results with a quantum simulator, the usefulness of the quantum kernels was confirmed on a quantum computer. Learning with SVMs embedded with specific quantum kernels showed significantly higher values of the AUC compared to classical kernels. The reason for the lack of learning in quantum kernels is considered to be due to kernel concentration or exponential concentration similar to the Baren plateau. The reason why the F1 score does not increase as the number of features increases is suggested to be due to exponential concentration, while at the same time it is possible that only certain features have discriminative ability. Furthermore, it is suggested that controlled Toffoli gate may be a promising quantum kernel component.</description>

      <title>Sensitively searching for microwave dark photons with atomic ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark photon is one of the promising candidates of light dark matter and could be detected by using its interaction with standard model particles via kinetic mixings. Here, we propose a feasible approach to detect the dark photons by nondestructively probing these mixing-induced quantum state transitions of atomic ensembles. Compared with the scheme by probing the mixing-induced quantum excitation of single-atom detector, the achievable detection sensitivity can be enhanced theoretically by a factor of $\sqrt{N}$ for the ensemble containing $N$ atoms. Specifically, we show that the dark photons, in both centimeter- and millimeter-wave bands, could be detected by using the artificial atomic ensemble detector, generated by surface-state electrons on liquid Helium. It is estimated that, with the detectable transition probability of $10^{-4}$, the experimental surface-state electrons (with $N = 10^8$ trapped electrons) might provide a feasible approach to search for the dark photons in $18.61-26.88$ $\mu$eV and $496.28-827.13$ $\mu$eV ranges, within about two months. The confidence level can exceed 95\% for the achievable sensitivities being $10^{-14} \sim 10^{-13}$ and $10^{-12} \sim 10^{-11}$, respectively. In principle, the proposal could also be generalized to the other atomic ensemble detectors for the detection of dark photons in different frequency bands.</description>

      <title>Detecting entanglement and nonlocality with minimum observable length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and nonlocality are foundational to quantum technologies, driving quantum computation, communication, and cryptography innovations. To benchmark the capabilities of these quantum techniques, efficient detection and accurate quantification methods are indispensable. This paper focuses on the concept of "detection length" -- a metric that quantifies the extent of measurement globality required to verify entanglement or nonlocality. We extend the detection length framework to encompass various entanglement categories and nonlocality phenomena, providing a comprehensive analytical model to determine detection lengths for specified forms of entanglement. Furthermore, we exploit semidefinite programming techniques to construct entanglement witnesses and Bell's inequalities tailored to specific minimal detection lengths, offering an upper bound for detection lengths in given states. By assessing the noise robustness of these witnesses, we demonstrate that witnesses with shorter detection lengths can exhibit superior performance under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computing technology has made it possible to study the thermodynamic properties of fermionic systems at finite temperatures through quantum simulations on a quantum computer. This provides a novel approach to the study of the chiral phase transition of fermionic systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states (QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.</description>

      <title>Floquet driven long-range interactions induce super-extensive scaling in quantum battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving quantum advantage in energy storage and power extraction is a primary objective in the design of quantum-based batteries. We explore how long-range (LR) interactions in conjunction with Floquet driving can improve the performance of quantum batteries, particularly when the battery is initialized in a fully polarized state. In particular, we exhibit that by optimizing the driving frequency, the maximum average power scales super extensively with system-size which is not achievable through next-nearest neighbor interactions or traditional unitary charging, thereby gaining genuine quantum advantage. We illustrate that the inclusion of either two-body or many-body interaction terms in the LR charging Hamiltonian leads to a scaling benefit. Furthermore, we discover that a super-linear scaling in power results from increasing the strength of interaction compared to the transverse magnetic field and the range of interaction with low fall-off rate, highlighting the advantageous role of long-range interactions in optimizing quantum battery charging.</description>

      <title>Fractal decompositions and tensor network representations of Bethe wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement structure of a generic $M$-particle Bethe wavefunction (not necessarily an eigenstate of an integrable model) on a 1d lattice by dividing the lattice into L parts and decomposing the wavefunction into a sum of products of $L$ local wavefunctions. We show that a Bethe wavefunction accepts a fractal multipartite decomposition: it can always be written as a linear combination of $L^M$ products of $L$ local wavefunctions, where each local wavefunction is in turn also a Bethe wavefunction. Building upon this result, we then build exact, analytical tensor network representations with finite bond dimension $\chi=2^M$, for a generic planar tree tensor network (TTN), which includes a matrix product states (MPS) and a regular binary TTN as prominent particular cases. For a regular binary tree, the network has depth $\log_{2}(N/M)$ and can be transformed into an adaptive quantum circuit of the same depth, composed of unitary gates acting on $2^M$-dimensional qudits and mid-circuit measurements, that deterministically prepares the Bethe wavefunction. Finally, we put forward a much larger class of generalized Bethe wavefunctions, for which the above decompositions, tensor network and quantum circuit representations are also possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00939v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision, robust quantum gates are essential components in quantum computation and information processing. In this study, we present an alternative perspective, exploring the potential applicability of quantum gates that exhibit heightened sensitivity to errors. We investigate such sensitive quantum gates, which, beyond their established use in in vivo NMR spectroscopy, quantum sensing, and polarization optics, may offer significant utility in precision quantum metrology and error characterization. Utilizing the composite pulses technique, we derive three fundamental quantum gates with narrowband and passband characteristics -- the X (NOT) gate, the Hadamard gate, and gates enabling arbitrary rotations. To systematically design these composite pulse sequences, we introduce the SU(2), modified-SU(2), and regularization random search methodologies. These approaches, many of which are novel, demonstrate superior performance compared to established sequences in the literature, including NB1, SK1, and PB1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss an expansion of the detection probabilities of biphoton states in terms of increasing orders of the joint spectral amplitude. The expansion enables efficient time- or frequency-resolved numerical simulations involving quantum states exhibiting a high degree of spectral entanglement. Contrary to usual approaches based on one- or two-pair approximations, we expand the expressions in terms corresponding to the amount of correlations between different pairs. The lowest expansion order corresponds to the limit of infinitely entangled states, where different pairs are completely uncorrelated and the full multi-pair statistics are inferred from a single pair. We show that even this limiting case always yields more accurate results than the single-pair approximation. Higher expansion orders describe deviations from the infinitely entangled case and introduce correlations between the photons of different pairs.</description>

Abstract: We present time- and frequency-resolved simulations of quantum key distribution~(QKD) systems employing highly entangled biphoton quantum states. Our simulations are based on expansions of the covariance matrix and photon detection probabilities of biphoton states in terms of increasing orders of the joint spectral amplitude that were introduced in the first part of this series. Employing these expansions allows us to efficiently evaluate the impact of multi-pair events on the performance of the QKD systems while systematically taking into account effects from the photon spectra and many relevant imperfections of the setup. The results are shown to be in agreement with corresponding measurements of the key rates and quantum bit error rates.</description>

Abstract: We develop the theory of equilibration in quantum dynamics for the case were the dynamics-generating Hamiltonians have continuous spectrum. The main goal of this paper will be to propose a framework to extend the results obtained by Short in [11], where estimates for equilibration on average and effective equilibration are derived. We will primarily focus on the case where the quantum dynamics are generated by a semi-group whose generator, i.e. the Hamiltonian, has purely absolutely continuous spectrum, and show that for such a case it is compulsory to constrain ourselves to finite time equilibration; we then develop estimates analogous to the main results in the proposed setting</description>

Abstract: The recent advances in quantum information processing, sensing and communications are surveyed with the objective of identifying the associated knowledge gaps and formulating a roadmap for their future evolution. Since the operation of quantum systems is prone to the deleterious effects of decoherence, which manifests itself in terms of bit-flips, phase-flips or both, the pivotal subject of quantum error mitigation is reviewed both in the presence and absence of quantum coding. The state-of-the-art, knowledge gaps and future evolution of quantum machine learning are also discussed, followed by a discourse on quantum radar systems and briefly hypothesizing about the feasibility of integrated sensing and communications in the quantum domain. Finally, we conclude with a set of promising future research ideas in the field of ultimately secure quantum communications with the objective of harnessing ideas from the classical communications field.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Quantum Metrology Enhanced by Strong Couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Equilibrium probes have been widely used in various noisy quantum metrology schemes. However, such an equilibrium-probe-based metrology scenario severely suffers from the low-temperature-error divergence problem in the weak-coupling regime. To circumvent this limit, we propose a strategy to eliminate the error-divergence problem by utilizing the strong coupling effects, which can be captured by the reaction-coordinate mapping. The strong couplings induce a noncanonical equilibrium state and greatly enhance the metrology performance. It is found that our metrology precision behaves as a polynomial-type scaling relation, which suggests the reduction of temperature can be used as a resource to improve the metrology performance. Our result is sharply contrary to that of the weakcoupling case, in which the metrology precision exponentially decays as the temperature decreases. Paving a way to realize a high-precision noisy quantum metrology at low temperatures, our result reveals the importance of the non-Markovianity in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Scheme for Private Set Intersection and Union Cardinality based on Quantum Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Private set intersection (PSI) and private set union (PSU) are the crucial primitives in secure multiparty computation protocols, which enable several participants to jointly compute the intersection and union of their private sets without revealing any additional information. Quantum homomorphic encryption (QHE) offers significant advantages in handling privacy-preserving computations. However, given the current limitations of quantum resources, developing efficient and feasible QHE-based protocols for PSI and PSU computations remains a critical challenge. In this work, a novel quantum private set intersection and union cardinality protocol is proposed, accompanied by the corresponding quantum circuits. Based on quantum homomorphic encryption, the protocol allows the intersection and union cardinality of users' private sets to be computed on quantum-encrypted data with the assistance of a semi-honest third party. By operating on encrypted quantum states, it effectively mitigates the risk of original information leakage. Furthermore, the protocol requires only simple Pauli and CNOT operations, avoiding the use of complex quantum manipulations (e.g., $T$ gate and phase rotation gate). Compared to related protocols, this approach offers advantages in feasibility and privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Using Reinforcement Learning to Guide Graph State Generation for Photonic Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic quantum computer (PQC) is an emerging and promising quantum computing paradigm that has gained momentum in recent years. In PQC, which leverages the measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) model, computations are executed by performing measurements on photons in graph states (i.e., sets of entangled photons) that are generated before measurements. The graph state in PQC is generated deterministically by quantum emitters. The generation process is achieved by applying a sequence of quantum gates to quantum emitters. In this process, i) the time required to complete the process, ii) the number of quantum emitters used, and iii) the number of CZ gates performed between emitters greatly affect the fidelity of the generated graph state. However, prior work for determining the generation sequence only focuses on optimizing the number of quantum emitters. Moreover, identifying the optimal generation sequence has vast search space. To this end, we propose RLGS, a novel compilation framework to identify optimal generation sequences that optimize the three metrics. Experimental results show that RLGS achieves an average reduction in generation time of 31.1%, 49.6%, and 57.5% for small, medium, and large graph states compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited continuous-variable distributed quantum metrology with arbitrary weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum metrology (DQM) enables the estimation of global functions of d distributed parameters beyond the capability of separable sensors. To estimate an arbitrary analytic function of the parameters it suffices that a DQM scheme can measure an arbitrary linear combination of these parameters, and a number of schemes have now been devised to achieve this at the Heisenberg limit. The most practical to-date requires d coherent inputs and one squeezed vacuum. Here we provide a full understanding of the minimal input resources and linear networks required to achieve DQM of arbitrary functions. We are able to fully elucidate the structure of any linear network for DQM that has two non-vacuum inputs, and we show that two non-vacuum inputs, one non-classical, is the minimum required to achieve DQM with arbitrary weights at the Heisenberg limit. We characterize completely the properties of the nonclassical input required to obtain a quantum advantage, showing that a wide range of inputs make this possible, including a squeezed vacuum. We further elucidate two distinct regimes of the distributed sensing network. The first achieves Heisenberg scaling. In the second the nonclassical input is much weaker than the coherent input, nevertheless providing a significant quantum enhancement to the otherwise classical sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and universality in stationary state of long-range Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the signature of quantum criticality in the long-time stationary state of the long-range Kitaev chain by performing various quench protocols. In this model, the pairing interaction decays with distance according to a power law with exponent $\alpha$. Using quantum information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and logarithmic negativity, we show that, irrespective of the values of $\alpha$, critical-to-critical quench displays quantum criticality even in the stationary state. Remarkably, in the presence of long-range pairing interactions, where fermionic correlators decay algebraically even at non-critical points, signature of quantum criticality persists in the stationary state. Furthermore, the effective central charge, calculated from both mutual information and logarithmic negativity of stationary state following a critical-to-critical quench, agrees with the central charge of the corresponding ground states for both $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 2$. Therefore, information of the universality class can be inferred from the stationary state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interaction of spontaneous emission photons generated by a strongly driven laser-cooled atom sample with that same sample after a time delay, which is important for establishing long-distance entanglement between quantum systems. The photons are emitted into an optical nanofiber, connected to a length of conventional optical fiber and reflected back using a Fiber-Bragg Grating mirror. We show that the photon count rates as a function of exciting laser frequency and intensity follow a simple model.</description>

      <title>Unified Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound for quantum multi-parameter estimation: Invertible and non-invertible Fisher information matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum multi-parameter estimation, the uncertainty in estimating unknown parameters is lower-bounded by Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB), defined as an inverse of the Fisher information matrix (FIM) associated with the multiple parameters. However, in particular estimation scenarios, the FIM is non-invertible due to redundancy in the parameter set, which depends on the probe state and measurement observable. Particularly, this has led to the use of a weaker form of the CRB to bound the estimation uncertainty in distributed quantum sensing. This weak CRB is generally lower than or equal to the exact CRB, and may, therefore, overestimate the achievable estimation precision. In this work, we propose an alternative approach, employing the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the FIM for constrained parameters, providing a unified CRB, attainable with an unbiased estimator. This allows us to construct simple strategies for each case in both simultaneous estimation and distributed quantum sensing, covering paradigmatic examples considered in the literature. We believe this study to provide a unified framework for addressing non-invertible FIMs and improving the precision of quantum multi-parameter estimation in various practical scenarios.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity multipartite entanglement creation in non-Hermitian qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems showcase many distinct and intriguing features with no Hermitian counterparts. One of them is the exceptional point which marks the PT (parity and time) symmetry phase transition, where an enhanced spectral sensitivity arises and leads to novel quantum engineering. Here we theoretically study the multipartite entanglement properties in non-Hermitian superconducting qubits, where high-fidelity entangled states can be created under strong driving fields or strong couplings among the qubits. Under an interplay between driving fields, couplings, and non-Hermiticity, we focus on generations of GHZ states or GHZ classes in three and four qubits with all-to-all couplings, which allows a fidelity approaching unity when relatively low non-Hermitian decay rates are considered. This presents an ultimate capability of non-Hermitian qubits to host a genuine and maximal multipartite entanglement. Our results can shed light on novel quantum engineering of multipartite entanglement generations in non-Hermitian qubit systems.</description>

      <title>Programming Variational Quantum Circuits with Quantum-Train Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the Quantum-Train Quantum Fast Weight Programmer (QT-QFWP) framework is proposed, which facilitates the efficient and scalable programming of variational quantum circuits (VQCs) by leveraging quantum-driven parameter updates for the classical slow programmer that controls the fast programmer VQC model. This approach offers a significant advantage over conventional hybrid quantum-classical models by optimizing both quantum and classical parameter management. The framework has been benchmarked across several time-series prediction tasks, including Damped Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM), NARMA5, and Simulated Gravitational Waves (GW), demonstrating its ability to reduce parameters by roughly 70-90\% compared to Quantum Long Short-term Memory (QLSTM) and Quantum Fast Weight Programmer (QFWP) without compromising accuracy. The results show that QT-QFWP outperforms related models in both efficiency and predictive accuracy, providing a pathway toward more practical and cost-effective quantum machine learning applications. This innovation is particularly promising for near-term quantum systems, where limited qubit resources and gate fidelities pose significant constraints on model complexity. QT-QFWP enhances the feasibility of deploying VQCs in time-sensitive applications and broadens the scope of quantum computing in machine learning domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the frequency configuration of qubits and quantum gates in superconducting quantum chips presents a complex NP-complete optimization challenge. This process is critical for enabling practical control while minimizing decoherence and suppressing significant crosstalk. In this paper, we propose a neural network-based frequency configuration approach. A trained neural network model estimates frequency configuration errors, and an intermediate optimization strategy identifies optimal configurations within localized regions of the chip. The effectiveness of our method is validated through randomized benchmarking and cross-entropy benchmarking. Furthermore, we design a crosstalk-aware hardware-efficient ansatz for variational quantum eigensolvers, achieving improved energy computations.</description>

      <title>Reducing PEC Overhead by Pauli Error Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation is regarded as a possible path to near-term quantum utility. The methods under the quantum error mitigation umbrella term, such as probabilistic error cancellation, zero-noise extrapolation or Clifford data regression are able to significantly reduce the error for the estimation of expectation values, although at an exponentially scaling cost, i.e., in the sampling overhead. In this work, we present a straightforward method for reducing the sampling overhead of PEC on Clifford circuits (and Clifford subcircuits) via Pauli error propagation alongside some classical preprocessing. While the methods presented in this work are restricted to Clifford circuits, we argue that Clifford sub circuits often occur in relevant calculations as for example the resource state generation in measurement based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Order-six CHMs containing exactly three distinct elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Hadamard matrices (CHMs) are intimately related to the number of distinct matrix elements. We investigate CHMs containing exactly three distinct elements, which is also the least number of distinct elements. In this paper, we show that such CHMs can only be complex equivalent to two kind of matrices, one is $H_2$-reducible and the other is the Tao matrix. Using our result one can further narrow the range of MUB trio (a set of four MUBs in $\mathbb{C}^6$ consists of an MUB trio and the identity) since we find that the two CHMs neither belong to MUB trios. Our results may
  lead to the more complete classification of $6\times 6$ CHMs whose elements in the first row are all 1.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously optimizing symmetry shifts and tensor factorizations for cost-efficient Fault-Tolerant Quantum Simulations of electronic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, the cost of calculating Hamiltonian eigenvalues using the quantum phase estimation algorithm is proportional to the constant scaling the Hamiltonian matrix block-encoded in a unitary circuit. We present a method to reduce this scaling constant for the electronic Hamiltonians represented as a linear combination of unitaries. Our approach combines the double tensor-factorization method of Burg et al. with the the block-invariant symmetry shift method of Loaiza and Izmaylov. By extending the electronic Hamiltonian with appropriately parametrized symmetry operators and optimizing the tensor-factorization parameters, our method achieves a 25% reduction in the block-encoding scaling constant compared to previous techniques. The resulting savings in the number of non-Clifford T-gates, which are an essential resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, are expected to accelerate the feasiblity of practical Hamiltonian simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on Hamiltonians of industrial and biological relevance, including the nitrogenase cofactor (FeMoCo) and cytochrome P450.</description>

      <title>Transversal Logical Clifford gates on rotated surface codes with reconfigurable neutral atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose hardware-efficient schemes for implementing logical H and S gates transversally on rotated surface codes with reconfigurable neutral atom arrays. For logical H gates, we develop a simple strategy to rotate code patches efficiently with two sets of 2D-acousto-optic deflectors (2D-AODs). Our protocol for logical S gates utilizes the time-dynamics of the data and ancilla qubits during syndrome extraction (SE). In particular, we break away from traditional schemes where transversal logical gates take place between two SE rounds and instead embed our fold-transversal logical operation inside a single SE round, leveraging the fact that data and ancilla qubits can be morphed to an unrotated surface code state at half-cycle. Under circuit noise, we observe the performance of our S gate protocol is on par with the quantum memory. Together with transversal logical CNOT gates, our protocols complete a transversal logical Clifford gate set on rotated surface codes and admit efficient implementation on neutral atom array platforms.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Logical Bell State Generation in Memory Assisted Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01434v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the feasibility of utilizing quantum error correction (QEC) to generate and store logical Bell states in heralded quantum entanglement protocols, crucial for quantum repeater networks. Two novel lattice surgery-based protocols (local and non-local) are introduced to establish logical Bell states between distant nodes using an intermediary node. In the local protocol, the intermediary node creates and directly transmits the logical Bell states to quantum memories. In contrast, the non-local protocol distributes auxiliary Bell states, merging boundaries between pre-existing codes in the quantum memories.
  We simulate the protocols using realistic experimental parameters, including cavity-enhanced atomic frequency comb quantum memories and multimode fiber-optic noisy channels. The study evaluates rotated and planar surface codes alongside Bacon-Shor codes for small code distances $(d = 3, 5)$ under standard and realistic noise models. We observe pseudo-thresholds, indicating that when physical error rates exceed approximately $p_{\text{err}} \sim 10^{-3}$, QEC codes do not provide any benefit over using unencoded Bell states. Moreover, to achieve an advantage over unencoded Bell states for a distance of $1 \, \mathrm{km}$ between the end node and the intermediary, gate error rates must be reduced by an order of magnitude $(0.1p_{\text{err}_H}$, $0.1p_{\text{err}_{CX}}$, and $0.1p_{\text{err}_M}$), highlighting the need for significant hardware improvements to implement logical Bell state protocols with quantum memories. Finally, both protocols were analyzed for their achieved rates, with the non-local protocol showing higher rates, ranging from $6.64 \, \mathrm{kHz}$ to $1.91 \, \mathrm{kHz}$, over distances of $1$ to $9 \, \mathrm{km}$ between the end node and the intermediary node.</description>

      <title>Cavity-Heisenberg spin-$j$ chain quantum battery and reinforcement learning optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning offers a promising methodology to tackle complex challenges in quantum physics. In the realm of quantum batteries (QBs), model construction and performance optimization are central tasks. Here, we propose a cavity-Heisenberg spin chain quantum battery (QB) model with spin-$j (j=1/2,1,3/2)$ and investigate the charging performance under both closed and open quantum cases, considering spin-spin interactions, ambient temperature, and cavity dissipation. It is shown that the charging energy and power of QB are significantly improved with the spin size. By employing a reinforcement learning algorithm to modulate the cavity-battery coupling, we further optimize the QB performance, enabling the stored energy to approach, even exceed its upper bound in the absence of spin-spin interaction. We analyze the optimization mechanism and find an intrinsic relationship between cavity-spin entanglement and charging performance: increased entanglement enhances the charging energy in closed systems, whereas the opposite effect occurs in open systems. Our results provide a possible scheme for design and optimization of QBs.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Visible Light by a Ni$_2$ Molecular Optical Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings molecule.The composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Magic State Injection on IBM Quantum Processors Above the Distillation Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01446v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface code family is a promising approach to implementing fault-tolerant quantum computations by providing the desired reliability via scaling the code size. For universal fault-tolerance requiring logical non-Clifford quantum operations in addition to Clifford gates, it is imperative to experimentally demonstrate the implementation of additional resources known as magic states, which is a highly non-trivial task. Another key challenge is efficient embedding of surface code in quantum hardware layout to harness its inherent error resilience and magic state preparation techniques, which becomes a difficult task for hardware platforms with connectivity constraints. This work simultaneously addresses both challenges by proposing a qubit-efficient rotated heavy-hexagonal surface code embedding in IBM quantum processors (\texttt{ibm\_fez}) and implementing the code-based magic state injection protocol. Our work reports error thresholds for both logical bit- and phase-flip errors, obtaining $\approx0.37\%$ and $\approx0.31\%$, respectively, which are higher than the threshold values previously reported with traditional embedding. The post-selection-based preparation of logical magic states $|H_L\rangle$ and $|T_L\rangle$ achieve fidelities of $0.8806\pm0.0002$ and $0.8665\pm0.0003$, respectively, which are both above the magic state distillation threshold. Additionally, we report the minimum fidelity among injected arbitrary single logical qubit states as $0.8356\pm0.0003$. Our work demonstrates the potential for implementing non-Clifford logical gates by producing high-fidelity logical magic states on IBM quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Quadruply Bonded Mo$_2$ Molecules: An Emitter-Resonator Integrated Quantum System in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Evolution of Quantum Fisher and Skew Information under Decoherence in Three-Qubit X-States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum metrology leverages quantum effects such as squeezing, entanglement, and other quantum correlations to boost precision in parameter estimation by saturating quantum Cramer Rao bound, which can be achieved by optimizing quantum Fisher information or Wigner-Yanase skew information. This work provides analytical expressions for quantum Fisher and skew information in a general three-qubit X-state and examines their evolution under phase damping, depolarization, and phase-flip decoherence channels. To illustrate the validity of our method, we investigate their dynamics for a three-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state subjected to various memoryless decoherence channels. Closed-form expressions for QFI and SQI are derived for each channel. By comparing these metrics with the entanglement measure of concurrence, we demonstrate the impact of decoherence on measurement precision for quantum metrology. Our results indicate that phase damping and phase-flip channels generally allow for better parameter estimation compared to depolarization. This study provides insights into the optimal selection of noise channels for enhancing precision in quantum metrological tasks involving multi-qubit entangled states.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Discovery of Casimir-Polder forces: Repulsion in the Ground State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general-purpose algorithm for automatic production of a structure that induces a desired Casimir-Polder force. As a demonstration of the capability and wide applicability of the method, we use it to develop a geometry that leads to a repulsive Casimir-Polder force on a ground-state atom. The results turn out to be reminiscent of the ring-like geometries previously used to induce repulsion, but with some new features and -- importantly -- discovered completely independently of any input from the user. This represents a powerful new paradigm in the study of atom-surface forces -- instead of the user testing various geometries against a desired figure of merit, the goal can be specified and then an appropriate geometry created automatically.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling assisted simulation of measurement-altered quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, measurements can induce qualitative new features, but their simulation is hindered by the exponential complexity involved in sampling the measurement results. We propose to use machine learning to assist the simulation of measurement-induced quantum phenomena. In particular, we focus on the measurement-altered quantum criticality protocol and generate local reduced density matrices of the critical chain given random measurement results. Such generation is enabled by a physics-preserving conditional diffusion generative model, which learns an observation-indexed probability distribution of an ensemble of quantum states, and then samples from that distribution given an observation.</description>

      <title>Single-Photon Generation: Materials, Techniques, and the Rydberg Exciton Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to their quantum nature, single-photon emitters generate individual photons in bursts or streams. They are paramount in emerging quantum technologies such as quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters, and measurement-based quantum computing. Many such systems have been reported in the last three decades, from Rubidium atoms coupled to cavities to semiconductor quantum dots and color centers implanted in waveguides. This review article highlights different material systems with deterministic and controlled single photon generation. We discuss and compare the performance metrics, such as purity and indistinguishability, for these sources and evaluate their potential for different applications. Finally, a new potential single-photon source, based on the Rydberg exciton in solid state metal oxide thin films, is introduced, briefly discussing its promising qualities and advantages in fabricating quantum chips for quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Enhanced feature encoding and classification on distributed quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The steady progress of quantum hardware is motivating the search for novel quantum algorithm optimization strategies for near-term, real-world applications. In this study, we propose a novel feature map optimization strategy for Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), designed to enhance binary classification while taking into account backend-specific parameters, including qubit connectivity, native gate sets, and circuit depth, which are critical factors in noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The dataset we utilised belongs to the neutrino physics domain, with applications in the search for neutrinoless double beta decay. A key contribution of this work is the parallelization of the classification task to commercially available superconducting quantum hardware to speed up the genetic search processes. The study was carried out by partitioning each quantum processing unit (QPU) into several sub-units with the same topology to implement individual QSVM instances. We conducted parallelization experiments with three IBM backends with more than 100 qubits, ranking the sub-units based on their susceptibility to noise. Data-driven simulations show how, under certain restrictions, parallelized genetic optimization can occur with the tested devices when retaining the top 20% ranked sub-units in the QPU.</description>

      <title>Coherent emission from single impurities in ZnSe through resonant excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors are promising optically active solid-state spin qubit systems. Previous work relied on incoherent optical excitation to generate photons from these impurities. However, many quantum applications require resonant driving to directly excite optical transitions and maintain coherence. Here, we demonstrate coherent optical emission from a resonantly driven single impurity-bound exciton in ZnSe. We observe resonance fluorescence and verify the emission coherence through polarization interferometry. Resonant excitation also enables the direct measurement of the Debye-Waller factor, determined to be 0.94, indicating high efficiency emission to the zero-phonon line. Time-resolved resonance fluorescence measurements reveal a fast optically driven ionization process attributed to Auger recombination, along with a slower spontaneous ionization process having a lifetime of 21 {\mu}s due to charge tunneling from the impurity. We demonstrate that a low-power incoherent pump laser efficiently stabilizes the charge of the impurity-bound exciton on the timescale of 9.3 ns. Our results pave the way for direct coherent optical and spin control through resonant excitation of impurity-bound excitons in II-VI semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear functions of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient estimation of nonlinear functions of quantum states is crucial for various key tasks in quantum computing, such as entanglement spectroscopy, fidelity estimation, and feature analysis of quantum data. Conventional methods using state tomography and estimating numerous terms of the series expansion are computationally expensive, while alternative approaches based on a purified query oracle impose practical constraints. In this paper, we introduce the quantum state function (QSF) framework by extending the SWAP test via linear combination of unitaries and parameterized quantum circuits. Our framework enables the implementation of arbitrary degree-$n$ polynomial functions of quantum states with precision $\varepsilon$ using $\mathcal{O}(n/\varepsilon^2)$ copies. We further apply QSF for developing quantum algorithms of fundamental tasks, achieving a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/(\varepsilon^2\kappa))$ for both von Neumann entropy estimation and quantum state fidelity calculations, where $\kappa$ represents the minimal nonzero eigenvalue. Our work establishes a concise and unified paradigm for estimating and realizing nonlinear functions of quantum states, paving the way for the practical processing and analysis of quantum data.</description>

      <title>Quasi-optimal sampling from Gibbs states via non-commutative optimal transport metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from and preparing quantum Gibbs states of local commuting Hamiltonians on hypercubic lattices of arbitrary dimension. We prove that any such Gibbs state which satisfies a clustering condition that we coin decay of matrix-valued quantum conditional mutual information (MCMI) can be quasi-optimally prepared on a quantum computer. We do this by controlling the mixing time of the corresponding Davies evolution in a normalized quantum Wasserstein distance of order one. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a non-commutative transport metric has been used in the study of quantum dynamics, and the first time quasi-rapid mixing is implied by solely an explicit clustering condition. Our result is based on a weak approximate tensorization and a weak modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality for such systems, as well as a new general weak transport cost inequality. If we furthermore assume a constraint on the local gap of the thermalizing dynamics, we obtain rapid mixing in trace distance for interactions beyond the range of two, thereby extending the state-of-the-art results that only cover the nearest neighbor case. We conclude by showing that systems that admit effective local Hamiltonians, like quantum CSS codes at high temperature, satisfy this MCMI decay and can thus be efficiently prepared and sampled from.</description>

      <title>Observing the dynamics of quantum states generated inside nonlinear optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states at optical frequencies are often generated inside cavities to facilitate strong nonlinear interactions. However, measuring these quantum states with traditional homodyne techniques poses a challenge, as outcoupling from the cavity disturbs the state's quantum properties. Here, we propose a framework for reconstructing quantum states generated inside nonlinear optical cavities and observing their dynamics. Our approach directly imprints the field distribution of the cavity quantum state onto the statistics of bistable cavity steady-states. We propose a protocol to fully reconstruct the cavity quantum state, visualized in 2D phase-space, by measuring the changes in the steady-state statistics induced by a probe signal injected into the cavity under different condition. We experimentally demonstrate our approach in a degenerate optical parametric oscillator, generating and reconstructing the quasi-probability distribution of different quantum states. As a validation, we reconstruct the Husimi Q function of the cavity squeezed vacuum state. In addition, we observe the evolution of the quantum vacuum state inside the cavity as it undergoes phase-sensitive amplification. By enabling generation and measurement of quantum states in a single nonlinear optical cavity, our method realizes an "end-to-end" approach to intracavity quantum tomography, facilitating studies of quantum optical phenomena in nonlinear driven-dissipative systems.</description>

      <title>Solving one-body ensemble N-representability problems with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic quantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of orbitals $\varphi_i$ according to $0 \leq n_i \leq 2$. In this work, we first refine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into account simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness $\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a comprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation theory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the set of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully characterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation numbers, defining a convex polytope $\Sigma_{N,S}(\boldsymbol w) \subset [0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of orbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate them for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a crucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.</description>

      <title>Edge modes and boundary impurities in the anisotropic Heisenberg spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of boundary phenomena in a spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ anisotropic Heisenberg chain (XXZ-$\frac{1}{2}$) in the gapped antiferromagnetic phase, with a particular focus on the interplay between fractionalized spin-$\frac{1}{4} $ edge modes and a coupled spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity at the edge. Employing a combination of Bethe Ansatz, exact diagonalization, and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) methods, we explore the intricate phase diagram that emerges when the impurity is coupled either integrably or non-integrably to the chain. For integrable antiferromagnetic impurity couplings, we identify two distinct phases: the Kondo phase, where the impurity is screened by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and the antiferromagnetic bound mode phase, where an exponentially localized bound state screens the impurity in the ground state. When coupled ferromagnetically while maintaining integrability, the impurity behaves as a free spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, leading to either a ferromagnetic bound mode phase, where the impurity remains free in the ground state but may be screened at higher energy excitations or an unscreened (or local moment) phase where impurity remains unscreened in every eigenstate whereas for non-integrable ferromagnetic coupling, the impurity is not free. In the case of non-integrable antiferromagnetic coupling, a third phase emerges, characterized by mid-gap excitations with two degenerate states below the mass gap on top of the Kondo and antiferromagnetic bound mode phases, further enriching the phase diagram. Our findings highlight the nuanced behavior of boundary impurities in gapped antiferromagnetic systems, offering new insights into Kondo effects and impurity screening in the presence of fractionalized edge modes and bulk antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Micro-cavity length stabilization for fluorescence enhancement using schemes based on higher order spatial modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on experimental investigation of potential high-performance cavity length stabilization using odd-indexed higher-order spatial modes. Schemes based on higher-order modes are particularly useful for micro-cavities that are used for enhanced fluorescence detection of a few emitters, which need to minimize photons leaking from a stabilization beam. We describe the design and construction of an assembly for a microcavity setup with tunable high passive stability. In addition, different types of active stabilization techniques based on higher-order modes, are then implemented and characterized based on their performance. We achieved a stability of about 0.5 pm RMS, while the error photons leaking from the continuous locking beam to a fluorescence detector are suppressed by more than 100-fold. We expect these results to be important for quantum technology implementations of various emitter-cavity setups, where these techniques provide a useful tool to meet the highly challenging demands.</description>

In real-world applications, when multiple optimal or constraint-satisfying solutions exist, enumerating all these solutions -- rather than finding just one -- is often desirable, as it provides flexibility in decision-making. However, combinatorial problems and their enumeration versions pose significant computational challenges due to combinatorial explosion. To address these challenges, we propose enumeration algorithms for combinatorial optimization and constraint satisfaction problems using Ising machines. Ising machines are specialized devices designed to efficiently solve combinatorial problems. Typically, they sample low-cost solutions in a stochastic manner. Our enumeration algorithms repeatedly sample solutions to collect all desirable solutions. The crux of the proposed algorithms is their stopping criteria for sampling, which are derived based on probability theory. In particular, the proposed algorithms have theoretical guarantees that the failure probability of enumeration is bounded above by a user-specified value, provided that lower-cost solutions are sampled more frequently and equal-cost solutions are sampled with equal probability. Many physics-based Ising machines are expected to (approximately) satisfy these conditions. As a demonstration, we applied our algorithm using simulated annealing to maximum clique enumeration on random graphs. We found that our algorithm enumerates all maximum cliques in large dense graphs faster than a conventional branch-and-bound algorithm specially designed for maximum clique enumeration. This demonstrates the promising potential of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Collective quantum phases in frustrated arrays of Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study collective quantum phases and quantum phase transitions occurring in frustrated sawtooth arrays of small quantum Josephson junctions. Frustration is introduced through the periodic arrangement of $0$- and $\pi$- Josephson junctions with the Josephson coupling energies $\alpha E_\mathrm{J}$ of different signs, $-1\leq \alpha \leq 1$. The complexity of the potential landscape of the system is controlled by the frustration parameter $f=(1-\alpha)/2$. The potential energy has a single global minimum in the non-frustrated regime ($f&lt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$) and a macroscopic number of equal minima in the frustrated regime ($f&gt;f_\mathrm{cr}=0.75$). We address the coherent quantum regime and identify several collective quantum phases: disordered (insulating) and ordered (superconducting) phases in the non-frustrated regime, as well as highly entangled patterns of vortices and anti-vortices in the frustrated regime. These collective quantum phases are controlled by several physical parameters: the frustration $f$, the Josephson coupling, and the charging energies of junctions and islands. We map the control parameter phase diagram by characterizing the quantum dynamics of frustrated Josephson junction arrays by spatially and temporally resolved quantum-mechanical correlation function of the local magnetization.</description>

      <title>Solving and visualizing fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions with neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN based variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with topological order and electron fractionalization.</description>

      <title>Quench Spectroscopy for Dissipative and Non-Hermitian Quantum Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the open Bose-Hubbard chain confined in the superfluid phase submitted to a sudden global quench on the dissipations and the repulsive interactions. The latter is investigated by calculating the equations of motion of relevant quadratic correlators permitting to study the equal-time connected one-body and density-density correlations functions. We then compute the quench spectral function associated to each observable to perform the quench spectroscopy of this dissipative quantum lattice model. This permits to unveil the quasiparticle dispersion relation of the Bose-Hubbard chain in the superfluid phase in the presence of loss processes. The applicability of the quench spectroscopy is also generalized to non-Hermitian quantum lattice models by considering the non-Hermitian transverse-field Ising chain in the paramagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Probing nonlocal correlations in magnetic rare-earth clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying entanglement entropy is crucial to characterize the quantum behaviors that drive phenomena in a variety of systems. Rare-earth spin complexes, with their unique magnetic properties, provide fertile ground for exploring these nonlocal correlations. In this work, we study Eu$^{2+}$ ions deposited on a Au(111) substrate, modeling finite clusters of large spin-moments using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameterized by first-principles calculations. Our analysis reveals a one-to-one correspondence between structures in the differential conductance profiles and changes in the von Neumann entanglement entropy of bipartite subsystems, influenced by probe-ion separation and applied magnetic fields. Distinct braiding patterns in the conductance profiles are shown to correspond to stepwise changes in the entanglement entropy, providing a new avenue for investigating quantum correlations. These results establish a foundation for experimentally probing and controlling entanglement in lanthanide-based systems, with potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization of Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is a crucial theoretical question in understanding the onset of hydrodynamics, and in a broad sense, a key step to the exploration of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. Addressing this problem theoretically, in a first principle manner, requires a real-time, non-perturbative method. To this end, we carry out a fully quantum simulation on a classical hardware, of a massive Schwinger model, which well mimics QCD as it shares the important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. We focus on the real-time evolution of the Wigner function, namely, the two-point correlation function, which approximates quark momentum distribution. In the context of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and the evolution of entropy, our solution reveals the emergence of quantum thermalization in quark-gluon plasma with a strong coupling constant, while thermalization fails progressively as a consequence of the gradually increased significance of quantum many-body scar states in a more weakly coupled system. More importantly, we observe the non-trivial role of the topological vacuum in thermalization, as the thermalization properties differ dramatically in the parity-even and parity-odd components of the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement entropy and Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid to liquid transition in biquadratic spin-1 XY chain with rhombic single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) are investigated in biquadratic spin-$1$ XY chain with rhombic single-ion anisotropy by using the ground state energy (GE), the bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the mutual information (MI). It turns out that there are three spin nematic phases and two Tomonaga-Luttinger (TL) liquid phases with the central charge $c = 1$. The TL Liquid phases emerge roughly for biquadratic interaction strength two times stronger than the absolute value of the single-ion anisotropy. The GE and the derivatives up to the second order reveal a first-order QPT between spin nematic ferroquarupole (FQ) phases but cannot capture an evident signal of QPTs between the spin nematic phases and the TL Liquid phases as well as QPT between the two TL liquid phases. The TL liquid-to-liquid transition point features a highly degenerate state and the spin-block entanglement entropy increases logarithmically with block size. The BEE exhibits a divergent or convergent behavior identifying the TL Liquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively. Similarly, the MI and the spin-spin correlation are shown to decay algebraically or exponentially with increasing the lattice distance in the TL Liquid or spin nematic FQ phases, respectively. In the TL liquid phase, the exponents $\eta_I$ and $\eta_z$ of the MI and the spin-spin correlation vary with the interaction parameter of the biquadratic interaction strength and the rhombic single-ion anisotropy and satisfy the relationship of $\eta_z &lt;\eta_I$. Such changes of characteristic behavior of the BEE, the MI and the spin-spin correlation indicate an occurrence of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT)-type QPT between the TL Liquid phase and the spin nematic FQ phase. The staggered spin fluctuation $\langle S^x S^y \rangle$ is shown to play a significant role for the emergence of the TL liquid phase and thus give rise to the BKT-type QPT.</description>

      <title>Field-induced quantum interference of inelastic scattering in ultracold atomic collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: xploiting quantum interference remains a significant challenge in ultracold inelastic scattering. In this work, we propose a method to enable detectable quantum interference within the two-body loss rate resulting from various inelastic scattering channels. Our approach utilizes a ``ring-coupling" configuration, achieved by combining external radio-frequency and static electric fields during ultracold atomic collisions. We conduct close-coupling calculations for $^7$Li-$^{41}$K collisions at ultracold limit to validate our proposal. The results show that the interference profile displayed in two-body loss rate is unable to be observed with unoptimized external field parameters. Particularly, our findings demonstrate that the two-body loss rate coefficient exhibits distinct constructive and destructive interference patterns near the magnetically induced $p$-wave resonance in the incoming channel near which a rf-induced scattering resonance exists. These interference patterns become increasingly pronounced with greater intensities of the external fields. This work opens a new avenue for controlling inelastic scattering processes in ultracold collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explicit expression for the photon polarization operator in the presence of a single electron is found in the $in$-$in$ formalism in the one-loop approximation out of the photon mass-shell. This polarization operator describes the dielectric permittivity of a single electron wave packet in coherent scattering processes. The plasmons and plasmon-polaritons supported by a single electron wave packet are described. The two limiting cases are considered: the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much smaller than the typical scale of variations of the electron wave packet and the wavelength of the external electromagnetic field is much larger than the size of the electron wave packet. In the former case, there are eight independent plasmon-polariton modes. In the latter case, the plasmons boil down to the dynamical dipole moment attached to a point electron. Thus, in the infrared limit, the electron possesses a dynamical electric dipole moment manifesting itself in coherent scattering processes.</description>

Abstract: Polar polyatomic molecules provide an ideal but largely unexplored platform to encode qubits in rotational states. Here, we trap cold (100-600 mK) formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) inside an electric box and perform a Ramsey-type experiment to observe long-lived (~100 $\mu$s) coherences between symmetry-protected molecular states with opposite rotation but identical orientation, representing a quasi-hidden molecular degree of freedom. As a result, the observed qubit is insensitive to the magnitude of an external electric field, and depends only weakly on magnetic fields. Our findings provide a basis for future quantum and precision experiments with trapped cold molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a systematic implementation of hybrid quantum-classical computational methods for investigating corrosion inhibition mechanisms on aluminum surfaces. We present an integrated workflow combining density functional theory (DFT) with quantum algorithms through an active space embedding scheme, specifically applied to studying 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol inhibitors on Al111 surfaces. Our implementation leverages the ADAPT-VQE algorithm with benchmarking against classical DFT calculations, achieving binding energies of -0.386 eV and -1.279 eV for 1,2,4-Triazole and 1,2,4-Triazole-3-thiol, respectively. The enhanced binding energy of the thiol derivative aligns with experimental observations regarding sulfur-functionalized inhibitors' improved corrosion protection. The methodology employs the orb-d3-v2 machine learning potential for rapid geometry optimizations, followed by accurate DFT calculations using CP2K with PBE functional and Grimme's D3 dispersion corrections. Our benchmarking on smaller systems reveals that StatefulAdaptVQE implementation achieves a 5-6x computational speedup while maintaining accuracy. This work establishes a workflow for quantum-accelerated materials science studying periodic systems, demonstrating the viability of hybrid quantum-classical approaches for studying surface-adsorbate interactions in corrosion inhibition applications. In which, can be transferable to other applications such as carbon capture and battery materials studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision optical filters are key components for current and future photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a low loss spectral filter consisting of an ultrasteep bandpass feature with a maximum gradient of (90.6$\pm$0.7) dB/GHz, centred within a notch filter with (128$\pm$6) dB of suppression. The filter consists of a fiber Bragg grating with multiple $\pi$-phase discontinuities inscribed into a single mode photosensitive fiber. The measured performance closely matches the simulated spectrum calculated from the design parameters indicating a high degree of confidence in the repeatability and manufacture of such devices. These filters show great promise for applications reliant on high-frequency resolution noise suppression, such as quantum networking, and highlight the opportunities for the versatility, efficiency, and extreme suppression offered by high-performance fiber Bragg grating devices.</description>

Abstract: We focus on three distinct lines of recent developments: edge modes and boundary charges in gravitational physics, relational dynamics in classical and quantum gravity, and quantum reference frames. We argue that these research directions are in fact linked in multiple ways, and can be seen as different aspects of the same research programme. This research programme has two main physical goals and one general conceptual aim. The physical goals are to move beyond the two idealizations/approximations of asymptotic or closed boundary conditions in gravitational physics and of ideal reference frames (coded in coordinate frames or gauge fixings), thus achieving a more realistic modeling of (quantum) gravitational physical phenomena. The conceptual aim is to gain a better understanding of the influence of observers in physics and the ensuing limits of objectivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum steering for different types of Bell-like states in gravitational background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a relativistic framework, it is generally accepted that quantum steering of maximally entangled states provide greater advantages in practical applications compared to non-maximally entangled states. In this paper, we investigate quantum steering for four different types of Bell-like states of fermionic modes near the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole. In some parameter spaces, the peak of steering asymmetry corresponds to a transition from two-way to one-way steerability for Bell-like states under the influence of the Hawking effect. It is intriguing to find that the fermionic steerability of the maximally entangled states experiences sudden death with the Hawking temperature, while the fermionic steerability of the non-maximally entangled states maintains indefinite persistence at infinite Hawking temperature. In contrast to prior research, this finding suggests that quantum steering of non-maximally entangled states is more advantageous than that of maximally entangled states for processing quantum tasks in the gravitational background. This surprising result overturns the traditional idea of ``the advantage of maximally entangled steering in the relativistic framework" and provides a new perspective for understanding the Hawking effect of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pointwise Convolution: A Flexible and Scalable Approach for Neural Network Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a novel architecture, the Quantum Pointwise Convolution, which incorporates pointwise convolution within a quantum neural network framework. Our approach leverages the strengths of pointwise convolution to efficiently integrate information across feature channels while adjusting channel outputs. By using quantum circuits, we map data to a higher-dimensional space, capturing more complex feature relationships. To address the current limitations of quantum machine learning in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, we implement several design optimizations. These include amplitude encoding for data embedding, allowing more information to be processed with fewer qubits, and a weight-sharing mechanism that accelerates quantum pointwise convolution operations, reducing the need to retrain for each input pixels. In our experiments, we applied the quantum pointwise convolution layer to classification tasks on the FashionMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets, where our model demonstrated competitive performance compared to its classical counterpart. Furthermore, these optimizations not only improve the efficiency of the quantum pointwise convolutional layer but also make it more readily deployable in various CNN-based or deep learning models, broadening its potential applications across different architectures.</description>

      <title>Universal Spreading Dynamics in Quasiperiodic Non-Hermitian Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a distinctive type of wave propagation, due to the intricate interplay of non-Hermiticity and disorder. Here, we investigate the spreading dynamics in the archetypal non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model with quasiperiodic disorder. We uncover counter-intuitive transport behaviors: subdiffusion with a spreading exponent $\delta=1/3$ in the localized regime and diffusion with $\delta=1/2$ in the delocalized regime, in stark contrast to their Hermitian counterparts (halted vs. ballistic). We then establish a unified framework from random-variable perspective to determine the universal scaling relations in both regimes for generic disordered non-Hermitian systems. An efficient method is presented to extract the spreading exponents from Lyapunov exponents. The observed subdiffusive or diffusive transport in our model stems from Van Hove singularities at the tail of imaginary density of states, as corroborated by Lyapunov-exponent analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum microwaves: stabilizing squeezed light by phase locking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bright sources of quantum microwave light are an important building block for various quantum technological applications. Josephson junctions coupled to microwave cavities are a particularly versatile and simple source for microwaves with quantum characteristics, such as different types of squeezing. Due to the inherent nonlinearity of the system, a pure dc-voltage bias can lead to the emission of correlated pairs of photons into a stripline resonator. However, a drawback of this method is that it suffers from bias voltage noise, which disturbs the phase of the junction and consequently destroys the coherence of the photons, severely limiting its applications. Here we describe how adding a small ac reference signal either to the dc-bias or directly into the cavity can stabilize the system and counteract the sensitivity to noise. We first consider the injection locking of a single-mode device, before turning to the more technologically relevant locking of two-mode squeezed states, where phase locking preserves the entanglement between photons. Finally, we describe locking by directly injecting a microwave into the cavity, which breaks the symmetry of the squeezing ellipse. In all cases, locking can mitigate the effects of voltage noise, and enable the use of squeezed states in quantum technological applications.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop model (QLM), along with the quantum dimer model (QDM), are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, these models are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg quantum simulators. However, the effect of finite temperature fluctuations on these quantum constrained models has been barely explored. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite temperature phase diagram of the QLM on the triangular lattice. We discover that the vison plaquette (VP) crystal experiences a finite temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of {\it thermal fractionalization}, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral symmetry is broken by typical interactions in lattice models, but the statistical interactions embodied in the anyon-Hubbard model are an exception. It is an example of a correlated hopping model in which chiral symmetry protects a degenerate zero-energy subspace. Complementary to the traditional approach of anyon braiding in real space, we adiabatically evolve the statistical parameter in the anyon-Hubbard model and we find non-trivial Berry phases and holonomies in this chiral subspace. The corresponding states possess stationary checkerboard pattern in their $N$-particle densities which are preserved under adiabatic manipulation. We give an explicit protocol for how these chirally-protected zero energy states can be prepared, observed, validated, and controlled.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Picture for Entanglement Hamiltonians in Higher Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the quasiparticle picture of entanglement evolution to obtain an effective description for the out-of-equilibrium Entanglement Hamiltonian at the hydrodynamical scale following quantum quenches in free fermionic systems in two or more spatial dimensions. Specifically, we begin by applying dimensional reduction techniques in cases where the geometry permits, building directly on established results from one-dimensional systems. Subsequently, we generalize the analysis to encompass a wider range of geometries. We obtain analytical expressions for the entanglement Hamiltonian valid at the ballistic scale, which reproduce the known quasiparticle picture predictions for the Renyi entropies and full counting statistics. We also numerically validate the results with excellent precision by considering quantum quenches from several initial configurations.</description>

      <title>Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ using exact large scale Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. For all $1&lt;\alpha\leq 3$ the quantum phase transition from a superfluid and a Mott insulator at unit filling is found to be continuous and scale invariant, in a way incompatible with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) scenario, which is recovered for $\alpha&gt;3$. We characterise the new universality class by providing the critical exponents by means of data collapse analysis near the critical point for each $\alpha$ and from careful analysis of the spectrum. Large-scale simulations of the grand canonical phase diagram and of the decay of correlation functions demonstrate an overall behavior akin to higher dimensional systems with long-range order in the ground state for $\alpha \leq 2$ and intermediate between one and higher dimensions for $2&lt;\alpha \leq 3$. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark to compare theories of long-range quantum models and are relevant for experiments with cold neutral atom, molecules and ion chains.</description>

      <title>Superposing and gauging fermionic Gaussian projected entangled pair states to get lattice gauge theory groundstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauged Gaussian fermionic projected entangled pair states (GGFPEPS) form a novel type of Ansatz state for the groundstate of lattice gauge theories. The advantage of these states is that they allow efficient calculation of observables by combining Monte-Carlo integration over gauge fields configurations with Gaussian tensor network machinery for the fermionic part. Remarkably, for GGFPEPS the probability distribution for the gauge field configurations is positive definite and real so that there is no sign problem.
  In this work we will demonstrate that gauged (non-Gaussian) fermionic projected pair states (GFPEPS) exactly capture the groundstate of generic lattice gauge theories. Additionally, we will present a framework for the efficient computation of observables in the case where the non-Gaussianity of the PEPS follows from the superposition of (few) Gaussian PEPS.
  Finally, we present a new graphical notation for Gaussian tensor and their contractions into Gaussian tensor network states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate Riemannian quantum-geometric structures in semiclassical transport features of two-dimensional multigap topological phases. In particular, we study nonlinear Hall-like bulk electric current responses and, accordingly, semiclassical equations of motion induced by the presence of a topological Euler invariant. We provide analytic understanding of these quantities by phrasing them in terms of momentum-space geodesics and geodesic deviation equations and further corroborate these insights with numerical solutions. Within this framework, we moreover uncover anomalous bulk dynamics associated with the second- and third-order nonlinear Hall conductivities induced by a patch Euler invariant. As a main finding, our results show how one can reconstruct the Euler invariant on coupling to electric fields at nonlinear order and from the gradients of the electric fields. Furthermore, we comment on the possibility of deducing the non-trivial non-Abelian Euler class invariant specifically in second-order nonlinear ballistic conductance measurements within a triple-contact setup, which was recently proposed to probe the Euler characteristics of more general Fermi surfaces. Generally, our results provide a route for deducing the topology in real materials that exhibit the Euler invariant by analyzing bulk electrical currents.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states from K\"ahler structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.15518v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states (also known as "squeezed coherent states") can be uniquely characterized by their linear complex structure $J$ which is a linear map on the classical phase space. This extends conventional Gaussian methods based on covariance matrices and provides a unified framework to treat bosons and fermions simultaneously. Pure Gaussian states can be identified with the triple $(G,\Omega,J)$ of compatible K\"ahler structures, consisting of a positive definite metric $G$, a symplectic form $\Omega$ and a linear complex structure $J$ with $J^2=-1\!\!1$. Mixed Gaussian states can also be identified with such a triple, but with $J^2\neq -1\!\!1$. We apply these methods to show how computations involving Gaussian states can be reduced to algebraic operations of these objects, leading to many known and some unknown identities. We apply these methods to the study of (A) entanglement and complexity, (B) dynamics of stable systems, (C) dynamics of driven systems. From this, we compile a comprehensive list of mathematical structures and formulas to compare bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states side-by-side.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic phase-space theorems lead to hidden causal loops in a model for measurement consistent with macroscopic realism, Bell nonlocality and no-signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.06070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.06070v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we show how quantum measurement and nonlocality can be explained consistently with macroscopic realism and no-signaling. We analyze a measurement of $\hat{x}$ on a system prepared in a superposition of eigenstates, with measurement modeled as amplification, realized by interacting the system with an amplifier. Deriving quantum stochastic path-integral theorems, we prove an equivalence between a phase-space probability distribution $Q(x,p)$ (which uniquely represents the quantum state) and stochastic trajectories for the amplified and attenuated variables, $x$ and $p$, that propagate backwards and forwards in time, respectively. For the superposition, but not the mixture, the backward and forward-propagating trajectories are connected by the initial-time conditional distribution $Q(p|x)$, leading to a causal loop. The joint densities for $x(t)$ and $p(t)$ yield $Q(x,p,t)$, confirming causal consistency. A feature is hidden noise associated with an eigenstate. Unlike the eigenvalue, this noise is not amplified. This motivates an ontological model for measurement, where the amplified amplitude x(t) gives the detected outcome, from which Born's rule follows. For macroscopic superpositions, we demonstrate consistency with macroscopic realism: Further, we evaluate the initial-time distribution $Q_{loop}(x,p)$ for the coupled trajectories conditioned on a given outcome, showing that this cannot correspond to a quantum state. Finally, we analyze Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen and Bell nonlocality. Our conclusion is a model for the collapse of the wave-function and nonlocality, consistent with three weak local realistic premises. We deduce a hybrid causal structure involving causal relations for amplified variables, demonstrating through explicit simulation how microscopic retrocausality can explain measurement and entanglement, without leading to retrocausality at a macroscopic level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.00021v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Without a complete theory of quantum gravity, the question of how quantum fields and quantum particles behave in a superposition of spacetimes seems beyond the reach of theoretical and experimental investigations. Here we use an extension of the quantum reference frame formalism to address this question for the Klein-Gordon field residing on a superposition of conformally equivalent metrics. Based on the group structure of ``quantum conformal transformations'', we construct an explicit quantum operator that can map states describing a quantum field on a superposition of spacetimes to states representing a quantum field with a superposition of masses on a Minkowski background. This constitutes an extended symmetry principle, namely invariance under quantum conformal transformations. The latter allows to build an understanding of superpositions of diffeomorphically non-equivalent spacetimes by relating them to a more intuitive superposition of quantum fields on curved spacetime. Furthermore, it can be used to import the phenomenon of particle production in curved spacetime to its conformally equivalent counterpart, thus revealing new features in modified Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Unified framework for continuity of sandwiched R\'enyi divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we prove uniform continuity bounds for entropic quantities related to the sandwiched R\'enyi divergences such as the sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropy. We follow three different approaches: The first one is the "almost additive approach", which exploits the sub-/ superadditivity and joint concavity/ convexity of the exponential of the divergence. In our second approach, termed the "operator space approach", we express the entropic measures as norms and utilize their properties for establishing the bounds. These norms draw inspiration from interpolation space norms. We not only demonstrate the norm properties solely relying on matrix analysis tools but also extend their applicability to a context that holds relevance in resource theories. By this, we extend the strategies of Marwah and Dupuis as well as Beigi and Goodarzi employed in the sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropy context. Finally, we merge the approaches into a mixed approach that has some advantageous properties and then discuss in which regimes each bound performs best. Our results improve over the previous best continuity bounds or sometimes even give the first continuity bounds available. In a separate contribution, we use the ALAFF method, developed in a previous article by some of the authors, to study the stability of approximate quantum Markov chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating open quantum systems is essential for exploring novel quantum phenomena and evaluating noisy quantum circuits. In this Letter, we address the problem of whether mixed states generated from noisy quantum circuits can be efficiently represented by locally purified density operators (LPDOs). We map an LPDO of $N$ qubits to a pure state of size $2\times N$ defined on a ladder and introduce a unified method for managing virtual and Kraus bonds. We numerically simulate noisy random quantum circuits with depths up to $d=40$ using fidelity and entanglement entropy as accuracy measures. LPDO representation proves to be effective in describing mixed states in both quantum and classical regions but encounters significant challenges at the quantum-classical critical point, limiting its applicability to the quantum region exclusively. In contrast, the matrix product operator (MPO) successfully characterizes the entanglement trend throughout the simulation, while truncation in MPOs breaks the positivity condition required for a physical density matrix. This work advances our understanding of efficient mixed-state representation in open quantum systems and provides insights into the entanglement structure of noisy quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics Happens Only on Paper: QBism's Account of Decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14112v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QBism has long recognized quantum states, POVM elements, Kraus operators, and even unitary operations to be cut from the same cloth: They express aspects of an agent's belief system concerning the consequences (for her) of actions she might take upon her external world. Such action-consequence pairs have conventionally been called "quantum measurements." The calculus of quantum theory is then viewed as an empirically motivated addition to Bayesian decision theory when brought to this notion of measurement. This radical approach has allowed QBism to eliminate conceptual problems that plague other interpretations of quantum mechanics. However, one issue has remained elusive: If a QBist does not believe in the existence of an ontic (agent-independent) dynamical variable evolving over time, why would there be any constraints on her quantum-state assignment in the absence of performing a measurement? Why would she introduce unitary or open-system quantum dynamics at all? Here, we present a representation theorem based on van Fraassen's reflection principle to answer these questions. Simply put, an agent's assignment of quantum dynamics represents her belief that a measurement action she is contemplating would not change her current odds for future gambles. A corollary to this approach is that one can make sense of "open-system dynamics" without the need to introduce an "environment with a measurement record," as is common in decoherence accounts of quantum measurement. QBism's understanding instead rests more fundamentally on an agent's beliefs about the system of interest (not system plus environment) and her judgments about measurements she might perform on that system. More broadly, this result establishes QBism's contention that measurement itself is the central concept of quantum theory and thus the framework upon which any future QBist ontology must hang.</description>

      <title>Fast measurement of group index variation with ultimate precision using Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum sensing applications, particularly in measuring physical parameters that influence the relative optical delay between pair photons. Unlike classical techniques, HOM-based quantum sensors offer higher resolution due to their intrinsic dispersion cancellation property. Despite this advantage, achieving precise measurements of optical delay crucial for practical applications often involves time-consuming integration and post-processing with traditional statistical methods. To address this challenge, our recent work focused on optimizing optical delay measurements in a time-efficient manner. By carefully selecting the length of a 1 mm periodically-poled KTP (PPKTP) crystal for pair photon generation, we achieved a remarkable group index measurement precision of $\sim 6.75\times 10^{-6}$ per centimeter of sample length, surpassing the previous maximum precision by over 400$\%$. These current measurements maintain fast detection and high photon counts, which are essential for practical quantum sensing applications. The HOM-based method, while limiting the measurement range, can be extended by compensating for photon delay using an optical delay stage. As a proof-of-principle, we measured the group index variation of PPKTP over a temperature range up to 200$^{\circ}$C with a precision in the range of one part per million ($\sim$10$^{-6}$). This advancement not only contributes to quantum sensing but also holds promising implications for high-precision and long-range measurements in quantum optical coherence tomography.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient loss-aware photonic graph state preparation using atomic emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-qubit entangled photonic graph states are an important ingredient for all-photonic quantum computing, repeaters and networking. Preparing them using probabilistic stitching of single photons using linear optics presents a formidable resource challenge due to multiplexing needs. Quantum emitters provide a viable solution to prepare photonic graph states as they enable deterministic production of photons entangled with emitter qubits, and deterministic two-qubit interactions among emitters. A handful of emitters often suffice to generate useful-size graph states that would otherwise require millions of emitters used as single photon sources, using the linear-optics method. Photon loss however impedes the emitter method due to a large circuit depth, and hence loss accrual on the photons of the graph state produced, given the typically large number of slow two-qubit CNOT gates between emitters. We propose an algorithm that can trade the number of emitters with the graph-state depth, while minimizing the number of emitter CNOTs. We apply our algorithm to generate a repeater graph state (RGS) for a new all-photonic repeater protocol, which achieves a far superior rate-distance tradeoff compared to using the least number of emitters needed to generate the RGS. Yet, it needs five orders of magnitude fewer emitters than the multiplexed linear-optics method -- with each emitter used as a photon source -- to achieve a desired rate-distance performance.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants for higher-order exceptional points in quantum three-mode systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to the presence of exceptional points (EPs), non-Hermitian (NH) systems can display intriguing topological phenomena without Hermitian analogs. However, experimental characterizations of exceptional topological invariants have been restricted to second-order EPs (EP2s) in classical or semiclassical systems. We here propose an NH multi-mode system with higher-order EPs, each of which is underlain by a multifold-degenerate multipartite entangled eigenstate. We implement the NH model by controllably coupling a Josephson-junction-based electronic mode to two microwave resonators. We experimentally quantify the topological invariant for an EP3, by mapping out the complex eigenspectra of the tripartite system along a loop surrounding this EP3 in the parameter space. The nonclassicality of the realized topology is manifested by the observed quantum correlations in the corresponding eigenstates. Our results extend research of exceptional topology to fully quantum-mechanical models with multipartite entangled eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations under environmental decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking a system of two coupled qubits described by a X-shaped state and interacting through an anisotropic Heisenberg XY interaction, we examine the evolution of quantum entanglement and a few quantum correlations beyond entanglement, local quantum uncertainty and measurement-induced nonlocality, under the environmental decoherence both for zero and finite temperatures. The relation between concurrence and log negativity as two well-known quantifiers of entanglement is argued. It will be proven that measurement-induced nonlocality equals correlated coherence. The interaction of qubits with the environment causes quantum entanglement to suddenly die for independent qubits, but other correlations do not experience this phenomenon. The time of entanglement sudden death is calculated analytically for zero temperature, while numerically for finite temperatures. Contrary to its usual destructive role, the environment plays a constructive role in some situations, inducing quantum correlations even when the initial quantum correlations are zero. The steady state quantum correlations, being independent of the initial state, are found to remain all non-zero for low, finite temperatures. It is found that quantum correlations beyond entanglement are more robust against temperature than entanglement. The zero-temperature steady state exhibits less local quantum uncertainty than the other correlations.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced state transitions in dispersive qubit readout schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dispersive-readout scheme enables quantum nondemolition measurement of superconducting qubits. An increased readout power can shorten the readout time and reduce the state discrimination error but can promote qubit transitions into higher noncomputational states. The ability to predict the onset of these measurement-induced state transitions can aid the optimization of qubit circuits and provide means for comparing the readout performance of different qubit types. Building upon the concept of dressed coherent states, we consider two straightforward metrics for determining the maximum number of photons that can be used for dispersive readout without causing state transitions. We focus on the fluxonium readout to demonstrate the independence of the metrics from any qubit-type-specific approximations. The dispersive readout of transmons and other superconducting qubits can be treated universally in the same fashion.</description>

      <title>Bulk and boundary entanglement transitions in the projective gauge-Higgs model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum many-body spin systems, the interplay between the entangling effect of multi-qubit Pauli measurements and the disentangling effect of single-qubit Pauli measurements may give rise to two competing effects. By introducing a randomized measurement pattern with such bases, a phase transition can be induced by altering the ratio between them. In this work, we numerically investigate a measurement-based model associated with the $(2+1)$d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Fradkin-Shenker Hamiltonian model, encompassing the deconfining, confining, and Higgs phases. We determine the phase diagram in our measurement-only model by employing entanglement measures. For the bulk topological order, we use the topological entanglement entropy. We also use the mutual information between separated boundary regions to diagnose the boundary phase transition associated with the Higgs or the bulk SPT phase. We observe the structural similarity between our phase diagram and the one in the standard quantum Hamiltonian formulation of the Fradkin-Shenker model with the open rough boundary. First, a deconfining phase is detected by nonzero and constant topological entanglement entropy. Second, we find a (boundary) phase transition curve separating the Higgs=SPT phase from the rest. In certain limits, the topological phase transitions reside at the critical point of the formation of giant homological cycles in the bulk 3d spacetime lattice, as well as the bond percolation threshold of the boundary 2d spacetime lattice when it is effectively decoupled from the bulk. Additionally, there are analogous mixed-phase properties at a certain region of the phase diagram, emerging from how we terminate the measurement-based procedure. Our findings pave an alternative pathway to study the physics of Higgs=SPT phases on quantum devices in the near future.</description>

      <title>Unconditional quantum magic advantage in shallow circuit computation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory promises computational speed-ups over classical approaches. The celebrated Gottesman-Knill Theorem implies that the full power of quantum computation resides in the specific resource of "magic" states -- the secret sauce to establish universal quantum computation. However, it is still questionable whether magic indeed brings the believed quantum advantage, ridding unproven complexity assumptions or black-box oracles. In this work, we demonstrate the first unconditional magic advantage: a separation between the power of generic constant-depth or shallow quantum circuits and magic-free counterparts. For this purpose, we link the shallow circuit computation with the strongest form of quantum nonlocality -- quantum pseudo-telepathy, where distant non-communicating observers generate perfectly synchronous statistics. We prove quantum magic is indispensable for such correlated statistics in a specific nonlocal game inspired by the linear binary constraint system. Then, we translate generating quantum pseudo-telepathy into computational tasks, where magic is necessary for a shallow circuit to meet the target. As a by-product, we provide an efficient algorithm to solve a general linear binary constraint system over the Pauli group, in contrast to the broad undecidability in constraint systems. We anticipate our results will enlighten the final establishment of the unconditional advantage of universal quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that if the wave function of a quantum system undergoes an arbitrary random transformation such that the diagonal elements of the density matrix in the decoherence basis associated with a preferred observable remain constant, then (i) the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix become smaller in magnitude, and (ii) the state of the system gains information about the preferred observable from its environment in the sense that the uncertainty of the observable is reduced in the transformed state. These results do not depend on the details of how the system-environment interaction generates the random state transformation, and together imply that decoherence leads in general to information gain, not information loss.</description>

      <title>Conditional Independence of 1D Gibbs States with Applications to Efficient Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that spin chains in thermal equilibrium have a correlation structure in which individual regions are strongly correlated at most with their near vicinity. We quantify this with alternative notions of the conditional mutual information, defined through the so-called Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy. We prove that these measures decay superexponentially at every positive temperature, under the assumption that the spin chain Hamiltonian is translation-invariant. Using a recovery map associated with these measures, we sequentially construct tensor network approximations in terms of marginals of small (sublogarithmic) size. As a main application, we show that classical representations of the states can be learned efficiently from local measurements with a polynomial sample complexity. We also prove an approximate factorization condition for the purity of the entire Gibbs state, which implies that it can be efficiently estimated to a small multiplicative error from a small number of local measurements. The results extend from strictly local to exponentially-decaying interactions above a threshold temperature, albeit only with exponential decay rates. As a technical step of independent interest, we show an upper bound to the decay of the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropy upon the application of a conditional expectation.</description>

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have revolutionized natural language processing. Combining them with quantum computing aims to further advance this technology. This paper introduces a novel Quantum Mixed-State Self-Attention Network (QMSAN) for natural language processing tasks. Our model leverages quantum computing principles to enhance the effectiveness of self-attention mechanisms. QMSAN uses a quantum attention mechanism based on mixed state, allowing for direct similarity estimation between queries and keys in the quantum domain. This approach leads to more effective attention coefficient calculations. We also propose an innovative quantum positional encoding scheme, implemented through fixed quantum gates within the circuit, improving the model's ability to capture sequence information without additional qubit resources. In numerical experiments of text classification tasks on public datasets, QMSAN outperforms Quantum Self-Attention Neural Network (QSANN). Furthermore, we demonstrate QMSAN's robustness in different quantum noise environments, highlighting its potential for near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of current and efficiency in a bosonic system consisting of a central system interacting with two reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive a master equation describing the time evolution of the density matrix of the system, accounting for the interactions and energy transfer between the components. We quantify the current, representing the flow of bosons through the system and analyse its dependence on the system's parameters and temperatures of the thermal reservoirs. In the steady state regime, we derived an expression for the efficiency of the energy transfer process. Our analysis show that quantum effects, such as the dependence on temperature and the quantum correction factor, can significantly impact energy transfer efficiency. In particular, we observe that at high temperatures, the efficiency of the quantum system is greater than the Carnot efficiency. The insights gained from this analysis may have implications in various fields, including quantum computing and energy harvesting, where optimising energy utilisation is crucial.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector.

Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common technique in the study of complex quantum-mechanical systems is to reduce the number of degrees of freedom in the Hamiltonian by using quasi-degenerate perturbation theory. While the Schrieffer--Wolff transformation achieves this and constructs an effective Hamiltonian, its scaling is suboptimal, it is limited to two subspaces, and implementing it efficiently is both challenging and error-prone. We introduce an algorithm for constructing an equivalent effective Hamiltonian as well as a Python package, Pymablock, that implements it. Our algorithm combines an optimal asymptotic scaling and the ability to handle any number of subspaces with a range of other improvements. The package supports numerical and analytical calculations of any order and it is designed to be interoperable with any other packages for specifying the Hamiltonian. We demonstrate how the package handles constructing a k.p model, analyses a superconducting qubit, and computes the low-energy spectrum of a large tight-binding model. We also compare its performance with reference calculations and demonstrate its efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circular atomtronics is known to exhibit a uniform ground state, unlike elliptical atomtronics. In elliptical atomtronics, the matter wave tends to accumulate along the semimajor edges during its time dynamics, which we depict by the survival function. Consequently, the dynamical time scales become coupled to the eccentricity, making the dynamics nontrivial for applications. We report that an appropriate dispersion management can decouple the time scales from the eccentricity. One can choose the suitable dispersion coefficient from the overlap function involving the corresponding ground state. We focus on producing distinct fractional matter waves inside an elliptical waveguide to achieve efficient atom interferometry. The said dispersion engineering can recover fractional revivals in the elliptical waveguide, analogous to the circular case. We demonstrate atom interferometry for the engineered elliptical atomtronics, where matter wave interference is mediated by an external harmonic trap for controlled interference patterns.</description>

Abstract: Neutral atom arrays manipulated with optical tweezers are promising candidates for fault-tolerant quantum computers due to their advantageous properties, such as scalability, long coherence times, and optical accessibility for communication. A significant challenge to overcome is the presence of non-Pauli errors, specifically erasure errors and leakage errors. Previous work has shown that leakage errors can be converted into erasure errors; however, these (converted) erasure errors continuously occur and accumulate over time. Prior proposals have involved transporting atoms directly from a reservoir area--where spare atoms are stored--to the computational area--where computation and error correction are performed--to correct atom loss. While coherent transport is promising, it may not address all challenges--particularly its effectiveness in dense arrays and alternative methods must help. In this study, we evaluate the effects of erasure errors on the surface code using circuit-based Monte Carlo simulations that incorporate depolarizing and accumulated erasure errors. We propose a new scheme to mitigate this problem: a k-shift erasure recovery scheme. Our scheme employs code deformation to repeatedly transfer the logical qubit from an imperfect array with accumulated erased qubits to a perfect array, thereby tolerating many accumulated erasures. Furthermore, our scheme corrects erasure errors in the atom arrays while the logical qubits are evacuated from the area being corrected; thus, manipulating optical tweezers for erasure correction does not disturb the qubits that constitute the logical data. Our scheme provides a practical pathway for neutral atom quantum computers to achieve feasible fault tolerance.</description>

      <title>Noise Classification in Three-Level Quantum Networks by Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a machine learning based classification of noise acting on a small quantum network with the aim of detecting spatial or multilevel correlations, and the interplay with Markovianity. We control a three-level system by inducing coherent population transfer exploiting different pulse amplitude combinations as inputs to train a feedforward neural network. We show that supervised learning can classify different types of classical dephasing noise affecting the system. Three non-Markovian (quasi-static correlated, anti-correlated and uncorrelated) and Markovian noises are classified with more than $99\%$ accuracy. On the contrary, correlations of Markovian noise cannot be discriminated with our method. Our approach is robust to statistical measurement errors and retains its effectiveness for physical measurements where only a limited number of samples is available making it very experimental-friendly. Our result paves the way for classifying spatial correlations of noise in quantum architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mpemba Effect in Random Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The essence of the Mpemba effect is that non-equilibrium systems may relax faster the further they are from their equilibrium configuration. In the quantum realm, this phenomenon arises in the dynamics of closed systems, where it is witnessed by fundamental features such as symmetry and entanglement. Here, we study the quantum Mpemba effect in charge-preserving random circuits on qudits combining extensive numerical simulations and analytical arguments. We show that the more asymmetric certain classes of initial states (tilted ferromagnets) are, the faster they restore symmetry and reach the grand-canonical ensemble. Conversely, other classes of states (tilted antiferromagnets) do not show the Mpemba effect. We provide a simple and general mechanism underlying the effect, based on the spreading of nonconserved operators in terms of conserved densities. Our analysis is based on minimal principles -- locality, unitarity, and symmetry. Consequently, our results represent a significant advancement in clarifying the emergence of Mpemba physics in chaotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dissipative systems with decoherence free subspaces, a.k.a. dark spaces (DSs), can be used to protect quantum information. At the same time, dissipation is expected to give rise to coherent information degradation outside the DS. Employed to support quantum information platforms, DSs can be adiabatically modified in a way that resembles adiabatic control of coherent systems. Here we study the slow evolution of a purely dissipative system with a spectral gap $\gamma$, characterized by a strong symmetry, under a cyclic protocol with period $T$. Non-adiabatic corrections to the state evolution give rise to decoherence: the evolution within the instantaneous DS is described by a time-local effective Liouvillian operator that leads to purity degradation over a period, of order $1/\gamma T$. We obtain a closed form of the latter to order $1/(\gamma T)^2$. Our analysis underlines speed limitations in quantum information processing in the absence of corrective measures.</description>

      <title>Incompressibility and spectral gaps of random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07478v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random reversible and quantum circuits form random walks on the alternating group $\mathrm{Alt}(2^n)$ and unitary group $\mathrm{SU}(2^n)$, respectively. Known bounds on the spectral gap for the $t$-th moment of these random walks have inverse-polynomial dependence in both $n$ and $t$. We prove that the gap for random reversible circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for all $t\geq 1$, and the gap for random quantum circuits is $\Omega(n^{-3})$ for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$. These gaps are independent of $t$ in the respective regimes. We can further improve both gaps to $n^{-1}/\mathrm{polylog}(n, t)$ for $t\leq 2^{\Theta(n)}$, which is tight up to polylog factors. Our spectral gap results have a number of consequences:
  1) Random reversible circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error $t$-wise independent (even) permutations for all $t\geq 1$; for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/6.1})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2 t)$ gates suffice.
  2) Random quantum circuits with $\mathcal{O}(n^4 t)$ gates form multiplicative-error unitary $t$-designs for $t \leq \Theta(2^{n/2})$; for $t\leq \Theta(2^{2n/5})$, we show that $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^2t)$ gates suffice.
  3) The robust quantum circuit complexity of random circuits grows linearly for an exponentially long time, proving the robust Brown--Susskind conjecture [BS18,BCHJ+21].
  Our spectral gap bounds are proven by reducing random quantum circuits to a more structured walk: a modification of the ``$\mathrm{PFC}$ ensemble'' from [MPSY24] together with an expander on the alternating group due to Kassabov [Kas07a], for which we give an efficient implementation using reversible circuits. In our reduction, we approximate the structured walk with local random circuits without losing the gap, which uses tools from the study of frustration-free Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ quantum state discrimination theory to establish the ultimate limit for spoofing detection in electromagnetic signals encoded with random quantum states. Our analysis yields an analytical expression for the optimal bound, which we prove can be achieved using a pair of coherent states. Notably, the quantum enhancement persists regardless of photon number, thereby removing the previous constraint to single-photon sources. This breakthrough unlocks new experimental possibilities using standard laser sources. Furthermore, we explore the encoding of squeezed states and demonstrate that the detection probability approaches 100% when the spoofer's capability is restricted to coherent state generation.</description>

      <title>Resource overheads and attainable rates for trapped-ion lattice surgery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present estimates for the number of ions needed to implement fault-tolerant lattice surgery between spatially separated trapped-ion surface codes. Additionally, we determine attainable lattice surgery rates given a number of dedicated ``communication ions" per logical qubit. Because our analysis depends heavily on the rate that syndrome extraction cycles take place, we survey the state-of the art and propose three possible cycle times between $10$ and $1000 \mu s$ that we could reasonably see realised provided certain technological milestones are met. Consequently, our numerical results indicate that hundreds of resource ions will be needed for lattice surgery in the slowest case, while close to a hundred thousand will be needed in the fastest case. The main factor contributing to these prohibitive estimates is the limited rate that ions can be coupled across traps. Our results indicate an urgent need for optical coupling to improve by one or more orders of magnitude for trapped-ion quantum computers to scale.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Thermal-Noise Limit of Microwave Measurements by Pre-cooling with an Active Cold Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a method, which we here name ``active pre-cooling'' (APC), for removing, just prior to performing a measurement, a large fraction of the deleterious thermal photons that would otherwise occupy the electromagnetic modes of a microwave cavity or some alternative form of radio-frequency resonator. The removal is achieved by temporarily over-coupling the cavity's modes to an active cold load (ACL). We report a room-temperature bench-top demonstration of the method, where this load takes the form of the input of a commercial low-noise amplifier (LNA). No isolator is inserted between the LNA's input and the cavity's coupling port. The noise temperature of a monitored microwave mode drops to 123 K. Upon incorporating our pre-coolable cavity into a time-resolved (tr-) EPR spectrometer, a commensurate improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio is observed, corresponding to a factor-of-5 speed up over a conventional tr-EPR measurement at room temperature for the same precision and/or sensitivity. Modeling indicates the feasibility, for realistic mode quality factors and couplings, of cooling the room-temperature cavity's modes down to a few tens of K, and for this coldness to last several tens of s, whilst the cavity and its contents are optimally interrogated by a microwave tone or pulse sequence. The method thus provides a simple and generally applicable approach to improving the sensitivity and/or read-out speed in pulsed and time-resolved EPR spectroscopy, quantum detection and other radiometric measurements. It provides a first-stage cold reservoir (of microwave photons) for other, deeper cooling methods to work from and, through the use of cryogenic ACLs (realized, in the first instance, as the inputs of existing cryogenic low-noise amplifiers), the method could itself be directly extended to lower temperature regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07664v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum corrections to electron dynamics in a circularly polarized electromagnetic field are found within the Floquet theory of periodically driven quantum systems. It is demonstrated that emission of photons by an electron rotating under the field leads to the quantum recoil force acting on the electron perpendicularly to the velocity of its forward movement, which differs crucially from the known classical recoil force directed oppositely to the velocity. Physically, such an anomalous radiation reaction arises from the one-loop QED correction to the photon emission and has no analogue within the classical electrodynamics. Possible manifestations of this phenomenon are discussed for electrons in strong laser fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study tests of quantum steering in which the trusted party does not have perfect control of their measurements. We report on steering inequalities that remain unaffected when introducing up to a threshold magnitude of measurement imprecision. This phenomenon, which we call an imprecision plateau, thus permits a departure from the standard assumption of idealised measurements without any incuring cost to the detection power of steering experiments. We provide an explanation for why imprecision plateaus are possible, a simple criterion for their existence and tools for analysing their properties. We also demonstrate that these plateaus have natural applications when the assumption of perfect measurements is relaxed: they allow for maintaining both the noise- and loss-robustness of standard steering tests and the performance rate of idealised one-sided device-independent random number generators.</description>

Abstract: Emergence of objective, classical properties in quantum systems can be described in the modern language of quantum information theory. In this work, we present an example of such an analysis. We apply the quantum channel theory to a boson-spin model of open quantum systems and calculate, using recoilless approximation and the Floquet theory, the Holevo quantity, which bounds the capacity of the channel, broadcasting information about the central system into its environment. We analyze both the short-time regime, showing quadratic in time initial growth of the capacity, and the asymptotic regime. Complicated dependence on the model parameters, such as temperature, tunneling energy for the environment, etc., is also analyzed, showing, e.g., regimes where the Holevo bound reaches its maximum.</description>

The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore nonclassical effects in the phase space of a four-headed kitten state (a superposition of two Schr\"odinger kitten states) induced by photon addition and subtraction operations applied in different sequences. We investigate two scenarios: in the first, photon addition is applied to the state, followed by photon subtraction, while in the second, the order of operations is reversed. We demonstrate that applying multiphoton operations to the state results in notable nearly isotropic sub-Planck structures, with the characteristics of these structures being influenced by the photon addition and subtraction. We observe that adding photons increases the average photon number, while photon subtraction reduces it in the first case but has no effect in the second. Increasing the number of added photons compresses the sub-Planck structures in both cases. Photon subtraction, however, has the opposite effect on the sub-Planck structures in the first case and no effect in the second, although it may improve their isotropy at optimal settings. The presence of the sub-Planck structures in our states leads to improved sensitivity to displacements, exceeding the standard quantum limit, as verified across all the depicted scenarios.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Winning Certain Coset-Guessing Quantum Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recently introduced coset guessing game, Alice plays against Bob and Charlie, aiming to meet a joint winning condition. Bob and Charlie can only communicate before the game starts to devise a joint strategy. The game we consider begins with Alice preparing a 2m-qubit quantum state based on a random selection of three parameters. She sends the first m qubits to Bob and the rest to Charlie and then reveals to them her choice for one of the parameters. Bob is supposed to guess one of the hidden parameters, Charlie the other, and they win if both guesses are correct. From previous work, we know that the probability of Bob's and Charlie's guesses being simultaneously correct goes to zero exponentially as m increases. We derive a tight upper bound on this probability and show how Bob and Charlie can achieve it. While developing the optimal strategy, we devised an encoding circuit using only CNOT and Hadamard gates, which could be relevant for building efficient CSS-coded systems. We found that the role of quantum information that Alice communicates to Bob and Charlie is to make their responses correlated rather than improve their individual (marginal) correct guessing rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we model the interaction of a quantum emitter with a finite-size dispersive dielectric object in an unbounded space within the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics, using the modified Langevin noise formalism, without any restrictions on the emitter level structure or dipole operator. The quantized electromagnetic field consists of two contributions: the medium-assisted field, which accounts for the electromagnetic field generated by the noise polarization currents of the dielectric, and the scattering-assisted field, which takes into account the electromagnetic field incoming from infinity and scattered by the dielectric. We show that the emitter couples to two distinct bosonic baths: a medium-assisted bath and a scattering-assisted bath, each characterized by its own spectral density. We identify the conditions under which the electromagnetic environment composed of these two baths can be effectively replaced by a single bosonic bath, so that the reduced dynamics of the quantum emitter remain unchanged. In particular, when the initial states of the medium- and scattering-assisted baths are thermal states with the same temperature, we find that a single bosonic bath with a spectral density equal to the sum of the medium-assisted and scattering-assisted spectral densities is equivalent to the original electromagnetic environment.</description>

Abstract: We modify the R\'enyi (1961) axioms for entropy to apply to negative (``signed") measures as arise, for example, in phase-space representations of quantum mechanics. We obtain two new measures of (lack of) information about a system -- which we propose as signed analogs to classical Shannon entropy and classical R\'enyi entropy, respectively. We show that signed R\'enyi entropy witnesses non-classicality of a system. Specifically, a measure has at least one negative component if and only if signed R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropy is negative for some $\alpha &gt; 1$. The corresponding non-classicality test does not work with signed Shannon entropy. We next show that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy, when $k$ is a positive integer, is Schur-concave. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy is not Schur-concave.) We then establish an abstract quantum H-theorem for signed measures. We prove that signed R\'enyi $2k$-entropy is non-decreasing under classical (``decohering") evolution of a signed measure, where the latter could be a Wigner function or other phase-space representation of a quantum system. (An example shows that signed Shannon entropy may be non-monotonic.) We also provide a characterization of the Second Law for signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy in terms of what we call eventual classicalization of evolution of a system. We conclude with an argument that signed R\'enyi $2$-entropy of the Wigner function is constant under Moyal bracket evolution.</description>

      <title>Supercharging exceptional points: Full-spectrum pairwise coalescence in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider non-Hermitian tight-binding one-dimensional Hamiltonians and show that imposing a certain symmetry causes all eigenvalues to pair up and the corresponding eigenstates to coalesce in pairs. This Pairwise Coalescence (PC) is an enhanced version of an exceptional point -- the complete spectrum pairs up, not just one pair of eigenstates. The symmetry is that of reflection excluding the central two sites, and allowing flipping of non-reciprocal hoppings (``generalized off-center reflection symmetry''). Two simple examples of PC exist in the literature -- our construction encompasses these examples and extends them to a vast class of Hamiltonians. We study several families of such Hamiltonians, extend to cases of full-spectrum higher-order coalescences, and show how the PC point corresponds to amplified non-orthogonality of the eigenstates and enhanced loss of norm in time evolution.</description>

      <title>A cat qubit stabilization scheme using a voltage biased Josephson junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08132v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DC-voltage-biased Josephson junctions have been recently employed in superconducting circuits for Hamiltonian engineering, demonstrating microwave amplification, single photon sources and entangled photon generation. Compared to more conventional approaches based on parametric pumps, this solution typically enables larger interaction strengths. In the context of quantum information, a two-to-one photon interaction can stabilize cat qubits, where bit-flip errors are exponentially suppressed, promising significant resource savings for quantum error correction. This work investigates how the DC bias approach to Hamiltonian engineering can benefit cat qubits. We find a simple circuit design that is predicted to showcase a two-to-one photon exchange rate larger than that of the parametric pump-based implementation while dynamically averaging typically resonant parasitic terms such as Kerr and cross Kerr. In addition to addressing qubit stabilization, we propose to use injection locking with a cat-qubit adapted frequency filter to prevent long-term drifts of the cat qubit angle associated to DC voltage noise. The whole scheme is simulated without rotating-wave approximations, highlighting for the first time the amplitude of related oscillatory effects in cat-qubit stabilization schemes. This study lays the groundwork for the experimental realization of such a circuit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arrays of optically trapped neutral atoms are a promising architecture for the realization of quantum computers. In order to run increasingly complex algorithms, it is advantageous to demonstrate high-fidelity and flexible gates between long-lived and highly coherent qubit states. In this work, we demonstrate a universal high-fidelity gate-set with individually controlled and parallel application of single-qubit gates and two-qubit gates operating on the ground-state nuclear spin qubit in arrays of tweezer-trapped $^{171}$Yb atoms. We utilize the long lifetime, flexible control, and high physical fidelity of our system to characterize native gates using single and two-qubit Clifford and symmetric subspace randomized benchmarking circuits with more than 200 CZ gates applied to one or two pairs of atoms. We measure our two-qubit entangling gate fidelity to be 99.72(3)% (99.40(3)%) with (without) post-selection. In addition, we introduce a simple and optimized method for calibration of multi-parameter quantum gates. These results represent important milestones towards executing complex and general quantum computation with neutral atoms.</description>

Abstract: In this article the weakest possible theorem giving a foundation behind the Hilbert space formalism of quantum theory is stated. The necessary postulates are formulated, and the mathematics is spelled out in detail. It is argued that, from this approach, a general epistemic interpretation of quantum mechanics is natural. Some applications to the Bell experiment and to decision theory are briefly discussed. The article represents the conclusion of a series of articles and books on quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Kitaev Quantum Batteries: Super-Extensive Scaling of Ergotropy in 1D Spin$-1/2$ $XY-\Gamma(\gamma)$ Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of a novel model based on a one-dimensional (1D) spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg $XY-\Gamma(\gamma)$ quantum chain, also known as 1D Kitaev chain, as a working medium for a quantum battery (QB) in both closed and open system scenarios. We analyze the closed QB scenario by analytically evaluating ergotropy across different spin-spin couplings, anisotropies in spin interactions, Zeeman field strengths, charging field intensities, $\Gamma$ interactions, and temperature. Our results indicate that the ergotropy is highly dependent on spin-spin coupling and anisotropy. Under variable parameters, an increase in the spin-spin coupling strength displays quenches and exhibits non-equilibrium trends in ergotropy. After a quench, ergotropy may experience a sharp increase or drop, suggesting optimal operational conditions for QB performance. In the open QB scenario, we examine spin chains of sizes $2 \leq N \leq 8$ under the influence of dephasing, focusing on the evolution of ergotropy. We study two charging schemes: parallel charging, where spins are non-interacting, and collective charging, involving spin-spin coupling. In the former, increased Zeeman field strength enhances both the peak ergotropy and charging rate, although without any quantum advantage or super-extensive scaling. In the latter, increasing spin-spin coupling might not achieve super-extensive scaling without introducing anisotropy in the spin-spin interaction. Our results suggest that optimal QB performance and a quantum advantage in scaling can be achieved by leveraging anisotropic spin-spin couplings and non-zero $\Gamma$ interactions, allowing for faster charging and higher ergotropy under super-extensive scaling conditions up to $\alpha=1.24$ for the given size of the spin chain.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek scaling law in dissipative critical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dissipative quench dynamics in a family of two-band fermionic systems on bipartite lattices ramped across their critical points, which is cast into the Lindblad formalism. First, we demonstrate an exact solution in the presence of uniform loss or gain, which tells that dissipation exponentially suppresses the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) scaling behavior and the quantum jump part of the dissipation is responsible for the anti-KZ (AKZ) behavior. Then, in a scenario of engineered dissipation, we exemplify the effect of loss difference between the two sublattices of the system by three typical models. By the one-dimensional Rice-Mele model, we unravel a kind of dissipative KZ (DKZ) scaling law in the limit of loss difference and point out a convenient way to observe the DKZ behavior by counting the number of residual particles. Nevertheless, in the one-dimensional Shockley model, we find a nonuniversal scaling behavior irrelevant to the critical dynamics. Thus we explore several quench protocols so that these two scaling behaviors can appear together or separately. At last, we extend our findings to the two-dimensional Haldane model for Chern insulators consistently.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Quantum Memories with Light-Matter Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Future optical quantum technologies, including quantum networks and distributed quantum computing and sensing, demand efficient, broadband quantum memories. However, achieving high efficiencies in optical quantum memory protocols is a significant challenge, and typical methods to increase the efficiency can often introduce noise, reduce the bandwidth, or limit scalability. Here, we present a new approach to enhancing quantum memory protocols by leveraging constructive light-matter interference. We implement this method in a Raman quantum memory in warm Cesium vapor, and achieve a more than three-fold improvement in total efficiency reaching $(34.3\pm8.4)\%$, while retaining GHz-bandwidth operation and low noise levels. Numerical simulations predict that this approach can boost efficiencies in systems limited by atomic density, such as cold atomic ensembles, from $65\%$ to beyond $96\%$, while in warm atomic vapors it could reduce the laser intensity to reach a given efficiency by over an order-of-magnitude, and exceed $95\%$ total efficiency. Furthermore, we find that our method preserves the single-mode nature of the memory at significantly higher efficiencies. This new protocol is applicable to various memory architectures, paving the way toward scalable, efficient, low-noise, and high-bandwidth quantum memories.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanics is proved to admit no hidden-variable in 1960s, which means the quantum systems are contextual. Revealing the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics is a significant task. We develop the approach of partial Boolean algebra to characterize the contextuality theory with local consistency and exclusivity, and then prove that the finite dimensional quantum systems are determined by atoms using two graph structure theorems. We also generalize our work to infinite dimensional cases. Our conclusions indicate that the quantum mechanics is a graph-structured combination of multiple hidden-variable theories, and provide a precise mathematical framework for quantum contextuality.</description>

      <title>Generating non-Clifford gate operations through exact mapping between Majorana fermions and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana fermions and their generalizations to $\mathbb{Z}_n$ parafermions are considered promising building blocks of fault-tolerant quantum computers for their ability to encode quantum information nonlocally. In such topological quantum computers, highly robust quantum gates are obtained by braiding pairs of these quasi-particles. However, it is well-known that braiding Majorana fermions or parafermions only leads to a Clifford gate, hindering quantum universality. This paper establishes an exact mapping between Majorana fermions to $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions in systems under total parity non-conserving and total parity conserving setting. It is revealed that braiding of Majorana fermions may lead to non-Clifford quantum gates in the 4-dimensional qudit representation spanned by $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions, whilst braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions may similarly yield non-Clifford quantum gates in the qubit representation spanned by Majorana fermions. This finding suggests that topologically protected universal quantum computing may be possible with Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) by supplementing the usual braiding operations with the braiding of $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions (Majorana fermions) that could be formed out of Majorana fermions ($\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions) via the mapping prescribed here. Finally, the paper discusses how braiding of Majorana fermions or $\mathbb{Z}_4$ parafermions could be obtained via a series of parity measurements.</description>

Abstract: A two-terminal quantum spin-Hall heat engine and refrigerator with embedded Majorana bound states (MBS) is analyzed for optimality in thermoelectric performance using the Landaeur-Buttiker approach. This investigation can be an effective tool to detect MBS. Furthermore, the occurrence of MBS can enhance the performance to rival, as well as outperform, some modern nanoscale quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators. The optimal performance of this MBS quantum heat engine and quantum refrigerator can be further enhanced by an Aharonov-Bohm flux.</description>

      <title>Symmetries as Ground States of Local Superoperators: Hydrodynamic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry algebras of quantum many-body systems with locality can be understood using commutant algebras, which are defined as algebras of operators that commute with a given set of local operators. In this work, we show that these symmetry algebras can be expressed as frustration-free ground states of a local superoperator, which we refer to as a ``super-Hamiltonian". We demonstrate this for conventional symmetries such as $Z_2$, $U(1)$, and $SU(2)$, where the symmetry algebras map to various kinds of ferromagnetic ground states, as well as for unconventional ones that lead to weak ergodicity breaking phenomena of Hilbert space fragmentation and quantum many-body scars. In addition, we show that the low-energy excitations of this super-Hamiltonian can be understood as approximate symmetries, which in turn are related to slowly relaxing hydrodynamic modes in symmetric systems. This connection is made precise by relating the super-Hamiltonian to the superoperator that governs the operator relaxation in noisy symmetric Brownian circuits, and this physical interpretation also provides a novel interpretation for Mazur bounds for autocorrelation functions. We find examples of gapped/gapless super-Hamiltonians indicating the absence/presence of slow-modes, which happens in the presence of discrete/continuous symmetries. In the gapless cases, we recover hydrodynamic modes such as diffusion, tracer diffusion, and asymptotic scars in the presence of $U(1)$ symmetry, Hilbert space fragmentation, and a tower of quantum scars respectively. In all, this demonstrates the power of the commutant algebra framework in obtaining a comprehensive understanding of exact symmetries, and associated approximate symmetries and hydrodynamic modes, and their dynamical consequences in systems with locality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08473v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum processors advance, the emergence of large-scale decentralized systems involving interacting quantum-enabled agents is on the horizon. Recent research efforts have explored quantum versions of Nash and correlated equilibria as solution concepts of strategic quantum interactions, but these approaches did not directly connect to decentralized adaptive setups where agents possess limited information. This paper delves into the dynamics of quantum-enabled agents within decentralized systems that employ no-regret algorithms to update their behaviors over time. Specifically, we investigate two-player quantum zero-sum games and polymatrix quantum zero-sum games, showing that no-regret algorithms converge to separable quantum Nash equilibria in time-average. In the case of general multi-player quantum games, our work leads to a novel solution concept, that of the {separable} quantum coarse correlated equilibria (QCCE), as the convergent outcome of the time-averaged behavior no-regret algorithms, offering a natural solution concept for decentralized quantum systems. Finally, we show that computing QCCEs can be formulated as a semidefinite program and establish the existence of entangled (i.e., non-separable) QCCEs, which are unlearnable via the current paradigm of no-regret learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15776v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of extending the insights and techniques of categorical quantum mechanics to infinite-dimensional systems was considered in (Coecke and Heunen, 2016). In that work the $\mathrm{CP}^{\infty}$-construction, which recovers the category of Hilbert spaces and quantum operations from the category of Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps, was defined. Here we show that by a `horizontal categorification' of the $\mathrm{CP}^{\infty}$-construction, one can recover the category of all von Neumann algebras and channels (normal unital completely positive maps) from the 2-category $[W^*]$ of von Neumann algebras, bimodules and intertwiners. As an application, we extend Choi's characterisation of extremal channels between finite-dimensional matrix algebras to a characterisation of extremal channels between arbitrary von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the magnetization is equal to the edge current in the thermodynamic limit for a large class of models of lattice fermions with finite-range interactions satisfying local indistinguishability of the Gibbs state, a condition known to hold for sufficiently high temperatures. Our result implies that edge currents in such systems are determined by bulk properties and are therefore stable against large perturbations near the boundaries. Moreover, the equality persists also after taking the derivative with respect to the chemical potential. We show that this form of bulk-edge correspondence is essentially a consequence of homogeneity in the bulk and locality of the Gibbs state. An important intermediate result is a new version of Bloch's theorem for two-dimensional systems, stating that persistent currents vanish in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Plaquette-type valence bond solid state in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square-lattice Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We utilize Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and Fully Augmented Matrix Product States (FAMPS) methods to investigate the Valence Bond Solid (VBS) phase in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model. To differentiate between the Columnar Valence Bond Solid (CVBS) and Plaquette Valence Bond Solid (PVBS) phases, we introduce an anisotropy $\Delta_y$ in the nearest neighboring coupling in the $y$-direction, aiming at detecting the possible spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. In the calculations, we push the bond dimension to as large as $D = 25000$ in FAMPS, simulating systems at a maximum size of $14 \times 14$. With a careful extrapolation of the truncation errors and appropriate finite-size scaling, followed by finite $\Delta_y$ scaling analysis of the VBS dimer order parameters, we identify the VBS phase as a PVBS type, meaning there is no spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking in the VBS phase. This study not only resolves the long-standing issue of the characterization of the VBS order in the $J_1$-$J_2$ square lattice Heisenberg model but also highlights the capabilities of FAMPS in the study of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Assisting Tibetan Students in Learning Quantum Mechanics via Mathematica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Undergraduate students of physics in Tibet have great difficulty learning quantum mechanics (QM). We attempt to use PER-based methods to help Tibetan students learn QM. In this preliminary study, we incorporate Mathematica in a QM course at Tibet University and record students' learning experiences. Tibetan students tend to have subjective feelings of learning Mathematica, whereas Han students (majority) are more focused on the operational techniques of Mathematica. The results also suggest that both Tibetan students and Han students show limited improvement in time-independent Schrodinger equations after learning QM with Mathematica. Further effort is needed to improve the academic literacy skills of physics students in Tibet.</description>

      <title>Reality of the Eigenvalues of the Hilbert-P\'olya Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15135v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent work in~[J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 57, 235204 (2024)], we propose a Hamiltonian for the Hilbert-P\'olya Conjecture. We establish the existence of a well-defined similarity transformation that renders this Hamiltonian self-adjoint for the nontrivial Riemann zeros. In particular, we explicitly demonstrate that the eigenfunctions of the transformed Hamiltonian are orthogonal and square-integrable, and crucially, that the eigenvalues are real. This represents a significant step toward proving the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Models of interacting bosons with exact ground states: a unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define an infinite class of ``frustration-free'' interacting lattice quantum Hamiltonians for bosons, constructed such that their exact ground states have a density distribution specified by the Boltzmann weight of a corresponding classical lattice gas problem. By appropriately choosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various known solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code, and certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct solvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin liquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose surfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from a non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.</description>

      <title>Many-body physics and resolvent algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some advantages of the algebraic approach to many body physics, based on resolvent algebras, are illustrated by the simple example of non-interacting bosons which are confined in compact regions with soft boundaries. It is shown that the dynamics of these systems converges to the spatially homogeneous dynamics for increasing regions and particle numbers and a variety of boundary forces. The corresponding correlation functions of thermal equilibrium states also converge in this limit. Depending on the filling of the regions with particles, the limits can either be spatially homogeneous, including the Bose-Einstein condensates, or they become inhomogeneous with varying, but finite local particle densities. In case of this spontaneous breakdown of the spatial symmetry, the presence of condensates can be established by exhibiting temporal correlations over large temporal distances (memory effects).</description>

      <title>Thermalization of a Closed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev System in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The question of thermalization of a closed quantum system is of central interest in non-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here we present one such study analyzing the dynamics of a closed coupled Majorana SYK system. We have a large-$q$ SYK model prepared initially at equilibrium quenched by introducing a random hopping term, thus leading to non-equilibrium dynamics. We find that the final stationary state reaches thermal equilibrium with respect to the Green's functions and energy. Accordingly, the final state is characterized by calculating its final temperature and the thermalization rate. We provide a detailed review of analytical methods and derive the required Kadanoff-Baym equations, which are then solved using the algorithm developed in this work. Our results display rich thermalization dynamics in a closed quantum system in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Lanczos algorithm offers a method for constructing wave functions for both closed and open systems based on their Hamiltonians. Given that the entire early universe is fundamentally an open system, we apply the Lanczos algorithm to investigate Krylov complexity across different phases of the early universe, including inflation, the radiation-dominated period (RD), and the matter-dominated period (MD). Notably, we find that Krylov complexity differs between the closed and open system approaches. To effectively capture the impact of potentials during the RD and MD phases, we analyze various inflationary potentials, including the Higgs potential, the \(R^2\) inflationary potential, and chaotic inflationary potential, which is taking into account the violations of slow-roll conditions. This analysis is conducted in terms of conformal time through the preheating process. Our numerical results indicate that the evolution of Krylov complexity and Krylov entropy is remarkably similar within distinctive potentials in RD and MD. Additionally, we rigorously construct what is referred to as an open two-mode squeezed state, utilizing the second kind of Meixner polynomials. Based on this construction, we are the first to calculate the evolution equations for \(r_k\) and \(\phi_k\) as they relate to the scale factor. Our findings suggest that dissipative effects lead to a rapid decoherence-like behavior. Moreover, our results indicate that inflation behaves as a strongly dissipative system, while both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated phases exhibit characteristics of weak dissipation. This research provides new insights into exploring the universe from the perspective of quantum information.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of chirality imbalance in SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>
