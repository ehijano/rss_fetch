      <title>A Well-Balanced Fifth-Order A-WENO Scheme Based on Flux Globalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new fifth-order flux globalization based well-balanced (WB) alternative weighted essentially non-oscillatory (A-WENO) scheme for general nonconservative systems. The proposed scheme is a higher-order extension of the WB path-conservative central-upwind (PCCU) scheme recently proposed in [A. Kurganov, Y. Liu and R. Xin, J. Comput. Phys., 474 (2023), Paper No. 111773]. We apply the new scheme to the nozzle flow system and the two-layer shallow water equations. We conduct a series of numerical experiments, which clearly demonstrate the advantages of using the fifth-order extension of the flux globalization based WB PCCU scheme.</description>

      <title>Mimetic finite difference schemes for transport operators with divergence-free advective field and applications to plasma physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wave propagation problems, finite difference methods implemented on staggered grids are commonly used to avoid checkerboard patterns and to improve accuracy in the approximation of short-wavelength components of the solutions. In this study, we develop a mimetic finite difference (MFD) method on staggered grids for transport operators with divergence-free advective field that is proven to be energy-preserving in wave problems. This method mimics some characteristics of the summation-by-parts (SBP) operators framework, in particular it preserves the divergence theorem at the discrete level. Its design is intended to be versatile and applicable to wave problems characterized by a divergence-free velocity. As an application, we consider the electrostatic shear Alfv\'en waves (SAWs), appearing in the modeling of plasmas. These waves are solved in a magnetic field configuration recalling that of a tokamak device. The study of the generalized eigenvalue problem associated with the SAWs shows the energy conservation of the discretization scheme, demonstrating the stability of the numerical solution.</description>

      <title>A study on nodal and isogeometric formulations for nonlinear dynamics of shear- and torsion-free rods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we compare the nodal and isogeometric spatial discretization schemes for the nonlinear formulation of shear- and torsion-free rods introduced in [1]. We investigate the resulting discrete solution space, the accuracy, and the computational cost of these spatial discretization schemes. To fulfill the required C1 continuity of the rod formulation, the nodal scheme discretizes the rod in terms of its nodal positions and directors using cubic Hermite splines. Isogeometric discretizations naturally fulfill this with smoothspline basis functions and discretize the rod only in terms of the positions of the control points [2], which leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of the Euclidean space R3. They enable the employment of basis functions of one degree lower, i.e. quadratic C1 splines, and possibly reduce the number of degrees of freedom. When using the nodal scheme, since the defined director field is in the unit sphere S2, preserving this for the nodal director variable field requires an additional constraint of unit nodal directors. This leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of the manifold R3xS2, however, results in zero nodal axial stress values. Allowing arbitrary length for the nodal directors, i.e. a nodal director field in R3 instead of S2 as within discrete rod elements, eliminates the constrained nodal axial stresses and leads to a discrete solution in multiple copies of R3. We discuss a strong and weak approach using the Lagrange multiplier method and penalty method, respectively, to enforce the unit nodal director constraint. We compare the resulting semi-discrete formulations and the computational cost of these discretization variants. We numerically demonstrate our findings via examples of a planar roll-up, a catenary, and a mooring line.</description>

      <title>MscaleFNO: Multi-scale Fourier Neural Operator Learning for Oscillatory Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a multi-scale Fourier neural operator (MscaleFNO) is proposed to reduce the spectral bias of the FNO in learning the mapping between highly oscillatory functions, with application to the nonlinear mapping between the coefficient of the Helmholtz equation and its solution. The MscaleFNO consists of a series of parallel normal FNOs with scaled input of the function and the spatial variable, and their outputs are shown to be able to capture various high-frequency components of the mapping's image. Numerical methods demonstrate the substantial improvement of the MscaleFNO for the problem of wave scattering in the high-frequency regime over the normal FNO with a similar number of network parameters.</description>

      <title>Vector Extrapolation Methods Applied To Geometric Multigrid Solvers For Isogeometric Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we study how to develop an efficient solver for the fast resolution of large and sparse linear systems that occur while discretizing elliptic partial differential equations using isogeometric analysis. Our new approach combines vector extrapolation methods with geometric multigrid schemes. Using polynomial-type extrapolation methods to speed up the multigrid iterations is our main focus. Several numerical tests are given to demonstrate the efficiency of these polynomial extrapolation methods in improving multigrid solvers in the context of isogeometric analysis.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Bfloat16, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics in Sparse Linear Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving sparse linear systems lies at the core of numerous computational applications. Consequently, understanding the performance of recently proposed alternatives to the established IEEE 754 floating-point numbers, such as bfloat16 and the tapered-precision posit and takum machine number formats, is of significant interest. This paper examines these formats in the context of widely used solvers, namely LU, QR, and GMRES, with incomplete LU preconditioning and mixed precision iterative refinement (MPIR). This contrasts with the prevailing emphasis on designing specialized algorithms tailored to new arithmetic formats.
  This paper presents an extensive and unprecedented evaluation based on the SuiteSparse Matrix Collection -- a dataset of real-world matrices with diverse sizes and condition numbers. A key contribution is the faithful reproduction of SuiteSparse's UMFPACK multifrontal LU factorization and SPQR multifrontal QR factorization for machine number formats beyond single and double-precision IEEE 754. Tapered-precision posit and takum formats show better accuracy in direct solvers and reduced iteration counts in indirect solvers. Takum arithmetic, in particular, exhibits exceptional stability, even at low precision.</description>

      <title>Integer Representations in IEEE 754, Posit, and Takum Arithmetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The posit and takum machine number formats have been proposed as alternatives to the IEEE 754 floating-point standard. As floating-point numbers are frequently employed to represent integral values, with certain applications explicitly relying on this capability, it is pertinent to evaluate how effectively these new formats fulfil this function compared to the standard they seek to replace. While empirical results are known for posits, this aspect has yet to be formally investigated.
  This paper provides rigorous derivations and proofs of the integral representation capabilities of posits and takums, examining both the exact number of bits required to represent a given integer and the largest consecutive integer that can be represented with a specified number of bits. The findings indicate that, while posits are generally less effective than IEEE 754 floating-point numbers in this regard, takums demonstrate overall superior representational strength compared to both IEEE 754 and posits.</description>

      <title>Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.</description>

      <title>A $p$-adaptive treecode solution of the Poisson equation in the general domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raising the order of the multipole expansion is a feasible approach for improving the accuracy of the treecode algorithm. However, a uniform order for the expansion would result in the inefficiency of the implementation, especially when the kernel function is singular. In this paper, a $p$-adaptive treecode algorithm is designed to resolve the efficiency issue for problems defined on a general domain. Such a $p$-adaptive implementation is realized through i). conducting a systematical error analysis for the treecode algorithm, ii). designing a strategy for a non-uniform distribution of the order of multipole expansion towards a given error tolerance, and iii). employing a hierarchy geometry tree structure for coding the algorithm. The proposed $p$-adaptive treecode algorithm is validated by a number of numerical experiments, from which the desired performance is observed successfully, i.e., the computational complexity is reduced dramatically compared with the uniform order case, making our algorithm a competitive one for bottleneck problems such as the demagnetizing field calculation in computational micromagnetics.</description>

      <title>Runge-Kutta Physics Informed Neural Networks: Formulation and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider time-dependent PDEs discretized by a special class of Physics Informed Neural Networks whose design is based on the framework of Runge--Kutta and related time-Galerkin discretizations. The primary motivation for using such methods is that alternative time-discrete schemes not only enable higher-order approximations but also have a crucial impact on the qualitative behavior of the discrete solutions. The design of the methods follows a novel training approach based on two key principles: (a) the discrete loss is designed using a time-discrete framework, and (b) the final loss formulation incorporates Runge--Kutta or time-Galerkin discretization in a carefully structured manner. We then demonstrate that the resulting methods inherit the stability properties of the Runge--Kutta or time-Galerkin schemes, and furthermore, their computational behavior aligns with that of the original time discrete method used in their formulation. In our analysis, we focus on linear parabolic equations, demonstrating both the stability of the methods and the convergence of the discrete minimizers to solutions of the underlying evolution PDE. An important novel aspect of our work is the derivation of maximal regularity (MR) estimates for B-stable Runge--Kutta schemes and both continuous and discontinuous Galerkin time discretizations. This allows us to provide new energy-based proofs for maximal regularity estimates previously established by Kov\'acs, Li, and Lubich, now in the Hilbert space setting and with the flexibility of variable time steps.</description>

      <title>An inverse obstacle scattering problem with random sources in the time domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers a time domain inverse acoustic obstacle scattering problem due to randomly distributed point sources. Motivated by the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff identity in the frequency domain, we propose to relate the time domain measurement data due to random sources to an approximate data set given by the subtraction of two scattered wave fields. We propose a time domain linear sampling method for the approximate data set and show how to tackle the measurement data due to random sources. An imaging functional is built based on the linear sampling method, which reconstructs the support of the unknown scattering object using directly the time domain measurements. The functional framework is based on the Laplace transform, which relates the mapping properties of Laplace domain factorized operators to their counterparts in the time domain. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the capability of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: The article is devoted to the study of neural networks with one hidden layer and a modified activation function for solving physical problems. A rectified sigmoid activation function has been proposed to solve physical problems described by the ODE with neural networks. Algorithms for physics-informed data-driven initialization of a neural network and a neuron-by-neuron gradient-free fitting method have been presented for the neural network with this activation function. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of neural networks with a rectified sigmoid function over neural networks with a sigmoid function in the accuracy of solving physical problems (harmonic oscillator, relativistic slingshot, and Lorentz system).</description>

      <title>A gradient-based and determinant-free framework for fully Bayesian Gaussian process regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is widely used for inferring functions from noisy data. GPR crucially relies on the choice of a kernel, which might be specified in terms of a collection of hyperparameters that must be chosen or learned. Fully Bayesian GPR seeks to infer these kernel hyperparameters in a Bayesian sense, and the key computational challenge in sampling from their posterior distribution is the need for frequent determinant evaluations of large kernel matrices. This paper introduces a gradient-based, determinant-free approach for fully Bayesian GPR that combines a Gaussian integration trick for avoiding the determinant with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. Our framework permits a matrix-free formulation and reduces the difficulty of dealing with hyperparameter gradients to a simple automatic differentiation. Our implementation is highly flexible and leverages GPU acceleration with linear-scaling memory footprint. Numerical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to scale gracefully to both high-dimensional hyperparameter spaces and large kernel matrices.</description>

      <title>A positivity-preserving truncated Euler--Maruyama method for stochastic differential equations with positive solutions: multi-dimensional case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many positivity-preserving numerical methods have been developed to solve stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with positive solutions in recent years. A common technique in these methods is transformation, such as the Lamperti or logarithmic transformations. It is widely used in one-dimensional cases. However, an effective method for solving multi-dimensional general SDEs with positive solutions has yet to be established. To fill this gap, we propose a positivity-preserving method combining a novel truncated mapping and a truncated Euler--Maruyama discretization in this paper. The strong and weak convergence of the numerical method is studied under local Lipschitz and integrability conditions. Moreover, we show that this method has the optimal strong convergence order 1/2 and the weak convergence order close to 1 under additional assumptions. Numerical experiments are presented to validate theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the first-order system proximal Galerkin (FOSPG) method, a locally mass-conserving, hybridizable finite element method for solving heterogeneous anisotropic diffusion and obstacle problems. Like other proximal Galerkin methods, FOSPG finds solutions by solving a recursive sequence of smooth, discretized, nonlinear subproblems. We establish the well-posedness and convergence of these nonlinear subproblems along with stability and error estimates under low regularity assumptions for the linearized equations obtained by solving each subproblem using Newton's method. The FOSPG method exhibits several advantages, including high-order accuracy, discrete maximum principle or bound-preserving discrete solutions, and local mass conservation. It also achieves prescribed solution accuracy within asymptotically mesh-independent numbers of subproblems and linear solves per subproblem iteration. Numerical experiments on benchmarks for anisotropic diffusion and obstacle problems confirm these attributes. Furthermore, an open-source implementation of the method is provided to facilitate broader adoption and reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a stabilized optimal control problem governed by a parabolic convection--diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem on a bounded domain $\Omega\subset{\mathbb{R}}^2,$ governed by a parabolic convection--diffusion equation with pointwise control constraints. We follow the optimize-then-discretize-approach, where for the state and the co-state variable, we consider the piecewise finite element method alongside with the algebraic flux correction method for its stabilization and the for temporal discretization, we use the backward Euler for the state variable and explicit Euler for the co-state variable. The discrete control variable is obtained by the projection of the discretized adjoint state on the set of admissible controls. The resulting stabilized fully--discrete scheme is nonlinear and a fixed point argument is used in order to prove its existence and uniqueness under a mild condition between the time step $k$ and the mesh step $h,$ e.g., $k = \mathcal{O}(h^{1+\epsilon}),\,0&lt;\epsilon&lt;1.$ Further, for sufficiently regular solution, we derive error estimates in $L^2$ and $H^1$ norm with respect on space and $\ell^\infty$ norm in time for the state and the co-state variable. For the control variable we also derive an $L^2$ estimate for its error with respect to spatial variable and $\ell^\infty$ in time. Finally, we present numerical experiments that validate the the order of convergence of the stabilized fully--discrete scheme via algebraic flux correction method.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Models and Conditional Expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systems may depend on parameters which one may control, or which serve to optimise the system, or are imposed externally, or they could be uncertain. This last case is taken as the "Leitmotiv" for the following. A reduced order model is produced from the full order model by some kind of projection onto a relatively low-dimensional manifold or subspace. The parameter dependent reduction process produces a function of the parameters into the manifold. One now wants to examine the relation between the full and the reduced state for all possible parameter values of interest. Similarly, in the field of machine learning, also a function of the parameter set into the image space of the machine learning model is learned on a training set of samples, typically minimising the mean-square error. This set may be seen as a sample from some probability distribution, and thus the training is an approximate computation of the expectation, giving an approximation to the conditional expectation, a special case of an Bayesian updating where the Bayesian loss function is the mean-square error. This offers the possibility of having a combined look at these methods, and also introducing more general loss functions.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of the Time-Dependent Transmission Rate in Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to improve the modeling, estimation, and prediction of how infectious diseases spread. SEIR-like models have been particularly successful in providing accurate short-term predictions. This study fills a notable literature gap by exploring the following question: Is it possible to incorporate a nonparametric susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) COVID-19 model into the inverse-problem regularization framework when the transmission coefficient varies over time? Our positive response considers varying degrees of disease severity, vaccination, and other time-dependent parameters. In addition, we demonstrate the continuity, differentiability, and injectivity of the operator that link the transmission parameter to the observed infection numbers. By employing Tikhonov-type regularization to the corresponding inverse problem, we establish the existence and stability of regularized solutions. Numerical examples using both synthetic and real data illustrate the model's estimation accuracy and its ability to fit the data effectively.</description>

Abstract: These lecture notes focus on some numerical linear algebra algorithms in scientific computing. We assume that students are familiar with elementary linear algebra concepts such as vector spaces, systems of equations, matrices, norms, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. In the numerical part, we do not pursue Gaussian elimination and other LU factorization algorithms for square systems. Instead, we mainly focus on overdetermined systems, least squares solutions, orthogonal factorizations, and some applications to data analysis and other areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish well-posedness of reflected McKean-Vlasov SDEs and their particle approximations in smooth non-convex domains. We prove convergence of the interacting particle system to the corresponding mean-field limit with the optimal rate of convergence. We motivate this study with applications to sampling and optimization in constrained domains by considering reflected mean-field Langevin SDEs and two reflected consensus-based optimization (CBO) models, respectively. We utilize reflection coupling to study long-time behaviour of reflected mean-field SDEs and also investigate convergence of the reflected CBO models to the global minimum of a constrained optimization problem. We numerically test reflected CBO models on benchmark constrained optimization problems and an inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Analytically Informed Inverse Kinematics Solution at Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near kinematic singularities of a serial manipulator, the inverse kinematics (IK) problem becomes ill-conditioned, which poses computational problems for the numerical solution. Computational methods to tackle this issue are based on various forms of a pseudoinverse (PI) solution to the velocity IK problem. The damped least squares (DLS) method provides a robust solution with controllable convergence rate. However, at singularities, it may not even be possible to solve the IK problem using any PI solution when certain end-effector motions are prescribed. To overcome this problem, an analytically informed inverse kinematics (AI-IK) method is proposed. The key step of the method is an explicit description of the tangent aspect of singular motions (the analytic part) to deduce a perturbation that yields a regular configuration. The latter serves as start configuration for the iterative solution (the numeric part). Numerical results are reported for a 7-DOF Kuka iiwa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sequence is difference algebraic (or D-algebraic) if finitely many shifts of its general term satisfy a polynomial relationship; that is, they are the coordinates of a generic point on an affine hypersurface. The corresponding equations are called algebraic difference equations (ADE). We show that subsequences of D-algebraic sequences, indexed by arithmetic progressions, satisfy ADEs of the same orders as the original sequences. Additionally, we provide algorithms for operations with D-algebraic sequences and discuss the difference-algebraic nature of holonomic and $C^2$-finite sequences.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mu$ be a positive Borel measure on the real line and let $L$ be the linear functional on univariate polynomials of bounded degree, defined as integration with respect to $\mu$. In 2020, Blekherman et al., the characterization of all minimal quadrature rules of $\mu$ in terms of the roots of a bivariate polynomial is given and two determinantal representations of this polynomial are established. In particular, the authors solved the question of the existence of a minimal quadrature rule with one prescribed node, leaving open the extension to more prescribed nodes. In this paper, we solve this problem using moment theory as the main tool.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.21049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling and forecasting the spread of infectious diseases is essential for effective public health decision-making. Traditional epidemiological models rely on expert-defined frameworks to describe complex dynamics, while neural networks, despite their predictive power, often lack interpretability due to their ``black-box" nature. This paper introduces the Finite Expression Method, a symbolic learning framework that leverages reinforcement learning to derive explicit mathematical expressions for epidemiological dynamics. Through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, FEX demonstrates high accuracy in modeling and predicting disease spread, while uncovering explicit relationships among epidemiological variables. These results highlight FEX as a powerful tool for infectious disease modeling, combining interpretability with strong predictive performance to support practical applications in public health.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The finite element method offers attractive methods for the numerical solution of coupled field problems arising in sensors and actuator simulations of various physical domains, like electrodynamics, mechanics, and thermodynamics. With this application perspective and being open, accessible, and fast implementations are possible, openCFS was launched in 2020. It provides an open-source framework for implementing partial differential equations using the finite element method. In particular, the acoustic module is part of active development, including several key methods. These methods include the perfectly-matched layer technique, non-confirming interface formulations, Lagrangian basis function, Legendre basis functions, spectral element formulations, a nodal element type, edge-based element type (aeroacoustic post-processing), absorbing boundary conditions, frequency dependent-material for time-harmonic and time-dependent simulations. Time-dependent simulations, time-harmonic simulations, and eigenvalue simulations are supported. Several variants of acoustic equations are implemented, including the relevant source terms and wave operators for aeroacoustics. The package includes rotating domains and non-conforming interfaces for fan noise simulations. It also contains an API to the Python3 package pyCFS. This paper presents openCFS with a focus on the acoustic module.</description>

      <title>Which constraints of a numerical problem cause ill-conditioning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many numerical problems with input $x$ and output $y$ can be formulated as a system of equations $F(x, y) = 0$ where the goal is to solve for $y$. The condition number measures the change of $y$ for small perturbations to $x$. From this numerical problem, one can derive a (typically underdetermined) relaxation by omitting any number of equations from $F$. We propose a condition number for underdetermined systems that relates the condition number of a numerical problem to those of its relaxations, thereby detecting the ill-conditioned constraints. We illustrate the use of our technique by computing the condition of two problems that do not have a finite condition number in the classic sense: two-factor matrix decompositions and Tucker decompositions.</description>

      <title>A hypocoercivity-exploiting stabilised finite element method for Kolmogorov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new stabilised finite element method for the classical Kolmogorov equation. The latter serves as a basic model problem for large classes of kinetic-type equations and, crucially, is characterised by degenerate diffusion. The stabilisation is constructed so that the resulting method admits a \emph{numerical hypocoercivity} property, analogous to the corresponding property of the PDE problem. More specifically, the stabilisation is constructed so that spectral gap is possible in the resulting ``stronger-than-energy'' stabilisation norm, despite the degenerate nature of the diffusion in Kolmogorov, thereby the method has a provably robust behaviour as the ``time'' variable goes to infinity. We consider both a spatially discrete version of the stabilised finite element method and a fully discrete version, with the time discretisation realised by discontinuous Galerkin timestepping. Both stability and a priori error bounds are proven in all cases. Numerical experiments verify the theoretical findings.</description>

Abstract: Biological cells can release compounds into their direct environment, generally inhomogeneously over their cell membrane, after which the compounds spread by diffusion. In mathematical modelling and simulation of a collective of such cells, it is theoretically and numerically advantageous to replace spatial extended cells with point sources, in particular when cell numbers are large, but still so small that a continuum density description cannot be justified, or when cells are moving. We show that inhomogeneous flux density over the cell boundary may be realized in a point source approach, thus maintaining computational efficiency, by utilizing multiple, clustered point sources (and sinks). In this report, we limit ourselves to a sinusoidal function as flux density in the spatial exclusion model, and we show how to determine the amplitudes of the Dirac delta points in the point source model, such that the deviation between the point source model and the spatial exclusion model is small.</description>

      <title>An adaptive mesh refinement strategy to ensure quasi-optimality of finite element methods for self-adjoint Helmholtz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06266v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the quasi-optimality of the Galerkin finite element method for the Helmholtz equation is dependent on the mesh size and the wave-number. In the literature, different criteria have been proposed to ensure uniform quasi-optimality of the discretisation. In the present work, we study the uniform quasi-optimality of $H^1$ conforming and non-conforming Crouzeix-Raviart discretisation of the self-adjoint Helmholtz problem. In particular, we propose an adaptive scheme, coupled with a residual-based indicator, for generating guaranteed quasi-optimal meshes with minimal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SQP Method for Hyperbolic PDE-Constrained Optimization in Acoustic Full Waveform Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the SQP method applied to a hyperbolic PDE-constrained optimization problem is considered. The model arises from the acoustic full waveform inversion in the time domain. The analysis is mainly challenging due to the involved hyperbolicity and second-order bilinear structure. This notorious character leads to an undesired effect of loss of regularity in the SQP method, calling for a substantial extension of developed parabolic techniques. We propose and analyze a novel strategy for the well-posedness and convergence analysis based on the use of a smooth-in-time initial condition, a tailored self-mapping operator, and a two-step estimation process along with Stampacchia's method for second-order wave equations. Our final theoretical result is the R-superlinear convergence of the SQP method.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference least square methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10758v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm to approximate the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network. The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based method to minimize the least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution. The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical studies on various canonical HJ equations across different dimensions, showcasing its potential and versatility.</description>

      <title>A good lattice point sampling neural network for solving partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17039v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When dealing with a large number of points, the usually uniform sampling approach for approximating integrals using the Monte Carlo method becomes inefficient. In this work, we leverage the good lattice point sets from number-theoretic methods for sampling and develop a deep learning framework that integrates the good lattice point sets with Physics-Informed Neural Networks. This framework is designed to address low-regularity and high-dimensional partial differential equations. Furthermore, rigorous mathematical proofs are provided to validate the error bound of our method is less than that of uniform sampling methods. We employ numerical experiments involving the Poisson equation with low regularity, the two-dimensional inverse Helmholtz equation, and high-dimensional linear and nonlinear problems to illustrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.% from a numerical perspective.</description>

      <title>An explicit spectral decomposition of the ADRT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The approximate discrete Radon transform (ADRT) is a hierarchical multiscale approximation of the Radon transform. In this paper, we factor the ADRT into a product of linear transforms that resemble convolutions, and derive an explicit spectral decomposition of each factor. We further show that this implies - for data lying in the range of the ADRT - that the transform of an $N \times N$ image can be formally inverted with complexity $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log^2 N)$. We numerically test the accuracy of the inverse on images of moderate sizes and find that it is competitive with existing iterative algorithms in this special regime.</description>

      <title>Deep Kalman Filters Can Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep Kalman filters (DKFs) are a class of neural network models that generate Gaussian probability measures from sequential data. Though DKFs are inspired by the Kalman filter, they lack concrete theoretical ties to the stochastic filtering problem, thus limiting their applicability to areas where traditional model-based filters have been used, e.g.\ model calibration for bond and option prices in mathematical finance. We address this issue in the mathematical foundations of deep learning by exhibiting a class of continuous-time DKFs which can approximately implement the conditional law of a broad class of non-Markovian and conditionally Gaussian signal processes given noisy continuous-times measurements. Our approximation results hold uniformly over sufficiently regular compact subsets of paths, where the approximation error is quantified by the worst-case 2-Wasserstein distance computed uniformly over the given compact set of paths.</description>

      <title>Computation and Control of Unstable Steady States for Mean Field Multiagent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interacting particle systems driven by noise, modeling phenomena such as opinion dynamics. We are interested in systems that exhibit phase transitions i.e. non-uniqueness of stationary states for the corresponding McKean-Vlasov PDE, in the mean field limit. We develop an efficient numerical scheme for identifying all steady states (both stable and unstable) of the mean field McKean-Vlasov PDE, based on a spectral Galerkin approximation combined with a deflated Newton's method to handle the multiplicity of solutions. Having found all possible equilibra, we formulate an optimal control strategy for steering the dynamics towards a chosen unstable steady state. The control is computed using iterated open-loop solvers in a receding horizon fashion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed steady state computation and stabilization methodology on several examples, including the noisy Hegselmann-Krause model for opinion dynamics and the Haken-Kelso-Bunz model from biophysics. The numerical experiments validate the ability of the approach to capture the rich self-organization landscape of these systems and to stabilize unstable configurations of interest. The proposed computational framework opens up new possibilities for understanding and controlling the collective behavior of noise-driven interacting particle systems, with potential applications in various fields such as social dynamics, biological synchronization, and collective behavior in physical and social systems.</description>
