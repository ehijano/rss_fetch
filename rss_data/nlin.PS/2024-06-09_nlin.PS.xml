      <title>Hamiltonian formulation and aspects of integrability of generalised hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalised Hydrodynamics (GHD) describes the large-scale inhomogeneous dynamics of integrable (or close to integrable) systems in one dimension of space, based on a central equation for the fluid density or quasi-particle density: the GHD equation. We consider a new, general form of the GHD equation: we allow for spatially extended interaction kernels, generalising previous constructions. We show that the GHD equation, in our general form and hence also in its conventional form, is Hamiltonian. This holds also including force terms representing inhomogeneous external potentials coupled to conserved densities. To this end, we introduce a new Poisson bracket on functionals of the fluid density, which is seen as our dynamical field variable. The total energy is the Hamiltonian whose flow under this Poisson bracket generates the GHD equation. The fluid density depends on two (real and spectral) variables so the GHD equation can be seen as a $2+1$-dimensional classical field theory. We further show the system admits an infinite set of conserved quantities that are in involution for our Poisson bracket, hinting at integrability of this field theory.</description>

      <title>Identification of moment equations via data-driven approaches in nonlinear schrodinger models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moment quantities associated with the nonlinear Schrodinger equation offer important insights towards the evolution dynamics of such dispersive wave partial differential equation (PDE) models. The effective dynamics of the moment quantities is amenable to both analytical and numerical treatments. In this paper we present a data-driven approach associated with the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to numerically capture the evolution behaviors of such moment quantities. Our method is applied first to some well-known closed systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) which describe the evolution dynamics of relevant moment quantities. Our examples are, progressively, of increasing complexity and our findings explore different choices within the SINDy library. We also consider the potential discovery of coordinate transformations that lead to moment system closure. Finally, we extend considerations to settings where a closed analytical form of the moment dynamics is not available.</description>

      <title>Modulation instability in dispersive parity-broken systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the interplay between dispersive parity breaking and non-linearity in two contrasting continuous dynamical systems that exhibit Modulation Instability (MI). We begin by examining deep water odd surface gravity waves and derive the non-linear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) for the modulated envelope dynamics using the method of multiple scales. The parity breaking in the odd gravity waves results in distinct NLSEs for the right and the left mover, leading to chirality-dependent stability properties for the envelope dynamics. Moreover, the resonant interaction of gravity waves and odd viscosity-induced capillary dynamics creates a window of wave numbers in one of the chiral sectors where the envelope propagation remains stable. Following the odd gravity results, we design a one-dimensional non-reciprocal PT-symmetric dielectric model that exhibits parity-breaking effects that are analogous to the odd viscosity term in 2D hydrodynamics. With cubic non-linearity in the polarization dynamics, we derive the corresponding NLSE. Once again, we observe that parity breaking stabilizes the modulated envelope dynamics in the lower polariton bands. We then compare the similarities and differences between this case and that of odd gravity waves.</description>

      <title>Transition to synchronization in adaptive Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model with higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of transition to synchronization in Sakaguchi-Kuramoto model in the presence of higher-order interactions and global order parameter adaptation. The investigation is done by performing extensive numerical simulations and low dimensional modeling of the system. Numerical simulations of the full system show both continuous (second order) as well as discontinuous transitions. The discontinuous transitions can either be associated with explosive (first order) or with tiered synchronization states depending on the choice of parameters. To develop an in depth understanding of the transition scenario in the parameter space we derive a reduced order model (ROM) using the Ott-Antonsen ansatz, the results of which closely matches with that of the numerical simulations of the full system. The simplicity and analytical accessibility of the ROM helps to conveniently unfold the transition scenario in the system having complex dependence on the parameters. Simultaneous analysis of the full system and the ROM clearly identifies the regions of the parameter space exhibiting different types of transitions. It is observed that the second order continuous transition is connected with a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation (PB) of the ROM. On the other hand, the discontinuous teired transition is associated with multiple saddle-node (SN) bifurcations along with a supercritical PB and the first order explosive transition involves a subcritical PB alongside a SN bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Unified view of scalar and vector dark matter solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of solitons -- stable, long-lived, and localized field configurations -- is a generic prediction for ultralight dark matter. These solitons, known by various names such as boson stars, axion stars, oscillons, and Q-balls depending on the context, are typically treated as distinct entities in the literature. This study aims to provide a unified perspective on these solitonic objects for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter, considering self-interactions and nonminimal gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that these solitons share universal nonrelativistic properties, such as conserved charges, mass-radius relations, stability and profiles. Without accounting for alternative interactions or relativistic effects, distinguishing between real and complex scalar dark matter is challenging. However, self-interactions differentiate real and complex vector dark matter due to their different dependencies on the macroscopic spin density of dark matter waves. Furthermore, gradient-dependent nonminimal gravitational interactions impose an upper bound on soliton amplitudes, influencing their mass distribution and phenomenology in the present-day universe.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Impact of Organic Molecules and Phosphate Ions on Biosilica Pattern Formation in Diatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid and complex patterning of biosilica in diatom frustules is of great interest in nanotechnology, although it remains incompletely understood. Specific organic molecules, including long-chain polyamines, silaffins, and silacidins are essential in this process. The molecular structure of the synthesized polyamines significantly affects the quantity, size, and shape of silica precipitates. Experimental findings show that silica precipitation occurs at specific phosphate ion concentrations. We focus on the hypothesis that pattern formation in diatom valve structures is driven by phase separation of species-specific organic molecules. The resulting organic structures serve as templates for silica precipitation. We investigate the role of phosphate ions in self-assembly of organic molecules and analyze how the reaction between them affects the morphology of the organic template. Using mathematical and computational techniques, we gain an understanding of the range of patterns that can arise in a phase-separating system. By varying the degree of dissociation and the initial concentrations of reacting components we demonstrate that the resulting geometric features are highly dependent on these factors. This approach provides insights into the parameters controlling patterning. Additionally, we consider the effects of prepatterns, mimicking silica ribs that preexist the pores, on the final patterns.</description>
