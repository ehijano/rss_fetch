      <title>Non-intrusive Data-driven ADI-based Low-rank Balanced Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, a non-intrusive data-driven formulation of ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation is provided. The proposed algorithm only requires transfer function samples at the mirror images of ADI shifts. If some shifts are used in both approximating the controllability Gramian and the observability Gramian, then samples of the transfer function's derivative at these shifts are also needed to enforce Hermite interpolation in the Loewner framework. It is noted that ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation can be viewed as a two-step process. The first step involves constructing an interpolant of the original model at the mirror images of the ADI shifts, which can be done non-intrusively within the Loewner framework. The second step involves reducing this interpolant using low-rank factors of Gramians associated with the interpolation data through the balanced square-root algorithm. This second step does not require any system information, making the overall process non-intrusive with the only required information being samples of the transfer function and/or its derivative at the mirror images of ADI shifts. Furthermore, it is shown that when the order of the reduced model in ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation is selected to match the numerical rank of the low-rank factors of the Gramians, it effectively reduces to standard interpolation at the mirror images of the ADI shift. An illustrative example is provided to explain the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Formally Verified Neural Lyapunov Function for Incremental Input-to-State Stability of Unknown Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an approach to synthesize a Lyapunov-like function to ensure incrementally input-to-state stability ($\delta$-ISS) property for an unknown discrete-time system. To deal with challenges posed by unknown system dynamics, we parameterize the Lyapunov-like function as a neural network, which we train using the data samples collected from the unknown system along with appropriately designed loss functions. We propose a validity condition to test the obtained function and incorporate it into the training framework to ensure provable correctness at the end of the training. Finally, the usefulness of the proposed technique is proved using two case studies: a scalar non-linear dynamical system and a permanent magnet DC motor.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Integrated Dispatching and Idle Fleet Steering with Deep Reinforcement Learning for A Meal Delivery Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve high service quality and profitability, meal delivery platforms like Uber Eats and Grubhub must strategically operate their fleets to ensure timely deliveries for current orders while mitigating the consequential impacts of suboptimal decisions that leads to courier understaffing in the future. This study set out to solve the real-time order dispatching and idle courier steering problems for a meal delivery platform by proposing a reinforcement learning (RL)-based strategic dual-control framework. To address the inherent sequential nature of these problems, we model both order dispatching and courier steering as Markov Decision Processes. Trained via a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, we obtain strategic policies by leveraging the explicitly predicted demands as part of the inputs. In our dual-control framework, the dispatching and steering policies are iteratively trained in an integrated manner. These forward-looking policies can be executed in real-time and provide decisions while jointly considering the impacts on local and network levels. To enhance dispatching fairness, we propose convolutional deep Q networks to construct fair courier embeddings. To simultaneously rebalance the supply and demand within the service network, we propose to utilize mean-field approximated supply-demand knowledge to reallocate idle couriers at the local level. Utilizing the policies generated by the RL-based strategic dual-control framework, we find the delivery efficiency and fairness of workload distribution among couriers have been improved, and under-supplied conditions have been alleviated within the service network. Our study sheds light on designing an RL-based framework to enable forward-looking real-time operations for meal delivery platforms and other on-demand services.</description>

      <title>Enhanced sampled-data model predictive control via nonlinear lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework that incorporates a lifting technique to enhance control performance for nonlinear systems. While the lifting technique has been widely employed in linear systems to capture intersample behaviour, their application to nonlinear systems remains unexplored. We address this gap by formulating an NMPC scheme that combines fast-sample fast-hold (FSFH) approximations and numerical methods to approximate system dynamics and cost functions. The proposed approach is validated through two case studies: the Van der Pol oscillator and the inverted pendulum on a cart. Simulation results demonstrate that the lifted NMPC outperforms conventional NMPC in terms of reduced settling time and improved control accuracy. These findings underscore the potential of the lifting-based NMPC for efficient control of nonlinear systems, offering a practical solution for real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Koopman-Based Model Predictive Control of Functional Electrical Stimulation for Ankle Dorsiflexion and Plantarflexion Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) can be an effective tool to augment paretic muscle function and restore normal ankle function. Our approach incorporates a real-time, data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, built upon a Koopman operator theory (KOT) framework. This framework adeptly captures the complex nonlinear dynamics of ankle motion in a linearized form, enabling application of linear control approaches for highly nonlinear FES-actuated dynamics. Utilizing inertial measurement units (IMUs), our method accurately predicts the FES-induced ankle movements, while accounting for nonlinear muscle actuation dynamics, including the muscle activation for both plantarflexors, and dorsiflexors (Tibialis Anterior (TA)). The linear prediction model derived through KOT allowed us to formulate the MPC problem with linear state space dynamics, enhancing the real-time feasibility, precision and adaptability of the FES driven control. The effectiveness and applicability of our approach have been demonstrated through comprehensive simulations and experimental trials, including three participants with no disability and a participant with Multiple Sclerosis. Our findings highlight the potential of a KOT-based MPC approach for FES based gait assistance that offers effective and personalized assistance for individuals with gait impairment conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Safe Trusted Autonomy for Responsible Space (STARS) program aims to advance autonomy technologies for space by leveraging machine learning technologies while mitigating barriers to trust, such as uncertainty, opaqueness, brittleness, and inflexibility. This paper presents the achievements and lessons learned from the STARS program in integrating reinforcement learning-based multi-satellite control, run time assurance approaches, and flexible human-autonomy teaming interfaces, into a new integrated testing environment for collaborative autonomous satellite systems. The primary results describe analysis of the reinforcement learning multi-satellite control and run time assurance algorithms. These algorithms are integrated into a prototype human-autonomy interface using best practices from human-autonomy trust literature, however detailed analysis of the effectiveness is left to future work. References are provided with additional detailed results of individual experiments.</description>

      <title>On the Interaction in Transient Stability of Two-Inverter Power Systems containing GFL inverter Using Manifold Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many renewable energy resources are integrated into power systems via grid-following (GFL) inverters which rely on a phase-locked loop (PLL) for grid synchronization. During severe grid faults, GFL inverters are vulnerable to transient instability, often leading to disconnection from the grid. This paper aims to elucidate the interaction mechanisms and define the stability boundaries of systems of two inverters, including GFL, grid-forming (GFM), or grid-supporting (GSP) inverters. First, the generalized large-signal expression for the two-inverter system under various inverter combinations is derived, revealing that no energy function exists for systems containing GFL inverters. This implies that the traditional direct method cannot be applied to such systems. To overcome these challenges, a manifold method is employed to precisely determine the domain of attraction (DOA) of the system, and the transient stability margin is assessed by a new metric termed the critical clearing radius (CCR). A case study of the two-inverter system under various inverter combinations is conducted to explore large-signal interactions across different scenarios. Manifold analysis and simulation results reveal that GSP inverters using PLL for grid synchronization exhibit behavior similar to GFM inverters when the droop coefficients in the terminal voltage control loop (TVC) are sufficiently large. Compared to GFL inverters, GSP inverters incorporating a TVC significantly enhances the transient stability of other inverters. In the STATCOM case, the optimal placement of the STATCOM, realized by GSP or GFM inverters, is identified to be at the midpoint of a transmission line. All findings in this paper are validated through electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations</description>

      <title>Resiliency metrics quantifying emergency response in a distribution system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric distribution system is a cornerstone of modern life, playing a critical role in the daily activities and well-being of individuals. As the world transitions toward a decarbonized future, where even mobility relies on electricity, ensuring the resilience of the grid becomes paramount. This paper introduces novel resilience metrics designed to equip utilities and stakeholders with actionable tools to assess performance during storm events. The metrics focus on emergency storm response and the resources required to improve customer service. The practical calculation of the metrics from historical utility data is demonstrated for multiple storm events. Additionally, the metrics' improvement with added crews is estimated by "rerunning history" with faster restoration. By applying this resilience framework, utilities can enhance their restoration strategies and unlock potential cost savings, benefiting both providers and customers in an era of heightened energy dependency.</description>

      <title>Molecular Communication-Inspired Particle Collector-Transmitter (PaCoT) for Heavy Metal Removal from Human Circulatory System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel molecular communication (MC)-inspired nanomachine, PArticle COllector-Transmitter (PaCoT), to remove toxic heavy metals from the human circulatory system. PaCoT collects these toxic metals and transmits them to release nodes, such as lymph capillaries, before they reach critical organs. The design incorporates key physical parameters and operates through particle reception and release mechanisms. In the reception process, described as ligand-receptor binding reactions, modeled as a continuous-time Markov process (CTMP), PaCoT uses metallothionein proteins as receptors and heavy metals (e.g., Zn, Pb, Cd) as ligands. We assume that the toxicity condition (toxic (bit-1), non-toxic (bit-0)) is encoded into the concentration of heavy metal molecules. Thus, we consider that heavy metal concentration within the MC channel (e.g., human circulatory system) employs binary concentration shift keying (binary CSK). The concentration ratio of specific heavy metals is estimated to infer toxicity, i.e., a high ratio indicates toxicity and a low ratio suggests non-toxicity. Toxicity detection is achieved by monitoring the receptor bound duration in the presence of interferers and various types of heavy metals. After detecting and collecting toxic heavy metals, PaCoT securely retains them in a liquid medium (e.g., water) until release, employing two mechanisms: (1) a single-disc viscous micropump to regulate flow rate, and (2) Brownian motion to facilitate diffusion. PaCoT's performance is evaluated through MATLAB simulations, focusing on bit error probability (BEP) of the toxicity detection method, release time of molecules from PaCoT and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Weather-Driven Priority Charging for Battery Storage Systems in Hybrid Renewable Energy Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy into the power grid is often hindered by its fragmented infrastructure, leading to inefficient utilization due to the variability of energy production and its reliance on weather conditions. Battery storage systems, while essential for stabilizing energy supply, face challenges like sub-optimal energy distribution, accelerating battery degradation, and reducing operational efficiency. This paper presents a novel solution to these challenges by developing a large-scale, interconnected renewable energy network that optimizes energy storage and distribution. The proposed system includes strategically placed battery storage facilities that stabilize energy production by compensating for fluctuations in renewable output. A priority charging algorithm, informed by real-time weather forecasting and load monitoring, ensures that the most suitable battery systems are charged under varying conditions. Within each storage facility, a secondary priority charging algorithm minimizes battery degradation by ranking batteries based on critical parameters such as state of health (SoH) and state of charge (SoC) and deciding which to charge. This comprehensive approach enhances the efficiency and longevity of battery storage systems, offering a more reliable and resilient renewable energy infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Experiments for Accurate Battery Circuit Parameters Estimation: Reduction and Adjustment of Frequency Set Used in Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a suitable experimental design of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to reduce the number of frequency points while not significantly affecting the uncertainties of the estimated cell's equivalent circuit model (ECM) parameters. It is based on an E-optimal experimental design that aims to maximize the information about the ECM parameters collected by EIS measurements and, at the same time, minimize the overall uncertainty. In a numerical experiment, we first analyze to which extent reducing the number of measurement points at low frequencies affects the uncertainty of the estimated parameters. Secondly, we show that applying the frequency adjustments can lead to the same or even improved global uncertainty of ECM parameter estimates as with a higher number of measurements. This is numerically verified through a case study using the ECM parameters of a commercial battery cell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Best Response Convergence for Zero-sum Stochastic Dynamic Games with Partial and Asymmetric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze best response dynamics for finding a Nash equilibrium of an infinite horizon zero-sum stochastic linear quadratic dynamic game (LQDG) with partial and asymmetric information. We derive explicit expressions for each player's best response within the class of pure linear dynamic output feedback control strategies where the internal state dimension of each control strategy is an integer multiple of the system state dimension. With each best response, the players form increasingly higher-order belief states, leading to infinite-dimensional internal states. However, we observe in extensive numerical experiments that the game's value converges after just a few iterations, suggesting that strategies associated with increasingly higher-order belief states eventually provide no benefit. To help explain this convergence, our numerical analysis reveals rapid decay of the controllability and observability Gramian eigenvalues and Hankel singular values in higher-order belief dynamics, indicating that the higher-order belief dynamics become increasingly difficult for both players to control and observe. Consequently, the higher-order belief dynamics can be closely approximated by low-order belief dynamics with bounded error, and thus feedback strategies with limited internal state dimension can closely approximate a Nash equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Switched Optimal Control with Dwell Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an embedding-based approach for solving switched optimal control problems (SOCPs) with dwell time constraints. At first, an embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) is defined by replacing the discrete switching signal with a continuous embedded variable that can take intermediate values between the discrete modes. While embedding enables solutions of SOCPs via conventional techniques, optimal solutions of EOCPs often involve nonexistent modes and thus may not be feasible for the SOCP. In the modified EOCP (MEOCP), a concave function is added to the cost function to enforce a bang-bang solution in the embedded variable, which results in feasible solutions for the SOCP. However, the MEOCP cannot guarantee the satisfaction of dwell-time constraints.
  In this paper, a MEOCP is combined with a filter layer to remove switching times that violate the dwell time constraint. Insertion gradients are used to minimize the effect of the filter on the optimal cost.</description>

Abstract: Low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SatCom) has emerged as a promising technology for improving wireless connectivity in global areas. Cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO), an architecture recently proposed for next-generation networks, has yet to be fully explored for LEO satellites. In this paper, we investigate the downlink performance of a CF-mMIMO LEO SatCom network, where many satellite access points (SAPs) simultaneously serve the corresponding ground user terminals (UTs). Using tools from stochastic geometry, we model the locations of SAPs and UTs on surfaces of concentric spheres using Poisson point processes (PPPs) and present expressions based on linear minimum-mean-square-error (LMMSE) channel estimation and conjugate beamforming. Then, we derive the coverage probabilities in both fading and non-fading scenarios, with significant system parameters such as the Nakagami fading parameter, number of UTs, number of SAPs, orbital altitude, and service range brought by the dome angle. Finally, the analytical model is verified by extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Simulation results show that stronger line-of-sight (LoS) effects and a more comprehensive service range of the UT bring higher coverage probability despite existing multi-user interference. Moreover, we found that there exist optimal numbers of UTs for different orbital altitudes and dome angles, which provides valuable system design insights.</description>

      <title>Fully Decentralized Computation Offloading in Priority-Driven Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel framework for fully decentralized offloading policy design in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems. The system comprises $N$ power-constrained user equipments (UEs) assisted by an edge server (ES) to process incoming tasks. Tasks are labeled with urgency flags, and in this paper, we classify them under three urgency levels, namely, high, moderate, and low urgency. We formulate the problem of designing computation decisions for the UEs within a large population noncooperative game framework, where each UE selfishly decides on how to split task execution between its local onboard processor and the ES. We employ the weighted average age of information (AoI) metric to quantify information freshness at the UEs. Increased onboard processing consumes more local power, while increased offloading may potentially incur a higher average AoI due to other UEs' packets being offloaded to the same ES. Thus, we use the mean-field game (MFG) formulation to compute approximate decentralized Nash equilibrium offloading and local computation policies for the UEs to balance between the information freshness and local power consumption. Finally, we provide a projected gradient descent-based algorithm to numerically assess the merits of our approach.</description>

      <title>Path Planning for Multi-Copter UAV Formation Employing a Generalized Particle Swarm Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper investigates the problem of path planning techniques for multi-copter uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAV) cooperation in a formation shape to examine surrounding surfaces. We first describe the problem as a joint objective cost for planning a path of the formation centroid working in a complicated space. The path planning algorithm, named the generalized particle swarm optimization algorithm, is then presented to construct an optimal, flyable path while avoiding obstacles and ensuring the flying mission requirements. A path-development scheme is then incorporated to generate a relevant path for each drone to maintain its position in the formation configuration. Simulation, comparison, and experiments have been conducted to verify the proposed approach. Results show the feasibility of the proposed path-planning algorithm with GEPSO.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projection-based regularization for efficient model augmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep-learning-based nonlinear system identification has shown the ability to produce reliable and highly accurate models in practice. However, these black-box models lack physical interpretability, and often a considerable part of the learning effort is spent on capturing already expected/known behavior due to first-principles-based understanding of some aspects of the system. A potential solution is to integrate prior physical knowledge directly into the model structure, combining the strengths of physics-based modeling and deep-learning-based identification. The most common approach is to use an additive model augmentation structure, where the physics-based and the machine-learning (ML) components are connected in parallel. However, such models are overparametrized, training them is challenging, potentially causing the physics-based part to lose interpretability. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes an orthogonal projection-based regularization technique to enhance parameter learning, convergence, and even model accuracy in learning-based augmentation of nonlinear baseline models.</description>

      <title>Coverage and Spectral Efficiency of NOMA-Enabled LEO Satellite Networks with Ordering Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates an analytical model for low-earth orbit (LEO) multi-satellite downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The satellites transmit data to multiple NOMA user terminals (UTs), each employing successive interference cancellation (SIC) for decoding. Two ordering schemes are adopted for NOMA-enabled LEO satellite networks, i.e., mean signal power (MSP)-based ordering and instantaneous-signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (ISINR)-based ordering. For each ordering scheme, we derive the coverage probabilities of UTs under different channel conditions. Moreover, we discuss how coverage is influenced by SIC, main-lobe gain, and tradeoffs between the number of satellites and their altitudes. Additionally, two user fairness-based power allocation (PA) schemes are considered, and PA coefficients with the optimal number of UTs that maximize their sum spectral efficiency (SE) are studied. Simulation results show that there exists a maximum signal-to-inter-satellite-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) threshold for each PA scheme that ensures the operation of NOMA in LEO satellite networks, and the benefit of NOMA only exists when the target SINR is below a certain threshold. Compared with orthogonal multiple access (OMA), NOMA increases UTs' sum SE by as much as 35\%. Furthermore, for most SINR thresholds, the sum SE increases with the number of UTs to the highest value, whilst the maximum sum SE is obtained when there are two UTs.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Impact of Observation Space Design Choices On Training Reinforcement Learning Solutions for Spacecraft Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn autonomous control for spacecraft operations has shown great success. However, a recent study showed their performance could be improved by changing the action space, i.e. control outputs, used in the learning environment. This has opened the door for finding more improvements through further changes to the environment. The work in this paper focuses on how changes to the environment's observation space can impact the training and performance of RL agents learning the spacecraft inspection task. The studies are split into two groups. The first looks at the impact of sensors that were designed to help agents learn the task. The second looks at the impact of reference frames, reorienting the agent to see the world from a different perspective. The results show the sensors are not necessary, but most of them help agents learn more optimal behavior, and that the reference frame does not have a large impact, but is best kept consistent.</description>

      <title>The improvement in transmission resilience metrics from reduced outages or faster restoration can be calculated by rerunning historical outage data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission utilities routinely collect detailed outage data, including resilience events in which outages bunch up due to weather. The resilience events and their resilience metrics can readily be extracted from this historical outage data. Improvements such as grid hardening or investments in restoration lead to reduced outages or faster restoration. We show how to rerun this history with the effects of the reduced outages or faster restoration included to find the resulting improvement in resilience metrics, thus quantifying the benefits of these investments. This is demonstrated with case studies for specific events (a derecho and a hurricane), and all large events or large thunderstorms in the Midwest USA. Instead of predicting future extreme events with models, which is very challenging, the historical rerun readily quantifies the benefits that a resilience investment would have had if it had been made in the past. The historical rerun is particularly vivid in making the case for resilience investments to stakeholders because it quantifies the benefits for events actually experienced by those stakeholders, rather than for future events predicted with uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Towards Developing Socially Compliant Automated Vehicles: State of the Art, Experts Expectations, and A Conceptual Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated Vehicles (AVs) hold promise for revolutionizing transportation by improving road safety, traffic efficiency, and overall mobility. Despite the steady advancement in high-level AVs in recent years, the transition to full automation entails a period of mixed traffic, where AVs of varying automation levels coexist with human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Making AVs socially compliant and understood by human drivers is expected to improve the safety and efficiency of mixed traffic. Thus, ensuring AVs compatibility with HDVs and social acceptance is crucial for their successful and seamless integration into mixed traffic. However, research in this critical area of developing Socially Compliant AVs (SCAVs) remains sparse. This study carries out the first comprehensive scoping review to assess the current state of the art in developing SCAVs, identifying key concepts, methodological approaches, and research gaps. An expert interview was also conducted to identify critical research gaps and expectations towards SCAVs. Based on the scoping review and expert interview input, a conceptual framework is proposed for the development of SCAVs. The conceptual framework is evaluated using an online survey targeting researchers, technicians, policymakers, and other relevant professionals worldwide. The survey results provide valuable validation and insights, affirming the significance of the proposed conceptual framework in tackling the challenges of integrating AVs into mixed-traffic environments. Additionally, future research perspectives and suggestions are discussed, contributing to the research and development agenda of SCAVs.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) Based Autonomous Driving Function Development and Evaluation Methodology for Vulnerable Road User Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for developing and evaluating autonomous driving functions, such as model-in-the-loop (MIL) and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations, heavily depend on the accuracy of simulated vehicle models and human factors, especially for vulnerable road user safety systems. Continuation of development during public road deployment forces other road users including vulnerable ones to involuntarily participate in the development process, leading to safety risks, inefficiencies, and a decline in public trust. To address these deficiencies, the Vehicle-in-Virtual-Environment (VVE) method was proposed as a safer, more efficient, and cost-effective solution for developing and testing connected and autonomous driving technologies by operating the real vehicle and multiple other actors like vulnerable road users in different test areas while being immersed within the same highly realistic virtual environment. This VVE approach synchronizes real-world vehicle and vulnerable road user motion within the same virtual scenario, enabling the safe and realistic testing of various traffic situations in a safe and repeatable manner. In this paper, we propose a new testing pipeline that sequentially integrates MIL, HIL, and VVE methods to comprehensively develop and evaluate autonomous driving functions. The effectiveness of this testing pipeline will be demonstrated using an autonomous driving path-tracking algorithm with local deep reinforcement learning modification for vulnerable road user collision avoidance.</description>

      <title>Development of an Advisory System for Parking of a Car and Trailer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trailer parking is a challenging task due to the unstable nature of the vehicle-trailer system in reverse motion and the unintuitive steering actions required at the vehicle to accomplish the parking maneuver. This paper presents a strategy to tackle this kind of maneuver with an advisory graphic aid to help the human driver with the task of manually backing up the vehicle-trailer system. A kinematic vehicle-trailer model is derived to describe the low-speed motion of the vehicle-trailer system, and its inverse kinematics is established by generating an equivalent virtual trailer axle steering command. The advisory system graphics is generated based on the inverse kinematics and displays the expected trailer orientation given the current vehicle steer angle and configuration (hitch angle). Simulation study and animation are set up to test the efficacy of the approach, where the user can select both vehicle speed and vehicle steering angle freely, which allows the user to stop the vehicle-trailer system and experiment with different steering inputs to see their effect on the predicted trailer motion before proceeding with the best one according to the advisory graphics, hence creating a series of piecewise continuous control actions similar to how manual trailer reverse parking is usually carried out. The advisory graphics proves to provide the driver with an intuitive understanding of the trailer motion at any given configuration (hitch angle).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a gradient-based meta-learning framework for rapid adaptation of neural state-space models (NSSMs) for black-box system identification. When applicable, we also incorporate domain-specific physical constraints to improve the accuracy of the NSSM. The major benefit of our approach is that instead of relying solely on data from a single target system, our framework utilizes data from a diverse set of source systems, enabling learning from limited target data, as well as with few online training iterations. Through benchmark examples, we demonstrate the potential of our approach, study the effect of fine-tuning subnetworks rather than full fine-tuning, and report real-world case studies to illustrate the practical application and generalizability of the approach to practical problems with physical-constraints. Specifically, we show that the meta-learned models result in improved downstream performance in model-based state estimation in indoor localization and energy systems.</description>

      <title>Empowering Aggregators with Practical Data-Driven Tools: Harnessing Aggregated and Disaggregated Flexibility for Demand Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10726v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the interaction between aggregators and building occupants in activating flexibility through Demand Response (DR) programs, with a focus on reinforcing the resilience of the energy system considering the uncertainties presented by Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Firstly, it introduces a methodology of optimizing aggregated flexibility provision strategies in environments with limited data, utilizing Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and clustering techniques to identify building occupants' activity patterns. Secondly, the study assesses the disaggregated flexibility provision of Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems during DR events, employing machine learning and optimization techniques for precise, device-level analysis. The first approach offers a non-intrusive pathway for aggregators to provide flexibility services in environments of a single smart meter for the whole building's consumption, while the second approach maximizes the amount of flexibility in the case of dedicated metering devices to the HVAC systems by carefully considering building occupants' thermal comfort profiles. Through the application of data-driven techniques and encompassing case studies from both industrial and residential buildings, this paper not only unveils pivotal opportunities for aggregators in the balancing and emerging flexibility markets but also successfully develops and demonstrates end-to-end practical tools for aggregators.</description>

      <title>Remaining Discharge Energy Prediction for Lithium-Ion Batteries Over Broad Current Ranges: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14767v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries have found their way into myriad sectors of industry to drive electrification, decarbonization, and sustainability. A crucial aspect in ensuring their safe and optimal performance is monitoring their energy levels. In this paper, we present the first study on predicting the remaining energy of a battery cell undergoing discharge over wide current ranges from low to high C-rates. The complexity of the challenge arises from the cell's C-rate-dependent energy availability as well as its intricate electro-thermal dynamics especially at high C-rates. To address this, we introduce a new definition of remaining discharge energy and then undertake a systematic effort in harnessing the power of machine learning to enable its prediction. Our effort includes two parts in cascade. First, we develop an accurate dynamic model based on integration of physics with machine learning to capture a battery's voltage and temperature behaviors. Second, based on the model, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the remaining discharge energy under arbitrary C-rates and pre-specified cut-off limits in voltage and temperature. The experimental validation shows that the proposed approach can predict the remaining discharge energy with a relative error of less than 3% when the current varies between 0~8 C for an NCA cell and 0~15 C for an LFP cell. The approach, by design, is amenable to training and computation.</description>

      <title>Log-Scale Quantization in Distributed First-Order Methods: Gradient-based Learning from Distributed Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00621v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized strategies are of interest for learning from large-scale data over networks. This paper studies learning over a network of geographically distributed nodes/agents subject to quantization. Each node possesses a private local cost function, collectively contributing to a global cost function, which the considered methodology aims to minimize. In contrast to many existing papers, the information exchange among nodes is log-quantized to address limited network-bandwidth in practical situations. We consider a first-order computationally efficient distributed optimization algorithm (with no extra inner consensus loop) that leverages node-level gradient correction based on local data and network-level gradient aggregation only over nearby nodes. This method only requires balanced networks with no need for stochastic weight design. It can handle log-scale quantized data exchange over possibly time-varying and switching network setups. We study convergence over both structured networks (for example, training over data-centers) and ad-hoc multi-agent networks (for example, training over dynamic robotic networks). Through experimental validation, we show that (i) structured networks generally result in a smaller optimality gap, and (ii) log-scale quantization leads to a smaller optimality gap compared to uniform quantization.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Defense Framework for DC Microgrids Against Exponentially Unbounded False Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, fully distributed control framework for DC microgrids, enhancing resilience against exponentially unbounded false data injection (EU-FDI) attacks. Our framework features a consensus-based secondary control for each converter, effectively addressing these advanced threats. To further safeguard sensitive operational data, a privacy-preserving mechanism is incorporated into the control design, ensuring that critical information remains secure even under adversarial conditions. Rigorous Lyapunov stability analysis confirms the framework's ability to maintain critical DC microgrid operations like voltage regulation and load sharing under EU-FDI threats. The framework's practicality is validated through hardware-in-the-loop experiments, demonstrating its enhanced resilience and robust privacy protection against the complex challenges posed by quick variant FDI attacks.</description>

      <title>SMTL: A Stratified Logic for Expressive Multi-Level Temporal Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Stratified Metric Temporal Logic (SMTL), a novel formalism for specifying and verifying properties of complex cyber-physical systems that exhibit behaviors across multiple temporal and abstraction scales. SMTL extends existing temporal logics by incorporating a stratification operator, enabling the association of temporal properties with specific abstraction levels. This allows for the natural expression of multi-scale requirements while maintaining formal reasoning about inter-level relationships. We formalize the syntax and semantics of SMTL, proving that it strictly subsumes metric temporal logic (MTL) and offers enhanced expressiveness by capturing properties unattainable in existing logics. Numerical simulations comparing agents operating under MTL and SMTL specifications show that SMTL enhances agent coordination and safety, reducing collision rates without substantial computational overhead or compromising path efficiency. These findings underscore SMTL's potential as a valuable tool for designing and verifying complex multi-agent systems operating across diverse temporal and abstraction scales.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Quantum Power Flow for Risk Assessment in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the first quantum computing framework for Stochastic Quantum Power Flow (SQPF) analysis in power systems. The proposed method leverages quantum states to encode power flow distributions, enabling the use of Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) sampling to efficiently assess the probability of line overloads. Our approach significantly reduces the required sample size compared to traditional Monte Carlo methods, making it particularly suited for risk assessments in scenarios involving high uncertainty, such as renewable energy integration. We validate the method on two test systems, demonstrating the computational advantage of quantum algorithms in reducing sample complexity while maintaining accuracy. This work represents a foundational step toward scalable quantum power flow analysis, with potential applications in future power system operations and planning. The results show promising computational speedups, underscoring the potential of quantum computing in addressing the increasing uncertainty in modern power grids.</description>

      <title>Integration of Cobalt Ferromagnetic Control Gates for Electrical and Magnetic Manipulation of Semiconductor Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of electron spin qubit architectures for quantum computing processors has led to a strong interest in designing and integrating ferromagnets to induce stray magnetic fields for electron dipole spin resonance (EDSR). The integration of nanomagnets imposes however strict layout and processing constraints, challenging the arrangement of different gating layers and the control of neighboring qubit frequencies. This work reports a successful integration of nano-sized cobalt control gates into a multi-gate FD-SOI nanowire with nanometer-scale dot-to-magnet pitch, simultaneously exploiting electrical and ferromagnetic properties of the gate stack at nanoscale. The electrical characterization of the multi-gate nanowire exhibits full field effect functionality of all ferromagnetic gates from room temperature to 10 mK, proving quantum dot formation when ferromagnets are operated as barrier gates. The front-end-of-line (FEOL) compatible integration of cobalt is examined by energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and high/low frequency capacitance characterization, confirming the quality of interfaces and control over material diffusion. Insights into the magnetic properties of thin films and patterned control-gates are provided by vibrating sample magnetometry and electron holography measurements. Micromagnetic simulations anticipate that this structure fulfills the requirements for EDSR driving for magnetic fields higher than 1 T, where a homogeneous magnetization along the hard magnetic axis of the Co gates is expected. The FDSOI architecture showcased in this study provides a scalable alternative to micromagnets deposited in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) and middle-of-line (MOL) processes, while bringing technological insights for the FEOL-compatible integration of Co nanostructures in spin qubit devices.</description>

      <title>Stability and Synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imagine a group of oscillators, each endowed with their own rhythm or frequency, be it the ticking of a biological clock, the swing of a pendulum, or the glowing of fireflies. While these individual oscillators may seem independent of one another at first glance, the true magic lies in their ability to influence and synchronize with one another, like a group of fireflies glowing in unison.
  The Kuramoto model was motivated by this phenomenon of collective synchronization, when a group of a large number of oscillators spontaneously lock to a common frequency, despite vast differences in their individual frequencies. Inspired by Kuramoto's groundbreaking work in the 1970s, this model captures the essence of how interconnected systems, ranging from biological networks to power grids, can achieve a state of synchronization.
  This work aims to study the stability and synchronization of Kuramoto oscillators, starting off with an introduction to Kuramoto Oscillators and it's broader applications. We then at a graph theoretic formulation for the same and establish various criterion for the stability, synchronization of Kuramoto Oscillators. Finally, we broadly analyze and experiment with various physical systems that tend to behave like Kuramoto oscillators followed by further simulations.</description>
