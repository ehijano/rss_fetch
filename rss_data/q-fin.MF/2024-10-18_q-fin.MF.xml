      <title>Delegated portfolio management with random default</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are considering the problem of optimal portfolio delegation between an investor and a portfolio manager under a random default time. We focus on a novel variation of the Principal-Agent problem adapted to this framework. We address the challenge of an uncertain investment horizon caused by an exogenous random default time, after which neither the agent nor the principal can access the market. This uncertainty introduces significant complexities in analyzing the problem, requiring distinct mathematical approaches for two cases: when the random default time falls within the initial time frame [0,T] and when it extends beyond this period. We develop a theoretical framework to model the stochastic dynamics of the investment process, incorporating the random default time. We then analyze the portfolio manager's investment decisions and compensation mechanisms for both scenarios. In the first case, where the default time could be unbounded, we apply traditional results from Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) and control theory to address the agent problem. In the second case, where the default time is within the interval [0,T], the problem becomes more intricate due to the degeneracy of the BSDE's driver. For both scenarios, we demonstrate that the contracting problem can be resolved by examining the existence of solutions to integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations in both situations. We develop a deep-learning algorithm to solve the problem in high-dimension with no access to the optimizer of the Hamiltonian function.</description>

      <title>A pure dual approach for hedging Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a new dual approach to compute the hedging portfolio of a Bermudan option and its initial value. It gives a "purely dual" algorithm following the spirit of Rogers (2010) in the sense that it only relies on the dual pricing formula. The key is to rewrite the dual formula as an excess reward representation and to combine it with a strict convexification technique. The hedging strategy is then obtained by using a Monte Carlo method, solving backward a sequence of least square problems. We show convergence results for our algorithm and test it on many different Bermudan options. Beyond giving directly the hedging portfolio, the strength of the algorithm is to assess both the relevance of including financial instruments in the hedging portfolio and the effect of the rebalancing frequency.</description>
