      <title>Finite-volume formalism for physical processes with an electroweak loop integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates finite-volume effects in physical processes that involve the combination of long-range hadronic matrix elements with electroweak loop integrals. We adopt the approach of implementing the electroweak part as the infinite-volume version, which is denoted as the EW$_\infty$ method in this work. A general approach is established for correcting finite-volume effects in cases where the hadronic intermediate states are dominated by either a single particle or two particles. For the single-particle case, this work derives the infinite volume reconstruction (IVR) method from a new perspective. For the two-particle case, we provide the correction formulas for power-law finite-volume effects and unphysical terms with exponentially divergent time dependence. The finite-volume formalism developed in this study has broad applications, including the QED corrections in various processes and the two-photon exchange contribution in $K_L\to\mu^+\mu^-$ or $\eta\to\mu^+\mu^-$ decays.</description>

      <title>Simulation of ultracold Bose gases with the complex Langevin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This PhD thesis gives a comprehensive treatment of ab initio lattice Monte Carlo simulations of ultracold Bose gases by means of the complex Langevin algorithm. Since the field-theoretic action of non-relativistic bosons is a complex quantity, the corresponding path integral features a complex weight and is not accessible to standard Monte Carlo techniques. The complex Langevin algorithm represents an approach to overcome this obstacle, thereby providing the intriguing possibility of numerically exact simulations of interacting Bose-Einstein condensates within the field-theoretic framework. After reviewing the coherent-state path integral description of ultracold Bose gases as well as the complex Langevin method, we present the results of simulations in several physical scenarios. While parts of the thesis are based on arXiv:2204.10661 and arXiv:2304.05699 that treat the 3D and 2D homogeneous gas with contact interactions, it contains additional material covering external trapping potentials as well as Bose gases with long-range dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Charting Standard Model Duality and its Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate high and low energy implications of a gauge dual description of the Standard Model. The high energy electric theory features gauge dynamics involving only fermionic matter fields, while the low energy magnetic description features a quasi-supersymmetric spectrum testable at colliders. The flavour theory is constructed via operators generated at the Planck scale. We further show that duality opens novel avenues for theories of grand unification.</description>

      <title>A better space of generalized connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a base manifold $M$ and a Lie group $G$, we define $\widetilde{\cal A}_M$ a space of generalized $G$-connections on $M$ with the following properties:
  - The space of smooth connections ${\cal A}^\infty_M = \sqcup_\pi {\cal A}^\infty_\pi$ is densely embedded in $\widetilde{\cal A}_M = \sqcup_\pi \widetilde{\cal A}^\infty_\pi$; moreover, in contrast with the usual space of generalized connections, the embedding preserves topological sectors.
  - It is a homogeneous covering space for the standard space of generalized connections of loop quantization $\bar{\cal A}_M$.
  - It is a measurable space constructed as an inverse limit of of spaces of connections with a cutoff, much like $\bar{\cal A}_M$. At each level of the cutoff, a Haar measure, a BF measure and heat kernel measures can be defined.
  - The topological charge of generalized connections on closed manifolds $Q= \int Tr(F)$ in 2d, $Q= \int Tr(F \wedge F)$ in 4d, etc, is defined.
  - On a subdivided manifold, it can be calculated in terms of the spaces of generalized connections associated to its pieces. Thus, spaces of boundary connections can be computed from spaces associated to faces.
  - The soul of our generalized connections is a notion of higher homotopy parallel transport defined for smooth connections. We recover standard generalized connections by forgetting its higher levels.
  - Higher levels of our higher gauge fields are often trivial. Then $\widetilde{\cal A}_\Sigma = \bar{\cal A}_\Sigma$ for $\dim \Sigma = 3$ and $G=SU(2)$, but $\widetilde{\cal A}_M \neq \bar{\cal A}_M$ for $\dim M = 4$ and $G=SL(2, {\mathbb C})$ or $G=SU(2)$. Boundary data for loop quantum gravity is consistent with our space of generalized connections, but a path integral for quantum gravity with Lorentzian or euclidean signatures would be sensitive to homotopy data.</description>

      <title>Lattice study on finite density QC$_2$D towards zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D) at low temperature ($T = 40$ MeV, $32^4$ lattice) for the purpose of extending our previous works~\cite{Iida:2019rah, Iida:2022hyy} at $T=80$ MeV ($16^4$ lattice). Indeed, a rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential $\mu$ has been revealed, but finite volume effects in a high-density regime sometimes cause a wrong understanding. Therefore, it is important to investigate the temperature dependence down to zero temperature with large-volume simulations. By performing $32^4$ simulations, we obtain essentially similar results to the previous ones, but we are now allowed to get a fine understanding of the phase structure via the temperature dependence. Most importantly, we find that the hadronic-matter phase, which is composed of thermally excited hadrons, shrinks with decreasing temperature and that the diquark condensate scales as $\langle qq \rangle \propto \mu^2$ in the BCS phase, a property missing at $T=80$ MeV. From careful analyses, furthermore, we confirm a tentative conclusion that the topological susceptibility is independent of $\mu$. We also show the temperature dependence of the pressure, internal energy, and sound velocity as a function of $\mu$. The pressure increases around the hadronic-superfluid phase transition more rapidly at the lower temperature, while the temperature dependence of the sound velocity is invisible. Breaking of the conformal bound is also confirmed thanks to the smaller statistical error.</description>

      <title>The f0(1370) controversy from dispersive meson-meson scattering data analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.14822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the existence of the long-debated $f_0(1370)$ resonance in the dispersive analyses of meson-meson scattering data. For this, we present a novel approach using forward dispersion relations, valid for generic inelastic resonances. We find its pole at $(1245\pm 40)- i\,(300^{+30}_{-70})$ MeV in $\pi\pi$ scattering. We also provide the couplings as well as further checks extrapolating partial-wave dispersion relations or with other continuation methods. A pole at $(1380^{+70}_{-60})-i\,(220^{+80}_{-70})$ MeV also appears in the $\pi\pi\to K\bar K$ data analysis with partial-wave dispersion relations. Despite settling its existence, our model-independent dispersive and analytic methods still show a lingering tension between pole parameters from the $\pi\pi$ and $K\bar K$ channels that should be attributed to data.</description>

      <title>Footprints of the QCD Crossover on Cosmological Gravitational Waves at Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17136v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) have reported evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background at nHz frequencies, possibly originating in the early Universe. We show that the spectral shape of the low-frequency (causality) tail of GW signals sourced at temperatures around $T\gtrsim 1$ GeV is distinctively affected by confinement of strong interactions (QCD), due to the corresponding sharp decrease in the number of relativistic species. Bayesian analyses in the NANOGrav 15 years and the previous International PTA datasets reveal a significant improvement in the fit with respect to cubic power-law spectra, previously employed for the causality tail. This suggests that the inclusion of Standard Model effects on GWs can have a potentially decisive impact on model selection.</description>

      <title>Negative Barnett effect, negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma and thermal evaporation of chromomagnetic condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the negativity of the moment of inertia of (quark-)gluon plasma in a window of "supervortical" range of temperatures above the deconfining phase transition, $T \simeq (1\dots 1.5) T_c $ found recently in numerical Monte Carlo simulations by two independent methods. In our work, we confirm numerically that the origin of this effect is rooted in the thermal evaporation of the non-perturbative chromomagnetic condensate. We argue that the negative moment of inertia of gluon plasma indicates the presence of a novel effect, the negative spin-vortical coupling for gluons resulting in a negative gluonic Barnett effect: the spin polarization of gluons exceeds the total angular momentum of rotating plasma, thus forcing the orbital angular momentum to take negative values in the supervortical range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Triply charm and bottom tetraquarks in a constituent quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Singly, doubly and fully charmed tetraquark candidates, \emph{e.g.}, $T_{c\bar{s}}(2900)$, $T^+_{cc}(3875)$ and $X(6900)$ have been recently reported by the LHCb collaboration. Therefore, it is timely to implement a theoretical investigation on triply heavy tetraquark systems; herein, the S-wave triply charm and bottom tetraquarks, $\bar{Q}Q\bar{q}Q$ $(q=u,\,d,\,s;\,Q=c,\,b)$, with spin-parity $J^P=0^+$, $1^+$ and $2^+$, isospin $I=0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$, are systematically studied in a constituent quark model. Besides, all tetraquark configurations, \emph{i.e.} meson-meson, diquark-antidiquark and K-type arrangements, along with any allowed color structure, are comprehensively considered. The Gaussian expansion method (GEM), in combination with the complex-scaling method (CSM), which is quite ingenious in dealing with either bound or resonances, is the approach adopted in solving the complex scaled Schr\"odinger equation. This theoretical framework has already been applied in various tetra- and penta-quark systems. In a fully coupled-channel calculation within the GEM$+$CSM, narrow resonances are found in each $I(J^P)$ channel of the charm and bottom sector. In particular, triply charm and bottom tetraquark resonances are obtained in $5.6-5.9$ GeV and $15.3-15.7$ GeV, respectively. We provide also some insights of the compositeness of these exotic states, such as the inner quark distance, magnetic moment and dominant wave function component. All this may help to distinguish them in future high energy nuclear and particle experiments.</description>
