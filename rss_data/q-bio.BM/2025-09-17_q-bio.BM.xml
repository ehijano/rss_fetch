      <title>Computational design of intrinsically disordered proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein design has the potential to revolutionize biotechnology and medicine. While most efforts have focused on proteins with well-defined structures, increased recognition of the functional significance of intrinsically disordered regions, together with improvements in their modeling, has paved the way to their computational de novo design. This review summarizes recent advances in engineering intrinsically disordered regions with tailored conformational ensembles, molecular recognition, and phase behavior. We discuss challenges in combining models with predictive accuracy with scalable design workflows and outline emerging strategies that integrate knowledge-based, physics-based, and machine-learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Protein-Ligand Complex Generation for Deep Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scarcity of experimental protein-ligand complexes poses a significant challenge for training robust deep learning models for molecular docking. Given the prohibitive cost and time constraints associated with experimental structure determination, scalable generation of realistic protein-ligand complexes is needed to expand available datasets for model development. In this study, we introduce a novel workflow for the procedural generation and validation of synthetic protein-ligand complexes, combining a diverse ensemble of generation techniques and rigorous quality control. We assessed the utility of these synthetic datasets by retraining established docking models, Smina and Gnina, and evaluating their performance on standard benchmarks including the PDBBind core set and the PoseBusters dataset. Our results demonstrate that models trained on synthetic data achieve performance comparable to models trained on experimental data, indicating that current synthetic complexes can effectively capture many salient features of protein-ligand interactions. However, we did not observe significant improvements in docking or scoring accuracy over conventional methods or experimental data augmentation. These findings highlight the promise as well as the current limitations of synthetic data for deep learning-based molecular docking and underscore the need for further refinement in generation methodologies and evaluation strategies to fully exploit the potential of synthetic datasets for this application.</description>

      <title>Flow-Based Fragment Identification via Binding Site-Specific Latent Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fragment-based drug design is a promising strategy leveraging the binding of small chemical moieties that can efficiently guide drug discovery. The initial step of fragment identification remains challenging, as fragments often bind weakly and non-specifically. We developed a protein-fragment encoder that relies on a contrastive learning approach to map both molecular fragments and protein surfaces in a shared latent space. The encoder captures interaction-relevant features and allows to perform virtual screening as well as generative design with our new method LatentFrag. In LatentFrag, fragment embeddings and positions are generated conditioned on the protein surface while being chemically realistic by construction. Our expressive fragment and protein representations allow location of protein-fragment interaction sites with high sensitivity and we observe state-of-the-art fragment recovery rates when sampling from the learned distribution of latent fragment embeddings. Our generative method outperforms common methods such as virtual screening at a fraction of its computational cost providing a valuable starting point for fragment hit discovery. We further show the practical utility of LatentFrag and extend the workflow to full ligand design tasks. Together, these approaches contribute to advancing fragment identification and provide valuable tools for fragment-based drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Protein Molecular Dynamics Simulation with DeepJump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that DeepJump achieves significant $\approx$1000$\times$ computational acceleration while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.</description>

      <title>SHREC 2025: Protein surface shape retrieval including electrostatic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9 participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics (Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.</description>
