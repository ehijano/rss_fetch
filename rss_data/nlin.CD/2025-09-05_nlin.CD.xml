      <title>Statistical closures from the Martin-Siggia and Rose approach to turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to study the statistical closures suggested by the Martin-Siggia and Rose approach to statistical turbulence. We find that the formalism leads to a Bethe-Salpeter equation for the three point correlation of the velocity field. In the leading order approximation this equation becomes an explicit expression, which reproduces the closure found in W D McComb and S R Yoffe, A formal derivation of the local energy transfer (LET) theory of homogeneous turbulence, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 50, 375501 (2017). This suggests ways to improve upon this closure by resumming the perturbative expansion and/or applying renormalization group techniques.</description>

      <title>Deficiency of equation-finding approach to data-driven modeling of dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding the governing equations from data by sparse optimization has become a popular approach to deterministic modeling of dynamical systems. Considering the physical situations where the data can be imperfect due to disturbances and measurement errors, we show that for many chaotic systems, widely used sparse-optimization methods for discovering governing equations produce models that depend sensitively on the measurement procedure, yet all such models generate virtually identical chaotic attractors, leading to a striking limitation that challenges the conventional notion of equation-based modeling in complex dynamical systems. Calculating the Koopman spectra, we find that the different sets of equations agree in their large eigenvalues and the differences begin to appear when the eigenvalues are smaller than an equation-dependent threshold. The results suggest that finding the governing equations of the system and attempting to interpret them physically may lead to misleading conclusions. It would be more useful to work directly with the available data using, e.g., machine-learning methods.</description>

      <title>Rotational Symmetry-Breaking effects in the Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bifurcations and phase diagram for a network of identical Kuramoto oscillators with a coupling that explicitly breaks the rotational symmetry of the equations. Applying the Watanabe-Strogatz ansatz, the original N-dimensional dynamics of the network collapses to a system of dimension two. Our analytical exploration uncovers bifurcation mechanisms, including transcritical, saddle-node, heteroclinic, Hopf, and Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations, that dictate transitions between collective states. Numerical validation of the full system confirms emergent phenomena such as oscillation death, global synchronization, and multicluster dynamics. By integrating reduced-model bifurcation theory with largescale simulations, we map phase diagrams that link parameter regimes to distinct dynamical phases. This work offers insights into multistability and pattern formation in coupled oscillator systems. Notably, the multicluster obtained exhibits behavior closely resembling the frequency-synchronized clusters identified in Hodgkin-Huxley neuron models.</description>

      <title>Reservoir Predictive Path Integral Control for Unknown Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks capable of approximating complex nonlinearities have found extensive application in data-driven control of nonlinear dynamical systems. However, fast online identification and control of unknown dynamics remain central challenges. This paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs) -- reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks -- and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control -- sampling-based variants of model predictive control -- to meet these challenges. The proposed reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics with ESN and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in parallelized MPPI control computation without linearization approximations. The framework is further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which leverages ESN uncertainty to balance exploration and exploitation: exploratory inputs dominate during early learning, while exploitative inputs prevail as model confidence grows. Experiments on controlling the Duffing oscillator and four-tank systems demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based model predictive control methods.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Low-Dimensional Turbulence via Multi-Dimensional Hybrid Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of complex dynamics remains an open problem across many domains of physics, where nonlinearities and multiscale interactions severely limit the reliability of conventional forecasting methods. Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing by exploiting the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space, where the dynamics of quantum systems take place. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical reservoir architecture capable of handling multivariate time series through quantum evolution combined with classical memory enhancement. Our model employs a five-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with input-modulated dynamics and temporal multiplexing, enabling the encoding of input signals over multiple timescales. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic models of chaotic behavior in fluid dynamics, where multiscale dynamics and nonlinearities play a dominant role: a low-dimensional truncation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz-63 system. By systematically scanning the quantum system's parameter space, we identify regions that maximize forecasting performance, as measured by the Valid Prediction Time. The observed robustness and reliable performances for both dynamical systems suggest that this hybrid quantum approach offers a flexible platform for modelling complex nonlinear time series.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and hydrodynamics: from quantum to classical spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in classical spin systems the precise nature of the late-time hydrodynamic tails of the autocorrelation functions of a generic observable is determined by (i) the dynamical critical exponent and (ii) the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the corresponding observable. We provide numerical results for one- and two-dimensional systems and present theoretical considerations that only rely on the notion of ergodicity. Our result extends to the classical framework the relaxation-overlap inequality, first introduced in Capizzi et al. Phys. Rev. X 15, 011059 (2025)] for quantum many-body systems satisfying the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian features of turbulent transport in tokamak plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the Lagrangian properties of ion turbulent transport driven by drift-type turbulence in tokamak plasmas. Despite the compressible and inhomogeneous nature of Eulerian gyrocenter drifts, numerical simulations with the T3ST code reveal approximate ergodicity, stationarity, and time-symmetry. These characteristics are attributed to broad initial phase-space distributions that support ergodic mixing. Moreover, relatively minor constraints on the initial distributions are found to have negligible effects on transport levels.</description>

      <title>Local integrability breaking and exponential localization of leading Lyapunov vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16887v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study integrability breaking and transport in a discrete space-time lattice with a local integrability breaking perturbation. We find a singular distribution of the Lyapunov spectrum where the majority of Lyapunov exponents vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The sub-extensive sequence of nonzero exponents, converging in the thermodynamic limit, correspond to Lyapunov vectors that are exponentially localized with localization lengths proportional to inverse Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, we investigate the transport behavior of the system by considering the spin-spin and current-current spatio-temporal correlation functions. Our results indicate that the overall transport behavior, similarly as in the purely integrable case, conforms to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling in the thermodynamic limit and at vanishing magnetization. The same dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ governs the effect of local perturbation spreading in the bulk.</description>
