      <title>Conjugator Length in Finitely Presented Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conjugator length function of a finitely generated group is the function $f$ so that $f(n)$ is the minimal upper bound on the length of a word realizing the conjugacy of two words of length at most $n$. We study herein the spectrum of functions which can be realized as the conjugator length function of a finitely presented group, showing that it contains every function that can be realized as the Dehn function of a finitely presented group. In particular, given a real number $\alpha\geq2$ which is computable in double-exponential time, we show there exists a finitely presented group whose conjugator length function is asymptotically equivalent to $n^\alpha$. This yields a substantial refinement to results of Bridson and Riley. We attain this result through the computational model of $S$-machines, achieving the more general result that any sufficiently large function which can be realized as the time function of an $S$-machine can also be realized as the conjugator length function of a finitely presented group. Finally, we use the constructed groups to explore the relationship between the conjugator length function, the Dehn function, and the annular Dehn function in finitely presented groups.</description>

      <title>An introduction to the geometric and combinatorial group theory of Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief introduction to the geometric and combinatorial group theory of Artin groups. In particular we introduce the $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for Artin groups and survey known results as of January 2024. These notes were written as companion notes for the MFO mini-workshop 2405a "Artin groups meet triangulated categories" alongside Edmund Heng's notes "Introduction to stability conditions and its relation to the $K(\pi,1)$ conjecture for Artin groups".</description>

      <title>The Jamneshan-Tao conjecture for finite abelian groups of bounded rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm the Jamneshan-Tao conjecture for finite abelian groups of rank at most a fixed integer $R$ (i.e. finite abelian groups generated by at most $R$ elements), by proving an inverse theorem for 1-bounded functions of non-trivial Gowers norm on such groups, concluding that such a function must correlate non-trivially with a nilsequence of bounded complexity.</description>

      <title>The minimal counterexample to James's conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, Geordie Williamson proved the existence of counterexamples to James's conjecture on the decomposition matrices of symmetric groups and their Hecke algebras. The smallest counterexample detectable by Williamson's method occurs in the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_n$ for $n=1 \thinspace 744 \thinspace 860$, in characteristic $p=2237$. Those detected by Williamson remain the only known counterexamples to James's conjecture. In this work, we calculate an explicit new counterexample, occurring in the principal block of the Hecke algebra $\mathscr{H}_{24}$ when $q$ is a primitive fourth root of unity, and give explicit graded decomposition numbers in this case. This is the minimal rank counterexample for $e\neq 2$.</description>

      <title>On simple groups definable in some valued fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that non-abelian definable, definably simple groups in 1-h-minimal henselian valued fields are essentially already linear algebraic groups. Here, the group is assumed to live in the home sort. We have a similar result in pure algebraically closed valued fields of positive characteristic, under the additional assumption that the definable group is a subgroup of a linear algebraic group.</description>

      <title>Locally dihedral block designs and primitive groups with dihedral point stabilizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{D}$ be a block design admitting a locally transitive automorphism group $G$. We say $\mathcal{D}$ is $G$-point-locally dihedral if the induced local action $G_x^{\mathcal{D}(x)}$ is dihedral for each point $x$, and say $\mathcal{D}$ is $G$-block-locally dihedral if the induced local action $G_B^B$ is dihedral for each block $B$. The design $\mathcal{D}$ is called $G$-locally dihedral if both conditions hold. We give a classification of primitive permutation groups with dihedral point stabilizers, and apply it to classify point-locally dihedral block designs. For symmetric designs with a dihedral local action, we show that $G_x$ and $G_B$ are conjugate in $G$. Moreover, both local actions are faithful, and $G$ acts imprimitively on both points and blocks.</description>

      <title>A Lower Bound for the Diameter of Cayley Graph of the Symmetric Group $S_n$ Generated by $(12), (12 \dots n), (1n \dots 2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let us denote elements of the symmetric group $S_n$ using square brackets for the one-line notation. Cycles will be represented using parentheses, following the standard cycle notation. Under this convention, the full reversal of the identity element $()$ is the element $s = [n\ n-1 \dots 1]$. In the present work, we obtain a lower bound on the decomposition complexity of elements $s(1n \dots 2)^{i}$ into the generators $(12), (12 \dots n), (1n \dots 2)$, where $i$ ranges over the set $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$. As a consequence, we derive the lower bound $n(n-1)/2$ for the diameter of Cayley graph of the group $S_n$ generated by $(12), (12 \dots n), (1n \dots 2)$.</description>

      <title>Accessing non-abelian quotients of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group via elementary tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many challenging questions about the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group, $GT$, are motivated by the fact that this group receives the injective homomorphism (called the Ihara embedding) from the absolute Galois group, $G_Q$, of rational numbers. Although the question about the surjectivity of the Ihara embedding is a very challenging problem, in this paper, we construct a family of finite non-abelian quotients of $GT$ that receive surjective homomorphisms from $G_Q$. We also assemble these finite quotients into an infinite (non-abelian) profinite quotient of $GT$. We prove that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the resulting profinite group is also surjective. We give an explicit description of this profinite group.
  To achieve these goals, we used the groupoid $GTSh$ of $GT$-shadows for the gentle version of the Grothendieck-Teichmueller group. This groupoid was introduced in the recent paper by the second author and J. Guynee and the set $Ob(GTSh)$ of objects of $GTSh$ is a poset of certain finite index normal subgroups of the Artin braid group on 3 strands. We introduce a sub-poset $Dih$ of $Ob(GTSh)$ related to the family of dihedral groups and call it the dihedral poset. We show that each element $K$ of $Dih$ is the only object of its connected component in $GTSh$. Using the surjectivity of the cyclotomic character, we prove that, if the order of the dihedral group corresponding to $K$ is a power of 2, then the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective. We introduce the Lochak-Schneps conditions on morphisms of $GTSh$ and prove that each morphism of $GTSh$ with the target $K$ in $Dih$ satisfies the Lochak-Schneps conditions. Finally, we conjecture that the natural homomorphism from $G_Q$ to the finite group $GTSh(K, K)$ is surjective for every object $K$ of the dihedral poset.</description>

      <title>A completeness criterion for the common divisor graph on $p$-regular class sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09083v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group. For some fixed prime $p$, let $\Gamma_p(G)$ be the common divisor graph built on the set of sizes of $p$-regular conjugacy classes of $G$: this is the simple undirected graph whose vertices are the class sizes of those non-central elements of $G$ such that $p$ does not divide their order, and two distinct vertices are adjacent if and only if they are not coprime. In this note we prove that if $\Gamma_p(G)$ is a $k$-regular graph with $k\geq 1$, then it is a complete graph with $k+1$ vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the space of all configurations of finitely many (potentially nested) circles in the plane. We prove that this space is aspherical, and compute the fundamental group of each of its connected components. It turns out these fundamental groups are obtained as iterated semidirect products of subgroups of braid groups, with the structure for each component dictated by a finite rooted tree. These groups can be viewed as "braided" versions of the automorphism groups of such trees. We also discuss connections to statistical mechanics, topological data analysis, and geometric group theory.</description>

      <title>Cocompact Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12656v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Fuchsian group $\Gamma$ has a modular embedding if its adjoint trace field is a totally real number field and every unbounded Galois conjugate $\Gamma^\sigma$ comes equipped with a holomorphic (or conjugate holomorphic) map ${\phi^\sigma : \mathbb{B}^1 \to \mathbb{B}^1}$ intertwining the actions of $\Gamma$ and $\Gamma^\sigma$ on the Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^1$. This paper provides the first cocompact nonarithmetic Fuchsian groups with a modular embedding that are not commensurable with a triangle group. The main result, proved using period domains, is that any immersed totally geodesic complex curve on a complex hyperbolic $2$-orbifold has a modular embedding. Another consequence is arithmeticity of totally geodesic curves on finite-volume complex hyperbolic surfaces that are commensurable with quotients of $\mathbb{B}^1$ by the group generated by reflections in quadrilaterals satisfying certain angle conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09807v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the divergence of Kleinian groups $\Gamma$ and the recurrence of simple random walks on the Schreier graph associated with $\Gamma$. In particular, we show that if $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of a lattice and is of divergence type, then the Schreier graph is recurrent. Our approach builds connections among the growth rate of the $\Gamma$-orbit, the volume growth rate of the quotient manifolds, and the growth rate of the Schreier graph. Using the connections, we construct abundant Kleinian groups of divergence type.</description>
