      <title>Cavendish Tests of Millicharged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A terrestrial population of room-temperature millicharged particles can arise if they make up a dark matter subcomponent or if they are light enough to be produced in cosmic ray air showers. In a companion paper, we showed that a simple electrified shell acts as an efficient accumulator for such particles, parametrically enhancing their local density by many orders of magnitude. Here we demonstrate that Cavendish tests of Coulomb's Law, performed since the late 18th century, function as both quasistatic accumulators and detectors for this overdensity. Reinterpretations of these past Cavendish tests thus provide some of the strongest bounds on a terrestrial millicharge population. We also propose surrounding a Cavendish test with an additional charged shell, which significantly improves the sensitivity and can even enable detection of the irreducible density of millicharged particles generated from cosmic rays. Using decades-old technology, this can outperform future accelerator searches for sub-GeV masses.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Bhabha background in the detection of muonium-antimuonium conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments such as MACS and the proposed MACE study muonium-antimuonium conversion by the energies of the final-state $e^\pm$. The $e^+$ and $e^-$ from an antimuonium decay tend to be non-relativistic and relativistic, respectively, and vice versa for muonium. However, these $e^\pm$ can exchange their energies by hard Bhabha scattering, causing muonium to fake an antimuonium decay signal. We compute the rate for this background and find that, while negligible for MACE, it will become larger than the signal for conversion probabilities less than $10^{-18}$. Measuring the helicity of the $e^-$ will reduce this to $10^{-22}$.</description>

      <title>Electric Accumulation of Millicharged Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A terrestrial population of millicharged particles that interact significantly with normal matter can arise if they make up a dark matter subcomponent or if they are light enough to be produced in cosmic ray air showers. Such particles thermalize to terrestrial temperatures through repeated scatters with normal matter in Earth's environment. We show that a simple electrified shell (e.g., a Van de Graaff generator) functions as an efficient accumulator of such room-temperature millicharged particles, parametrically enhancing their local density by as much as twelve orders of magnitude. This can be used to boost the sensitivity of any detector housed in the shell's interior, such as ion traps and tests of Coulomb's law. In a companion paper, we apply this specifically to Cavendish tests of Coulomb's law, and show that a well-established setup can probe a large region of unexplored parameter space, with sensitivity to the irreducible density of millicharged particles generated from cosmic rays that outperforms future accelerator searches for sub-GeV masses.</description>

      <title>Determining (All) Dark Matter-Electron Scattering Rates From Material Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the scattering rate for any dark matter (DM) interaction with electrons in any target is proportional to several measurable material properties, encapsulated by a single master formula. This generalizes the dielectric function formalism--developed for DM interactions that couple to electron density--to any interaction, incorporating both spin-dependent and spin-independent interactions simultaneously. This formalism links the full many-body response of a target system to the DM probe in a clear and simple form, providing a reliable event rate prediction from measurable material quantities. We demonstrate the utility of our formalism by placing new limits from existing data on a class of spin-dependent light DM interactions, as their rates--contrary to common lore--are determined entirely by the dielectric function. We further highlight a promising avenue for the detection of sub-MeV DM using the rare earth metal Praseodymium, which exhibits a spin-dependent anisotropic response down to the meV scale. Our results lay the groundwork for a rapid systematic investigation of novel electron scattering targets going beyond the classic spin-independent searches, enhancing the prospects for DM detection.</description>

      <title>Deriving a parton shower for jet thermalization in QCD plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet quenching - the modification of high-energy jets in the quark-gluon plasma - has been extensively studied through weakly coupled scattering amplitudes embedded in parton-shower frameworks. These models, often combined with bulk hydrodynamic evolution, successfully describe a wide range of observables, though they typically rely on assumptions of rapid thermalization and simplified treatments of medium response. Parallel to these developments, jet thermalization has been investigated within the finite-temperature QCD effective kinetic theory, which provides our best microscopic understanding of equilibration in heavy-ion collisions. Early studies of linearized perturbations have highlighted both the promise and the limitations of current approaches, as existing MC implementations face challenges - particularly in the treatment of recoils and particle merging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a new parton-shower algorithm that exactly reproduces the dynamics of the linearized EKT, enabling a first-principles description of jet thermalization with proper inclusion of recoils, holes, quantum statistics, and merging processes.</description>

      <title>A Mini Review of some Dark Matter/BSM Physics and a Bit More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a vast literature on Dark Matter (DM) with many reviews of specific topics only a small fraction of which will be mentioned. I start with a very brief review of cosmology which underlies much of DM research and some relevant General Relativity (GR). I next discuss Self Interacting Dark Matter (SIDM) models and upper bounds on the mass M(X) of point-like, symmetric DM. This is followed up by some general aspects of DM detection and directional and temporal variations. I discuss DM models tied with BSM physics scenarios including Primordial Black Holes, new physics in the neutrino sector, ultra-light DM and axions.</description>

      <title>Precise predictions for joint polarisation fractions in WZ production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We achieve for the first time NNLO QCD + NLO EW accuracy for doubly polarised WZ inclusive production at the LHC, in the case of fully leptonic decays. Additionally, we provide estimates for missing higher-order uncertainties in QCD associated with doubly polarised differential cross sections and joint polarisation fractions, obtained both with standard scale variations and with a theory-nuisance-parameter approach. The study is carried out in the fiducial setup of a recent ATLAS analysis of Run-2 data.</description>

      <title>KM3-230213A and IceCube Neutrino Events from Metastable Dark Matter of Primordial Black Hole Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario in which the recently observed ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A, with a median energy of approximately 220 PeV, as well as the high-energy neutrinos detected by IceCube Observatory, originate from the decay of superheavy dark matter (DM) particles produced through primordial black hole (PBH) evaporation. To establish this connection, we derive constraints on the PBH abundance parameter $\beta$ as a function of the initial PBH mass $M_{\mathrm{BH_0}}$ and DM mass $m_{\mathrm{DM}}$, by considering the bound from the observed relic DM abundance. Using these constraints, we compute the resulting neutrino flux and show that DM masses in the PeV-EeV range can yield neutrinos of comparable energies, capable of accounting for both the KM3-230213A and IceCube events while remaining consistent with the relic abundance constraint. Interestingly, the scenario remains viable over a broad region of parameter space while satisfying existing cosmological and astrophysical bounds. Overall, our results demonstrate that PBH evaporation followed by DM decay provides a consistent and natural explanation for the observed ultra-high-energy neutrino events in the absence of accompanying multimessenger signatures.</description>

      <title>Testing the type-II seesaw mechanism with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional seesaw mechanisms provide an elegant theoretical framework for explaining the small yet non-zero masses of neutrinos. Nevertheless, they face significant experimental challenges, primarily because the energy scale associated with the seesaw mechanism is too high to be directly probed in terrestrial experiments. In this paper, we explore the gravitational waves (GWs) generated via graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of seesaw particles in the early Universe. Specifically, we compute the GW spectrum resulting from the decay of the Higgs triplet within the type-II seesaw model. Our results demonstrate that the resulting GW spectrum depends sensitively on the mass of the Higgs triplet and its couplings to the Standard Model Higgs doublet and the left-handed lepton doublet. The detection of such a high-frequency GW background could offer a unique experimental window into the seesaw mechanism and provide indirect evidence for its validity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel saturation and leading order collinear factorization based Monte-Carlo implementation of the EKRT model for computing QCD matter initial states in high-energy nuclear collisions. As new features the MC implementation gives a full 3-dimensional initial state event-by-event, introduces new event-by-event fluctuating spatially dependent nuclear parton distribution functions, includes dynamical fluctuations in minijet production and saturation, and accounts for the energy-momentum and valence-quark number conservation.</description>

      <title>The signals of doomsday II: Cosmological signatures of late time $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The only two gauge symmetries which remain unbroken today are $SU(3)_c$ and $U(1)_{EM}$. Both of them are crucial for our universe to appear the way it does, and for our form of life to exist. Unless we are very special observers living at the very end of the cosmological symmetry breaking chain, there is no reason to believe that these two symmetries will remain unbroken in the future. In this paper, we discuss cosmological observational signatures of the $SU(3)_c$ symmetry breaking. We introduce a model with a new colored scalar field whose potential supports the first order phase transition through creation of the true vacuum bubbles. We then calculate particle production due to vacuum mismatch and use the event generators to study the decays of the new scalar field and massive gluons. We then use Pythia to hadronize the decay products and get the distributions of produced photons and neutrinos as the final result. They represent a long range signature which, if ever observed, might be interpreted as the signals of the doomsday.</description>

Abstract: In addition to the well-known quantum chromodynamical theta angle, we show that the Standard Model has another theta angle which is invariant under arbitrary chiral rotations of quarks and leptons. The new theta angle coincides with the quantum electrodynamical theta angle which may be observable in a nontrivial spacetime topology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are coming online and will quickly impact hadron physics once certain fidelity, decoherence and memory thresholds are met, quite possibly within a decade. We review a selected number of topics where ab-initio QCD-level information about hadrons can be obtained with this computational tool that is hard to come by from other methods. This includes high baryon-density systems such as neutron-star matter (with a sign problem in lattice gauge theory); fragmentation functions; Monte Carlo generation of particles which accounts for quantum correlations in the final state; entropy production in jets; and generally, any application where time evolution in Minkowski space (as opposed to a Euclidean formulation) or where large chemical potentials play an important dynamical role. For other problems, such as the prediction of very highly excited hadron spectroscopy, they will not be a unique, but a complementary tool.</description>

      <title>Electroweak corrections to doubly polarised WZ scattering at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of next-to-leading-order electroweak corrections to the vector-boson scattering (VBS) process resulting in leptonically decaying W and Z bosons in association with two jets at the LHC. The VBS process is computed for both polarised and unpolarised intermediate bosons, exploiting the pole approximation and the separation of helicity states in tree-level and one-loop amplitudes. A phenomenological analysis is carried out for a realistic fiducial setup at a 13.6 TeV LHC collision energy, highlighting different patterns for the various polarisation states both at integrated and at differential level. This study provides theoretical predictions that are necessary to perform a sound characterisation of the spin structure of VBS processes with full LHC data.</description>

      <title>An extraction of the Collins-Soper kernel from a joint analysis of experimental and lattice data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first joint extraction of the Collins-Soper kernel (CSK) combining experimental and lattice QCD data in the context of an analysis of transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs). Based on a neural-network parametrization, we perform a Bayesian reweighting of an existing fits of TMDs using lattice data, as well as a joint TMD fit to lattice and experimental data. We consistently find that the inclusion of lattice information shifts the central value of the CSK by approximately 10% and reduces its uncertainty by 40-50%, highlighting the potential of lattice inputs to improve TMD extractions.</description>

      <title>The $\phi p$ bound state in the unitary coupled-channel approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The attractive interaction of the $\phi$ meson and the proton is reported by the ALICE Collaboration, and the corresponding scattering length $f_0$ is given as $Re(f_0)=0.85\pm0.34(stat)\pm0.14(syst)$ fm and $Im(f_0)=0.16\pm0.10(stat)\pm0.09(syst)$ fm. The fact that the real part is significant in contrast to the imaginary part indicates a dominating role of the elastic scattering, whereas the inelastic process is less important. In this work, such scattering processes are inspected on the basis of a unitary coupled-channel approximation inspired by the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The $\phi p$ scattering length is calculated and it is found that the experimental value of the $\phi p$ scattering length can be obtained only if the attractive interaction of the $\phi$ meson and the proton is taken into account. A significant outcome of such an attractive interaction is a two-pole structure in the scattering amplitude. One of the poles, located at $1969-i283$ MeV, might be a resonance state of $\phi N$, while the other pole, located at $1949-i3$ MeV, should be a bound state of $\phi N$. Both of these states do not have counterparts in the data of the Particle Data Group(PDG).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we employ Ordinary Differential Equation solution method to study neutrino spin oscillations in the case when they are gravitationally scattered off a rotating Kerr black hole. Previously, this problem involved the integral solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We analyze the consistency of these two methods.</description>

      <title>A New Probe for Long-Lived Particles at Higgs Factories: Displaced Photons in the Hadronic Calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for dark matter and other photon-portal long-lived particles (LLPs) at electron-positron colliders often relies on the mono-photon signature. At future Higgs factories operating at the $Z$-pole, this approach faces a critical challenge: the irreducible background from $e^+e^- \to \nu\bar{\nu}\gamma$ becomes overwhelming. We propose a novel strategy that overcomes this limitation by searching for displaced photons from LLP decays within the barrel of the hadronic calorimeter. This signature exploits the architectural shielding of the detector to create a nearly background-free environment. Our analysis demonstrates exceptional sensitivity to LLPs with decay lengths from $\sim$1 to $10^6$ meters, improving upon conventional searches by up to one order of magnitude for benchmark photon-portal models.</description>

      <title>QED corrections to bound-muon decays from an effective-field-theory framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound-muon decays are a powerful probe of new physics, making precise theoretical predictions for their spectra essential. While QED corrections significantly affect the shape of the spectra, their calculation is extremely challenging below the nuclear scale. By exploring the universality of modern effective-field-theory techniques, we present a framework that systematically computes those corrections across a broad class of bound-muon decays. As a key application, we provide the most accurate predictions to date for the signal and background spectra in muon conversion. We show that radiative corrections modify the leading-order ratio of these spectra by $5\%$ with minimal energy dependence, a result relevant for enhancing the discovery reach of upcoming experiments. Our framework also represents a crucial step toward connecting high-energy physics to low-energy observables, complementing recent progress above the muon mass scale.</description>

Abstract: We present recent updates from the CTEQ-JLab (CJ) global PDF analysis, focusing on the interplay and implementation systematics of the HT and offshell correction (CJ22ht). We also discuss preliminary results of the CJ25 global analysis, showing the impact of the full JLab 6 GeV datasets, that we recently collected in a comprehensive DIS database, and having a first look at early JLab 12 GeV measurements. We finally offer a few thoughts on how future data may help unraveling the nuclear and partonic dynamics in light nuclei.</description>

      <title>Vector dark matter with non-abelian kinetic mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An appealing framework for dark matter is provided by light hidden sectors, below the electroweak scale, feebly coupled to the Standard Model via light mediators. We consider a minimal, predictive model where both the dark matter and the mediator are vector bosons, and have the same mass. The portal between the dark sector and the Standard Model is provided by a kinetic mixing between the dark gauge symmetry, $SU(2)_X$, and the hypercharge, $U(1)_Y$, induced by a dimension-six operator. The dark-matter candidates, $X^\pm$, are charged under a custodial symmetry and therefore stable, while the mediator is a massive dark photon, $Z_D$, mixing with the photon and the $Z$. We show how the observed dark-matter abundance can be reproduced via freeze-out or freeze-in, through either the kinetic mixing or the dark gauge interaction. We also analyse dark 3-to-2 annihilations, that can become dominant in model variations with $Z_D$ heavier than $X^\pm$. We confront our relic-density predictions with current and projected experimental, astrophysical and cosmological bounds on the model parameter space, highlighting the correlation between the dark-photon and dark-matter phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>Automated event generation for S-wave quarkonium and leptonium production in NRQCD and NRQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework that enables the automated calculation of leading-order cross sections for S-wave quarkonium and leptonium production within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) and non-relativistic QED (NRQED) factorisation formalisms. The framework has been validated against a variety of benchmark processes, demonstrating robustness and flexibility for phenomenological studies. A key advantage of this implementation is its seamless integration with existing MadGraph5_aMC@NLO features, allowing computations not only within the Standard Model but also in a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model or Effective Field Theory scenarios via a modified Universal Feynman Output (UFO) interface. Furthermore, the framework maintains compatibility with standard Monte Carlo event generators for parton showering and hadronisation. Through numerous examples, we highlight that theoretical studies of quarkonium processes require careful consideration: the impact of subleading contributions is often difficult to predict using simple counting arguments based solely on the hierarchy of couplings and velocity-scaling rules.</description>

      <title>Determination of the initial condition for the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation with transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the high-energy limit of QCD, scattering off nucleons and nuclei can be described in terms of Wilson-line correlators whose energy dependence is perturbative. The energy dependence of the two-point correlator, called the dipole amplitude, is governed by the Balitsky-Kovchegov (BK) equation. The initial condition for the BK equation can be fitted to the experimental data, which requires evolving the dipole amplitude for a large set of different parameter values. In this work, we train a transformer model to learn the energy dependence of the dipole amplitude, skipping the time-consuming numerical evaluation of the BK equation. The transformer predicts the learned dipole amplitude and the leading order inclusive deep inelastic scattering cross section very accurately, allowing for efficient fitting of the initial condition to the experimental data. Using this setup, we fit the initial condition of the BK equation to the inclusive deep inelastic scattering data from HERA and consider two different starting points $x_0$ for the evolution. We find better agreement with the experimental data for a smaller $x_0$. This work paves the way for future studies involving global fits of the dipole amplitude at leading order and beyond.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation. Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that this is not the case, and the proposed experiments would have a gain of only $10^{-20}$ or smaller. We also analyze proposals for gamma ray lasers based on stimulated annihilation of positronium Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Fundamental impossibility of a superradiant neutrino laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we address the fundamental question whether an idealized system of $N$ atoms will show collective behavior and superradiance when it emits fermions instead of photons. We show that the maximum emission is $\propto N$ and not $\propto N^2$ which proves the absence of superradiance and shows that the recent proposal to realize a superradiant neutrino laser is impossible. This can be understood as either destructive interference of fermionic transition amplitudes, or Pauli blockade by collective excitations with fermionic nature. On the other hand, states with low excitation can show collective behavior. We derive the exact solution of the fermionic Dicke problem and analyze the decay dynamics in various regimes.</description>

      <title>The dark dimension, proton decay, and the length of the M-theory interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of a large extra dimension in which only gravity propagates would have spectacular consequences for cosmology and laboratory experiments. In the strong coupling limit of the $E_8\times E_8$ heterotic string theory, the gauge and matter fields live at the end of the eleventh dimension, which becomes a natural candidate for a micron-size \textit{dark dimension}. In this work, however, we show that the length of the M-theory interval is severely constrained by proton decay searches. Our results indicate that in such constructions the size of the eleventh dimension is $R\lesssim \mathcal{O}(10^{-28})$ meters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) Skyrme model within the framework of semi-classical quantization to compute both electromagnetic and neutral current form factors for heavy nuclei. Our results show excellent agreement with the experimental data for low- to moderate momentum transfer. Further, we present an analytic expression of the neutral current form factor for generic nuclei, expressed as a power series in the momentum transfer. Our method provides an alternative to existing phenomenological approaches, and is particularly relevant for precision neutrino experiments where control over model-dependent systematics is essential for probing physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Letter of Intent: The Forward Physics Facility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Forward Physics Facility (FPF) is a proposed extension of the HL-LHC program designed to exploit the unique scientific opportunities offered by the intense flux of high energy neutrinos, and possibly new particles, in the far-forward direction. Located in a well-shielded cavern 627 m downstream of one of the LHC interaction points, the facility will support a broad and ambitious physics program that significantly expands the discovery potential of the HL-LHC. Equipped with four complementary detectors -- FLArE, FASER$\nu$2, FASER2, and FORMOSA -- the FPF will enable breakthrough measurements that will advance our understanding of neutrino physics, quantum chromodynamics, and astroparticle physics, and will search for dark matter and other new particles. With this Letter of Intent, we propose the construction of the FPF cavern and the construction, integration, and installation of its experiments. We summarize the physics case, the facility design, the layout and components of the detectors, as well as the envisioned collaboration structure, cost estimate, and implementation timeline.</description>

Abstract: We present a short review of an unusual but important application for a high-temperature charged plasma. The unorthodox proposition was made by Ninham concerning a contribution from Casimir forces across high-temperature electron-positron plasma in nuclear interactions. The key message in the current work is how high temperatures ($\sim10^{11}$ \,K) pop out as essential. Clearly, classical, semi-classical, and quantum considerations for the background media impact both the Casimir effect and the physics of stars and the Universe.</description>

      <title>Model-independent late-universe measurements of $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ with the PAge-improved inverse distance ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$ model has encountered serious challenges and the $H_0$ tension has become more significant with increasingly precise cosmological observation. Meanwhile, inconsistencies in measurements of the curvature parameter $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ between different datasets also have emerged. In this work, we employ two global and cosmic age-based parameterizations, PAge and MAPAge, to perform model-independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and $\Omega_\mathrm{K}$ by utilizing the inverse distance ladder (IDL). To construct the PAge-improved IDL, we utilize the strong gravitational lensing (SGL), cosmic chronometers (CC), and gamma ray bursts (GRB) data to calibrate the latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation data and DESY5 type Ia supernova data. Our analysis indicate that DESI+DESY5+SGL+CC+GRB gives $H_0=71.59\pm 0.94\,{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}~{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ in the MAPAge model, reducing the $H_0$ tension to the $1.0\sigma$ level. Extending to MAPAge$+\Omega_{\rm K}$ model, we obtain $\Omega_\mathrm{K}=0.001\pm 0.038$, which suggests that current late-time data are consistent with a flat universe. Finally, the Bayesian analysis indicates that the present late-universe data provide weak to moderate evidence in favor of PAge and MAPAge relative to $\Lambda{\rm CDM}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BESIII experiment has collected a large data sample of charmonium, charm mesons, hyperons, and other light mesons. These data provide a unique opportunity to explore the dark sector beyond the Standard Model, particularly for dark sectors that couple to charm quarks or other light quarks, and for dark sectors with masses in the $\tau-c$ energy region. We present recent dark sector search results from the BESIII experiment, including the search for massless dark photons in $D^0\to\omega\gamma'$ and $D^0\to\gamma\gamma'$, the search for invisible decays of $K^0_S$, the search for dark baryon particles in $\Xi^-\to\pi^-\chi$, the search for massless particles in $\Sigma^+\to p + \rm{invisible}$, and the search for axion-like particles in $J/\psi\to\gamma a$ with $a\to\gamma\gamma$.</description>

      <title>One-pion exchange potential in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the one-pion exchange potential (OPEP) in the presence of a homogeneous magnetic field using chiral perturbation theory with nonrelativistic nucleons. Our approach is applicable not only to weak magnetic fields but also to strong ones up to around the pion-mass scale. The Green's function of charged pions is modified by the magnetic field, leading to changes in the nuclear force. By numerically evaluating the modified OPEP incorporating its spin and isospin dependencies, we show that the range of the potential decreases in both directions parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field as the field strength increases. We also compute the resulting energy shift of the deuteron due to the modified OPEP, which can reach the order of 1 MeV around $|eB| = m_\pi^2$, which is comparable to the deuteron binding energy.</description>

      <title>Close encounters with attractors of the third kind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the existence of a hydrodynamic attractor in the Mueller-Israel-Stewart framework of a fluid living in the novel geometry discovered recently by Grozdanov. This geometry, corresponding to a hyperbolic slicing of dS$_3\times\mathbb{R}$, complements previous analyses of attractors in Bjorken (flat slicing) and Gubser (spherical slicing) flows. The fluid behaves like a sharply localized droplet propagating rapidly along the lightcone, reminiscent of wounded nuclei in the CGC picture. Typical solutions approach the hydrodynamic attractor rapidly at late times despite a Knudsen number exceeding unity, suggesting that the inverse Reynolds number captures hydrodynamization more faithfully since the shear stress vanishes at late times. This is in stark contrast to Gubser flow, which has both the Knudsen and inverse Reynolds number becoming small for intermediate times. We close with a comparison to Weyl-transformed Bjorken flow and discuss possible phenomenological applications.</description>

      <title>Moments of parton distributions functions of the pion from lattice QCD using gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a nonperturbative determination of the pion valence parton distribution function (PDF) moment ratios $\left\langle x^{n-1} \right\rangle / \left\langle x \right\rangle$ up to $n=6$, using the gradient flow in lattice QCD. As a testing ground, we employ SU($3$) isosymmetric gauge configurations generated by the OpenLat initiative with a pseudoscalar mass of $m_\pi \simeq 411~\text{MeV}$. Our analysis uses four lattice spacings and a nonperturbatively improved action, enabling full control over the continuum extrapolation, and the limit of vanishing flow time, $t\to0$. The flowed ratios exhibit O($a^2$) scaling across the ensembles, and the continuum-extrapolated results, matched to the $\overline {\text{MS}}$ scheme at $\mu = 2$ GeV using next-to-next-to-leading order matching coefficients, show only mild residual flow-time dependence. The resulting ratios, computed with a relatively small number of configurations, are consistent with phenomenological expectations for the pion's valence distribution, with statistical uncertainties that are competitive with modern global fits. These findings demonstrate that the gradient flow provides an efficient and systematically improvable method to access partonic quantities from first principles. Future extensions of this work will target lighter pion masses toward the physical point, and applications to nucleon structure such as the proton PDFs and the gluon and sea-quark distributions.</description>

      <title>Boosting the cosmic 21-cm signal with exotic Lyman-$\alpha$ from dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm signal from the epoch of cosmic dawn ($z \sim 10-30$) offers a powerful probe of new physics. One standard mechanism for constraining decaying dark matter from 21-cm observations relies on heating of the intergalactic medium by the decay products, an effect whose observability is entangled with the uncertain Lyman-$\alpha$ fluxes and X-ray heating from the first stars. In this Letter, we explore a novel mechanism, where the Lyman-$\alpha$ photons produced from dark matter decay initiate early Wouthuysen-Field coupling of the spin temperature to the gas temperature, thereby boosting the 21-cm signal. This mechanism provides constraints on dark matter that are less dependent on uncertainties associated with star formation than constraints on exotic heating. We study this effect for decaying dark matter with masses $m_{\chi}\sim20.4-27.2$ eV, where diphoton decay efficiently produces Lyman-series photons. We present forecasts for the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array, showing their potential to probe an unconstrained parameter space for light decaying DM, including axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of Electroweak Scale via Higgs-portal: Dyson-Schwinger in Conformally Invariant Scalar Sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate conformally extended Standard Model with a hidden scalar $\phi$. It is shown that due to non-perturbative dynamics in the hidden sector, $\phi$ develops a vacuum expectation value (vev) in the form of a mass gap which triggers the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) and dynamically generates the SM Higgs boson mass. For estimating the non-perturbatively generated mass scale, we solve the hierarchy of Dyson-Schwinger Equations in form of partial differential equations using the exact solution known via a novel technique developed by Bender, Milton and Savage. We employ Jacobi Elliptic function as exact background solution and show that the mass gap that arises in the hidden sector can be transmuted to the EW sector, expressed in terms of Higgs-portal mixed quartic coupling $\beta$ and self interaction quartic coupling $\lambda_{\phi}$ of $\phi$. We identify the suitable parameter space where the observed SM Higgs boson can be successfully generated . Finally, we discuss how this idea of non-perturbative EW scale generation can serve as a new starting point for better realistic model building in the context of resolving the hierarchy problem in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept of instanton liquid model to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of pseudoparticles. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values (VEVs) and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations. Thereby, the nonperturbative physics can be well-controlled by only a few parameters: instanton size $\rho$ and instanton density $n_{I+A}$, and current quark mass $m$.</description>

      <title>Precise determination of the properties of $X(3872)$ and of its isovector partner $W_{c1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a simultaneous fit to BESIII data on $e^+e^-\to \gamma (D^0{\bar{D}^{0}}\pi^0/J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ and LHCb data on $B^+\to K^+(J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-)$ to precisely determine the properties of the $X(3872)$, with full consideration of three-body effects from $D^*\to D\pi$ decay, respecting both analyticity and unitarity. The $X(3872)$ is determined to be a quasi-bound state with a significance of $2.7\,\sigma$, representing the most precise determination to date. Its pole is located at $\left(-160^{+57}_{-74}-125^{+23}_{-38}\,i\right) \rm keV$, relative to the nominal $D^0\bar{D}^{*0}$ threshold. Moreover, we confirm the presence of an isovector partner state, $W_{c1}$. It is found as a virtual state at $\left(3.1\pm0.7+ 1.3^{+1.9}_{-0.6}\,i\right)\ \rm MeV$ relative to the $D^+ D^{*-}$ threshold on an unphysical Riemann sheet, strongly supporting a molecular nature of both $X(3872)$ and $W_{c1}$. As a highly nontrivial prediction we show that the $W_{c1}$ leads to nontrivial lineshapes around 3.88 GeV in $B^0\to K^0 X(3872)\to K^0 D^0\bar D^0\pi^0$ and $K^0J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ -- thus the scheme presented here can be tested further by improved measurements.</description>

Abstract: The transition magnetic moment between active and sterile neutrinos is theoretically well-motivated scenario beyond the Standard Model, which can be probed in cosmology, astrophysics, and at terrestrial experiments. In this work, we focus on the latter by examining such an interaction at proposed lepton colliders. Specifically, in addition to revisiting LEP, we consider CEPC, FCC-ee, CLIC, and the muon collider, motivated by the potential realization of any of them. Within the effective field theory framework, we present parameter regions that can be probed, highlighting the dependence on the lepton flavor interacting with the sterile neutrino. By including several new processes with large sterile neutrino production cross sections at high-energy lepton colliders, we find that the expected sensitivity for the active-to-sterile neutrino transition magnetic moment can reach $d_\gamma \simeq \mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ GeV$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Hunting for a 17 MeV particle coupled to electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a set of precision observables that can probe the existence of a light particle $X$ coupled to electrons in the mass range of 1-100 MeV. As a case study, we consider the recent excess of $e^+e^-$ final-state events at $\sqrt{s} = 16.9$ MeV reported by the PADME collaboration. Interestingly, this mass is tantalizingly close to the invariant mass at which anomalous $e^+e^-$ pair production has previously been observed in nuclear transitions from excited to ground states by the ATOMKI collaboration. For the scenario in which the new particle has a vector coupling to electrons, we show that the PADME excess is already in tension with constraints from the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. Further improvements in the measurement of the electron $g$-2, together with upcoming results from PIONEER (searching for $\pi^+\to e^+ \nu X$) and Mu3e (searching for $\mu^+ \to e^+ \bar\nu_\mu\nu_e X$), are expected to definitively probe this scenario in the near future. We also explore alternative possibilities where the new particle has scalar, pseudoscalar, or axial-vector couplings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We entertain the constraints that the absence of vacuum Cherenkov radiation of ultrahigh-energy electrons inferred from LHAASO observations of the Crab Nebula can impose on generic models in which Lorentz symmetry of the particle vacuum is violated, as established by some recent studies in \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137034}{\emph{Phys. Lett. B} {\bf 829} (2022) 137034}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physletb.2022.137536}{{\bf 835} (2022) 137536}; \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.108.063006}{\emph{Phys. Rev. D} {\bf108} (2023) 063006}. We demonstrate in the present paper, that implementing a phenomenological approach to the Lorentz violation, the rates of this vacuum process are substantial such that one is justified in deriving bounds on the violation scales from simple threshold analysis just as these works did. Albeit such results are likely effective then, they do not apply in the same form among scenarios. Specifically, we show that these Cherenkov constraints are naturally evaded in models of space-time foam inspired from~(supercritical) string theory, involving D-branes as space-time defects in a brane-world scenario, in which subluminous energy-dependent refractive indices of light have been suggested. We examine here two specific foam situations and find for both cases~(though, for different reasons) the potentiality that charged quanta such as electrons do \emph{not} radiate as they pass through the gravitational vacuum `medium' despite moving faster than photons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate charmed hybrid baryons using the QCD sum rule method within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. We construct twenty-eight interpolating currents for charmed hybrid baryons, seven of which are employed in QCD sum rule analyses of nineteen states with quark-gluon configurations $qqcg$, $qscg$, and $sscg$ ($q = u/d$). The masses of the lowest-lying charmed hybrid baryons in the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{6}_F$ representation are calculated to be $M_{\Sigma_{cg}(1/2^+)} = 3.36^{+0.27}_{-0.26}~\rm{GeV}$, $M_{\Xi^\prime_{cg}(1/2^+)} = 3.59\pm 0.20~\rm{GeV}$, and $M_{\Omega_{cg}(1/2^+)} = 3.82\pm 0.21~\rm{GeV}$. We propose that future experiments search for these states via their $P$-wave decay channels $ND^{(*)}$, $\Lambda D^{(*)}$, and $\Xi D^{(*)}$, respectively. Such investigations would provide valuable insight into the role of gluonic excitations in hadron structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18555v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of future electron-positron colliders, such as FCC-ee and CEPC, to probe 2-Higgs-doublet models (2HDMs) that facilitate a strong first-order electroweak phase transition (SFOEWPT), a necessary condition for electroweak baryogenesis. Focusing on a 2HDM in the CP-conserving limit, we identify parameter regions consistent with an SFOEWPT and evaluate their compatibility with projected precision electroweak and Higgs measurements, as well as searches for exotic Higgs bosons. We show that radiative corrections to $e^+e^-\to hZ$ production introduce deviations in the cross section that are resolvable with the anticipated sub-percent precision at lepton colliders even when experimental outcomes of the LHC and $Z$ pole measurements are in agreement with the SM. This underscores the opportunities of a precision lepton collider to explore BSM quantum corrections to the Higgs sector more broadly.</description>

Abstract: We present the third part of a systematic calculation of the two-loop anomalous dimensions for the low-energy effective field theory below the electroweak scale (LEFT): insertions of dimension-six operators that conserve baryon number. In line with our previous publications, we obtain the results in the algebraically consistent 't Hooft-Veltman scheme for $\gamma_5$, corrected for evanescent as well as chiral-symmetry-breaking effects through finite renormalizations. We compute the renormalization of the dimension-six four-fermion and three-gluon operators, as well as the power corrections to lower-dimension operators in the presence of masses, i.e., the down-mixing into dimension-five dipole operators, masses, gauge couplings, and theta terms. Our results are of interest for a broad range of low-energy precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: We develop a simulation within GENIE of the excitation of baryonic resonances by boosted dark matter. This work completes the simulation of all scattering modes for dark matter entering a detector at relativistic speeds. At some boosts, resonant scattering can contribute over 30% to the scattering rate. This channel offers a potentially powerful probe of the isospin structure of dark matter interactions via the relative prominence of the isospin-changing $\Delta$ resonance. We study the estimated sensitivity of large volume detectors such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO to all dark matter scattering modes and demonstrate the expected improvement in sensitivity when resonant scattering is included.</description>

      <title>Precision gravity constraints on large dark sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General relativity, treated as a low energy effective field theory, predicts quantum corrections to Newtons law of gravitation arising from loops of matter and graviton fields. While these corrections are negligible for the Standard Model particle content, the situation changes dramatically in the presence of a hidden or dark sector containing a very large number of light degrees of freedom. In such cases, loop induced modifications to the Newtonian potential can accumulate to levels testable in laboratory and astrophysical probes of gravity at short distances. In this work we systematically derive and constrain the impact of large dark sectors on precision tests of Newtons law, translating effective field theory predictions into the experimental language of Yukawa type deviations and inverse square law deformations. By mapping precision fifth force constraints onto bounds on species multiplicities and masses, we show that current and forthcoming experiments already impose nontrivial constraints on the size and structure of hidden sectors coupled only gravitationally. For truly massless hidden states, present data still permit multiplicities as large as 1e61, with modest spin dependence; for finite masses the constraints reduce to the familiar short range Yukawa parameterization. Our results provide a model independent framework for confronting dark sector scenarios with precision gravity data and clarify how non minimal scalar couplings, potential higher derivative poles at large species number, and Kaluza Klein towers fit within this picture. The approach is complementary to cosmological probes: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background constrain relic abundances under specified production histories, whereas laboratory tests constrain the spectrum of light states irrespective of their cosmological population.</description>

Abstract: This competition in high-energy physics (HEP) and machine learning was the first to strongly emphasise uncertainties in $(H \rightarrow \tau^+ \tau^-)$ cross-section measurement. Participants were tasked with developing advanced analysis techniques capable of dealing with uncertainties in the input training data and providing credible confidence intervals. The accuracy of these intervals was evaluated using pseudo-experiments to assess correct coverage. The dataset is now published in Zenodo, and the winning submissions are fully documented.</description>

      <title>Lepton flavor from a horizontal symmetry in a slice of AdS$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build a model of lepton flavor in a slice of AdS$_5$. We add to the 5D SM fields a set of neutrino fields, as well as a horizontal U(1) symmetry and a flavon field, all propagating in the bulk. The electroweak and U(1) symmetries are spontaneously broken by a potential localized on the infrared boundary. We show that in a flavor anarchic scenario, by suitable choice of the 5D masses and the U(1) charges, the masses of the SM leptons and the PMNS matrix can be naturally generated. The neutrino masses are Dirac like, with a normal ordered hierarchical spectrum, $\Delta m_{32}^2\approx m_3^2$, $\Delta m_{21}^2\approx m_2^2\gg m_1^2$, and a suppressed $\theta_{13}$ mixing angle. We find configurations where the charged lepton mixing angles are suppressed by powers of the Cabibbo angle ($\lambda_C$) relative to vanilla anarchic partial compositeness, consequently reducing CP and lepton flavor violation. Specifically, the Wilson coefficient for the electron electromagnetic dipole moment exhibits $\lambda_C^2$ suppression, while those governing $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu-e$ vector operators are suppressed by $\lambda_C^{3/2}$ compared to the anarchic scenario without U(1) horizontal symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the end of 2016, we computed the five-loop (N$^4$LO) contributions to the beta function in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), its generalization to non-Abelian gauge theories with a simple compact Lie group, and for Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). Here we recall main tools used in and specifically developed for this computation and its main analytic and numerical results. The development work carried out for this project facilitated further even more involved analytic five-loop computations. We briefly summarize also their numerical QCD results for Higgs-boson decay to hadrons in the heavy-top limit and for two N$^4$LO splitting functions for the evolution of quark distributions of hadrons. The latter lead to a first realistic estimate of the five-loop contribution to another important quantity in perturbative QCD, the quark cusp anomalous dimension.</description>

      <title>Dijets with large rapidity separation at the next-to-leading BFKL for search of large extra dimension gravity at colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Search for the gravity with large extra dimensions at collider energies is considered in the trans-Planckian eikonal regime, i. e., when $\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg M_D \gg \sqrt{-\hat{t}}$. Here $\hat{s}$ and $\hat{t}$ are the Mandelstam variables of colliding parton-parton system and $M_D$ is the Planck mass scale in the space-time with compactified $n_D$ extra dimensions. A relevant observable for this regime may be the cross section of high-mass ($M_{jj}\sim\sqrt{\hat{s}} \gg M_D$) dijet production with large rapidity separation. Then the standard model (SM) background should be calculated within the next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) approximation of Lipatov-Fadin-Kuraev-Balitsky (BFKL) formalism of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) suitable for $\sqrt{\hat{s}}\gg\sqrt{-\hat{t}}\gg\Lambda_\mathrm{QCD}$. In this work the signal of the large extra dimension gravity as well as the NLL BFKL QCD background are estimated for the high-luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) and future colliders such as FCCpp and CEPC-SppC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the QCD chiral phase transition at finite temperature and finite baryon density using the functional Renormalization Group (fRG). While conventional fRG studies often employ techniques such as dynamical bosonization to regularize divergences, we instead pursue the weak solution of the fRG equations which allows for non-analytic behavior in the flow to compute the pure fermionic potential $V_k(\psi,\bar{\psi})$ within the local potential approximation. This approach enables us to explore the effects of purely quark-level fluctuations on dynamical chiral symmetry breaking without introducing any auxiliary bosonic fields. Based on this framework, we present the resulting chiral phase diagram as a function of temperature and baryon chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation for a charged scalar particle in an electromagnetic plane wave background with $k^2&gt;0$ which can be realized in a medium with a refractive index $n&lt;1$. We reduce the equation of motion to the Mathieu equation, which has resonant exponentially growing solutions for certain parameter ranges. We show that this resonance indeed occurs for small scalar masses. We apply our results to derive constraints on millicharged particles and compare them with existing experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11098v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent James Webb Space Telescope observations of high-redshift massive galaxy candidates have initiated renewed interest in the important mystery around the formation and evolution of our Universe's largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the direct collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into primordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark matter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation distributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation amplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy, observations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound region significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and enables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations corresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range ${\cal O}(10^5$\text{--}$10^{12}) M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precessing binary black-hole mergers can produce a net flux of circularly-polarized gravitational waves. This imbalance between left- and right-handed circularly polarized waves, quantified via the Stokes pseudo-scalar $V_{\rm GW}$, originated from mirror asymmetries in the binary. We scan the parameter space of black-hole mergers to investigate correlations between $V_{\rm GW}$ and chiral magnitudes constructed out of the intrinsic parameters of the binary. To this end, we use both numerical-relativity simulations for (quasi-circular) and eccentric precessing mergers from both the SXS and RIT catalogues, as well as the state-of-the-art surrogate model for quasi-circular precessing mergers NRSur7dq4. We find that, despite being computed by manifestly different formulas, $V_{\rm GW}$ is linearly correlated to the helicity of the final black hole, defined as the projection of its recoil velocity onto its spin. Next, we test our ability to perform accurate measurements of $V_{\rm GW}$ in gravitational-wave observations through the injection and recovery of numerically simulated signals. We show that $V_{\rm GW}$ can be estimated unbiasedly using the surrogate waveform model NRSur7dq4 even for signal-to-noise ratios of nearly 50, way beyond current gravitational-wave observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings with next-generation detector networks: Component separation based on a multi-source astrophysical foreground noise model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from cosmic strings is crucial for unveiling the evolutionary laws of the early universe and validating non-standard cosmological models. This study presents the first systematic evaluation of the detection capabilities of next-generation ground-based gravitational wave detector networks for cosmic strings. By constructing a hybrid signal model incorporating multi-source astrophysical foreground noise, including compact binary coalescences (CBCs) and compact binary hyperbolic encounters (CBHEs), we propose an innovative parameter estimation methodology based on multi-component signal separation. Numerical simulations using one-year observational data reveal three key findings: (1) The CE4020ET network, comprising the Einstein Telescope (ET-10 km) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE-40 km and CE-20 km), achieves nearly one order of magnitude improvement in constraining the cosmic string tension $G\mu$ compared to individual detectors, reaching a relative uncertainty $\Delta G\mu / G\mu &lt; 0.5$ for $G\mu &gt; 3.5 \times 10^{-15}$ under standard cosmological framework; (2) The network demonstrates enhanced parameter resolution in non-standard cosmological scenarios, providing a novel approach to probe pre-Big Bang Nucleosynthesis cosmic evolution; (3) Enhanced detector sensitivity amplifies CBHE foreground interference in parameter estimation, while precise modeling of such signals could further refine $G\mu$ constraints by $1-2$ orders of magnitude. This research not only quantifies the detection potential of third-generation detector networks for cosmic string models but also elucidates the intrinsic connection between foreground modeling precision and cosmological parameter estimation accuracy, offering theoretical foundations for optimizing scientific objectives of next-generation gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of collisions and the formation of subsequent many-particle states. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 104 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 5,589 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. An outgoing heavy particle produced in the collision is identified from the skewness of the measured energy density. Integral to this computation is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>

Abstract: We solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation (LSE) with a kernel that includes a regular finite-range potential and additional contact terms with derivatives. We employ distorted wave theory and dimensional regularization, as proposed in Physics Letters B 568 (2003) 109. We analyze the spin singlet nucleon-nucleon $S-$wave as case of study, with the regular one-pion exchange (OPE) potential in this partial wave and up to ${\cal O}(Q^6)$ (six derivatives) contact interactions. We discuss in detail the renormalization of the LSE, and show that the scattering amplitude solution of the LSE fulfills exact elastic unitarity and inherits the left-hand cut of the long-distance OPE amplitude. Furthermore, we proof that the LSE amplitude coincides with that obtained from the exact $N/D$ calculation, with the appropriate number and typology of subtractions to reproduce the effective range parameters taken as input to renormalize the LSE amplitude. The generalization to higher number of derivatives is straightforward.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrinos and dark energy (DE) have entered a new era of investigation, as the latest DESI baryon acoustic oscillation measurements tighten the constraints on the neutrino mass and suggest that DE may be dynamical rather than a cosmological constant. {In this work, we obtain a high-confidence measurement of the neutrino mass within a dynamical DE framework. A joint analysis of DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background, DESY5 supernova, and DESY1 weak lensing data yields a total neutrino mass of $\sum m_\nu = 0.098^{+0.016}_{-0.037}\,\mathrm{eV}$, indicating a measurement for a non-zero, positive neutrino mass at the $2.7\sigma$ level within the $w_0w_a$CDM framework. This high-confidence measurement is driven mainly by these factors: (i) the DESI's preference for a dynamical DE with its equation of state evolving from $w&lt; -1$ at early times to $w&gt; -1$ at late times, thus leading to a larger neutrino mass; (ii) treating $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$ as a free parameter together with the inclusion of weak lensing data, which likewise allows for an increased neutrino mass.} In future, even higher-confidence measurements of neutrino mass are expected with stronger preferences for dynamical DE in light of more complete DESI data releases.</description>
