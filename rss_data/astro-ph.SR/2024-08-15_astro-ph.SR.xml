      <title>On the intermittency of hot plasma loops in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent analysis has suggested that the heating of plasma loops in the solar corona depends not just on the Poynting flux but also on processes yet to be identified. This discovery reflects and refines earlier questions such as, why and how are entire hydromagnetic structures only intermittently loaded with bright coronal plasma Litwin &amp; Rosner (1993)? The present work scrutinizes more chromospheric and coronal data, with the aim of finding reproducible observational constraints on coronal heating mechanisms. Six independent scans of chromospheric active region magnetic fields are investigated and correlated to overlying hot plasma loops. For the first time, the footpoints of over 30 bright plasma loops are thus related to scalar proxies for the Poynting fluxes measured from the upper chromosphere. Although imperfect, the proxies all indicate a general lack of correlation between footpoint Poynting flux and loop brightness. Our findings consolidate the claim that unobserved physical processes are at work which govern the heating of long-lived coronal loops.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the high early solar cosmic ray flux with cosmogenic neon isotopes in refractory minerals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An enhancement in the activity of the early young Sun resulting in a high charged particle flux has been invoked to explain excesses in spallation-induced nuclides in primitive planetary materials. Astronomical observations of energetic outbursts of young stellar objects (YSOs) also support the idea of an active young Sun. However, the early solar cosmic-ray (SCR) flux has not been well constrained. Here we use measured concentrations of SCR-produced nuclides that formed and are preserved in meteoritical hibonite and spinel, some of the oldest solids formed in the Solar System, and physical models for dust transport in the early protoplanetary disk to determine the magnitude of the early SCR flux. We focus our attention on cosmogenic neon which cannot have been inherited from precursors and can only be produced in situ in solids. Our modeled effective exposure time to SCRs for these solids is very short on the order of years. This indicates the early SCR flux recorded in refractory mineral hibonite was up to ~7 orders of magnitude higher than the contemporary level. Our flux estimate is consistent with the &gt;10^5 enhanced flux inferred from astronomical observations of greatly enhanced flare activities of YSOs.</description>

      <title>Cyclical period changes in cataclysmic variables: a statistical study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of a statistical study of cyclical period changes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). Assuming the third-body hypothesis as the cause of period changes, we estimate the third-body mass, $m_3$, and its separation from the binary, $a_3$, for 21 CVs showing cyclical period changes from well-sampled observed-minus-calculated diagrams covering more than a decade of observations. The inferred $a_3$ values are independent of the binary orbital period, $P_\mathrm{orb}$, whereas the $m_3$ values increase with $P_\mathrm{orb}$ by an order of magnitude from the shortest period (oldest) to the longest period (youngest) systems, implying significant mass loss from the third body with time. A model for the time evolution of the triple system is not able to simultaneously explain the observed behavior of the $m_3(P_\mathrm{orb})$ and $a_3(P_\mathrm{orb})$ distributions because the combined mass loss from the binary and the third body demands an increase in orbital separation by factors $\sim 140$ as the binary evolves toward shorter $P_\mathrm{orb}$'s, in clear disagreement with the observed distribution. We conclude that the third-body hypothesis is statistically inconsistent and cannot be used to explain cyclical period changes observed in CVs. On the other hand, the diagram of the amplitude of the period change versus the CV donor-star mass is consistent both with the alternative hypothesis that the observed cyclical period changes are a consequence of magnetic activity in the solar-type donor star, and with the standard evolutionary scenario for CVs.</description>

      <title>Citizen ASAS-SN Data Release II: Variable Star Classification Using Citizen Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second results from Citizen ASAS-SN, a citizen science project for the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) hosted on the Zooniverse platform. Citizen ASAS-SN tasks users with classifying variable stars based on their light curves. We started with 94975 new variable candidates and identified 4432 new variable stars. The users classified the new variables as 841 pulsating variables, 2995 rotational variables, 350 eclipsing binaries, and 246 unknown variables. We found 68% user agreement for user-classified pulsating variables, 51% for rotational variables, and 77% for eclipsing binaries. We investigate user statistics and compare new variables to known variables. We present a sample of variables flagged as interesting or unusual.</description>

      <title>Chemical complexity and dust formation around evolved stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outflows of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are rich astrochemical laboratories, hosting different chemical regimes: from non-equilibrium chemistry close to the star, to dust formation further out, and finally photochemistry in the outer regions. Chemistry is crucial for understanding the driving mechanism and dynamics of the outflow, as it is the small-scale chemical process of dust formation that launches the large-scale stellar outflow. However, exactly how dust condenses from the gas phase and grows is still unknown: an astrochemical problem with consequences for stellar evolution. Disagreements between observations and the predictions of chemical models drive the development of these models, helping to understand the link between dynamics and chemistry and paving the way to a 3D hydrochemical model.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Various Solar Magnetic Field Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dynamics in three magnetic regions, viz., Quiet Sun, Weak Plage, and Strong Plage, using realistic three-dimensional simulations from a comprehensive radiation-MHD code, MURaM. We find that the spatial extents and spatial distribution of vortices vary for different setups even though the photospheric turbulence responsible for generating vortices has similar profiles for all three regions. We investigate kinetic and magnetic swirling strength and find them consistent with the Alfv\'en wave propagation. Using a flux tube expansion model and linear magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) wave theory, we find that the deviation in kinetic swirling strength from the theoretically expected value is the highest for the Strong Plage, least for the Weak Plage, and intermediate for the Quiet Sun at chromospheric heights. It suggests that Weak Plage is the most favoured region for chromospheric swirls, though they are of smaller spatial extents than in Quiet Sun. We also conjecture that vortex interactions within a single flux tube in Strong Plage lead to an energy cascade from larger to smaller vortices that further result in much lower values of kinetic swirling strength than other regions. Fourier spectra of horizontal magnetic fields at 1 Mm height also show the steep cascade from large to smaller scales for Strong Plage. These findings indicate the potential of vortex-induced torsional Alfv\'en waves to travel higher in the atmosphere without damping for weaker magnetic regions such as the Quiet Sun, whereas vortices would result in dissipation and heating due to the vortex interactions in narrow flux tubes for the strongly magnetized regions such as Strong Plage.</description>

      <title>Investing in the Unrivaled Potential of Wide-Separation Sub-Jupiter Exoplanet Detection and Characterisation with JWST -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for a large scale imaging survey of nearby young moving groups and star-forming regions to directly detect exoplanets over an unexplored range of masses, ages and orbits. Discovered objects will be identified early enough in JWST's lifetime to leverage its unparalleled capabilities for long-term atmospheric characterisation, and will uniquely complement the known population of exoplanets and brown dwarfs. Furthermore, this survey will constrain the occurrence of the novel wide sub-Jovian exoplanet population, informing multiple theories of planetary formation and evolution. Observations with NIRCam F200W+F444W dual-band coronagraphy will readily provide sub-Jupiter mass sensitivities beyond ~0.4" (F444W) and can also be used to rule out some contaminating background sources (F200W). At this large scale, targets can be sequenced by spectral type to enable robust self-referencing for PSF subtraction. This eliminates the need for dedicated reference observations required by GO programs and dramatically increases the overall science observing efficiency. With an exposure of ~30 minutes per target, the sub-Jupiter regime can be explored across 250 targets for ~400 hours of exposure time including overheads. An additional, pre-allocated, ~100 hours of observing time would enable rapid multi-epoch vetting of the lowest mass detections (which are undetectable in F200W). The total time required for a survey such as this is not fixed, and could be scaled in conjunction with the minimum number of detected exoplanet companions.</description>

      <title>The Unrealised Interdisciplinary Advantage of Observing High Mass Transiting Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs -- Strategic Exoplanet Initiatives with HST and JWST White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We advocate for further prioritisation of atmospheric characterisation observations of high mass transiting exoplanets and brown dwarfs. This population acts as a unique comparative sample to the directly imaged exoplanet and brown dwarf populations, of which a range of JWST characterisation observations are planned. In contrast, only two observations of transiting exoplanets in this mass regime were performed in Cycle 1, and none are planned for Cycle 2. Such observations will: improve our understanding of how irradiation influences high gravity atmospheres, provide insights towards planetary formation and evolution across this mass regime, and exploit JWST's unique potential to characterise exoplanets across the known population.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT reveals a ghostly thermal radio ring towards the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the serendipitous discovery of a new radio-continuum ring-like object nicknamed Kyklos (J1802-3353), with MeerKAT UHF and L-band observations. The radio ring, which resembles the recently discovered odd radio circles (ORCs), has a diameter of 80 arcsec and is located just 6 deg from the Galactic plane. However, Kyklos exhibits an atypical thermal radio-continuum spectrum ({\alpha} = -0.1 +/- 0.3), which led us to explore different possible formation scenarios. We concluded that a circumstellar shell around an evolved massive star, possibly a Wolf-Rayet, is the most convincing explanation with the present data.</description>

      <title>The effects of the carbon-to-oxygen ratio on the condensate compositions around Solar-like stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The initial stellar carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) ratio can have a large impact on the resulting condensed species present in the protoplanetary disk and, hence, the composition of the bodies and planets that form. The observed C/O ratios of stars can vary from 0.1-2. We use a sequential dust condensation model to examine the impact of the C/O ratio on the composition of solids around a Solar-like star. We utilize this model in a focused examination of the impact of varying the initial stellar C/O ratio to isolate the effects of the C/O ratio in the context of Solar-like stars. We describe three different system types in our findings. The Solar system falls into the silicate-dominant, low C/O ratio systems which end at a stellar C/O ratio somewhere between 0.52 and 0.6. At C/O ratios between about 0.6 and 0.9, we have intermediate systems. Intermediate systems show a decrease in silicates while carbides begin to become significant. Carbide-dominant systems begin around a C/O ratio of 0.9. Carbide-dominant systems exhibit high carbide surface densities at inner radii with comparable levels of carbides and silicates at outer radii. Our models show that changes between C/O=0.8 and C/O=1 are more significant than previous studies, that carbon can exceed 80% of the condensed mass, and that carbon condensation can be significant at radii up to 6 AU.</description>

      <title>Portability of Fortran's `do concurrent' on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a continuing interest in using standard language constructs for accelerated computing in order to avoid (sometimes vendor-specific) external APIs. For Fortran codes, the {\tt do concurrent} (DC) loop has been successfully demonstrated on the NVIDIA platform. However, support for DC on other platforms has taken longer to implement. Recently, Intel has added DC GPU offload support to its compiler, as has HPE for AMD GPUs. In this paper, we explore the current portability of using DC across GPU vendors using the in-production solar surface flux evolution code, HipFT. We discuss implementation and compilation details, including when/where using directive APIs for data movement is needed/desired compared to using a unified memory system. The performance achieved on both data center and consumer platforms is shown.</description>

      <title>One Year of SN 2023ixf: Breaking Through the Degenerate Parameter Space in Light-Curve Models with Pulsating Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and analyze the extensive optical broadband photometry of the Type II SN 2023ixf up to one year after explosion. We find that, when compared to two pre-existing model grids, the pseudo-bolometric light curve is consistent with drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties. This may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We independently compute a large grid of ${\tt MESA+STELLA}$ single-star progenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses, mass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed progenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models consistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously established scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling indicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ($E_{\rm exp}\approx7\times10^{50}$ erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red supergiant progenitor ($\gtrsim 17\ M_{\odot}$) that lost a significant amount of mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope ($\lesssim 3\ M_{\odot}$) at the time of explosion, with a radius $\gtrsim 950\ R_{\odot}$ and a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.07\ M_{\odot}$. We posit that previous mass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf's progenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work offers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future, particularly with the upcoming Vera C.~Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.</description>

      <title>IC 10 X-1: A Double Black Hole Progenitor Probably Formed through Stable Mass Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: IC 10 X-1 is one of close X-ray binaries containing a Wolf-Rayet donor, which can provide an evolutionary link between high-mass X-ray binaries and gravitational wave sources. It is still unclear about the precise nature of the accreting compact object in IC 10 X-1, although it looks more like a black hole than a neutron star. In this work, we use a binary population synthesis method to simulate the formation of IC 10 X-1 like binaries by assuming different common-envelope ejection efficiencies. This work represents a big step forward over previous studies since we adopt new criteria of mass-transfer stability. These criteria allow the formation of IC 10 X-1 like systems without experiencing common envelope evolution. Based on our calculations, we propose that the compact object in IC 10 X-1 is a black hole with mass of $\sim 10-30M_\odot$ and the progenitor evolution of this binary probably just experienced stable mass transfer.</description>

Abstract: Significant progress has been made toward understanding the formation of massive ($M &gt; 8~$M$_{\odot}$) binaries in close orbits. For example, the detection of a very low velocity dispersion among the massive stars in the young region M17 and the measurement of a positive trend of velocity dispersion with age in Galactic clusters. The velocity dispersion observed in M17 could be explained either by the lack of binaries among the stars in this region or by larger binary separations than typically observed, but with a binary fraction similar to other young Galactic clusters. The latter implies that over time, the binary components migrate toward each other. We aim to determine the origin of the strikingly low velocity dispersion by determining the observed and intrinsic binary fraction of massive stars in M17 through multi-epoch spectroscopy. We performed a multi-epoch spectroscopic survey consisting of three epochs separated by days and months. We determine the radial velocity of each star at each epoch by fitting the stellar absorption profiles. We determine an observed binary fraction of 27% and an intrinsic binary fraction of 87%, consistent with that of other Galactic clusters. We conclude that the low velocity dispersion is due to a large separation among the young massive binaries in M17. Our result is in agreement with a migration scenario in which massive stars are born in binaries or higher order systems at large separation and harden within the first million years of evolution. Such an inward migration may either be driven by interaction with a remnant accretion disk, with other young stellar objects present in the system or by dynamical interactions within the cluster. Our results imply that possibly both dynamical interactions and binary evolution are key processes in the formation of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Super-Alfv\'enic Flows Downstream of Collisionless Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Alfv\'enic jets, with kinetic energy densities significantly exceeding that of the solar wind, are commonly generated downstream of Earth's bow shock under both high and low beta plasma conditions. In this study, we present theoretical evidence that these enhanced kinetic energy flows are driven by firehose-unstable fluctuations and compressive heating within collisionless plasma environments. Using a fluid formalism that incorporates pressure anisotropy, we estimate that the downstream flow of a collisionless plasma shock can be accelerated by a factor of 2 to 4 following the compression and saturation of firehose instability. By analyzing quasi-parallel magnetosheath jets observed in situ by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we find that approximately 11\% of plasma measurements within these jets exhibit firehose-unstable fluctuations. Our findings offer an explanation for the distinctive generation of fast downstream flows in both low ($\beta&lt;1$) and high ($\beta&gt;1$) beta plasmas, and provide new evidence that kinetic processes are crucial for accurately describing the formation and evolution of magnetosheath jets.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Accretion Flows -- ALMAGAL: Flows along filamentary structures in high-mass star-forming clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use data from the ALMA Evolutionary Study of High Mass Protocluster Formation in the Galaxy (ALMAGAL) survey to study 100 ALMAGAL regions at $\sim$ 1\arcsec~ resolution located between $\sim$ 2 and 6~kpc distance. Using ALMAGAL $\sim$ 1.3mm line and continuum data we estimate flow rates onto individual cores. We focus specifically on flow rates along filamentary structures associated with these cores. Our primary analysis is centered around position velocity cuts in H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$ - 2$_{0,2}$) which allow us to measure the velocity fields, surrounding these cores. Combining this work with column density estimates we derive the flow rates along the extended filamentary structures associated with cores in these regions. We select a sample of 100 ALMAGAL regions covering four evolutionary stages from quiescent to protostellar, Young Stellar Objects (YSOs), and \HII~regions (25 each). Using dendrogram and line analysis, we identify a final sample of 182 cores in 87 regions. In this paper, we present 728 flow rates for our sample (4 per core), analysed in the context of evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass. On average, for the whole sample, we derive flow rates on the order of $\sim$10$^{-4}$ M$_{sun}$yr$^{-1}$ with estimated uncertainties of $\pm$50\%. We see increasing differences in the values among evolutionary stages, most notably between the less evolved (quiescent/protostellar) and more evolved (YSO/\HII~region) sources. We also see an increasing trend as we move further away from the centre of these cores. We also find a clear relationship between the flow rates and core masses $\sim$M$^{2/3}$ which is in line with the result expected from the tidal-lobe accretion mechanism. Overall, we see increasing trends in the relationships between the flow rate and the three investigated parameters; evolutionary stage, distance from the core, and core mass.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Supersonic Stellar Wind: Parker's Theory Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the classical theory of stellar wind formation. The theory requires that to form a supersonic stellar wind, a subsonic flow speed must start at a specific initial speed from the coronal base, called eigenspeed, go along a continuous eigenfunction, and reach the sonic point, which is where the flow speed equals the sonic speed, while the critical condition, which is where the effective driving force is zero, is satisfied. Any mismatch between the sonic point and critical condition distances results in either subsonic winds when the initial speed is below the eigenspeed, or no stellar wind when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. However, because the critical condition is determined by the stellar wind temperature profile, which depends on ionization process at the top of the chromosphere and the heating process around the coronal base but not by the processes at the sonic point, the requirement of sonic point satisfying the critical condition is generally not met and hence the momentum equation in the conventional theory encounters difficulty when the initial speed is above the eigenspeed. To resolve the difficulty, we propose a discontinuity between the sonic point and the critical condition to reach supersonic stellar wind solutions. As a result, supersonic stellar winds can be produced when the initial speed in the coronal base is greater than the eigenspeed. The critical solution or eigen function provided by the conventional stellar wind model describes the condition that separates the supersonic stellar winds from subsonic ones.</description>

      <title>Why are (almost) all the protostellar outflows aligned in Serpens Main?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep 1.4-4.8 um JWST-NIRCam imaging of the Serpens Main star-forming region and identify 20 candidate protostellar outflows, most with bipolar structure and identified driving sources. The outflow position angles (PAs) are strongly correlated, and aligned within +/- 24 degrees of the major axis of the Serpens filament. These orientations are further aligned with the angular momentum vectors of the two disk shadows in this region. We estimate that the probability of this number of young stars being co-aligned if sampled from a uniform PA distribution is 10^-4. This in turn suggests that the aligned protostars, which seem to be at similar evolutionary stages based on their outflow dynamics, formed at similar times with a similar spin inherited from a local cloud filament. Further, there is tentative evidence for a systematic change in average position angle between the north-western and south-eastern cluster, as well as increased scatter in the PAs of the south-eastern protostars. SOFIA-HAWC+ archival dust polarization observations of Serpens Main at 154 and 214 um are perpendicular to the dominant jet orientation in NW region in particular. We measure and locate shock knots and edges for all of the outflows and provide an identifying catalog. We suggest that Serpens main is a cluster that formed from an isolated filament, and due to its youth retains its primordial outflow alignment.</description>

      <title>A 9-Month Hubble Space Telescope Near-UV Survey of M87. II. A Strongly Enhanced Nova Rate near the Jet of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The 135 classical novae that we have discovered in M87 with two $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ imaging surveys appear to be strongly concentrated along that galaxy's jet. Detailed simulations show that the likelihood that this distribution occurred by chance is of order $0.3\%$. The novae near the jet display outburst characteristics (peak luminosities, colors and decline rates) that are indistinguishable from novae far from the jet. We explore whether the remarkable nova distribution could be caused by the jet's irradiation of the hydrogen-rich donors in M87's cataclysmic binaries. This explanation, and others extant in the literature which rely on increased binary mass transfer rates, fail by orders of magnitude in explaining the enhanced nova rate near the jet. An alternate explanation is the presence of a genuine surplus of nova binary systems near the jet, perhaps due to jet-induced star formation. This explanation fails to explain the lack of nova enhancement along M87's counterjet. The enhanced rate of novae along M87's jet is now firmly established, and unexplained.</description>

      <title>The conceptual design of the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The submillimeter and millimeter ((sub-)mm) sky contains a vast wealth of information that is both complementary and inaccessible to other wavelengths. Over half the light we receive is observable at (sub-)mm wavelengths, yet we have mapped only a small portion of the sky at sufficient spatial resolution and sensitivity to detect and resolve distant galaxies or star forming cores within their their large-scale environment. For decades the astronomical community has highlighted the need for a large, high-throughput (sub-)mm ($\lambda\sim0.35-10$ mm) single dish; The Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), with its 50-m aperture and $2^\circ$ maximal field of view, aims to be such a facility. We present here the full design concept for AtLAST, developed through an EU-funded project. Our design approach begins with a long lineage of (sub-)mm telescopes, relies on calculations and simulations to realize the optics, and uses finite element analysis to optimize the mechanical structure and subsystems. The demanding design requirements for AtLAST, set by transformative science goals, combine novel concepts with lessons learned from past experience. The result is an innovative rocking chair design with six instrument bays, two of which are mounted on Nasmyth platforms. AtLAST will be capable of $3^\circ\,\rm s^{-1}$ scanning and $1^\circ\,\rm s^{-2}$ acceleration, and aims to feature a surface accuracy of $\leq 20~\mu$m half wavefront error under static deformations, allowing observations up to $\approx 950$~GHz. Crucially, AtLAST will be a sustainable, visionary facility that will allow upgrades for decades to come. While some aspects require further testing, prototyping, and field demonstrations, we estimate that the design will be construction-ready this decade.</description>

      <title>Formation of GW230529 from Isolated Binary Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this {\em{Letter}}, we explore the formation of the mass-gap black hole-neutron star (mgBHNS) merger detected in gravitational wave (GW) event, i.e., GW230529, from the isolated binary evolution channel, and study potential signatures of its electromagnetic counterparts. By adopting the `delayed' supernova prescription and reasonable model realizations, our population synthesis simulation results can simultaneously match the rate densities of mgBHNS and total BHNS mergers inferred from the population analyses, along with the population distribution of the BH mass in BHNS mergers reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Because GW230529 contributes significantly to the inferred mgBHNS rate densities, we suggest that GW230529 can be explained through the isolated binary evolution channel. Considering the AP4 (DD2) equation of state, the probability that GW230529 can make tidal disruption is $12.8\%$ ($63.2\%$). If GW230529 is a disrupted event, its kilonova peak apparent magnitude is predicted $\sim23-24\,{\rm{mag}}$, and hence, can be detected by the present survey projects and LSST. Since GW230529 could be an off-axis event inferred from the GW observation, its associated gamma-ray burst (GRB) might be too dim to be observed by $\gamma$-ray detectors, interpreting the lack of GRB observations. Our study suggests the existence of mgBHNS mergers formed through the isolated binary evolution channel due to the discovery of GW230529, indicating that BHNS mergers are still likely to be multimessenger sources that emit GWs, GRBs, and kilonovae. Although mgBHNS mergers account for $\sim50\%$ cosmological BHNS population, we find that $\gtrsim90\%$ disrupted BHNS mergers are expected to originate from mgBHNS mergers.</description>
