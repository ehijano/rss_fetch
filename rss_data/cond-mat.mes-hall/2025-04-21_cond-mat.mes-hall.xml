      <title>Response to recent comments on Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023) and Subsection S4.3 of the Supp. Info. for Nature 638, 651-655 (2025)</title>

Abstract: The topological gap protocol (TGP) is a statistical test designed to identify a topological phase with high confidence and without human bias. It is used to determine a promising parameter regime for operating topological qubits. The protocol's key metric is the probability of incorrectly identifying a trivial region as topological, referred to as the false discovery rate (FDR). Two recent manuscripts [arXiv:2502.19560, arXiv:2503.08944] engage with the topological gap protocol and its use in Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023) and Subsection S4.3 of the Supplementary Information for Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), although they do not explicitly dispute the main results of either one. We demonstrate that the objections in arXiv:2502.19560 and arXiv:2503.08944 are unfounded, and we uphold the conclusions of Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023) and Nature 638, 651-655 (2025). Specifically, we show that no flaws have been identified in our estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR). We provide a point-by-point rebuttal of the comments in arXiv:2502.19560 and arXiv:2503.08944.</description>

      <title>Torsional Hall Viscosity of Massive Chern Insulators: Magnetic Field and Momentum Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the non-dissipative, parity-odd spin transport of (2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic electrons, generated by torsion, and the torsional Hall viscosity $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$. We first determine $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ for massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a constant electromagnetic field. We predict that the magnetic field induces a contribution to $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ competing with the one originating from the Dirac mass. Moreover, we quantify the impact on $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ originating from the band structure deformation quadratic in momentum terms that was proposed by Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ). We find that the BHZ deformation enhances $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ in magnitude, but reverses its sign as compared to the standard massive Dirac fermion, indicating a Hall response in opposite direction to the typical Hall viscous force. Nevertheless, the torsional Hall viscosity still discriminates between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes. Our results, hence, pave the way for a deeper understanding of hydrodynamic spin transport and its possible verification in experiments.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of highly scaled AlScN ferroelectric diode memory with storage density &gt; 100 Mbit/mm$^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wurtzite nitride ferroelectric materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation memory applications due to their exceptional polarization properties and compatibility with conventional semiconductor processing techniques. Here, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) ferroelectric diode (FeDiode) memory down to 50 nm device diameters while maintaining functional performance. Using a 20 nm Al0.64Sc0.36N ferroelectric layer, we investigate both metal-insulator-ferroelectric-metal (MIFM) and metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) architectures to optimize device performance. Our scaled devices exhibit a previously unreported size-dependent behavior, where switching voltage decreases while breakdown field increases with miniaturization, resulting in an enhanced breakdown-to-coercive field ratio exceeding 2.6 for the smallest structures. This favorable scaling behavior enables reliable operation at reduced dimensions critical for high-density applications. The MIFM devices demonstrate stable 3-bit non-volatile multistate behavior with clearly distinguishable resistance states and retention exceeding $5\times 10^5$ seconds. This combination of scalability and simple structure enables an effective memory density of 100 Mbit/mm$^2$ under feature size of 50 nm. By achieving 50 nm scaling with enhanced performance metrics, this work establishes AlScN-based FeDiode memory as a highly promising platform for next-generation non-volatile storage with potential for direct integration into CMOS technology.</description>

      <title>Forster resonance energy transfer in inhomogeneous and absorptive environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical model for Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor and an acceptor placed in inhomogeneous and absorptive environment characterized by complex dielectric function, e.g., near a metal-dielectric structure. By extending the standard approach to FRET to include energy transfer (ET) channel to the environment, we show that, in the absence of plasmonic enhancement effects, the Forster radius, which defines the characteristic distance for efficient FRET, is reduced due to a competing ET process. We demonstrate that a reduction of the Forster radius can affect dramatically fluorescence from large ensemble of molecules whose emission kinetics is dominated by FRET-induced concentration quenching. Specifically, we perform numerical calculations for dye-doped polymer films deposited on top of metallic substrate to find that, for high dye concentrations, the emission kinetics slows down considerably, in sharp contrast to acceleration of single-molecule fluorescence. Furthermore, the calculated effective fluorescence decay rate exhibits non-monotonic behavior with varying film thickness, consistent with the experiment, indicating a non-trivial interplay between the metal quenching and concentration quenching mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Chiral Locking of Magnon Flow and Electron Spin Accumulation in Their Near-Field Radiative Spin Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a non-contact mechanism for directional injection of magnons in magnetic films when driven by a spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$ of electrons of a nearby metallic layer, governed by the long-range dipolar coupling between magnons and electron spins, which spontaneously generates a magnon current ${\bf J}_m$ flowing in the film plane. Crucially, in such near-field radiative spin transfer, the magnon flow ${\bf J}_m$ is always perpendicular to the spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$, showing a universal chiral locking relation. The spin injection is efficient even when $\pmb{\mu}_s$ is parallel to the magnetization, a feature breaking the limitation of the spin transfer by contact exchange interaction. Our findings reveal the critical role of dipolar chirality in driving the magnon thermal current and paving the way for the functional design of magnonic devices based on near-field radiative spin transfer.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic model to investigate current-induced light emission in single-molecule tunnel junctions, where a two-level system interacts with a plasmonic field. Using the quantum master equation, we explore the transition from weak to strong plasmon-molecule coupling, identifying three distinct regimes governed by cooperativity, which quantifies the interplay between interaction strength and losses. Our findings establish a framework to detect strong coupling, unveiling resonance-dependent features in the emission spectrum and photon correlations.</description>

      <title>Probing Majorana localization of a phase-controlled three-site Kitaev chain with an additional quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-site implementations of the Kitaev chain offer a minimal platform to study the emergence and stability of Majorana bound states. Here, we realize two- and three-site chains in semiconducting quantum dots coupled via superconductors, and tune them to the sweet spot where zero-energy Majorana modes appear at the chain ends. We demonstrate control of the superconducting phase through both magnetic field and sweet-spot selection, and fully characterize the excitation spectrum under local and global perturbations. All spectral features are identified using the ideal Kitaev chain model. To assess Majorana localization, we couple the system to an additional quantum dot. The absence of energy splitting at the sweet spot confirms the high quality of the Majorana modes, despite the minimal size of the chains.</description>

      <title>Isotropic and anisotropic spin-dependent transport in epitaxial Fe$_3$Si</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin-dependent transport phenomena in epitaxially grown Fe$_3$Si films, focusing on the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), planar Hall effect (PHE), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and spin Hall effect (SHE). While the sign and magnitude of the AMR and PHE depend on the current orientation relative to the crystallographic axes, the AHE and SHE remain nearly independent of the current orientation. The anisotropic AMR and PHE are attributed to current and magnetization dependent local band properties, including band crossing/anticrossing at specific $k$ points. In contrast, the isotropic AHE and SHE arise from the Berry curvature integrated over the entire Brillouin zone, which cancels local variations. These findings highlight the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and magnetization in the spin-dependent transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>The $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritiated graphene: combining nuclear quantum mechanics with Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale imaging and charge state manipulation of NV centers by scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are among the most promising solid-state qubit candidates, owing to their exceptionally long spin coherence times, efficient spin-photon coupling, room-temperature operation, and steadily advancing fabrication and integration techniques. Despite significant progress in the field, atomic-scale characterization and control of individual NV centers have remained elusive. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing a conductive graphene capping layer to enable direct imaging and manipulation of $NV^{-}$ defects via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By investigating over 40 individual $NV^{-}$ centers, we identify their spectroscopic signatures and spatial configurations. Our dI/dV conductance spectra reveal the ground state approximately 300 meV below the Fermi level. Additionally, density-of-states mapping uncovers a two-lobed wavefunction aligned along the [111] crystallographic direction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the charge state of the NV centers from $NV^{-}$ to $NV^{0}$ through STM tip-induced gating. This work represents a significant advancement in the atomic-scale understanding and engineering of NV centers, paving the way for future quantum device development.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{\"o}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.</description>

      <title>Extracting flow stress surfaces of pristine materials using deformation paths in MD simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate simulation of deformation processes at the atomic scale is critical for predicting the mechanical response of materials and particularly the calculation of directional flow stresses. This work presents a method for applying arbitrary deformation paths in LAMMPS while adhering to its convention that supercell periodic vectors a, b are aligned such that a coincides with the x-axis and b lies in the (x,y) plane. This method is particularly relevant for materials with low crystal symmetry and also for exploring non uniaxial deformations. The first step of the method consists in generating the simulation frame tensor's time evolution upon any deformation, which may initially violate LAMMPS alignment constraints. This constraint is then overcome by the application of a rigid body rotation to realign the tensor with LAMMPS's convention, ensuring valid periodic boundary conditions. The resulting lengths and tilt factors from the rotated tensor are expressed analytically using third-order polynomials and applied to the simulation cell using the fix deform command. The present approach versatility is validated with the calculation of directional flow stresses for various materials upon constant volume shear, tension and compression, demonstrating its effectiveness in simulations involving complex deformation scenarios and diverse crystal structures. The flow stress surface extracted from these simulations are finally analyzed as the fingerprint of all deformation mechanisms occurring in the material.</description>

      <title>Excitonic effects in phonons: reshaping the graphene Kohn anomalies and lifetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an ab initio framework that captures the impact of electron-electron and electron-hole interactions on phonon properties. This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} &lt; {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.</description>

      <title>Optical engineering and detection of magnetism in moir\'e semiconductors</title>

Abstract: We present a general framework for optically inducing, controlling, and probing spin states in moir\'e systems. In particular, we demonstrate that applying Raman optical drives to moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers can realize a class of spin models, with magnetic interactions tunable via the optical parameters. The resulting interaction anisotropy, controlled by the polarizations of the drives, enables access to magnetic states that are inaccessible in undriven moir\'e bilayers. Furthermore, we establish direct connections between the resulting spin correlations and experimentally observable optical signals. Our work paves the way for future studies on the optical control and detection on strongly correlated quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electron-phonon scattering in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals</title>

Abstract: Topological antiferromagnetic systems, which exhibit anisotropic band structures combined with complex relativistic spin structures in momentum space, have shown strong magnetoresistance effects driven by Dirac fermion characteristics. While these new antiferromagnets have been studied in transport experiments, very little is known about their spin-dependent electronic dynamics on ultrafast timescales and far-from-equilibrium behavior. This paper investigates theoretically the spin-dependent electronic dynamics due to electron-phonon scattering in a model electronic band structure that corresponds to a Dirac semimetal antiferromagnet. Following a spin conserving instantaneous excitation we obtain a change of the antiferromagnetic spin polarization due to the scattering dynamics for the site-resolved spin expectation values. This allows us to identify fingerprints of the anisotropic band structure in the carrier dynamics on ultrashort timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moir\'e transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moir\'e excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states without requiring subwavelength spatial resolution. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moir\'e excitons.</description>

      <title>Borophane as substrate for adsorption of He-4: A journey across dimensionality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In search of substrates for adsorption of He atoms allowing for novel quantum phases in restricted geometry we study the case of borophane. We focus on two allotropes of borophane, alpha-4H and Rect-2H. With a suitable Density Functional Theory we characterize the adsorption potential of a He atom on such crystalline substrates finding its corrugation, the preferential adsorption sites and the energy barrier between sites. Rect-2H borophane is particularly interesting due to thepresence of ridges in the adsorption potential with modest energy barriers in one direction of the basal plane and much higher barrier in the orthogonal direction, thus forming channels for motion of the adsorbed atoms. We study the adsorption of He-4 on Rect-2H borophane using Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations. In the first adsorbed layer the He-4 atoms are rather delocalized along a channel with no exchanges between channels. This strong anisotropy is present also in the first few additional adsorption layers of He-4 with presence of ordered and of disordered regions. In the second and the fifth layers at low temperature we find superfluidity on the length scale of the simulated systems. In the second layer the superfluidity is one-dimensional along the grooves. In the fifth layer the state is a strongly anisotropic two-dimensional superfluid at low coverage, with a crossover to an isotropic one at layer completion. Starting from the sixth layer the adsorbed He-4 film evolves toward a three-dimensional superfluid. Our main prediction is that Rect-2H borophane as a substrate will allow to probe 1D superfluidity in the second absorption layer, as well as the evolution from a 2D anisotropic superfluid to an isotropic one in the fifth layer, and eventually the onset of 3D superfluidity for higher coverages.</description>

      <title>Conductance properties of an $\alpha$-$T_3$ Corbino disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice in the form of a Corbino disk, characterized by inner and outer radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, threaded by a tunable magnetic flux. Through exact (analytic) solution of the stationary Dirac-Weyl equation, we compute the transmission probability of the carriers and hence obtain the conductance features for $0&lt;\alpha \leq 1$ ($\alpha$ denotes the strength of the hopping between the central atom and one of the other two) which allows ascertaining the role of the flat band, alongwith scrutinizing the transport features from graphene to a dice lattice. Our results reveal periodic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in the conductance, reminiscent of the utility of the Corbino disk as an electron pump. Further, these results are strongly influenced by parameters, such as, doping level, ratio of the inner and outer radii, magnetic flux, and $\alpha$. Additionally, complex quantum interference effect resulting in the possible emergence of higher harmonic modes and split-peak structures in the conductance, become prominent for smaller $\alpha$ values and larger ratios of the radii. We also find that, away from the charge-neutrality point (zero doping), the conductance oscillations are more pronounced and sensitive to the various parameters, with the corresponding behaviour largely governed via the evanescent wave transport. The Fano factor reveals distinct transport regimes, transitioning from Poissonian to pseudo-diffusive for $\alpha &lt; 1$, and from ballistic to pseudo-diffusive for $\alpha = 1$. This setup, thus serves as a fertile ground for studying the generation of quantum Hall current and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in a flat band system, alongwith demonstrating intricate appearance of higher harmonics in electron transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forces acting between an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tip and sample are three dimensional. Despite this, most AFM force measurements are confined to one or two dimensions. Extending AFM force measurements into three dimensions has previously required complex, difficult and time-consuming workflows. Here, we demonstrate an accurate, interferometric method for quantifying the full, three-dimensional response of an AFM tip to localized forces. We demonstrate this approach on a series of piezoelectric materials and show that this approach yields quantitative 3D measurement independent of the sample orientation beneath the tip. This approach simplifies existing, angle-resolved piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) techniques. Our measurements benefit from the greatly reduced noise floor (5 fm per root Hz) and intrinsic accuracy of our interferometric measurements. One important result is that the vertical piezo sensitivity was systematically 2 to 3 times larger than the in-plane piezo sensitivities. A simple analysis of vertical and lateral contact stiffnesses, due to the difference in the Young (vertical) and Shear (lateral) sample yields a factor of 2.5, in good agreement with the measurements. While this work was confined to ferroelectric materials, it provides a general workflow and framework for other AFM based mechanical measurements.</description>

      <title>Geometric transport signatures of strained multi-Weyl semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal coupling of strain to Dirac and Weyl semimetals, and its modeling as a pseudo-gauge field has been extensively studied, resulting in several proposed topological transport signatures. In this work, we study the effects of strain on higher winding number Weyl semimetals and show that strain is not a pseudo-gauge field for any winding number larger than one. We focus on the double-Weyl semimetal as an illustrative example to show that the application of strain splits the higher winding number Weyl nodes and produces an anisotropic Fermi surface. Specifically, the Fermi surface of the double-Weyl semimetal acquires nematic order. By extending chiral kinetic theory for such nematic fields, we determine the effective gauge fields acting on the system and show how strain induces anisotropy and affects the geometry of the semi-classical phase space of the double-Weyl semimetal. Further, the strain-induced deformation of the Weyl nodes results in transport signatures related to the covariant coupling of the strain tensor to the geometric tensor associated with the Weyl nodes giving rise to strain-dependent dissipative corrections to the longitudinal as well as the Hall conductance. Thus, by extension, we show that in multi-Weyl semimetals, strain produces geometric signatures rather than topological signatures. Further, we highlight that the most general way to view strain is as a symmetry-breaking field rather than a pseudo-gauge field.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic STI, which has no clean counterpart. Using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find an axion STI characterized by the average axion angle $\bar{\theta}=\pi$, protected by an average $C_4T$ symmetry with $(C_4T)^4=1$. While the exact $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, and hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$, we prove that the $\theta\!=\!\pi$ state cannot be realized in the clean limit if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$. Therefore, the axion STI lacks band insulator correspondence and is thus intrinsic. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and numerically explore its phase diagram, identifying an axion STI phase separated from both band insulators and trivial Anderson insulators by a metallic phase, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. We also argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions. Our work thus provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Spin-orbit Torques by Two-dimensional Multilayered MXenes for Future Nonvolatile Magnetic Memories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MXenes have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their two-dimensional (2D) layered structures with various functionalities similar to those of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. To open a new application field for MXenes in the realm of electronic devices, such as ultrahigh-integrated magnetic memory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structure comprising bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO using the magnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrated field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the bilayer structure, regardless of the charge current directions with respect to the mirror symmetry lines of Cr2N crystal. This is a specific characteristic for the 2D MXene-based SOT-devices, originating from an unconventional out-of-plane SOT. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the Cr2N thickness, the first-principles calculations predict an intrinsic orbital-Hall conductivity with the dominant out-of-plane component, comparing to the spin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N layer at the interface, induced by contact with the Co in the [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnetic layer. Therefore, the intrinsic bulk orbital Hall effect in MXene and the interfacial contribution such as spin-filtering-like effect owing to uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr are considered as possible major mechanisms for the unconventional out-of-plane SOT in the device, rather than a crystal symmetry and/or an interlayer exchange coupling.</description>

      <title>Strong shape-dependent intensity of inelastic light scattering by gold nanocrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical approach to calculate inelastic light scattering spectra from gold nanocrystals, based on the finite element method. This approach is validated by comparison with previous analytic calculations for spherically symmetric scatterers. Superellipsoid nanocrystals are considered in order to smoothly vary the shape from octahedra to cubes via spheres, while preserving cubic symmetry. Spectra are calculated and discussed taking into account the irreducible representation of the involved vibration modes. A strong increase in the inelastically scattered light intensity is observed for small variations of the shape around the sphere. This increase is related to variations of the electric field inside the nanocrystals, which are very small for small nanospheres but increase quickly for non-spherical nanocrystals. This strong dependence with shape must be taken into account when interpreting experimental spectra acquired from inhomogeneous ensembles of nanocrystals whose shape dispersion are usually neglected. The overall changes in the spectra when varying the shape of the nanocrystals provide additional insight into previously published results. Preliminary calculations for chiral shapes further show a significant difference between spectra obtained with right or left circularly polarized light.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict an additional thermal transport pathway across metal/non-metal interfaces with large electron-phonon non-equilibrium via evanescent radiative heat transfer. In such systems, electron scattering processes vary drastically and can be leveraged to guide heat across interfaces via radiative heat transport without engaging the lattice directly. We employ the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics to simulate the spectral radiative heat flux across the interface of a metal film and a non-metal substrate. We find that the radiative conductance can exceed 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ at an electron temperature of 5000 K for an emitting tungsten film on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, becoming comparable to its conductive counterpart. This allows for a more holistic approach to the heat flow across interfaces, accounting for electron-phonon non-equilibrium and ultrafast near-field phonon-polariton coupling.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we present results of our recent work of epitaxially-grown aluminum (epi-Al) on antimonide heterostructures, where the epi-Al thin film is grown at either room temperature or below zero $^o$C. A sharp superconducting transition at $T \sim 1.3$ K is observed in these epi-Al films. We further show that supercurrent states are realized in Josephson junctions fabricated in the epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures with mobility $\mu \sim 1.0 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs. These results clearly demonstrate we have achieved growing high-quality epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures, a promising platform for the exploration of Josephson junction effects for quantum information science and microelectronics applications.</description>

      <title>Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity: stability and attractors in slip rate driven processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.</description>
