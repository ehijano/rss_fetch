      <title>High-Resolution Observations of Pickup Ion Mediated Shocks to 60 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides a detailed analysis of fourteen distant interplanetary shocks observed by the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument onboard New Horizons. These shocks were observed with a pickup ion data cadence of approximately 30 minutes, covering a heliocentric distance range of ~52-60 au. All the shocks observed within this distance range are fast-forward shocks, and the shock compression ratios vary between ~1.2 and 1.9. The shock transition scales are generally narrow, and the SW density compressions are more pronounced compared to the previous study of seven shocks by McComas et al. (2022). A majority (64%) of these shocks have upstream sonic Mach numbers greater than one. In addition, all high-resolution measurements of distant interplanetary shocks analyzed here show that the shock transition scale is independent of the shock compression ratio. However, the shock transition scale is strongly anti-correlated with the shock speed in the upstream plasma frame, meaning that faster shocks generally yield sharper transitions.</description>

      <title>Ionization memory of plasma emiters in a solar prominence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. In the low-collisional, partially ionized plasma (PIP) of solar prominences, uncharged emitters might show different signatures of magnetic line broadening than charged emitters. We investigate if the widths of weak metall emissions in prominences exceed the thermal line broadening by a different amount for charged and for uncharged emitters.
  Methods. We simultaneously observe five optically thin, weak metall lines in the brightness center of a quiescent prominence and compare their observed widths with the thermal broadening.
  Results. The inferred non-thermal broadening of the metall lines does not indicate systematic differences between the uncharged Mg b2 and Na D1 and the charged Fe II emitters, only Sr II is broader.
  Conclusions. The additional line broadening of charged emitters is reasonably attributed to magnetic forces. That of uncharged emitters can then come from their temporary state as ion before recombination. Magnetically induced velocities will retain some time after recombination. Modelling partially ionized plasmas then requires consideration of a memory of previous ionization states.</description>
