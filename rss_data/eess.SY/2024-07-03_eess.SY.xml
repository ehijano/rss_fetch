      <title>Beyond Profit: A Multi-Objective Framework for Electric Vehicle Charging Station Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the pricing and scheduling strategies of the electric vehicle charging stations in response to the rising demand for cleaner transportation. Most of the existing methods focus on maximizing the energy efficiency or the charging station profit, however, the reputation of EVs is also a key factor for the long-term charging station operations. To address these gaps, we propose a novel framework for jointly optimizing pricing and continuous-multiple charging rates. Our approach aims to maximize both charging station profit and reputation, considering multi-objective optimization and continuous rate control within physical constraints. Introducing a pricing fluctuating penalty for reputation modeling and a linear programming-based safe layer for constraints, we confront the complexity of continuous charging rates' action space. To enhance convergence, we explore a soft action critic framework with novel entropy temperature tunning technique. The experiments conducted with real data demonstrate that the proposed method can provide extra 25.45\%-52.20\% average JPR than the representative baselines.</description>

      <title>Joint Design of Conventional Public Transport Network and Mobility on Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Public Transport (PT) is based on fixed lines, running with routes and schedules determined a-priori. In low-demand areas, conventional PT is inefficient. Therein, Mobility on Demand (MoD) could serve users more efficiently and with an improved quality of service (QoS). The idea of integrating MoD into PT is therefore abundantly discussed by researchers and practitioners, mainly in the form of adding MoD on top of PT. Efficiency can be instead gained if also conventional PT lines are redesigned after integrating MoD in the first or last mile. In this paper we focus on this re-design problem. We devise a bilevel optimization problem where, given a certain initial design, the upper level determines stop selection and frequency settings, while the lower level routes a fleet of MoD vehicles. We propose a solution method based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for the upper level, while we adopt Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) in the lower level. Our solution method is computationally efficient and we test it in simulations with up to 10k travel requests. Results show important operational cost savings obtained via appropriately reducing the conventional PT coverage after integrating MoD, while preserving QoS.</description>

      <title>Humidity-Aware Model Predictive Control for Residential Air Conditioning: A Field Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control of residential air conditioning could reduce energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining or improving occupants' thermal comfort. However, most approaches to predictive air conditioning control either do not model indoor humidity or treat it as constant. This simplification stems from challenges with modeling indoor humidity dynamics, particularly the high-order, nonlinear equations that govern heat and mass transfer between the air conditioner's evaporator coil and the indoor air. This paper develops a machine-learning approach to modeling indoor humidity dynamics that is suitable for real-world deployment at scale. This study then investigates the value of humidity modeling in four field tests of predictive control in an occupied house. The four field tests evaluate two different building models: One with constant humidity and one with time-varying humidity. Each modeling approach is tested in two different predictive controllers: One that focuses on reducing energy costs and one that focuses on constraining electric power during a demand response event. The two models lead to similar performance for reducing energy costs. Combining the results of this study and a prior heating study of the same house, the estimated year-round energy cost savings were $340-497 or 22-31% (95% confidence intervals); these savings were consistent across both humidity models. However, in the demand response tests, the simplifying assumption of constant humidity led to far more frequent and severe violations of the power constraint. These results suggest that accurate building models are important for nonlinear objectives, such as reducing or constraining peak demand, while for linear objectives such as reducing energy costs or emissions, model accuracy is less important.</description>

      <title>Generation Expansion Equilibria with Predictive Dispatch Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a methodology to solve generation expansion equilibrium problems by using a predictive model to represent the equilibrium in a simplified network constrained electricity market. The investment problem for each generation company (Genco) is a bi-level problem with the investment decision made in the upper level and market clearing condition in the lower level, which traditionally is represented as a Mathematical Program with Equilibrium Constraint (MPEC). The predictive model is trained for estimating the system-wide revenues for each technology type across energy, ancillary services and capacity markets given the amount of technology-specific installed capacity on the grid. The profit maximization investment problem for each Genco is solved using a global search algorithm, which uses the predictive model to evaluate the objective function. To solve for the strategic equilibrium, each Genco's problem is plugged into a diagonalization algorithm that is generally used in multi-leader, single-follower bi-level problems. The methodology presented here enables significant computational improvements while still capturing the desired market characteristics and dynamics of traditional equilibrium modeling approaches</description>

      <title>Predicting DC-Link Capacitor Current Ripple in AC-DC Rectifier Circuits Using Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT 3.5 turbo allow users to refine the model based on newer information, known as fine-tuning. This paper leverages this ability to analyze AC-DC converter behaviors, focusing on the ripple current in DC-link capacitors. Capacitors degrade faster under high ripple currents, complicating life monitoring and necessitating preemptive replacements. Using minimal invasive measurements from a full bridge rectifier and PFC-boost converter, we developed LLM-based models to predict ripple content in DC-link currents under noisy conditions. In this regard, based on simulations and experimental data from a full-bridge rectifier and a 1.5kW PFC, we have demonstrated the LLMs ability for near accurate prediction of capacitor ripple current estimation. This study highlights the LLMs potential in modeling nonlinear power electronic circuit behaviors and determining data requirements for precise circuit parameter predictions to predict component degradation and/or performance without any additional sensors. The final paper will have expanded results, capacitor ESR estimation based on fine tuned LLM output.</description>

      <title>Adaptive control of reaction-diffusion PDEs via neural operator-approximated gain kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural operator approximations of the gain kernels in PDE backstepping has emerged as a viable method for implementing controllers in real time. With such an approach, one approximates the gain kernel, which maps the plant coefficient into the solution of a PDE, with a neural operator. It is in adaptive control that the benefit of the neural operator is realized, as the kernel PDE solution needs to be computed online, for every updated estimate of the plant coefficient. We extend the neural operator methodology from adaptive control of a hyperbolic PDE to adaptive control of a benchmark parabolic PDE (a reaction-diffusion equation with a spatially-varying and unknown reaction coefficient). We prove global stability and asymptotic regulation of the plant state for a Lyapunov design of parameter adaptation. The key technical challenge of the result is handling the 2D nature of the gain kernels and proving that the target system with two distinct sources of perturbation terms, due to the parameter estimation error and due to the neural approximation error, is Lyapunov stable. To verify our theoretical result, we present simulations achieving calculation speedups up to 45x relative to the traditional finite difference solvers for every timestep in the simulation trajectory.</description>

      <title>Quantifying cascading power outages during climate extremes considering renewable energy integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate extremes, such as hurricanes, combined with large-scale integration of environment-sensitive renewables, could exacerbate the risk of widespread power outages. We introduce a coupled climate-energy model for cascading power outages, which comprehensively captures the impacts of evolving climate extremes on renewable generation, and transmission and distribution networks. The model is validated by the 2022 Puerto Rico catastrophic blackout during Hurricane Fiona, the first-ever system-wide blackout event with complete weather-induced outage records. The model presents a novel resilience pattern that was not captured by the present state-of-the-art models and reveals that early failure of certain critical components surprisingly enhances overall system resilience. Sensitivity analysis of various behind-the-meter solar integration scenarios demonstrates that lower integration levels (below 45%, including the current level) exhibit minimal impact on system resilience in this event. However, surpassing this critical level without additional flexibility resources can exacerbate the failure probability due to substantially enlarged energy imbalances.</description>

      <title>Toward Wireless System and Circuit Co-Design for the Internet of Self-Adaptive Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of a growing number of devices in Internet of Things (IoT) networks implies that uninterrupted and seamless adaptation of wireless communication parameters (e.g., carrier frequency, bandwidth and modulation) will become essential. To utilize wireless devices capable of switching several communication parameters requires real-time self-optimizations at the radio frequency integrated circuit (RFIC) level based on system level performance metrics during the processing of complex modulated signals. This article introduces a novel design verification approach for reconfigurable RFICs based on end-to-end wireless system-level performance metrics while operating in a dynamically changing communication environment. In contrast to prior work, this framework includes two modules that simulate a wireless channel and decode waveforms. These are connected to circuit-level modules that capture device- and circuit-level non-idealities of RFICs for design validation and optimization, such as transistor noises, intermodulation/harmonic distortions, and memory effects from parasitic capacitances. We demonstrate this framework with a receiver (RX) consisting of a reconfigurable complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) low-noise amplifier (LNA) designed at the transistor level, a behavioral model of a mixer, and an ideal filter model. The seamless integration between system-level wireless models with circuit-level and behavioral models (such as VerilogA-based models) for RFIC blocks enables to preemptively evaluate circuit and system designs, and to optimize for different communication scenarios with adaptive circuits having extensive tuning ranges. An exemplary case study is presented, in which simulation results reveal that the LNA power consumption can be reduced up to 16x depending on system-level requirements.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Subsynchronous Oscillation Suppression for Renewable Energy Integrated Power Systems Based on Koopman Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, subsynchronous oscillations (SSOs) have emerged frequently worldwide, with the high penetration of renewable power generation in modern power systems. The SSO introduced by renewables has become a prominent new stability problem, seriously threatening the stable operation of systems. This paper proposes a data-driven dynamic optimal controller for renewable energy integrated power systems, to suppress SSOs with the control of renewables. The challenges of the controller design are the nonlinearity, complexity and hard accessibility of the system models. Using Koopman operator, the system dynamics are accurately extracted from data and utilized to the linear model predictive control (MPC). Firstly, the globally linear representation of the system dynamics is obtained by lifting, and the key states are selected as control signals by analyzing Koopman participation factors. Subsequently, augmented with the control term, the Koopman linear parameter-varying predictor of the controlled system is constructed. Finally, using MPC, the proposed controller computes control signals online in a moving horizon fashion. Case studies show that the proposed controller is effective, adaptive and robust in various conditions, surpassing other controllers with reliable control performance.</description>

      <title>A Tax-Subsidy Scheme for Efficient Investment in Renewable Generation Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of energy production significantly affects system sustainability, which has enabled a shift towards renewable energy sources. Thus, producer behavior is crucial in electricity markets to achieve sustainability goals. In this paper, we address two key challenges comprising electricity markets and generation investment. Firstly, electricity markets typically are operated with competitive market clearing and merit-order dispatch, which neglects negative externalities from pollution. A Pigouvian tax is proposed in order to investigate the impacts of these externalities on electricity prices and resolve this issue. Secondly, renewable energy sources entail low operational costs, which result in lower system prices and reduced profits for producers. Furthermore, producers face high investment costs when moving into renewable energy resources, which leads to strategic investment decisions. In order to mitigate this strategic behavior, subsidies are proposed equal to producers' contribution to consumer surplus. These subsidies incentivize producers to decrease prices and increase consumer surplus, so, producers would be motivated to invest in socially optimal generation capacity. Finally, we demonstrate that implementing the proposed tax and subsidy does not increase the regulator's information burden.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a model reduction approach for simplifying the interconnection topology of Lur'e network systems. A class of reduced-order models are generated by the projection framework based on graph clustering, which not only preserve the network structure but also ensure absolute stability. Furthermore, we provide an upper bound on the input-output approximation error between the original and reduced-order Lur'e network systems, which is expressed as a function of the characteristic matrix of graph clustering. Finally, the results are illustrated via a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Diffusion for Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated their strong capabilities in generating high-fidelity samples from complex distributions through an iterative refinement process. Despite the empirical success of diffusion models in motion planning and control, the model-free nature of these methods does not leverage readily available model information and limits their generalization to new scenarios beyond the training data (e.g., new robots with different dynamics). In this work, we introduce Model-Based Diffusion (MBD), an optimization approach using the diffusion process to solve trajectory optimization (TO) problems without data. The key idea is to explicitly compute the score function by leveraging the model information in TO problems, which is why we refer to our approach as model-based diffusion. Moreover, although MBD does not require external data, it can be naturally integrated with data of diverse qualities to steer the diffusion process. We also reveal that MBD has interesting connections to sampling-based optimization. Empirical evaluations show that MBD outperforms state-of-the-art reinforcement learning and sampling-based TO methods in challenging contact-rich tasks. Additionally, MBD's ability to integrate with data enhances its versatility and practical applicability, even with imperfect and infeasible data (e.g., partial-state demonstrations for high-dimensional humanoids), beyond the scope of standard diffusion models.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid-Layered System for Image-Guided Navigation and Robot Assisted Spine Surgeries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the growing demand for precise and affordable solutions for Image-Guided Spine Surgery (IGSS), this paper presents a comprehensive development of a Robot-Assisted and Navigation-Guided IGSS System. The endeavor involves integrating cutting-edge technologies to attain the required surgical precision and limit user radiation exposure, thereby addressing the limitations of manual surgical methods. We propose an IGSS workflow and system architecture employing a hybrid-layered approach, combining modular and integrated system architectures in distinctive layers to develop an affordable system for seamless integration, scalability, and reconfigurability. We developed and integrated the system and extensively tested it on phantoms and cadavers. The proposed system's accuracy using navigation guidance is 1.02 0.34 mm, and robot assistance is 1.11 0.49 mm on phantoms. Observing a similar performance in cadaveric validation where 84% of screw placements were grade A, 10% were grade B using navigation guidance, 90% were grade A, and 10% were grade B using robot assistance as per the Gertzbein-Robbins scale, proving its efficacy for an IGSS. The evaluated performance is adequate for an IGSS and at par with the existing systems in literature and those commercially available. The user radiation is lower than in the literature, given that the system requires only an average of 3 C-Arm images per pedicle screw placement and verification.</description>

      <title>Refined Motion Compensation with Soft Laser Manipulators using Data-Driven Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-contact laser ablation, a precise thermal technique, simultaneously cuts and coagulates tissue without the insertion errors associated with rigid needles. Human organ motions, such as those in the liver, exhibit rhythmic components influenced by respiratory and cardiac cycles, making effective laser energy delivery to target lesions while compensating for tumor motion crucial. This research introduces a data-driven method to derive surrogate models of a soft manipulator. These low-dimensional models offer computational efficiency when integrated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, while still capturing the manipulator's dynamics with and without control input. Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) theory models the manipulator's autonomous dynamics, acknowledging its tendency to reach equilibrium when external forces are removed. Preliminary results show that the MPC controller using the surrogate model outperforms two other models within the same MPC framework. The data-driven MPC controller also supports a design-agnostic feature, allowing the interchangeability of different soft manipulators within the laser ablation surgery robot system.</description>

      <title>Passivity Tools for Hybrid Learning Rules in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has pioneered the use of system-theoretic passivity to study equilibrium stability for the dynamics of noncooperative strategic interactions in large populations of learning agents. In this and related works, the stability analysis leverages knowledge that certain ``canonical'' classes of learning rules used to model the agents' strategic behaviors satisfy a passivity condition known as $\delta$-passivity. In this paper, we consider that agents exhibit learning behaviors that do not align with a canonical class. Specifically, we focus on characterizing $\delta$-passivity for hybrid learning rules that combine elements from canonical classes. Our analysis also introduces and uses a more general version of $\delta$-passivity, which, for the first time, can handle discontinuous learning rules, including those showing best-response behaviors. We state and prove theorems establishing $\delta$-passivity for two broad convex cones of hybrid learning rules. These cones can merge into a larger one preserving $\delta$-passivity in scenarios limited to two strategies. In our proofs, we establish intermediate facts that are significant on their own and could potentially be used to further generalize our work. We illustrate the applicability of our results through numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Transport Map Coupling Filter for State-Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems are subjected to stochastic influences, such as random excitations, noise, and unmodeled behavior. Tracking the system's state and parameters based on a physical model is a common task for which filtering algorithms, such as Kalman filters and their non-linear extensions, are typically used. However, many of these filters use assumptions on the transition probabilities or the covariance model, which can lead to inaccuracies in non-linear systems. We will show the application of a stochastic coupling filter that can approximate arbitrary transition densities under non-Gaussian noise. The filter is based on transport maps, which couple the approximation densities to a user-chosen reference density, allowing for straightforward sampling and evaluation of probabilities.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Learning Models for Bionic Robots: Non-Linear Transfer Function Identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control and modeling of bionic robot dynamics have increasingly adopted model-free control strategies using machine learning methods. Given the non-linear elastic nature of bionic robotic systems, learning-based methods provide reliable alternatives by utilizing numerical data to establish a direct mapping from actuation inputs to robot trajectories without complex kinematics models. However, for developers, the method of identifying an appropriate learning model for their specific bionic robots and further constructing the transfer function has not been thoroughly discussed. Thus, this research trains four types of models, including ensemble learning models, regularization-based models, kernel-based models, and neural network models, suitable for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) data and non-linear transfer function identification, in order to evaluate their (1) accuracy, (2) computation complexity, and (3) performance of capturing biological movements. This research encompasses data collection methods for control inputs and action outputs, selection of machine learning models, comparative analysis of training results, and transfer function identifications. The main objective is to provide a comprehensive evaluation strategy and framework for the application of model-free control.</description>

      <title>Complex-Frequency Synchronization of Converter-Based Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13860v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study phase-amplitude multivariable dynamics in converter-based power systems from a complex-frequency perspective. Complex frequency represents the rate of change of voltage amplitude and phase angle by its real and imaginary parts, respectively. This emerging notion is of significance as it accommodates the multivariable characteristics of power networks where active and reactive power are inherently coupled with both voltage amplitude and phase. We propose the notion of complex-frequency synchronization to study the phase-amplitude multivariable stability issue in a power system with dispatchable virtual oscillator-controlled (dVOC) converters. To achieve this, we separate the system into linear fast dynamics and approximately linear slow dynamics. The linearity property makes it tractable to analyze fast complex-frequency synchronization and slower voltage stabilization. From the perspective of complex frequency and complex-frequency synchronization, we provide novel insights into the equivalence of dVOC and complex-power-frequency droop control, stability analysis methods, and stability criteria. Our study offers a practical solution to address challenging stability issues in converter-based power systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coordination of Multi-Microgrids in Active Distribution Networks for Provisioning Ancillary Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the phenomenal growth in renewable energy generation, the conventional synchronous generator-based power plants are gradually getting replaced by renewable energy sources-based microgrids. Such transition gives rise to the challenges of procuring various ancillary services from microgrids. We propose a distributed optimization framework that coordinates multiple microgrids in an active distribution network for provisioning passive voltage support-based ancillary services while satisfying operational constraints. Specifically, we exploit the reactive power support capability of the inverters and the flexibility offered by storage systems available with microgrids for provisioning ancillary service support to the transmission grid. We develop novel mixed-integer inequalities to represent the set of feasible active and reactive power exchange with the transmission grid that ensures passive voltage support. The proposed alternating direction method of multipliers-based algorithm is fully distributed, and does not require the presence of a centralized entity to achieve coordination among the microgrids. We present detailed numerical results on the IEEE 33-bus distribution test system to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and examine the scalability and convergence behavior of the distributed algorithm for different choice of hyperparameters and network sizes.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Kinematics-Based Sensor-Fault Detection for Autonomous Vehicles Using Single and Double Transport with Adaptive Numerical Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sensor-fault detection is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This paper introduces a novel kinematics-based approach for detecting and identifying faulty sensors, which is model-independent, rule-free, and applicable to ground and aerial vehicles. This method, called kinematics-based sensor fault detection (KSFD), relies on kinematic relations, sensor measurements, and real-time single and double numerical differentiation. Using onboard data from radar, rate gyros, magnetometers, and accelerometers, KSFD uniquely identifies a single faulty sensor in real time. To achieve this, adaptive input and state estimation (AISE) is used for real-time single and double numerical differentiation of the sensor data, and the single and double transport theorems are used to evaluate the consistency of data. Unlike model-based and knowledge-based methods, KSFD relies solely on sensor signals, kinematic relations, and AISE for real-time numerical differentiation. For ground vehicles, KSFD requires six kinematics-based error metrics, whereas, for aerial vehicles, nine error metrics are used. Simulated and experimental examples are provided to evaluate the effectiveness of KSFD.</description>

      <title>Unifying Safety Approaches for Stochastic Systems: From Barrier Functions to Uncertain Abstractions via Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Providing safety guarantees for stochastic dynamical systems has become a central problem in many fields, including control theory, machine learning, and robotics. Existing methods either employ Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) or rely on numerical approaches based on abstractions. While SBFs are analogous to Lyapunov functions to prove (probabilistic) set invariance, abstraction-based approaches approximate the stochastic system into a finite model for the computation of safety probability bounds. In this paper, we offer a new perspective on these seemingly different methods. We show that both these approaches arise as approximations of a stochastic dynamic programming problem. Such a new and unifying perspective allows us to formally show the correctness of both approaches, characterize their convergence and optimality properties, and examine advantages and disadvantages of each. Our analysis reveals that abstraction-based methods can provide more accurate certificates of safety, but generally at a higher computational cost. We conclude the article with a discussion that highlights possible future directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-objective control framework for linear time-invariant systems in which performance and robustness can be achieved in a complementary way instead of trade-off. In particular, a state-space solution is first established for a new stabilizing control structure consisting of two independently designed controllers coordinated with a Youla-type operator ${\bm Q}$. It is then shown by performance analysis that these two independently designed controllers operate in a naturally complementary way for a tracking control system, due to the coordination function of ${\bm Q}$ driven by the residual signal of a Luenberger observer. Moreover, it is pointed out that ${\bm Q}$ could be further optimized with an additional gain factor to achieve improved performance, through a data-driven methodology for a measured cost function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the transient stability of a state-of-the-art grid-forming complex-droop control (i.e., dispatchable virtual oscillator control, dVOC) under current saturation. We quantify the saturation level of a converter by introducing the concept of degree of saturation (DoS), and we propose a provably stable current-limiting control with saturation-informed feedback, which feeds the degree of saturation back to the inner voltage-control loop and the outer grid-forming loop. As a result, although the output current is saturated, the voltage phase angle can still be generated from an internal virtual voltage-source node that is governed by an equivalent complex-droop control. We prove that the proposed control achieves transient stability during current saturation under grid faults. We also provide parametric stability conditions for multi-converter systems under grid-connected and islanded scenarios. The stability performance of the current-limiting control is validated with various case studies.</description>

      <title>Practical Power System Inertia Monitoring Based on Pumped Storage Hydropower Operation Signature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a practical method to monitor power system inertia using Pumped Storage Hydropower (PSH) switching-off events. This approach offers real-time system-level inertia estimation with minimal expenses, no disruption, and the inclusion of behind-the-meter inertia. First, accurate inertia estimation is achieved through improved RoCoF calculation that accounts for pre-event RoCoF, reducing common random frequency fluctuations in practice. Second, PSH field data is analyzed, highlighting the benefits of using switching-off events for grid inertia estimation. Third, an event detection trigger is designed to capture pump switching-off events based on local and system features. Fourth, the method is validated on the U.S. Eastern Interconnection model with over 60,000 buses, demonstrating very high accuracy (3%-5% error rate). Finally, it is applied to the U.S. Western Interconnection, with field validation showing a 9.9% average absolute error rate. Despite challenges in practical power system inertia estimation, this method enhances decision-making for power grid reliability and efficiency, addressing challenges posed by renewable energy integration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on our previous work, this paper investigates the effectiveness of interpolating control (IC) for real-time trajectory tracking. Unlike prior studies that focused on trajectory tracking itself or UAV stabilization control in simulation, we evaluate the performance of a modified extended IC (eIC) controller compared to Model Predictive Control (MPC) through both simulated and laboratory experiments with a remotely controlled UAV.
  The evaluation focuses on the computational efficiency and control quality of real-time UAV trajectory tracking compared to previous IC applications. The results demonstrate that the eIC controller achieves competitive performance compared to MPC while significantly reducing computational complexity, making it a promising alternative for resource-constrained platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.15775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most modern reinforcement learning algorithms optimize a cumulative single-step cost along a trajectory. The optimized motions are often 'unnatural', representing, for example, behaviors with sudden accelerations that waste energy and lack predictability. In this work, we present a novel paradigm of controlling nonlinear systems via the minimization of the Koopman spectrum cost: a cost over the Koopman operator of the controlled dynamics. This induces a broader class of dynamical behaviors that evolve over stable manifolds such as nonlinear oscillators, closed loops, and smooth movements. We demonstrate that some dynamics characterizations that are not possible with a cumulative cost are feasible in this paradigm, which generalizes the classical eigenstructure and pole assignments to nonlinear decision making. Moreover, we present a sample efficient online learning algorithm for our problem that enjoys a sub-linear regret bound under some structural assumptions.</description>

Abstract: A linear vector equation in two unknown vectors is examined in the framework of tropical algebra dealing with the theory and applications of semirings and semifields with idempotent addition. We consider a two-sided equation where each side is a tropical product of a given matrix by one of the unknown vectors. We use a matrix sparsification technique to reduce the equation to a set of vector inequalities that involve row-monomial matrices obtained from the given matrices. An existence condition of solutions for the inequalities is established, and a direct representation of the solutions is derived in a compact vector form. To illustrate the proposed approach and to compare the obtained result with that of an existing solution procedure, we apply our solution technique to handle two-sided equations known in the literature. Finally, a computational scheme based on the approach to derive all solutions of the two-sided equation is discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometrically Modulable Gait Design for Quadrupeds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Miniature-legged robots are constrained by their onboard computation and control, thus motivating the need for simple, first-principles-based geometric models that connect \emph{periodic actuation or gaits} (a universal robot control paradigm) to the induced average locomotion. In this paper, we develop a \emph{modulable two-beat gait design framework} for sprawled planar quadrupedal systems under the no-slip using tools from geometric mechanics. We reduce standard two-beat gaits into unique subgaits in mutually exclusive shape subspaces. Subgaits are characterized by a locomotive stance phase when limbs are in ground contact and a non-locomotive, instantaneous swing phase where the limbs are reset without contact. During the stance phase, the contacting limbs form a four-bar mechanism. To analyze the ensuing locomotion, we develop the following tools: (a) a vector field to generate nonslip actuation, (b) the kinematics of a four-bar mechanism as a local connection, and (c) stratified panels that combine the kinematics and constrained actuation to encode the net change in the system's position generated by a stance-swing subgait cycle. Decoupled subgaits are then designed independently using flows on the shape-change basis and are combined with appropriate phasing to produce a two-beat gait. Further, we introduce ``scaling" and ``sliding" control inputs to continuously modulate the global trajectories of the quadrupedal system in gait time through which we demonstrate cycle-average speed, direction, and steering control using the control inputs. Thus, this framework has the potential to create uncomplicated open-loop gait plans or gain schedules for robots with limited resources, bringing them closer to achieving autonomous control.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with event-triggered parameterized control (ETPC) of nonlinear systems with external disturbances. In this control method, between two successive events, each control input to the plant is a linear combination of a set of linearly independent scalar functions. At each event, the controller updates the coefficients of the parameterized control input so as to minimize the error in approximating a continuous time control signal and communicates the same to the actuator. We design an event-triggering rule (ETR) that guarantees global uniform ultimate boundedness of trajectories of the closed loop system. We also ensure the absence of Zeno behavior by showing the existence of a uniform positive lower bound on the inter-event times (IETs). We illustrate our results through numerical examples.</description>
