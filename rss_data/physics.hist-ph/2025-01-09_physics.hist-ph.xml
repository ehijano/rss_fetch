      <title>External quantum fluctuations select measurement contexts</title>

Abstract: Quantum paradoxes show that the outcomes of different quantum measurements cannot be described by a single measurement-independent reality. Any theoretical description of a quantum measurement implies the selection of a specific measurement context. Here, we investigate generalised quantum measurements, in order to identify the mechanism by which this specific context is selected. We show that external quantum fluctuations, represented by the initial state of the measurement apparatus, play an essential role in the selection of the context. This has the non-trivial consequence that, when considering measurements other than just idealised projection-valued measures, different outcomes of a single measurement setup can represent different measurement contexts. We further show this result underpins recent claims that contextuality can occur in scenarios without measurement incompatibility.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Quantum Mechanics: The Birth and Evolution of the Many-Worlds Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06924</link>

Abstract: The Many-worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics has captivated physicists and philosophers alike since its inception in the mid-20th century. This paper explores the historical roots, evolution, and implications of the MWI within the context of quantum theory. Beginning with an overview of early developments in quantum mechanics and the emergence of foundational interpretations, we delve into the origins of the MWI through the groundbreaking work of physicist Hugh Everett III. Everett's doctoral thesis proposed a radical solution to the measurement problem, positing the existence of multiple branching universes to account for quantum phenomenon. We trace the evolution of the MWI, examining its refinement and elaboration by subsequent physicists such as John Wheeler. Furthermore, we discuss the MWI's impact on contemporary physics, including its connections to quantum information theory and ongoing experimental tests. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the MWI's historical development and current relevance, this paper offers insights into one of the most provocative interpretations of quantum mechanics and its implications for our understanding of the universe.</description>
