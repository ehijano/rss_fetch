      <title>Modeling Transmission Dynamics of Tuberculosis: Parameter Estimation and Sensitivity Analysis Using Real-World Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) continues to pose a major public health challenge, particularly in high-burden regions such as Ethiopia, necessitating a more profound understanding of its transmission dynamics. In this study, we developed an SVEITRS compartmental model to investigate the transmission dynamics of TBs, utilizing real data from Ethiopia from 2011-2021. Model parameters were estimated via two methods: nonlinear least squares and maximum likelihood, with maximum likelihood providing more accurate and reliable results, as confirmed by a test case. The model's stability analysis indicated that there is a disease-free equilibrium in areas where the basic reproduction number ($\mathscr{R}_0$) is less than one. The results suggest that optimal conditions could lead to the elimination of TB. On the other hand, there is an endemic equilibrium in areas where $\mathscr{R}_0$ is greater than one, which means that the disease is still present. Sensitivity analysis revealed important factors affecting TB levels: higher natural death rates, vaccination rates, treatment rates, and disease-related death rates lower TB cases, whereas higher recruitment rates, contact rates, infection rates, and loss of vaccine protection increase its spread. These findings highlights to the necessity of enhancing vaccination, treatment, and recovery strategies while addressing drivers of transmission to achieve TB control in Ethiopia. This study provides useful advice for guiding TB control efforts and public health interventions in Ethiopia and similar regions.</description>

      <title>Interconnection between density-regulation and stability in competitive ecological network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.03193v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In natural ecosystems, species can be characterized by the nonlinear density-dependent self-regulation of their growth profile. Species of many taxa show a substantial density-dependent reduction for low population size. Nevertheless, many show the opposite trend; density regulation is minimal for small populations and increases significantly when the population size is near the carrying capacity. The theta-logistic growth equation can portray the intraspecific density regulation in the growth profile, theta being the density regulation parameter. In this study, we examine the role of these different growth profiles on the stability of a competitive ecological community with the help of a mathematical model of competitive species interactions. This manuscript deals with the random matrix theory to understand the stability of the classical theta-logistic models of competitive interactions. Our results suggest that having more species with strong density dependence, which self-regulate at low densities, leads to more stable communities. With this, stability also depends on the complexity of the ecological network. Species network connectance (link density) shows a consistent trend of increasing stability, whereas community size (species richness) shows a context-dependent effect. We also interpret our results from the aspect of two different life history strategies: r and K-selection. Our results show that the stability of a competitive network increases with the fraction of r-selected species in the community. Our result is robust, irrespective of different network architectures.</description>
