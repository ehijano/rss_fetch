      <title>Complete Sampling of the $uv$ Plane with Realistic Radio Arrays: Introducing the RULES Algorithm, with Application to 21 cm Foreground Wedge Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Radio-array $uv$ Layout Engineering Strategy (RULES), an algorithm for designing radio arrays that achieve complete coverage of the $uv$ plane, defined as, at minimum, regular sampling at half the observing wavelength ($\lambda$) along the $u$ and $v$ axes within a specified range of baseline lengths. Using RULES, we generate $uv$-complete layouts that cover the range $10\lambda\leq|(u,v)|\leq 100\lambda$ with fewer than 1000 antennas of diameter $5\lambda$, comparable to current and planned arrays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such arrays for mitigating contamination from bright astrophysical foregrounds in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization observations,particularly in the region of Fourier space known as the foreground wedge,by simulating visibilities of foreground-like sky models over the 130-150 MHz band and processing them through an image-based power spectrum estimator. We find that with complete $uv$ coverage, the wedge power is suppressed by sixteen orders of magnitude compared to an array with a compact hexagonal layout (used as a reference for a sparse $uv$ coverage). In contrast, we show that an array with the same number of antennas but in a random configuration only suppresses the wedge by three orders of magnitude, despite sampling more distinct $uv$ points over the same range. We address real-world challenges and find that our results are sensitive to small antenna position errors and missing baselines, while still performing equally or significantly better than random arrays in any case. We propose ways to mitigate those challenges such as a minimum redundancy requirement or tighter $uv$ packing density.</description>

      <title>Cold and fuzzy dark sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Fuzzy Dark Sector (FDS) scenario as a rich, interacting system and candidate for dark matter. This serves as a natural extension of the single-component, non-interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) paradigm. Concretely, we consider an ultra-light Abelian-Higgs model, with interacting Higgs and dark photon degrees of freedom. We find that the transfer function, and hence imprint on the CMB and Large-Scale Structure (LSS), is characterized by a single characteristic scale of the interacting fuzzy dark sector, allowing us to recover the LSS signature of single-field FDM, dependent on the FDS parameters. In contrast, galactic halos present a great diversity, unlike with the universality of single-field FDM, owing to the interaction between fields. This interaction introduces an instability that is not otherwise present for the case of four decoupled scalars. Finally, we comment on primordial production and portals to the Standard Model, and introduce another simple realization of the Fuzzy Dark Sector paradigm with a kinetic coupling.</description>

      <title>DESI DR1 Ly$\alpha$ forest: 3D full-shape analysis and cosmological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an analysis of the full shapes of Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) forest correlation functions measured from the first data release (DR1) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Our analysis focuses on measuring the Alcock-Paczynski (AP) effect and the cosmic growth rate times the amplitude of matter fluctuations in spheres of $8$ $h^{-1}\text{Mpc}$, $f\sigma_8$. We validate our measurements using two different sets of mocks, a series of data splits, and a large set of analysis variations, which were first performed blinded. Our analysis constrains the ratio $D_M/D_H(z_\mathrm{eff})=4.525\pm0.071$, where $D_H=c/H(z)$ is the Hubble distance, $D_M$ is the transverse comoving distance, and the effective redshift is $z_\mathrm{eff}=2.33$. This is a factor of $2.4$ tighter than the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) constraint from the same data. When combining with Ly$\alpha$ BAO constraints from DESI DR2, we obtain the ratios $D_H(z_\mathrm{eff})/r_d=8.646\pm0.077$ and $D_M(z_\mathrm{eff})/r_d=38.90\pm0.38$, where $r_d$ is the sound horizon at the drag epoch. We also measure $f\sigma_8(z_\mathrm{eff}) = 0.37\; ^{+0.055}_{-0.065} \,(\mathrm{stat})\, \pm 0.033 \,(\mathrm{sys})$, but we do not use it for cosmological inference due to difficulties in its validation with mocks. In $\Lambda$CDM, our measurements are consistent with both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and galaxy clustering constraints. Using a nucleosynthesis prior but no CMB anisotropy information, we measure the Hubble constant to be $H_0 = 68.3\pm 1.6\;\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ within $\Lambda$CDM. Finally, we show that Ly$\alpha$ forest AP measurements can help improve constraints on the dark energy equation of state, and are expected to play an important role in upcoming DESI analyses.</description>

      <title>Quintessential inflation studied through Semiclassical Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we solved the scalar and tensor perturbation equations numerically and using the improved uniform approximation method together with the third-order phase-integral method, for the $\alpha$-attractor inflationary model. This inflationary model has become very important because it allows us to describe the initial accelerated expansion of the universe in the inflationary epoch, and the current accelerated expansion with the same potential that depends on one scalar field $\varphi$. Once the equations for the scalar and tensor power spectra are found, we calculate the observables: the scalar-to-tensor ratio $r$, and the scalar spectral index $n_S$, concluding that semiclassical methods give excellent results compared to numerical integration. We also compare both observables in the $\alpha$-attractor and the Starobinsky inflationary model.</description>

      <title>CosmoGen: a cosmological model generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of the physical Universe suffers from well-known conceptual problems and is challenged by observational data. Alternative models exist in the literature, both phenomenological and physically motivated, many of them suffering from similar or new problems. We propose a method to mechanically generate alternative models in a procedure informed by data and tuned to mitigate specific problems. We implement a computational framework, dubbed CosmoGen, that integrates evolutionary algorithms for symbolic regression, with computation of structure formation and background cosmological quantities that are used to guide the evolutionary process. As a proof-of-concept we apply the procedure to the specific case of dark energy fluid models, and ask the framework to generate models capable of alleviating the cosmological tensions $S_8$ and $H_0$. The system generates models with high fitness values, and through a Bayesian analysis of an illustrative model, we show that the model indeed alleviates the tensions.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate Gaia-unWISE quasar mock catalogs from LPT and Eulerian bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present $100$ full-sky quasar spectrophotometric mock catalogs with smooth redshift evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim 4$, tailored to analyze the Gaia-unWISE Quasar Catalog (Quaia). In particular, we apply a novel hierarchical nonlocal nonlinear bias scheme (Hicobian) to dark matter fields generated through Augmented Lagrangian Perturbation Theory on the lightcone (WebON code), calibrating the free parameters of the bias model on Abacus quasar HOD mock catalogs tuned to reproduce DESI Early Data Release observations in real and redshift space. After having obtained such accurate spectroscopic catalogs, we inject in the mocks the observational effects characterizing the Quaia catalog: (i) spectrophotometric redshift uncertainties, (ii) the angular selection function, and (iii) the redshift number counts distribution. We assess the accuracy of our catalogs by validating a number of summary statistics: the full-sky QSO maps, the redshift uncertainty distributions as a function of redshift, the redshift $n(z)$ distribution, the angular power spectra and their normalized covariance matrices, and the angular two-point correlation functions. We find excellent agreement between these metrics from the mocks and from the Quaia catalog. We publicly release the mock catalogs to the community.</description>

      <title>The 21cm-galaxy cross-correlation: Realistic forecast for 21cm signal detection and reionisation constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 21cm-galaxy cross-correlation will play a key role in confirming the cosmological 21cm signal. We investigate which survey configurations detect the 21cm-LAE cross-correlation signal, and assess its ability to distinguish reionisation scenarios. Our pipeline computes observational uncertainties for the 21cm-galaxy cross-power spectrum, accounting for key survey parameters: the field of view (FoV), limiting luminosity of galaxy surveys $L_\alpha$, redshift uncertainty $\sigma_z$, and 21cm foreground wedge assumptions. We calculate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the 21cm-Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter (LAE) cross-power spectrum for two scenarios: one where reionisation is driven by faint or by bright galaxies. We find: (i) SNR increases with larger FoV, fainter $L_\alpha$, and smaller $\sigma_z$, with the FoV having the strongest impact when $\sigma_z$ is small. (ii) Under a moderate foreground wedge, photometric-like surveys yield insufficient SNR, and medium-deep ($L_\alpha\gtrsim10^{42.5}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV&gt;20deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys are needed. (iii) Under an optimistic foreground wedge, detection is possible with deep ($L_\alpha\gtrsim10^{42.3}$erg s$^{-1}$), wide-area (FoV$\gtrsim80$deg$^2$) photometric-like or shallower, small-area (FoV$\simeq2-3$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys. (iv) To distinguish the two reionisation scenarios at z=7, moderate foreground wedge scenarios require deep-wide spectroscopic surveys; under an optimistic foreground wedge, shallower, medium-area (FoV$\simeq10$deg$^2$) slitless spectroscopic surveys suffice. (v) Maximising the SNR for detection and model discrimination requires sampling the large-scale peak of the cross-power spectrum, which shifts to larger physical scales as reionisation proceeds and the less ionisation fronts follow the gas density - making surveys at z&gt;7 more promising despite lower galaxy number densities.</description>

      <title>Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the flat-spacetime limit. The latter expansion reveals that the flat-spacetime approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Lensed stars in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing -- a JWST prediction for the Cosmic Horseshoe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore for the first time the possibility of detecting lensed star transients in galaxy-galaxy strong lensing systems upon repeated, deep imaging using the {\it James-Webb Space Telescope} ({\it JWST}). Our calculation predicts that the extremely high recent star formation rate of $\sim 100\,M_{\odot}\textrm{yr}^{-1}$ over the last 50 Myr (not accounting for image multiplicity) in the ``Cosmic Horseshoe'' lensed system ($z = 2.381$) generates many young, bright stars, of which their large abundance is expected to lead to a detection rate of $\sim 60$ transients per pointing in {\it JWST} observations with a $5\sigma$ limiting magnitude of $\sim 29\,m_{AB}$. With the high expected detection rate and little room for uncertainty for the lens model compared with cluster lenses, our result suggests that the Cosmic Horseshoe could be an excellent tool to test the nature of Dark Matter based on the spatial distribution of transients, and can be used to constrain axion mass if Dark Matter is constituted of ultra-light axions. We also argue that the large distance modulus of $\sim46.5\,$mag at $z \approx 2.4$ can act as a filter to screen out less massive stars as transients and allow one to better constrain the high-mass end of the stellar initial mass function based on the transient detection rate. Follow-up {\it JWST} observations of the Cosmic Horseshoe with would allow one to better probe the nature of Dark Matter and the star formation properties, such as the initial mass function at the cosmic noon, via lensed star transients.</description>

      <title>Unified dark fluid with null sound speed as an alternative to phantom dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent BAO measurements from DESI, when combined with CMB and supernovae data, suggest evolving dark energy and in particular point to a possible phantom regime, with an equation of state parameter $w&lt;-1$.
  We explore an alternative phenomenological way to model dark matter and dark energy based on a unified dark fluid (UDF). By construction, our model reproduces the same background expansion history as DESI's best-fit using the CPL parametrization, but assumes a vanishing rest-frame sound speed and no anisotropic stress. This simple prescription ensures a consistent and physical treatment of perturbations, and the use of a unified dark sector avoids phantom behaviour by construction. We model CMB, LSS, and redshift-space distortion observables, and find differences with CPL that are typically at the few-percent level. As a result, we forecast that even stage IV CMB and galaxy surveys will have limited power to discriminate between our UDF and CPL at the linear level. At the non-linear level, we study spherical collapse in the UDF and show that within this framework, structure formation proceeds very similarly to standard scenarios.
  Using Planck, DESI BAO DR2, and DESY5 supernovae data, we demonstrate that this simple UDF model fits current observations nearly as well as CPL, while treating perturbations consistently. Because most cosmological observations are not sensitive to how the dark sector is split, the unified framework can also approximate the phenomenology of interacting dark energy-dark matter scenarios or evolving dark matter, making it a general way to model the data, at least as long as the dark components have a vanishing sound speed, which is the most distinctive feature of our analysis. This highlights that a unified dark fluid with evolving equation of state and null sound speed is sufficient to pass current constraints without a phantom component.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Footprints of Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel cosmographic framework to trace the late-time kinematics of the Universe without assuming any underlying dynamics. The method relies on generalized Pad\'e-$(2,1)$ expansions around arbitrary pivot redshifts, which, compared to state-of-the-art calculations, reduce truncation errors by up to two orders of magnitude at high redshift and yield more precise constraints by defining cosmographic parameters exactly where the data lie. This avoids extrapolations, mitigates degeneracies, and enables a clean disentangling of their effects. Using the latest low-redshift datasets, we center the generalized expansion in multiple bins across $z\in[0,1]$ and obtain precise constraints on the redshift evolution of cosmographic parameters. We find that all key parameters deviate from their $\Lambda$CDM predictions in a redshift-dependent way that can be naturally explained within dynamical Dark Energy scenarios. The deceleration parameter $q(z)$ follows a redshift evolution consistent with the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization, while the generalized $Om(z)$ diagnostic shows deviations of up to $\sim4\sigma$ from the constant $\Lambda$CDM expectation, closely matching the CPL predictions. Taken together, these results point to footprints of dynamical Dark Energy in the kinematics of the Universe at $z\lesssim 1$.</description>

      <title>Sound-Horizon-Agnostic Inference of the Hubble Constant and Neutrino Mass from BAO, CMB Lensing, and Galaxy Weak Lensing and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sound-horizon-agnostic determination of the Hubble constant, $H_0$, by combining DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data with the latest cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing measurements from Planck, ACT, and SPT-3G, the angular size of the CMB acoustic scale, Dark Energy Survey Year-3 ($3\times2$-pt) galaxy weak lensing and clustering correlations, and the Pantheon+ supernova sample. In this analysis, the sound horizon at the drag epoch, $r_d$, is treated as a free parameter, avoiding assumptions about early-Universe physics. By combining uncalibrated comoving distances from BAO and supernovae with constraints on the matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ from CMB and galaxy lensing/clustering, we break the $r_d$-$H_0$ degeneracy and obtain $H_0 = 70.0 \pm 1.7$ km/s/Mpc when the sum of the neutrino masses is fixed at $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.06$ eV. With a conservative prior on the amplitude of primordial fluctuations, $A_s$, we find $H_0 = 70.03 \pm 0.97$ km/s/Mpc and $r_d = 144.8 \pm 1.6$ Mpc. Allowing $\Sigma m_\nu$ to vary yields $H_0 = 75.3^{+3.3}_{-4.0}$ km/s/Mpc and $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.55^{+0.23}_{-0.37}$ ($&lt;1.11$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL, and $H_0 = 73.9 \pm 2.2$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu = 0.46^{+0.21}_{-0.25}$ ($=0.46^{+0.40}_{-0.45}$ eV) at 68% (95%) CL when a prior on $A_s$ is applied. Forecasts for the completed DESI BAO program, combined with Simons-Observatory-like CMB lensing, next-generation $3\times2$-pt data, and expanded supernova samples predict $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 0.67$ km/s/Mpc with fixed $\Sigma m_\nu$, and $\sigma(H_0) \simeq 1.1$ km/s/Mpc with $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 0.133$ ($&lt;0.263$) eV at 68% (95%) CL when the neutrino mass is varied. As the precision of BAO, CMB lensing, and galaxy lensing/clustering improve, this $r_d$-agnostic framework will provide an independent test of the need for new physics at recombination.</description>

      <title>Search for cosmic-ray induced gamma-ray emission from local galaxy clusters using Fermi-LAT data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters are the most massive gravitationally bound structures in the Universe. Even if clusters are nearly virialized structures, they undergo merging processes, creating merging shocks, and suffer from feedback from galaxies and Active Galactic Nuclei; causing complex turbulent motions and amplifying their magnetic fields. These processes act as acceleration mechanisms for the plasma of the intracluster medium (ICM), originating a population of cosmic rays (CRs). Leptonic CRs have long been detected, but we should also expect a CR hadronic population that, through interactions with the ICM, should produce neutral pions that decay into gamma-rays. The detection of diffuse gamma-ray emission from galaxy clusters is one of the long-awaited milestones for the high-energy astroparticle physics community. Still, no unambiguous detection has yet been obtained. In this talk, we will present the results of a combined cluster analysis searching for CR-induced gamma-ray signals, using 16 years of Fermi-LAT data. In our previous work (di Mauro et al. 2023) we obtained from the combined analysis of 49 local galaxy clusters (12 years of data) a hint of signal between 2.5-3 sigma. These results are consistent with other works as well, which consistently find a non-vanishing hint of signal, around the detection threshold. In this new work, we use a sample of near, well-known galaxy clusters and develop CR-induced emission templates using well-established X-ray measurements for calibration, assuming self similarity for the members of our sample. To strengthen the robustness of our analysis, we define benchmark models to encapsulate the uncertainties in the spectral and spatial profiles for the CR-induced emission and perform the standard template-fitting analysis using the likelihood ratio test.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark photon dark matter from terrestrial magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel search for dark photon dark matter (DM) using terrestrial magnetic field measurements at frequencies below 100 Hz. Coherently oscillating dark photon DM can induce a monochromatic magnetic field via kinetic mixing with ordinary photons. Notably, for dark photon masses $m_{A'}$ around $3 \times 10^{-14}$ eV, the signal can be resonantly amplified within a cavity formed by the Earth's surface and the ionosphere. We compute the expected signal incorporating the effect of atmospheric conductivity, and derive new upper limits on the kinetic mixing parameter $\varepsilon$ from long-term geomagnetic data. These limits improve upon previous ground-based constraints in the mass range of $1 \times 10^{-15}$ eV $\lesssim m_{A'} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-13}$ eV.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Strings in $E_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the appearance of superconducting strings in $E_6$ grand unification, keeping track of the magnetic monopole flux that precedes the formation of the string flux tube. This flux matching ensures compatibility with the quantum tunneling of a monopole-antimonopole pair on a metastable string. We identify two realistic $E_6$ models with superconducting (metastable) strings that also carry zero modes of the right handed Majorana neutrinos and dark matter particles. Depending on the symmetry breaking scale associated with the strings, the latter could be a source of observable gravitational waves, intermediate scale dark matter, and the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis. Topologically stable superconducting strings also appear if the $E_6$ symmetry breaking leaves unbroken the $Z_2$ subgroup of $Z_4$, the center of $SO(10)$. The zero modes of the SM fermions are the charge carriers in this case. Finally, the flux matching condition ensures that the Aharanov-Bohm phase change in going around the metastable strings is an integer multiple of $2 \pi$ for all fields. The fields in the spinorial representation of SO(10) acquire a phase change of $\exp(\pm i\pi)$ if taken around the topologically stable $Z_2$ string.</description>

      <title>Expected Constraints on the Intergalactic Magnetic Field using Gamma-Ray Bursts with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The InterGalactic Magnetic Field (IGMF), which could permeate the cosmic voids but was never detected so far, is considered a relic of the early Universe. Constraints on its strength $B$ can be derived from its influence on time-delayed very-high-energy photons from Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the electromagnetic cascades along their path to the Earth. The present lower limit achieved on its intensity is $10^{-18}\;\mathrm{G}$. In this work, we simulate data from the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO), accounting for realistic observational constraints, and we apply a joint spectral and temporal fit to characterize the IGMF. GRBs 190114C and 221009A are used as test cases to assess the sensitivity of CTAO. They demonstrate that a broad range of IGMF strengths can be probed with a lower bound as high as $10^{-15}\;\mathrm{G}$. Notably, we show that observations by the CTAO first large telescope, LST-1, already allow us to exclude field strengths up to $3\times 10^{-17}\;\mathrm{G}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.06551v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider quantum diffusion in ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation. Using the $\Delta N$ formalism, we present the first stochastic calculation of the probability distribution $P(\mathcal{R})$ of the curvature perturbation during USR. We capture the non-linearity of the system, solving the coupled evolution of the coarse-grained background with random kicks from the short wavelength modes, simultaneously with the mode evolution around the stochastic background. This leads to a non-Markovian process from which we determine the highly non-Gaussian tail of $P(\mathcal{R})$. Studying the production of primordial black holes in a viable model, we find that stochastic effects during USR increase their abundance by a factor $\sim 10^5$ compared to the Gaussian approximation.</description>

      <title>Implications of stochastic effects for primordial black hole production in ultra-slow-roll inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07437v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of stochastic noise on the generation of primordial black hole (PBH) seeds in ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation with numerical simulations. We consider the non-linearity of the system by consistently taking into account the noise dependence on the inflaton perturbations, while evolving the perturbations on the coarse-grained background affected by the noise. We capture in this way the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics, and demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are subleading. Using the $\Delta N$ formalism, we find the probability distribution $P(\mathcal{R})$ of the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. We consider inflationary potentials that fit the CMB and lead to PBH dark matter with $i)$ asteroid, $ii)$ solar, or $iii)$ Planck mass, as well as $iv)$ PBHs that form the seeds of supermassive black holes. We find that stochastic effects enhance the PBH abundance by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(10^8)$, depending on the PBH mass. We also show that the usual approximation, where stochastic kicks depend only on the Hubble rate, either underestimates or overestimates the abundance by orders of magnitude, depending on the potential. We evaluate the gauge dependence of the results, discuss the quantum-to-classical transition, and highlight open issues of the application of the stochastic formalism to USR inflation.</description>

      <title>The DELVE Quadruple Quasar Search I. A Lensed Low Luminosity AGN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A quadruply lensed source, J125856.3-031944, has been discovered using the DELVE survey and WISE W1 - W2 colors. Followup direct imaging carried out with the Magellan Baade 6.5 m telescope is analyzed, as is spectroscopy from the 2.5 m Nordic Optical Telescope. The lensed image configuration is kite-like, with the major axis of the lensing galaxy along the symmetry axis of the kite, and with the faintest image at its tail. Redward of 6000 AA the tail image is strongly blended with the lensing galaxy. The Sloan g direct imaging carried out with Magellan permits deblending. As the lensed image configuration is nearly circular, simple models give high predicted magnifications for all four images. The source's narrow emission lines at redshift z=2.225 and low intrinsic luminosity qualify it as a Type 2 AGN. The Magellan image shows a substantial residual that suggests a second lensing galaxy.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: Parameter Inference via Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building upon [2308.02636], we investigate the constraining power of persistent homology on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity in a likelihood-free inference pipeline utilizing machine learning. We evaluate the ability of Persistence Images (PIs) to infer parameters, comparing them to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS). We also compare two classes of models: neural-based and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS for parameters that can be constrained, i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$. PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, highlighting the potential of persistent homology for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results indicate that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little additional or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ is additionally informed by filaments (1-cycles).</description>

      <title>Testing the growth of cosmic structures during the Dark Ages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydrogen 21-cm Line Intensity Mapping offers the unique opportunity to access the Dark Ages and trace the formation and evolution of the large scale structure of the Universe prior to star and galaxy formation. In this work we investigate the potential of future Earth- and Moon-based 21-cm surveys to constrain the growth of structures during the currently unexplored redshift range $30 &lt; z &lt; 200$. On the one hand we show how foreground contamination could limit the capabilities of future instruments in achieving precision below the $10\%$ level. On the other hand, observations from the far side of the Moon have the potential to reach percent or even sub-percent precision in terms of reconstructing the growth of cosmic structures, if foregrounds are robustly accounted for. Such exquisite precision will provide tight constraints on models that induce deviations from $\Lambda$CDM, not only during the Dark Ages, but also during recombination or that manifest mostly in the low-redshift Universe, like Early Dark Energy and nDGP models, respectively. Thus, because of their insensitivity to non-linearities or astrophysical processes, line intensity mapping surveys will provide a formidable consistency check to potential claims of discoveries of new physics that affect the growth of structures.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of tracker scalar fields: Testing the evidence for dynamical dark energy with recent data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19274v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate non phantom tracker scalar field models as dynamical dark energy scenario. These models can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem and transition to a cosmological constant-like behaviour at late times. Focusing on the inverse axionlike and inverse steep exponential potentials, we study their background evolution and perturbations, finding a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum. Using combined datasets of ${\rm CMB}+{\rm BAO\; (DESI~DR1\; \&amp;\; DR2)}+{\rm Pantheon~Plus}+{\rm Hubble\; parameter}+{\rm RSD}$, we perform a statistical comparison based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results indicate that, within the framework of non-phantom tracker models, the data show no evidence for dynamical dark energy. The $\Lambda$CDM model continues to provide a better fit to current observations in the non phantom regime. We emphasise, however, that our analysis does not rule out the possibility of phantom-crossing dark energy models, which have been found in other studies to provide a better fit to some datasets.</description>

      <title>Probability density function for dispersion measure of fast radio burst from extragalactic medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes in cosmology. An optimized method was recently proposed to extract the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs by maximizing the joint likelihood function of the extragalactic dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$). In this paper, we identify a crucial factor that was omitted in the probability density function (PDF) for $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ in that method. Using simulated FRB data, we demonstrate that neglecting this factor leads to a systematic bias in the inferred cosmic baryon density, with deviations exceeding the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This highlights the necessity of including the missing factor for reliable cosmological applications of FRBs. Furthermore, applying our corrected PDF to a sample of 88 real localized FRBs, we find that the baryon density inferred with the original PDF is inconsistent with the Planck 2018 CMB results, whereas our corrected PDF yields excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>The Bispectrum of Intrinsic Alignments: Theory Modelling and Forecasts for Stage IV Galaxy Surveys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a complete treatment of the bispectrum of intrinsic alignments, both in three spatial dimensions and in projection in the flat-sky approximation. Since intrinsic alignment is a spin-2 observable, the bispectrum of intrinsic alignments contains a parity-even and a parity-odd part, the latter being nonzero even in the absence of parity violation. Moreover, all possible combinations of scalar, E- and B-mode bispectra are nonzero in the absence of parity violation. In analogy to the galaxy bispectrum in redshift space, we construct a complete set of multipoles for anisotropic bispectra of projected spin-2 fields. We then construct separable bispectrum estimators, both for parity-even and parity-odd bispectra, which can be computed by means of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs). We compare several different choices of angular weighting in terms of signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) for a Stage IV setup using luminous red galaxies (LRGs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) with galaxy shapes measured by the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). Assuming an overlapping area of $\sim 4,000$ square degrees (yielding $\sim 1.3$ million LRGs) and including scales up to $k_\text{max} = 0.14\,h$/Mpc, we find that the position-position-E-mode bispectrum $B_{DDE}$ (which is parity-even) can be strongly detected at SNR $\sim 30$, while detecting parity-odd bispectra (such as $B_{DDB}$, SNR $\sim 5$) or bispectra with more than one shape field (such as $B_{DEE}$, SNR $\sim 5$) may also be possible.</description>

      <title>Pressure Parametrization of Dark Energy: First and Second-Order Constraints with Latest Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model in which the pressure $p$ of the dark energy (DE) fluid evolves with the expansion of the Universe, expressed as a function of the scale factor $a$. The corresponding energy density $\rho$ is derived from the continuity equation, resulting in a dynamical equation-of-state parameter $w \equiv p/\rho$ during the late-time expansion of the Universe. The pressure is modeled using a Taylor expansion around the present epoch ($a = 1$), introducing deviations from a cosmological constant within the dynamical dark energy (DDE) framework. At first order, a single new parameter $\Omega_1$ captures linear deviations, while a second-order parameter, $\Omega_2$, accounts for quadratic evolution in the pressure. We constrain the first- and second-order DDE models using multiple observational datasets and compare their performance against $\Lambda$CDM and the CPL parameterization. A joint analysis of Planck CMB, DESI, and DESY5 data yields the strongest evidence for DDE, with a $2.7\sigma$ deviation in the first-order model and over $4\sigma$ in the second-order model, providing strong statistical support for a departure from a cosmological constant. The reconstructed DE evolution in the second-order case reveals a distinctive non-monotonic behavior in both energy density and $w_{\rm DE}(a)$, including clear phantom-crossing phenomena. Notably, the late-time evolution of $w_{\rm DE}(a)$ remains consistent across datasets and shows strong agreement with the CPL parameterization, underscoring the robustness of the pressure-based approach.</description>

      <title>A field-level reaction for screened modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a field-level reaction framework to emulate the nonlinear effects of screened modified gravity on the cosmic web. This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a "pseudo" $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction ("reaction") to a pseudo$\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k &lt; 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k &lt; 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical treatment of the annual modulation of relic neutrinos due to the Sun's gravitational influence. Extending our previously developed N-1-body simulation framework from Milky Way scales to solar system dynamics, we model how cosmic neutrino background densities might vary throughout Earth's orbital cycle. We validate our numerical approach against analytical expectations from previous studies that assumed idealized relic neutrino populations. Our results suggest that the prior gravitational history of neutrinos traversing asymmetric dark matter distributions can affect annual modulation patterns. While our simulations reproduce modulation amplitudes similar to analytical predictions for heavier neutrinos, we find that the amplitude can vary considerably depending on the specific morphology of dark matter halos. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating realistic structure formation effects when predicting potential observational relic neutrino signatures.</description>

      <title>Novel Challenges in Tracking Self-Interacting Dark Matter Subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations are among the primary tools for studying structure formation in the Universe. Analyses of these simulations critically depend on accurately identifying and tracking dark matter subhalos over time. In recent years, several new algorithms have been developed to improve the accuracy and consistency of subhalo tracking in cold dark matter simulations. These algorithms should be revisited in the context of new physics beyond gravity, which can modify the evolution and final properties of subhalo populations. In this work, we apply the particle-tracking-based subhalo finder Symfind to velocity-dependent self-interacting dark matter simulations with large cross section amplitudes to assess the performance of particle-tracking methods beyond the CDM paradigm. We find that the core-particle-tracking technique, which is key to the success of these algorithms in CDM, does not always yield accurate results in SIDM. The interplay between dark matter self-interactions and tidal stripping can cause the diffusion of core particles to larger radii, leading particle-tracking-based algorithms to prematurely lose track of SIDM subhalos. For massive core-expansion subhalos and core-collapse subhalos that experience close or repeated pericentric passages, a significant fraction of core particles can be lost, and particle-tracking-based finders such as Symfind offer no clear advantage over traditional methods that rely on identifying phase-space overdensities. On the other hand, for subhalos with large pericentric distances or fewer, more distant passages, Symfind tends to outperform. These differences depend sensitively on the cross section amplitude and turnover velocity of the underlying SIDM model. We therefore recommend a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both techniques to produce complete and robust catalogs of core-expansion and core-collapse SIDM subhalos.</description>

      <title>Rapid cosmological inference with the two-loop matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the two-loop effective field theory (EFT) power spectrum of dark matter density fluctuations in $\Lambda$CDM using the recently proposed COBRA method (Bakx. et al, 2025). With COBRA, we are able to evaluate the two-loop matter power spectrum in $\sim 1$ millisecond at $ \sim 0.1 \%$ precision on one CPU for arbitrary redshifts and on scales where perturbation theory applies. As an application, we use the nonlinear matter power spectrum from the Dark Sky simulation to assess the performance of the two-loop EFT power spectrum compared to the one-loop EFT power spectrum at $z=0$. We find that, for volumes typical for Stage IV galaxy surveys, $V = 25 \,(\text{Gpc}/h)^3$, the two-loop EFT can provide unbiased cosmological constraints on $\Omega_m,H_0$ and $A_s$ using scales up to $k_\text{max}=0.26\, h/\text{Mpc}$, thereby outperforming the constraints from the one-loop EFT ($k_\text{max}=0.11\, h/\text{Mpc}$). The Figure of Merit on these three parameters increases by a factor $\sim 2.6$ and the one-dimensional marginalized constraints improve by $\sim35\%$ for $\Omega_m$, $\sim20\%$ for $H_0$ and $\sim 15\%$ for $A_s$.</description>

      <title>Probing the Cosmological Principle with CMB lensing and cosmic shear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard cosmological model assumes the Cosmological Principle. However, recent observations hint at possible violations of isotropy on large scales, possibly through late-time anisotropic expansion. Here we investigate the potential of cross-correlations between CMB lensing convergence $\kappa$ and galaxy cosmic shear $B$-modes as a novel probe of such late-time anisotropies. Our signal-to-noise forecasts reveal that information from the $\kappa$-$B$ cross-correlation is primarily contained on large angular scales ($\ell \lesssim 200$). We find that this cross-correlation for a Euclid-like galaxy survey is sensitive to anisotropy at the percent level. Making use of tomography yields a modest improvement of $\sim 20\%$ in detection power. Incorporating the galaxy $E$-$B$ cross-correlations would further enhance these constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the gravitational baryogenesis paradigm in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of generalized coupling gravity and, in particular, of the so-called Minimal Exponential Measure Model (MEMe). We show that, also in this theory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents and can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal equilibrium. Using the current bounds on the ratio of baryon number to entropy density, we can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q that characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw stringent constraints on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Keeping the relation between the Starobinsky model and no-scale supergravity ACTive</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term $\sim \alpha R^3$, scaled by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, with the resulting inflaton potential being the standard Starobinsky potential modified to first parametric order by an additive term. The resulting potential is identical to the potential obtained by a modification of the superpotential employed in the construction of the Starobinsky model in the framework of no-scale supergravity, thus, extending the correspondence between a class of no-scale supergravity models and modifications of the Starobinsky model. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1.9 \times 10^{-5}$, the modified Starobinsky model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, for a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical constraints on the HI mass function of star-forming galaxies and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from interferometric surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The HI mass function is a crucial tool to understand the evolution of the HI content in galaxies over cosmic times. We aim to derive semi-empirical constraints at $z\sim 0.37$ by combining literature results on the $M_\star$ function from optical surveys with recent findings on the $M_{\rm HI}-M_\star$ scaling relation derived via spectral stacking analysis applied to 21-cm line interferometric data from the MIGHTEE and CHILES surveys, conducted with the MeerKAT and VLA radio telescopes, respectively. We draw synthetic $M_\star$ samples directly from the publicly-available results underlying the analysis of the COSMOS2020 galaxy photometric sample. Afterwards, we convert $M_\star$ into $M_{\rm HI}$ using analytical fitting functions to the data points from HI stacking. We then fit a Schechter function to the median HIMF from all the samples via MCMC. We finally derive the posterior distribution for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ by integrating the models for the HIMF built from the posteriors samples of the Schechter parameters. We find a deviation of the HIMF at $z\sim 0.37$ from the results at $z\sim 0$ from the ALFALFA survey and at $z\sim 1$ from uGMRT data. Our results for $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ are in broad agreement with other literature results, and follow the overall trend on $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ as a function of redshift. The derived value $\Omega_{\rm HI}=\left(7.02^{+0.59}_{-0.52}\right)\times10^{-4}$ at $z\sim 0.37$ from the combined analysis deviates at $\sim 2.9\sigma$ from the ALFALFA result at $z\sim 0$. Our findings about the HIMF and $\Omega_{\rm HI}$ differ from previous literature results at $z\sim0$ and $z\sim1$, although we are unable to confirm at this stage whether these differences are due to cosmic evolution consistent with a smooth transition of the HI content of galaxies over the last 8 Gyr or due to selection biases and systematics.</description>

      <title>Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Polarimetric Structure of Jets from Radio Galaxy MRC 0600-399 in A3376</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: MRC 0600-399, in the merging galaxy cluster Abell 3376, is one of the unique Head-Tail radio galaxies having abruptly bending structures, the origin of which is still under discussion. A previous study suggested that the interaction between the jets and the magnetic fields on the cold front has produced such an outstanding feature; however, it is still not known how the jet propagates the long distance keeping the sharp shape. In this study, we performed a polarization analysis of MRC 0600-399 and a nearby radio source using MeerKAT L-band data. To interpret the Faraday structure, we constructed the Pseudo-3D visualization map of the reconstructed Faraday dispersion function 3D cube. MRC 0600-399 has a complicated Faraday depth structure, and some of the Faraday depth features are in good agreement with the 2D structure on the celestial sphere. For the northern jet of MRC 0600-399, the Faraday depth values show a clear gap at the tip region. Based on the polarization analysis and comparison with the other observation, we concluded that the synchrotron radiation from the tip region of the northern jet originates from the magnetic field on the cold front.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological reheating bridges the inflationary epoch and the hot big bang phase, yet its underlying dynamics remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate a minimal scenario in which the inflaton evolves under a simple power-law potential during reheating and interacts with other particles via renormalizable couplings. We show that inflaton quanta can be regenerated from the thermal bath even after the decay of the coherent inflaton field, unveiling a previously overlooked channel for inflaton particle production, which offers a novel window into probing reheating. Remarkably, this mechanism may also account for the observed dark matter abundance, providing a natural link between early Universe dynamics and present-day cosmological observations.</description>
