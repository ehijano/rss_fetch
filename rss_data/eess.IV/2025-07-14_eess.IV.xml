      <title>3D forest semantic segmentation using multispectral LiDAR and 3D deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation and decision-making regarding forest resources necessitate regular forest inventory. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) in laser scanning systems has gained significant attention over the past two decades as a remote and non-destructive solution to streamline the labor-intensive and time-consuming procedure of forest inventory. Advanced multispectral (MS) LiDAR systems simultaneously acquire three-dimensional (3D) spatial and spectral information across multiple wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum. Consequently, MS-LiDAR technology enables the estimation of both the biochemical and biophysical characteristics of forests. Forest component segmentation is crucial for forest inventory. The synergistic use of spatial and spectral laser information has proven to be beneficial for achieving precise forest semantic segmentation. Thus, this study aims to investigate the potential of MS-LiDAR data, captured by the HeliALS system, providing high-density multispectral point clouds to segment forests into six components: ground, low vegetation, trunks, branches, foliage, and woody debris. Three point-wise 3D deep learning models and one machine learning model, including kernel point convolution, superpoint transformer, point transformer V3, and random forest, are implemented. Our experiments confirm the superior accuracy of the KPConv model. Additionally, various geometric and spectral feature vector scenarios are examined. The highest accuracy is achieved by feeding all three wavelengths (1550 nm, 905 nm, and 532 nm) as the initial features into the deep learning model, resulting in improvements of 33.73% and 32.35% in mean intersection over union (mIoU) and in mean accuracy (mAcc), respectively. This study highlights the excellent potential of multispectral LiDAR for improving the accuracy in fully automated forest component segmentation.</description>

      <title>Cracking Instance Jigsaw Puzzles: An Alternative to Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multiple instance learning (MIL) has shown to be a promising approach for histopathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis, its reliance on permutation invariance significantly limits its capacity to effectively uncover semantic correlations between instances within WSIs. Based on our empirical and theoretical investigations, we argue that approaches that are not permutation-invariant but better capture spatial correlations between instances can offer more effective solutions. In light of these findings, we propose a novel alternative to existing MIL for WSI analysis by learning to restore the order of instances from their randomly shuffled arrangement. We term this task as cracking an instance jigsaw puzzle problem, where semantic correlations between instances are uncovered. To tackle the instance jigsaw puzzles, we propose a novel Siamese network solution, which is theoretically justified by optimal transport theory. We validate the proposed method on WSI classification and survival prediction tasks, where the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art MIL competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/xiwenc1/MIL-JigsawPuzzles.</description>

      <title>Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST) for Segment-Specific ICA Calcification Mapping on Non-Contrast CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While total intracranial carotid artery calcification (ICAC) volume is an established stroke biomarker, growing evidence shows this aggregate metric ignores the critical influence of plaque location, since calcification in different segments carries distinct prognostic and procedural risks. However, a finer-grained, segment-specific quantification has remained technically infeasible. Conventional 3D models are forced to process downsampled volumes or isolated patches, sacrificing the global context required to resolve anatomical ambiguity and render reliable landmark localization. To overcome this, we reformulate the 3D challenge as a \textbf{Parallel Probabilistic Landmark Localization} task along the 1D axial dimension. We propose the \textbf{Depth-Sequence Transformer (DST)}, a framework that processes full-resolution CT volumes as sequences of 2D slices, learning to predict $N=6$ independent probability distributions that pinpoint key anatomical landmarks. Our DST framework demonstrates exceptional accuracy and robustness. Evaluated on a 100-patient clinical cohort with rigorous 5-fold cross-validation, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of \textbf{0.1 slices}, with \textbf{96\%} of predictions falling within a $\pm1$ slice tolerance. Furthermore, to validate its architectural power, the DST backbone establishes the best result on the public Clean-CC-CCII classification benchmark under an end-to-end evaluation protocol. Our work delivers the first practical tool for automated segment-specific ICAC analysis. The proposed framework provides a foundation for further studies on the role of location-specific biomarkers in diagnosis, prognosis, and procedural planning. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Raptor: Scalable Train-Free Embeddings for 3D Medical Volumes Leveraging Pretrained 2D Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current challenges in developing foundational models for volumetric imaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), stem from the computational complexity of training state-of-the-art architectures in high dimensions and curating sufficiently large datasets of volumes. To address these challenges, we introduce Raptor (Random Planar Tensor Reduction), a train-free method for generating semantically rich embeddings for volumetric data. Raptor leverages a frozen 2D foundation model, pretrained on natural images, to extract visual tokens from individual cross-sections of medical volumes. These tokens are then spatially compressed using random projections, significantly reducing computational complexity while retaining semantic information. Extensive experiments on ten diverse medical volume tasks verify the superior performance of Raptor over state-of-the-art methods, including those pretrained exclusively on medical volumes (+3% SuPreM, +6% MISFM, +10% Merlin, +13% VoCo, and +14% SLIViT), while entirely bypassing the need for costly training. Our results highlight the effectiveness and versatility of Raptor as a foundation for advancing deep learning-based methods for medical volumes.</description>

      <title>MetaH2: A Snapshot Metasurface HDR Hyperspectral Camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08282v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a metasurface camera that jointly performs high-dynamic range (HDR) and hyperspectral imaging in a snapshot. The system integrates exposure bracketing and computed tomography imaging spectrometry (CTIS) by simultaneously forming multiple spatially multiplexed projections with unique power ratios and chromatic aberrations on a photosensor. The measurements are subsequently processed through a deep reconstruction model to generate an HDR image and a hyperspectral datacube. Our simulation studies show that the proposed system achieves higher reconstruction accuracy than previous snapshot hyperspectral imaging methods on benchmark datasets. We assemble a working prototype and demonstrate snapshot reconstruction of 60 dB dynamic range and 10 nm spectral resolution from 600 nm to 700 nm on real-world scenes from a monochrome photosensor.</description>

      <title>Onboard Neuromorphic Split Computing via Optical Links for LEO Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations increasingly require onboard intelligence under strict power and communication constraints. This paper proposes a neuromorphic split computing framework tailored for hierarchical LEO systems, where edge satellites perform event-driven sensing using dynamic vision sensors (DVS) and lightweight spiking neural network (SNN) encoders, while core satellites conduct inference using a powerful SNN decoder. A learned spike mapping scheme enables direct transmission over optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) without conventional modulation overhead. Experimental results on synthetic aerial scene classification demonstrate that the proposed architecture achieves accuracy on par with modern large vision-based pipelines, while offering energy efficiency comparable to that of existing lightweight implementations. These findings highlight the potential of neuromorphic computing for energy-efficient inter-satellite split computing in LEO remote sensing missions.</description>

      <title>Upsample What Matters: Region-Adaptive Latent Sampling for Accelerated Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion transformers have emerged as an alternative to U-net-based diffusion models for high-fidelity image and video generation, offering superior scalability. However, their heavy computation remains a major obstacle to real-world deployment. Existing acceleration methods primarily exploit the temporal dimension such as reusing cached features across diffusion timesteps. Here, we propose Region-Adaptive Latent Upsampling (RALU), a training-free framework that accelerates inference along spatial dimension. RALU performs mixed-resolution sampling across three stages: 1) low-resolution denoising latent diffusion to efficiently capture global semantic structure, 2) region-adaptive upsampling on specific regions prone to artifacts at full-resolution, and 3) all latent upsampling at full-resolution for detail refinement. To stabilize generations across resolution transitions, we leverage noise-timestep rescheduling to adapt the noise level across varying resolutions. Our method significantly reduces computation while preserving image quality by achieving up to 7.0$\times$ speed-up on FLUX and 3.0$\times$ on Stable Diffusion 3 with minimal degradation. Furthermore, RALU is complementary to existing temporal accelerations such as caching methods, thus can be seamlessly integrated to further reduce inference latency without compromising generation quality.</description>

      <title>Fast and Efficient Merge of Sorted Input Lists in Hardware Using List Offset Merge Sorters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new set of hardware merge sort devices are introduced here, which merge multiple sorted input lists into a single sorted output list in a fast and efficient manner. In each merge sorter, the values from the sorted input lists are arranged in an input 2-D setup array, but with the order of each sorted input list offset from the order of each of the other sorted input lists. In these new devices, called List Offset Merge Sorters (LOMS), a minimal set of column sort stages alternating with row sort stages process the input setup array into a final output array, now in the defined sorted order. LOMS 2-way sorters, which merge 2 sorted input lists, require only 2 merge stages and are significantly faster than Kenneth Batcher's previous state-of-the-art 2-way merge devices, Bitonic Merge Sorters and Odd-Even Merge Sorters. LOMS 2-way sorters utilize the recently-introduced Single-Stage 2-way Merge Sorters (S2MS) in their first stage. Both LOMS and S2MS devices can merge any mixture of input list sizes, while Batcher's merge sorters are difficult to design unless the 2 input lists are equal, and a power-of-2. By themselves, S2MS devices are the fastest 2-way merge sorters when implemented in this study's target FPGA devices, but they tend to use a large number of LUT resources. LOMS 2-way devices use fewer resources than comparable S2MS devices, enabling some large LOMS devices to be implemented in a given FPGA when comparable S2MS devices cannot fit in that FPGA. A List Offset 2-way sorter merges 2 lists, each with 32 values, into a sorted output list of those 64 values in 2.24 nS, a speedup of 2.63 versus a comparable Batcher device. A LOMS 3-way merge sorter, merging 3 sorted input lists with 7 values, fully merges the 21 values in 3.4 nS, a speedup of 1.36 versus the comparable state-of-the-art 3-way merge device.</description>

      <title>UWarp: A Whole Slide Image Registration Pipeline to Characterize Scanner-Induced Local Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histopathology slide digitization introduces scanner-induced domain shift that can significantly impact computational pathology models based on deep learning methods. In the state-of-the-art, this shift is often characterized at a broad scale (slide-level or dataset-level) but not patch-level, which limits our comprehension of the impact of localized tissue characteristics on the accuracy of the deep learning models. To address this challenge, we present a domain shift analysis framework based on UWarp, a novel registration tool designed to accurately align histological slides scanned under varying conditions. UWarp employs a hierarchical registration approach, combining global affine transformations with fine-grained local corrections to achieve robust tissue patch alignment. We evaluate UWarp using two private datasets, CypathLung and BosomShieldBreast, containing whole slide images scanned by multiple devices. Our experiments demonstrate that UWarp outperforms existing open-source registration methods, achieving a median target registration error (TRE) of less than 4 pixels (&lt;1 micrometer at 40x magnification) while significantly reducing computational time. Additionally, we apply UWarp to characterize scanner-induced local domain shift in the predictions of Breast-NEOprAIdict, a deep learning model for breast cancer pathological response prediction. We find that prediction variability is strongly correlated with tissue density on a given patch. Our findings highlight the importance of localized domain shift analysis and suggest that UWarp can serve as a valuable tool for improving model robustness and domain adaptation strategies in computational pathology.</description>

      <title>Computationally Efficient Information-Driven Optical Design with Interchanging Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that imaging systems can be evaluated through the information content of their measurements alone, enabling application-agnostic optical design that avoids computational decoding challenges. Information-Driven Encoder Analysis Learning (IDEAL) was proposed to automate this process through gradient-based optimization. In this work, we study IDEAL across diverse imaging systems and find that it suffers from high memory usage, long runtimes, and a potentially mismatched objective function due to end-to-end differentiability requirements. We introduce IDEAL with Interchanging Optimization (IDEAL-IO), a method that decouples density estimation from optical parameter optimization by alternating between fitting models to current measurements and updating optical parameters using fixed models for information estimation. This approach reduces runtime and memory usage by up to 6x while enabling more expressive density models that guide optimization toward superior designs. We validate our method on diffractive optics, lensless imaging, and snapshot 3D microscopy applications, establishing information-theoretic optimization as a practical, scalable strategy for real-world imaging system design.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound Autofocusing: Common Midpoint Phase Error Optimization via Differentiable Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03008v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ultrasound imaging, propagation of an acoustic wavefront through heterogeneous media causes phase aberrations that degrade the coherence of the reflected wavefront, leading to reduced image resolution and contrast. Adaptive imaging techniques attempt to correct this phase aberration and restore coherence, leading to improved focusing of the image. We propose an autofocusing paradigm for aberration correction in ultrasound imaging by fitting an acoustic velocity field to pressure measurements, via optimization of the common midpoint phase error (CMPE), using a straight-ray wave propagation model for beamforming in diffusely scattering media. We show that CMPE induced by heterogeneous acoustic velocity is a robust measure of phase aberration that can be used for acoustic autofocusing. CMPE is optimized iteratively using a differentiable beamforming approach to simultaneously improve the image focus while estimating the acoustic velocity field of the interrogated medium. The approach relies solely on wavefield measurements using a straight-ray integral solution of the two-way time-of-flight without explicit numerical time-stepping models of wave propagation. We demonstrate method performance through in silico simulations, in vitro phantom measurements, and in vivo mammalian models, showing practical applications in distributed aberration quantification, correction, and velocity estimation for medical ultrasound autofocusing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08229v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.</description>

      <title>Lighting the Night with Generative Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The visible light reflectance data from geostationary satellites is crucial for meteorological observations and plays an important role in weather monitoring and forecasting. However, due to the lack of visible light at night, it is impossible to conduct continuous all-day weather observations using visible light reflectance data. This study pioneers the use of generative diffusion models to address this limitation. Based on the multi-band thermal infrared brightness temperature data from the Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) onboard the Fengyun-4B (FY4B) geostationary satellite, we developed a high-precision visible light reflectance generative model, called Reflectance Diffusion (RefDiff), which enables 0.47~\mu\mathrm{m}, 0.65~\mu\mathrm{m}, and 0.825~\mu\mathrm{m} bands visible light reflectance generation at night. Compared to the classical models, RefDiff not only significantly improves accuracy through ensemble averaging but also provides uncertainty estimation. Specifically, the SSIM index of RefDiff can reach 0.90, with particularly significant improvements in areas with complex cloud structures and thick clouds. The model's nighttime generation capability was validated using VIIRS nighttime product, demonstrating comparable performance to its daytime counterpart. In summary, this research has made substantial progress in the ability to generate visible light reflectance at night, with the potential to expand the application of nighttime visible light data.</description>
