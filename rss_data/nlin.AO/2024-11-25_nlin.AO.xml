      <title>Effects of coupling range on the dynamics of swarmalators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the one-dimensional swarmalator model where the units' interactions have a controllable length scale or range. We tune the model from the long-range regime, which is well studied, into the short-range regime, which is understudied, and find diverse collective states: sync dots, where the swarmalators arrange themselves into k&gt;1 delta points of perfect synchrony, q-waves, where the swarmalators form spatiotemporal waves with winding number q&gt;1, and an active state where unsteady oscillations are found. We present the phase diagram and derive most of the threshold boundaries analytically. These states may be observable in real-world swarmalator systems with low-range coupling such as biological microswimmers or active colloids.</description>

      <title>Complexity synchronization analysis of neurophysiological data: Theory and methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply modified diffusion entropy analysis (MDEA) to assess multifractal dimensions of ON time series (ONTS) and complexity synchronization (CS) analysis to infer information transfer among ONs that are part of a network of organ networks (NoONs). The purpose of this paper is to advance the validation, standardization, and repeatability of MDEA and CS analysis of heterogeneous neurophysiological time series data. Results from processing these datasets show that the complexity of brain, heart, and lung ONTS significantly co-vary over time during cognitive task performance but that certain principles, guidelines, and strategies for the application of MDEA analysis need consideration.</description>

      <title>Noise-induced nonreciprocal topological dissipative solitons in directionally coupled chains and lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal coupling can alter the transport properties of material media, producing striking phenomena such as unidirectional amplification of waves, boundary modes, or self-assembled pattern formation. It is responsible for nonlinear convective instabilities in nonlinear systems that drive topological dissipative solitons in a single direction, producing a lossless information transmission. Considering fluctuations, which are intrinsic to every macroscopic dynamical system, noise-sustained structures emerge permanently in time. Here, we study arrays of nonreciprocally coupled bistable systems exhibiting noise-sustained topological phase wall (or soliton) dynamics. The bifurcations between different steady states are analytically addressed, and the properties of the noise-sustained states are unveiled as a function of the reciprocal and nonreciprocal coupling parameters. Furthermore, we study critical points where the structures' characteristic size diverges with different power law exponents. Our numerical results agree with the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Resonant Solitary States in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partially synchronized solitary states occur frequently when a synchronized system of networked oscillators is perturbed locally. Several asymptotic states of different frequencies can coexist at the same node. Here, we reveal the mechanism behind this multistability: additional solitary frequencies arise from the coupling between network modes and the solitary oscillator's frequency, leading to significant energy transfer. This can cause the solitary node's frequency to resonate with a Laplacian eigenvalue. We analyze which network structures enable this resonance and explain longstanding numerical observations. Another solitary state is characterized by the effective decoupling of the synchronized network and the solitary node at the natural frequency. Our framework unifies the description of solitary states near and far from resonance, allowing to predict the behavior of complex networks.</description>

      <title>Phase and gain stability for adaptive dynamical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In adaptive dynamical networks, the dynamics of the nodes and the edges influence each other. We show that we can treat such systems as a closed feedback loop between edge and node dynamics. Using recent advances on the stability of feedback systems from control theory, we derive local, sufficient conditions for steady states of such systems to be linearly stable. These conditions are local in the sense that they are written entirely in terms of the (linearized) behavior of the edges and nodes. We apply these conditions to the Kuramoto model with inertia written in adaptive form, and the adaptive Kuramoto model. For the former we recover a classic result, for the latter we show that our sufficient conditions match necessary conditions where the latter are available, thus completely settling the question of linear stability in this setting. The method we introduce can be readily applied to a vast class of systems. It enables straightforward evaluation of stability in highly heterogeneous systems.</description>

      <title>Self-organized quantization and oscillations on continuous fixed-energy sandpiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.04470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.04470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric self-organization and activator-inhibitor dynamics in biology provide examples of checkerboard-like spatio-temporal organization. We study a simple model for local activation-inhibition processes. Our model, first introduced in the context of atmospheric moisture dynamics, is a continuous-energy and non-Abelian version of the fixed-energy sandpile model. Each lattice site is populated by a non-negative real number, its energy. Upon each timestep all sites with energy exceeding a unit threshold re-distribute their energy at equal parts to their nearest neighbors. The limit cycle dynamics gives rise to a complex phase diagram in dependence on the mean energy $\mu$: For low $\mu$, all dynamics ceases after few re-distribution events. For large $\mu$, the dynamics is well-described as a diffusion process, where the order parameter, spatial variance $\sigma$, is removed. States at intermediate $\mu$ are dominated by checkerboard-like period-two phases which are however interspersed by much more complex phases of far longer periods. Phases are separated by discontinuous jumps in $\sigma$ or $\partial_{\mu}\sigma$ - akin to first and higher-order phase transitions. Overall, the energy landscape is dominated by few energy levels which occur as sharp spikes in the single-site density of states and are robust to noise.</description>
