      <title>A probabilistic approach to system-environment coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified statistical framework for quantifying system-environment coupling by treating the interaction energy $V_\mathcal{SE}$ as a stochastic variable. Using a reference-particle decomposition, we derive exact, closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of $V_\mathcal{SE}$ in terms of the single-particle density and up to four-body correlation functions. When $V_\mathcal{SE}$ is approximately Gaussian, these two moments suffice to compute the free energy shift of the strongly coupled system. To validate our framework, we ran explicit Monte Carlo simulations of the full system-environment configurations across a range of system sizes, generating reference distributions of the interaction energy $V_\mathcal{SE}$. We then applied our derived analytical formulas to predict these distributions and found excellent agreement in both the weak- and strong-coupling regimes.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Two-component Double Ionization Potential Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster with the Dirac--Coulomb--Breit Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of relativistic double-ionization-potential (DIP) equation-of-motion coupled-cluster (EOMCC) with up to 4-hole--2-particle ($4h2p$) excitations that makes use of the molecular mean-field exact two-component (mmfX2C) framework. We apply mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC to several neutral atoms and diatomic molecules to obtain the ground and first few excited states of the corresponding di-cation species, and we observe excellent agreement (to within 0.001 eV) between double ionization potentials (IPs) obtained from mmfX2C- and four-component DIP-EOMCC calculations that include 3-hole--1-particle ($3h1p$) excitations, with either the Dirac--Coulomb or Dirac--Coulomb--Gaunt Hamiltonians. We also compare double IPs for mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC calculations with the full Dirac--Coulomb--Breit (DCB) Hamiltonian to those from experiment. The mmfX2C-DIP-EOMCC with $3h1p$ excitations leads to errors in absolute double IPs that are larger than 0.1 eV, whereas the addition of $4h2p$ excitations reduces these errors dramatically, often by an order of magnitude or more.</description>

      <title>An evaluation of unconditional 3D molecular generation methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unconditional molecular generation is a stepping stone for conditional molecular generation, which is important in \emph{de novo} drug design. Recent unconditional 3D molecular generation methods report saturated benchmarks, suggesting it is time to re-evaluate our benchmarks and compare the latest models. We assess five recent high-performing 3D molecular generation methods (EQGAT-diff, FlowMol, GCDM, GeoLDM, and SemlaFlow), in terms of both standard benchmarks and chemical and physical validity. Overall, the best method, SemlaFlow, has a success rate of 87% in generating valid, unique, and novel molecules without post-processing and 92.4% with post-processing.</description>

      <title>Understanding and improving transferability in machine-learned activation energy predictors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The calculation of reactive properties is a challenging task in chemical reaction discovery. Machine learning (ML) methods play an important role in accelerating electronic structure predictions of activation energies and reaction enthalpies, and are a crucial ingredient to enable large-scale automated reaction network discovery with $&gt;10^3$ reactions. Unfortunately, the predictive accuracy of existing ML models does not yet reach the required accuracy across the space of possible chemical reactions to enable subsequent kinetic simulations that even qualitatively agree with experimental kinetics. Here, we comprehensively assess the underlying reasons for prediction failures within a selection of machine-learned models of reactivity. Models based on difference fingerprints between reactant and product structures lack transferability despite providing good in-distribution predictions. This results in a significant loss of information about the context and mechanism of chemical reactions. We propose a convolutional ML model that uses atom-centered quantum-chemical descriptors and approximate transition state information. Inclusion of the latter improves transferability for out-of-distribution benchmark reactions, making greater use of the limited chemical reaction space spanned by the training data. The model further delivers atom-level contributions to activation energies and reaction enthalpies that provide a useful interpretational tool for rationalizing reactivity.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Advancements of the FHI-aims Software Package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic-structure theory is the foundation of the description of materials including multiscale modeling of their properties and functions. Obviously, without sufficient accuracy at the base, reliable predictions are unlikely at any level that follows. The software package FHI-aims has proven to be a game changer for accurate free-energy calculations because of its scalability, numerical precision, and its efficient handling of density functional theory (DFT) with hybrid functionals and van der Waals interactions. It treats molecules, clusters, and extended systems (solids and liquids) on an equal footing. Besides DFT, FHI-aims also includes quantum-chemistry methods, descriptions for excited states and vibrations, and calculations of various types of transport. Recent advancements address the integration of FHI-aims into an increasing number of workflows and various artificial intelligence (AI) methods. This Roadmap describes the state-of-the-art of FHI-aims and advancements that are currently ongoing or planned.</description>

      <title>Tree tensor network hierarchical equations of motion based on time-dependent variational principle for efficient open quantum dynamics in structured thermal environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient method TTN-HEOM for exactly calculating the open quantum dynamics for driven quantum systems interacting with highly structured bosonic baths by combining the tree tensor network (TTN) decomposition scheme to the bexcitonic generalization of the numerically-exact hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). The method yields a series of quantum master equations for all core tensors in the TTN that efficiently and accurately capture the open quantum dynamics for non-Markovian environments to all orders in the system-bath interaction. These master equations are constructed based on the time-dependent Dirac-Frenkel variational principle which isolates the optimal dynamics for the core tensors given the TTN ansatz. The dynamics converges to the HEOM when increasing the rank of the core tensors, a limit in which the TTN ansatz becomes exact. We introduce TENSO, Tensor Equations for Non-Markovian Structured Open systems, as a general-purpose Python code to propagate the TTN-HEOM dynamics. We implement three general propagators for the coupled master equations: Two fixed-rank methods that require a constant memory footprint during the dynamics, and one adaptive-rank method with variable memory footprint controlled by the target level of computational error. We exemplify the utility of these methods by simulating a two-level system coupled to a structured bath containing one Drude-Lorentzian component and eight Brownian oscillators, which is beyond what can presently be computed using the standard HEOM. Our results show that the TTN-HEOM is capable to simulate both dephasing and relaxation dynamics of driven quantum system interacting with structured baths, even those of chemical complexity, with affordable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic potentials from a probabilistic view on the system-environment interaction energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In open systems with strong coupling, the interaction energy between the system and the environment is significant, so thermodynamic quantities cannot be reliably obtained by traditional statistical mechanics methods. The Hamiltonian of mean force $\mathcal{H}^{*}_{\beta}$ offers an in principle accurate theoretical basis by explicitly accounting for the interaction energy. However, calculating the Hamiltonian of mean force is challenging both theoretically and computationally. We demonstrate that when the condition $\text{Var}_{\mathcal{E}_0} (e^{-\beta {V}_{\mathcal{SE}}}) = 0$ is met, the dependence of thermodynamic variables can be shifted from $\{P_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}}), \mathcal{H}^{*}_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}})\}$ to $\{P_{\beta}(x_{\mathcal{S}}), P(V_{\mathcal{SE}})\}$. This change simplifies thermodynamic measurements. As a central result, we derive a general equality that holds for arbitrary coupling strengths and from which an inequality follows - aligned with Jensen's inequality applied to the Gibbs-Bogoliubov-Feynman bound. This equality, analogous in importance to the Jarzynski equality, offers deeper insight into free energy differences in strongly coupled systems. Finally, by combining our result with said Jarzynski equality, we derive additional relations that further clarify thermodynamic behavior in strongly coupled open systems.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Adjoint Method for Quantum Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive and implement a second-order adjoint method to compute exact gradients and Hessians for a prototypical quantum optimal control problem, that of solving for the minimal energy applied electric field that drives a molecule from a given initial state to a desired target state. For small to moderately sized systems, we demonstrate a vectorized GPU implementation of a second-order adjoint method that computes both Hessians and gradients with wall times only marginally more than those required to compute gradients via commonly used first-order adjoint methods. Pairing our second-order adjoint method with a trust region optimizer (a type of Newton method), we show that it outperforms a first-order method, requiring significantly fewer iterations and wall time to find optimal controls for four molecular systems. Our derivation of the second-order adjoint method allows for arbitrary parameterizations of the controls.</description>

      <title>Observation of Resonant Tunneling from Molecular Shape into Vibronic Feshbach Resonances Followed by Mode-Specific Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a kinematically complete study of dissociative electron attachment (DEA) in linear OCS molecules, focusing on how electrons resonantly attach and trigger dissociation. Near the Franck-Condon regime, DEA is dominated by molecular shape resonances, where transient OCS$^-$ states form with high vibrational amplitudes, spectroscopically evident as broad features in DEA cross-sections. As the electron beam energy increases from 5.5 to 6.0 eV, S$^-$ population shifts from lower to higher-energy highly dense bending vibrational states, reinforcing our findings on dipole-forbidden vibronic intensity borrowing. Our advanced potential energy curve calculations, employing the Equation-of-motion coupled cluster singles and doubles for electron attachment (EA-EOMCCSD) method, reveal that beyond the shape resonance, non-adiabatic resonant tunneling governs the avoided crossings, dynamically generating three mode-specific vibronic Feshbach resonances before complete dissociation into three distinct kinetic energy bands of S$^-$. Our theoretical results probe most of the experimental observations quantitatively and qualitatively. These insights deepen our fundamental understanding of resonance-mediated dissociation in electron-molecule resonant scattering, with broader implications for quantum mechanics, plasma physics, vibrational revival, astrochemistry, and radiation damage research.</description>

      <title>Integer linear programming for unsupervised training set selection in molecular machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integer linear programming (ILP) is an elegant approach to solve linear optimization problems, naturally described using integer decision variables. Within the context of physics-inspired machine learning applied to chemistry, we demonstrate the relevance of an ILP formulation to select molecular training sets for predictions of size-extensive properties. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised training set selection approaches, especially when predicting properties of molecules larger than those present in the training set. We argue that the reason for the improved performance is due to the selection that is based on the notion of local similarity (i.e., per-atom) and a unique ILP approach that finds optimal solutions efficiently. Altogether, this work provides a practical algorithm to improve the performance of physics-inspired machine learning models and offers insights into the conceptual differences with existing training set selection approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article summarizes recent updates to the p$^\dagger$q package, which is a C++ accelerated Python library for generating equations and computer code corresponding to singly-reference many-body quantum chemistry methods such as coupled-cluster (CC) and equation-of-motion (EOM) CC theory. Since 2021, the functionality in \pq has expanded to include boson operators, coupled fermion-boson operators, unitary cluster operators, non-particle-conserving EOM operators, spin tracing, multiple single-particle subspaces, and more. Additional developments allow for the generation of C++ and Python code that minimizes floating-point operations via contraction order optimization, sub-expression elimination, and the fusion of similar terms.</description>

      <title>Chemputer and Chemputation - A Universal Chemical Compound Synthesis Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemputation, the execution of code controlled reaction pathways on universally reconfigurable hardware, offers a route to treating chemical synthesis as a formally computable i.e. chemputable process to produce chemical compounds or molecules. Here I present a proof that a chemputer endowed with a finite, but extensible reagent, catalyst, process condition sets, and a chempiler that maps reaction graphs to hardware graphs, and dynamic error correction handles, is universal for the synthesis of any stable, isolable molecule that respects conservation of matter and finite reaction time and can be produced in detectable amounts. In developing this proof, I also expanded the internationally accepted definition of a molecule, by requiring that the molecule must be reachable in an analytically accessible amount using concepts from assembly theory. This shows that error correction is a vital requirement for chemputation, and I formalise the universal chemical synthesis theorem, demonstrate a full worked example, and explore the practical limits imposed by vessel count and sensing bandwidth. In doing so, I show that chemical reactions are not implicit blackbox functions but emergent graph operations or chemical transformations over Reagents (R) x Process (P) x Catalyst (K). The role of universally configurable hardware is also highlighted, with the introduction of a chempiling function that translates synthesis pathways into executable hardware configurations.</description>

      <title>Action-Minimization Meets Generative Modeling: Efficient Transition Path Sampling with the Onsager-Machlup Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transition path sampling (TPS), which involves finding probable paths connecting two points on an energy landscape, remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world atomistic systems. Current machine learning approaches use expensive, task-specific, and data-free training procedures, limiting their ability to benefit from recent advances in atomistic machine learning, such as high-quality datasets and large-scale pre-trained models. In this work, we address TPS by interpreting candidate paths as trajectories sampled from stochastic dynamics induced by the learned score function of pre-trained generative models, specifically denoising diffusion and flow matching. Under these dynamics, finding high-likelihood transition paths becomes equivalent to minimizing the Onsager-Machlup (OM) action functional. This enables us to repurpose pre-trained generative models for TPS in a zero-shot manner, in contrast with bespoke, task-specific TPS models trained in previous work. We demonstrate our approach on varied molecular systems, obtaining diverse, physically realistic transition pathways and generalizing beyond the pre-trained model's original training dataset. Our method can be easily incorporated into new generative models, making it practically relevant as models continue to scale and improve with increased data availability.</description>
