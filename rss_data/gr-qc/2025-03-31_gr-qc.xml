      <title>A conservative solution to the Singularity Problem in Classical GR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Singularities, as formulated in classical General Relativity (GR), have the undesirable property that all classical laws of physics break down at this point. This makes it difficult to probe before the Big Bang or resolve black hole information loss problems. In this paper, we propose a solution to the singularity problem using a Symmetry-Restoring Phase Transition (SRPT) at the black hole event horizon. We show that in such a scenario, the singularity is instead replaced by a higher-symmetry bubble manifold with a vanishing Weyl curvature tensor. We show that in-falling particles undergoing such a phase transition become massless, uncharged and have zero angular momentum inside the bubble manifold. We also show that no information is lost or destroyed in this process.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of long-duration gravitational wave signals originating from Galactic sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detection of quasi-monochromatic, long-duration (continuous) gravitational wave radiation emitted by, e.g., asymmetric rotating neutron stars in our Galaxy requires a long observation time to distinguish it from the detector's noise. If this signal is additionally microlensed by a lensing object located in the Galaxy, its magnitude would be temporarily magnified, which may lead to its discovery and allow probing of the physical nature of the lensing object and the source. We study the observational feasibility of Galactic microlensing of continuous gravitational wave signals in the point mass lens approximation by discussing the parameter space of the problem as well as by applying a gravitational wave detection method, the Time Domain F-statistic search, to ground-based detectors in the simulated data.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bogoliubov vs Boltzmann approaches in gravitational production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral behavior of scalar fluctuations generated by gravity during inflation and the subsequent reheating phase. We consider a non-perturbative Bogoliubov treatment within the context of pure gravitational reheating. We compute both long and short-wavelength spectra, first for a massless scalar field, revealing that the spectral index in part of the infrared (IR) regime varies between $-6$ and $-3$, depending on the post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $0\leq w_\phi\leq1$. Furthermore, we study the mass-breaking effect of the IR spectrum by including finite mass, $m_{\chi}$, of the daughter scalar field. We show that for $m_{\chi}/H_{\rm e} \gtrsim 3/2$, where $H_{\rm e}$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation, the IR spectrum of scalar fluctuations experiences exponential mass suppression, while for smaller masses, $m_{\chi}/\He&lt;3/2$, the spectrum remains flat in the IR regime regardless of the post-inflationary EoS. For any general EoS, we also compute a specific IR scale, $k_m$, of fluctuations below which the IR spectrum will suffer from this finite mass effect. In the UV regime, oscillations of the inflaton background lead to interference terms that explain the high-frequency oscillations in the spectrum. Interestingly, we find that for any EoS, $1/9 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$, the spectral behavior turns out to be independent of the EoS, with a spectral index $ -6$. We have compared this Bogoliubov treatment for the UV regime to perturbative computations with solutions to the Boltzmann equation and found an agreement between the two approaches for any EoS, $0 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$. We also explore the relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the reheating EoS employing the non-perturbative analytic approach, finding that reheating can occur for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.6$.</description>

      <title>Comparing Bondi and Novikov-Thorne accretion disk luminosity around regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider and compare the Bondi and Novikov-Thorne accretion mechanisms in spherically symmetric regular black holes. To do so, we model the dark matter distribution adopting two main approaches. The first takes into account a cosmologically-inspired dark fluid, whose pressure turns out to be constant, whereas the density and equation of state depend on the radial coordinate. The second case employs an exponential dark matter energy distribution that describes the dark matter cloud in the accretion process. Accordingly, we quantify the mass accreted by regular solutions with the above information on the energy-momentum tensor and their luminosity and thermal properties, derived from the background models. Numerical simulations of the accretion processes are then reported, comparing regular black holes with Schwarzschild and Schwarzschild-de Sitter metrics. In so doing, we consider the Hayward, Bardeen, Dymnikova and Fang-Wang solutions, where the addiction of a further parameter determines regularity. Implications and physical consequences of using the Novikov-Thorne and Bondi accretion backgrounds are thus critically discussed in varying the free parameters of each spacetime.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark photon on magnetized and charged particle orbits around static spherically symmetric black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate the problem of magnetized particle motion in the spacetime of a static, spherically symmetric black hole influenced by weak magnetic fields stemming from visible and dark matter sectors. The Wald's procedure for obtaining the weakly magnetized solution, generalized to the case of dark photon - Einstein-Maxwell gravity was implemented. The collision process analysis of two particles in the background of the black hole has been studied in order to find the signature of dark matter presence in the nearby of the object in question.</description>

      <title>Axial perturbations of black holes with primary scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study axial perturbations of static black holes with primary hair in a family of degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. These solutions possess a scalar charge, fully independent of the mass, leading to a continuous one-parameter deformation of the standard Schwarzschild black hole. Starting from these solutions, we also construct new black holes, solutions of other DHOST theories, obtained via disformal transformations of the metric. In particular, we investigate two specific types of disformal transformations: the first leading to a theory where gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light, the second to a Horndeski theory, where the equations of motion remain second order. The dynamics of axial perturbations can be formally related to the general relativistic equations of motion of axial perturbations in an effective metric. The causal structure of the effective metric differs from that of the background metric, leading to distinct gravitational and luminous horizons. Using a WKB approximation, we compute the quasi-normal modes for the Schr\"odinger-like equation associated with the effective metric outside the gravitational horizon.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Multi-Horizon Solutions in Quartic Quasitopological Gravity: A Power-Maxwell Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive exact black hole solutions within the framework of fourth-order quasitopological gravity (4QTG) coupled to power-law Maxwell electrodynamics in five-dimensional spacetimes. We explore the thermodynamic properties of these solutions, including entropy, temperature, and electric potential, and verify the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. Our analysis spans asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS), de Sitter (dS), and flat spacetimes, revealing that thermal stability is exclusively achievable in asymptotically AdS black holes, while dS and flat solutions exhibit universal instability. The study highlights the unique role of higher-curvature terms in modifying black hole thermodynamics and horizon structures, providing new insights into the interplay between geometry, thermodynamics, and quantum gravity via the AdS/CFT correspondence. Furthermore, we demonstrate that 4QTG supports multi-horizon black holes even in the absence of charge, a feature absent in Einstein gravity. These findings underscore the importance of higher-curvature corrections in resolving classical limitations of general relativity and offer new avenues for exploring quantum gravity and holographic duality.</description>

      <title>Volume in the Extensive Thermodynamics of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since black holes lack a straightforward notion of geometrical volume due to their event horizon structure and coordinate dependence, various approaches have been proposed to introduce a meaningful geometric and thermodynamic volume. There is no volume in classical black hole thermodynamics, the nonextensivity of black holes is a consequence. Extensivity of such systems can be restored by introducing a new thermodynamic state variable, typically the volume, the mass or the number of particles. Smarr relations show that black hole thermodynamics is nonextensive. However, restored extensivity leads to a volume which corresponds to geometric concepts and is also meaningful from a physical point of view. The article examines various volume definitions in the context of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes and their implications for phase transitions, focusing on the Hawking-Page transition in Kerr-AdS spacetime, including the Christodoulou-Rovelli volume.</description>

      <title>Generalized parameter-space metrics for continuous gravitational-wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many searches for continuous gravitational waves face significant computational challenges due to the need to explore large parameter spaces characterized by unknown parameters. Parameter-space metrics are used to predict the relative loss of signal power when the searched parameters differ from the true signal parameters. In this paper we present generalized parameter-space metrics for the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic (a detection statistic used in many searches) that improve upon previous idealized metrics by incorporating realistic effects such as data gaps and varying noise floors. We derive a new marginalized $\mathcal{F}$-statistic metric that is more accurate than the previous averaged $\mathcal{F}$-statistic metric, especially for short coherent segments. We also derive a more accurate semi-coherent metric that properly accounts for the signal-power variability over segments. We provide numerical tests illustrating that the new generalized metrics provide more accurate mismatch predictions than previous expressions. More accurate metrics can result in a reduced number of templates needed for a given search, a feature that could improve the sensitivity of future searches.</description>

      <title>NEC violation and "beyond Horndeski'' physics in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent DESI DR2 results provide compelling evidence that the dark energy equation of state evolves from $w&lt;-1$ at high redshift to $w&gt;-1$ today, reinforcing interest in null energy condition (NEC) violation. While NEC violation may be crucial for dark energy and solving the cosmological singularity problem, it generically leads to ghost or gradient instabilities. It is well established in the study of nonsingular cosmology that the effective field theory (EFT) operator $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$ enables fully stable NEC violation and represents ``beyond Horndeski'' physics. We investigate its implications in the observable Universe and confirm within the EFT framework that $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$ can also stabilize NEC violation in dark energy, as indicated by the latest DESI DR2 BAO observations. Furthermore, our results show that current data already impose a nontrivial constraint on the EFT coefficient $\tilde{m}^2_4$ associated with $\delta g^{00} R^{(3)}$, indicating $\tilde{m}^2_4 \neq 0$ at approximately $2\sigma$. This finding suggests an unexpected possible connection between the primordial Universe and the late observable Universe.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entropy-Driven Modifications to Holographic Dark Energy in $f(G,T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a $f(G,T)$ gravity-based reconstruction of Barrow Holographic Dark Energy (BHDE). This approach extends the conventional HDE model by replacing the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy with Barrow entropy, which encapsulates quantum gravitational corrections to the geometry of black hole horizons. We explore the cosmological dynamics of a flat FRW background filled with a pressureless dust fluid, considering both conserved and non-conserved energy-momentum tensor models. To this end, we employ the Hubble horizon as the infrared cutoff and adopt a power-law ansatz for the scale factor. We then investigate the evolution of key cosmological parameters, including the equation-of-state parameter \( \omega_{GT} \), the deceleration parameter \( q \), and the squared sound speed $v_s^2$. Furthermore, we explore the dynamical behavior in the $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ space. In the case of conserved energy-momentum tensor, our findings indicate that the BHDE model evolves from a quintessence-like regime into the phantom domain. This transition supports the current accelerated expansion of the Universe and offers an improvement over the original HDE model, which does not adequately account for the observed phenomenology. The corresponding $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ trajectory lies within the freezing region. On the other hand, within the non-conserved framework, the BHDE model exhibits phantom-like behavior in the early Universe, subsequently evolving toward either a cosmological constant-like state or a quintessence-like regime. Notably, unlike the conserved scenario, the squared sound speed $v_s^2$ asymptotically attains positive values in the far future. Moreover, the trajectory in the $\omega_{GT}-\omega'_{GT}$ phase space displays a thawing behavior. Finally, we evaluate the observational viability of our results and compare them with predictions from alternative reconstructed DE models.</description>

      <title>Shadow and gravitational lensing produced by the nonlinear accretion of a scalar field onto a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hypothesis that classical scalar fields could constitute dark matter on galactic and cosmic scales has garnered significant interest. In scenarios where supermassive black holes (SMBHs) form through the accretion of matter onto black hole seeds, a critical question arises: what role does dark matter play in this process? We conduct a numerical investigation into the nonlinear dynamical evolution of black hole shadows and gravitational lensing effects resulting from the accretion of an ultralight, real scalar field onto a non-rotating black hole. The scalar field is minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity, and our simulations focus on wave packets, parameterized by their wave number and width, as they interact with and are accreted by a dynamic black hole. Our results demonstrate significant growth in the apparent horizon, photon ring, and Einstein ring sizes compared to those of a Schwarzschild black hole. These findings suggest that the observed photon ring and black hole shadow in Sgr\,A*, and M87* may be influenced by the gravitational interaction between the black hole and ultralight scalar field dark matter.</description>

      <title>Diffraction around caustics in gravitational wave lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing magnification is maximal around caustics. At these source locations, an incoming wave from a point source would formally experience an infinite amplification in the high-frequency or geometric optics limit. This divergence reflects the break-down of the mathematical formalism, which is regularized by either the finite size of the source or its wavelength. We explore diffraction around caustics and their implications for the distortion of waveforms from point sources, focusing on three types of caustics: point singularities, folds, and cusps. We derive analytical results for the amplitude and phase of the diffracted waves, and compare those against the stationary phase approximation. We then study the observational signatures and detectability of these distortions on gravitational waves. We find that the lensing distortions could be detectable, but that the stationary phase approximation is still a good description of the system even close to the caustic, when the repeated gravitational wave chirps interfere with each other. We also quantify the possibility of distinguishing lensed signals from different caustics by performing Bayesian parameter estimation on simulated signals. Our results demonstrate that the universal distortions due to diffraction around caustics could be used to single out a gravitational wave event as lensed.</description>

      <title>Wave Interference in Self-Interacting Fuzzy Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Fuzzy Dark Matter (FDM) scenario, the dark matter is composed of an ultra-light scalar field with coherence length and wave interference on astrophysical scales. Scalar fields generically have quartic self-interactions that modify their dispersion relation and the associated evolution of density perturbations. We perform the first dedicated analysis of the role of wave interference on this evolution due to self-interactions in FDM and vice versa, developing a perturbative treatment applicable at early times and then comparing against a suite of fully nonlinear benchmark simulations, varying the dark matter density, interaction strength, and fiducial momentum scale. We explicitly simulate the limit where this momentum scale is relatively high compared with the scale of the simulation volume, applicable to cases where the dark matter is initially ``warm" due to causal constraints on a post-inflationary production or in virialized halos and other ``thermalized" cases with initially cold production. We find that in such scenarios, density perturbations are unable to grow on the expected self interaction time scale because of interference effects, instead saturating on the much shorter de Broglie crossing time, with a dependence on the sign of the interaction. Finally, we comment on the implications of our results for astrophysical systems such as high-density ultra-faint dwarf galaxies where wave interference plays an important role.</description>

Abstract: Source inference for deterministic gravitational waves is a computationally demanding task in LISA. In a novel approach, we investigate the capability of Gaussian Processes to learn the posterior surface in order to reconstruct individual signal posteriors. We use GPry, which automates this reconstruction through active learning, using a very small number of likelihood evaluations, without the need for pretraining. We benchmark GPry against the cutting-edge nested sampler nessai, by injecting individually three signals on LISA noisy data simulated with Balrog: a white dwarf binary (DWD), a stellar-mass black hole binary (stBHB), and a super-massive black hole binary (SMBHB). We find that GPry needs $\mathcal O(10^{-2})$ fewer likelihood evaluations to achieve an inference accuracy comparable to nessai, with Jensen-Shannon divergence $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.01$ for the DWD, and $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.05$ for the SMBHB. Lower accuracy is found for the less Gaussian posterior of the stBHB: $D_{\scriptscriptstyle \mathrm{JS}} \lesssim 0.2$. Despite the overhead costs of GPry, we obtain a speed-up of $\mathcal O(10^2)$ for the slowest cases of stBHB and SMBHB. In conclusion, active-learning Gaussian process frameworks show great potential for rapid LISA parameter inference, especially for costly likelihoods, enabling suppression of computational costs without the trade-off of approximations in the calculations.</description>

      <title>Singularities in Cosmological Loop Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we perform a systematic study of the singularity structure of inflationary correlations at 1-loop. We explicitly compute a few diagrams and find a pattern emerging in the singularities produced. Motivated by this, we derive diagrammatic rules to extract the singularities of any two-site 1-loop diagram. Using these rules, the poles and branch cuts produced can be predicted by simply identifying the energies flowing through certain subgraphs, without having to perform complicated integrals. We demonstrate how these rules follow by analyzing the general structure of the time and momentum integrals of the correlators. An interesting feature of de-Sitter correlators at 1-loop is the presence of an off-shell total energy branch point, which is present in dimensional regularization as well as cutoff regularization. We probe the source of this branch cut in detail, while revisiting the cosmological KLN theorem (arXiv:2308.00680) in this context. Finally, we show that the branch cuts produced in a renormalised correlator always repackage themselves in a dilatation invariant form to produce logarithms of ratios of comoving scales.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black holes stripping a subgiant star down to its helium core: a new type of multi-messenger source for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some stars orbiting supermassive black holes (SMBH) are expected to undergo a gravitational-wave (GW)-driven inspiral and initiate mass transfer on nearly circular orbits. However, the stability and duration of such phases remain unexplored. In this work, we focus on the evolution of a low-mass, radiative-envelope subgiant star being stripped by an SMBH. We find that such systems can undergo a long-lasting, stable mass-transfer phase, even if none of the angular momentum of the transferred material returns to the orbit to counterbalance the GW-driven decay. We show an example where a 2 Msun subgiant is stripped before entering the LISA band and loses almost its entire hydrogen envelope. The remaining helium core undergoes a prolonged GW-driven inspiral, becoming a loud LISA source. If formed in our galaxy, the system would be detectable for several hundred thousand years, ultimately reaching extreme signal-to-noise ratios of a million. Hydrogen shell flashes in the residual envelope cause temporary radial expansions of the stripped star. As a result, a few additional phases of rapid mass transfer occur at orbital periods of 20 - 30 hours. Eventually, the core possibly undergoes circular partial tidal disruption at an orbital period of ~10 minutes, corresponding to a GW emission frequency of a few mHz. We estimate a chance of about 1% that such a detectable LISA source exists in our own galactic center. The loud final GW transient may lead to a few detections reaching as far as ~1 Gpc, including, e.g., the Abell clusters.</description>

      <title>Boundedness and Morawetz estimates on subextremal Kerr de Sitter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Klein--Gordon equation $\Box_{g_{a,M,l}}\psi-\mu^2_{\textit{KG}}\psi=0$ on subextremal Kerr--de Sitter black hole backgrounds with parameters $(a,M,l)$, where $l^2=\frac{3}{\Lambda}$. We prove boundedness and Morawetz estimates assuming an appropriate mode stability statement for real frequency solutions of Carter's radial ode. Our results in particular apply in the very slowly rotating case $|a|\ll M,l$, and in the case where the solution~$\psi$ is axisymmetric. This generalizes the work of Dafermos--Rodnianski \cite{DR3} on Schwarzschild--de~Sitter.
  The boundedness and Morawetz results of the present paper will be used in our companion \cite{mavrogiannis2} to prove a `relatively non-degenerate integrated estimate' for subextremal Kerr--de Sitter black holes~(and as a consequence exponential decay). In a forthcoming paper \cite{mavrogiannis3}, this will immediately yield nonlinear stability results for quasilinear wave equations on subextremal Kerr--de Sitter backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: We study the Klein--Gordon equation $\Box\psi-\mu^2_{\textit{KG}}\psi=0$ on subextremal Kerr de Sitter black hole backgrounds with parameters $(a,M,l)$, where $l^2=\frac{3}{\Lambda}$. We prove a "relatively non degenerate integrated" decay estimate assuming an appropriate mode stability statement for real frequency solutions of Carter's radial ode. Our results, in particular, apply unconditionally in the very slowly rotating case $|a|\ll M,l$, and in the case where $\psi$ is axisymmetric. Exponential decay for $\psi$ to a constant is a consequence of this estimate.
  To prove our result, we introduce a novel pseudodifferential commutation operator $\mathcal{G}$ that generalizes our previous purely physical space commutation \cite{mavrogiannis} and we use it in conjunction with the Morawetz estimate of our companion \cite{mavrogiannis4}. This pseudodifferential operator is defined using Fourier decomposition with respect to time frequencies $\omega$ and azimuthal frequencies $m$, but does not require Carter's full separation.</description>

      <title>Auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of corotating hotspots in accretion disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent horizon-scale observations of the Sgr A* might open up a new window to study spacetime geometry and accretion matter in the strong-field regime of gravity. Due to the short gravitational timescale for Sgr A*, variable emissions near the galactic center are expected in the observations, including variability in the Sgr A* images and flare motions within ten times gravitational radius. In this paper, we investigate the spatiotemporal auto- and cross-correlations for multiple images of a long-lived corotating hotspot near the black hole. Using the recently developed efficient ray-tracing scheme for point-like sources, we extensively consider multiple images from primary to eighth-order in the correlations. We show that these correlations exhibit a repeated inclined band-like structure in the $\Delta \Phi$-$\Delta t$ plane. And there is a periodic modulation of width of the correlated bands, with the maximum bandwidth increasing with the inclination angles. The point-slope of correlated bands is determined by the lapse in azimuthal angle and time of multiple images, as well as the apparent rotation speed of hotspots. By comparing correlations for lower-order with those for higher-order images, it is found that the fixed points for cross-correlations between lower-order images depend on the orbital configurations of hotspots. It challenges the use of correlations for lower-order images to infer black hole geometries. Additionally, we also examine the influence from hotspot shapes based on semi-analytical formulas. Although the emission shape can significantly influence light curves, it does not change the correlated bands of the correlations.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically safe canonical quantum gravity: Gaussian dust matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent series of publications we have started to investigate possible points of contact between the canonical (CQG) and the asymptotically safe (ASQG) approach to quantum gravity, despite the fact that the CQG approach is exclusively for Lorentzian signature gravity while the ASQG approach is mostly for Euclidean signature gravity. Expectedly, the simplest route is via the generating functional of time ordered N-point functions which requires a Lorentzian version of the Wetterich equation and heat kernel methods employed in ASQG.
  In the present contribution we consider gravity coupled to Gaussian dust matter. This is a generally covariant Lorentzian signature system, which can be considered as a field theoretical implementation of the idealisation of a congruence of collision free test observers in free fall, filling the universe. The field theory version correctly accounts for geometry -- matter backreaction and thus in principle serves as a dark matter model. Moreover, the intuitive geometric interpretation selects a preferred reference frame that allows to disentangle gauge degrees of freedom from observables. The CQG treatment of this theory has already been considered in the past.
  For this particular matter content it is possible to formulate the quantum field theory of observables as a non-linear $\sigma$ model described by a highly non-linear conservative Hamiltonian. This allows to apply techniques from Euclidean field theory to derive the generating functional of Schwinger N-point functions which can be treated with the standard Euclidean version of the heat kernel methods employed in ASQG. The corresponding Euclidean action is closely related to Euclidean signature gravity but not identical to it despite the fact that the underlying Hamiltonian is for Lorentzian signature gravity.</description>

      <title>To CPL, or not to CPL? What we have not learned about the dark energy equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that using a Taylor expansion for the dark energy equation-of-state parameter and limiting it to the zeroth and first-order terms, i.e., the so-called Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization, instead of allowing for higher-order terms and then marginalizing over them, adds extra information not present in the data and leads to markedly different and potentially misleading conclusions. Fixing the higher-order terms to zero, one concludes that vacuum energy that is currently non-dynamical (e.g., the cosmological constant) is excluded at several $\sigma$ significance as the explanation of cosmic acceleration, even in Dark Energy Spectroscopic Survey (DESI) DR1 data. Meanwhile, instead marginalizing over the higher-order terms shows that we know neither the current dark energy equation of state nor its current rate of change well enough to make such a claim. This issue has become more prominent now with the recent release of high-quality Stage IV galaxy survey data. The results of analyses using simple Taylor expansions should be interpreted with great care.</description>

      <title>Supporting traversable wormholes: the case for noncommutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08392v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While wormholes may be just as good a prediction of Einstein's theory as black holes, they are subject to severe restrictions from quantum field theory. In particular, a wormhole can only be held open by violating the null energy condition, calling for the existence of "exotic matter." An equally serious problem is the enormous radial tension at the throat of a typical Morris-Thorne wormhole unless the wormhole has an extremely large throat size. It has been proposed that noncommutative geometry, an offshoot of string theory, may be the proper tool for addressing these issues. The purpose of this paper is two-fold: (1) to refine previous arguments to make a stronger and more detailed case for this proposal and (2) to obtain a complete wormhole solution from the given conditions.</description>

      <title>Schwarzschild Black Hole Surrounded by Perfect Fluid Dark Matter in the presence of Quintessence Matter Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an exact solution for a spherically symmetric Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter (PFDM) in the presence of a quintessence field. We investigate the impact of dark matter on the black hole's thermodynamic and optical properties, as well as its quasinormal modes. Our analysis reveals a critical radius where the heat capacity becomes positive, indicating the thermodynamic stability of the black hole. Notably, this critical radius increases with the dark matter parameter $\alpha$. Additionally, we find that as the effects of dark matter increase, the black hole's shadow radius decreases. Using the WKB approximation, we show that the quasinormal mode spectrum differs from that of a standard Schwarzschild black hole due to the influence of PFDM. Moreover, we demonstrate that as $\alpha$ increases, both the real part and the magnitude of the imaginary part of the quasinormal mode frequencies increase. This suggests that field perturbations decay more rapidly in the presence of PFDM compared to those in a Schwarzschild black hole.</description>

      <title>Symmetric black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01780v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a system with a Hamiltonian constraint, we demonstrate that its dynamics is invariant under different choices of the lapse function, regardless of whether the Hamiltonian incorporates quantum corrections. Applying this observation to the interior of black-to-white holes, we analyze its dynamics with different choices of the lapse function. The results explicitly show that the leading-order expansion of both metrics proposed by Rovelli et al. (Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 225003 (2018); Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 215010 (2018)) and Ashtekar et al. (Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{121}, 241301 (2018); Phys. Rev. D \textbf{98}, 126003 (2018)) exhibit identical behavior near the transition surface. Therefore, in this sense the black-to-white hole model proposed by Rovelli et al., (Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 225003 (2018); Class. Quant. Grav. \textbf{35}, 215010 (2018)) may be interpreted as a coarse-grained version of the solution within the framework of loop quantum gravity. The black-to-white hole solutions with exact symmetry between the black hole and white hole regions are constructed by appropriately fixing the quantum parameters in the effective theory of loop quantum gravity. This approach circumvents the issue of amplification of mass, which could arise from a mass difference between the black hole and white hole, and provides a way to link the solutions obtained by minisuperspace quantization to those in the covariant approach. Finally, the black-to-white hole solutions with a cosmological constant are constructed. The numerical solutions for the interior of the black-to-white hole with a cosmological constant are obtained, and their symmetric behavior is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type N spacetimes of the Kundt class are presented as solutions to Einstein's equations sourced by a real scalar field whose equation of motion is conformally invariant and that generalizes the standard conformal scalar field. The specific spacetimes considered model gravitational waves with uniform and totally geodesic wave fronts, propagating in a maximally symmetric background, and are characterized by the value of their constant scalar curvature and by the so-called wave profile function. All subclasses of such spacetimes are analyzed. It is shown that the scalar field solutions generically divide into two branches, of which one has a strikingly different behavior from that of the standard conformal case. The scalar field contributes to the equation satisfied by the wave profile function by adding new singular terms. Closed form and mode solutions for the wave profile function are found for different scenarios. The resulting energy-momentum tensor has a null eigenvector, but is more general than the pure radiation type usually coupled with this kind of spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10770v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological first-order phase transition (FOPT) sources the stochastic gravitational wave background (SWGB) through bubble collisions, sound waves, and turbulence. So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding bubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale than the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects on the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we combine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid computation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing (1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find that the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup, which qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time behavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the energy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid profile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment on the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.</description>

Abstract: We derive the model of the Schwarzschild black hole immersed into a dark matter halo with a relativistic Hernquist profile, the Schwarzschild-Hernquist black hole, and obtain its tidal Love numbers and quasi-normal modes. We thoroughly compare our odd and even parity perturbation equations with the literature and point out that two distinct choices of matter perturbations lead to distinct spectra. We establish that the quasi-normal modes admit qualitatively distinct scaling laws in terms of dark matter densities for non-relativistic and relativistic halos. We develop a stable numerical scheme for computing tidal Love numbers based on asymptotic series expansions. We further comment upon the existence of matter configurations obeying the dominant energy condition that lead to multiple light rings.</description>

      <title>Rough estimates of solar system gravitomagnetic effects in post-Newtonian gravity</title>

Abstract: In order to describe properly the gravity interactions including the mass currents, in the gravitomagnetism we construct four Maxwell type gravitational equations which are shown to be analogs of the Maxwell equations in the electromagnetism. Next, exploiting the Maxwell type gravitational equations, we explicitly predict the mass magnetic fields for both the isolated system of the spinning Moon orbiting the spinning Earth and that of the Sun and solar system planets orbiting the spinning Sun, whose phenomenological values have not been evaluated in the precedented Newtonian gravity formalisms. In the gravitomagnetism we also phenomenologically investigate the mass magnetic general relativity (GR) forces associated with the mass magnetic fields, to find that they are extremely small but non-vanishing compared to the corresponding mass electric Newtonian forces. Moreover, the directions of the mass magnetic GR forces for the solar system planets except Venus and Uranus are shown to be anti-parallel to those of their mass electric Newtonian forces. Next we investigate the mass magnetic dipole moment related with the B-ring of Saturn, to evaluate $\vec{m}_{M}(Ring)=-1.141\times 10^{4}~{\rm m^{3}~sec^{-1}}~\hat{\omega}$ with $\hat{\omega}$ being the unit vector along the axis direction of the spinning B-ring. The predicted value of $\vec{m}_{M}(Ring)$ is shown to be directly related with the Cassini data on the total mass of the rings of Saturn.</description>

      <title>Improving the Detection of Gravitational-Wave Signals in Real Time</title>

Abstract: This thesis presents advancements in the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences, utilising the most sensitive observatories constructed to date. The research focuses on enhancing gravitational-wave signal searches through the development of new tools and the application of existing methodologies to increase the sensitivity of live gravitational-wave searches. We introduced a novel noise artefact model, which enabled the identification and removal of glitches, thereby facilitating the recovery of previously missed gravitational-wave injections. This pioneering approach established a glitch search pipeline that adapted techniques typically used in gravitational-wave searches to address the unique characteristics of glitches. Additionally, we implemented an exponential noise model within the PyCBC Live search framework, significantly improving the detection ranking statistics for gravitational-wave signals and demonstrating the potential for substantial increases in detection sensitivity. Furthermore, we analysed and proposed enhancements for the PyCBC Live Early Warning search to maximise the detection of gravitational-wave events in the early warning regime. Our findings highlighted deficiencies in the current ranking statistic and led to recommendations for optimising coincidence timing windows and refining phase-time-amplitude histograms. These adjustments aim to increase the detection of gravitational-wave signals, particularly binary neutron star events, in early warning scenarios. The results underscore the importance of advancing search techniques in gravitational-wave astronomy, which can operate independently of detector improvements. By refining search methodologies, we enhance the capacity to detect a greater number of events, contributing significantly to our understanding of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Cosmic topology. Part Ic. Limits on lens spaces from circle searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarization observations indicate that in the best-fit $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter model of the Universe, the local geometry is consistent with at most a small amount of positive or negative curvature, i.e., $\vert\Omega_K\vert\ll1$. However, whether the geometry is flat ($E^3$), positively curved ($S^3$) or negatively curved ($H^3$), there are many possible topologies. Among the topologies of $S^3$ geometry, the lens spaces $L(p,q)$, where $p$ and $q$ ($p&gt;1$ and $0&lt;q&lt;p$) are positive integers, are quotients of the covering space of $S^3$ (the three-sphere) by ${\mathbb{Z}}_p$, the cyclic group of order $p$. We use the absence of any pair of circles on the CMB sky with matching patterns of temperature fluctuations to establish constraints on $p$ and $q$ as a function of the curvature scale that are considerably stronger than those previously asserted for most values of $p$ and $q$. The smaller the value of $\vert\Omega_K\vert$, i.e., the larger the curvature radius, the larger the maximum allowed value of $p$. For example, if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.05$ then $p\leq 9 $, while if $\vert\Omega_K\vert\simeq 0.02$, $p$ can be as high as 24. Future work will extend these constraints to a wider set of $S^{3}$ topologies.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole by constructing non-perturbative length and timeshift operators in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We first construct projection operators onto the fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift subspaces using the replica trick. We calculate the densities of state for the length and the timeshift, which are found to be finite. This finiteness implies the discreteness in the spectrum of these quantities. We then construct the non-perturbative length and timeshift operators, and apply them to study the time evolution of the two-sided black hole. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty. In particular, the probability of having the negative timeshift states, which corresponds to the white hole probability, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>Effective Actions for Domain Wall Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic method to derive the effective action for domain walls directly from the scalar field theory that gives rise to their solitonic solutions. The effective action for the Goldstone mode, which characterizes the soliton's position, is shown to consist of the Nambu-Goto action supplemented by higher-order curvature invariants associated to its worldvolume metric. Our approach constrains the corrections to a finite set of Galileon terms, specifying both their functional forms and the procedure to compute their coefficients. We do a collection of tests across various models in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions that confirm the validity of this framework. Additionally, the method is extended to include bound scalar fields living on the worldsheet, along with their couplings to the Goldstone mode. These interactions reveal a universal non-minimal coupling of these scalar fields to the Ricci scalar on the worldsheet. A significant consequence of this coupling is the emergence of a parametric instability, driven by interactions between the bound states and the Goldstone mode.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry as a gauge theory of gravity: covariant equations of motion &amp; conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16548v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Weyl conformal geometry as a general gauge theory of the Weyl group (of Poincar\'e and dilatations symmetries) in a manifestly Weyl gauge covariant formalism in which this geometry is automatically metric and physically relevant. This gives a realistic (quadratic) gauge theory of gravity, with Einstein-Hilbert gravity recovered in its spontaneously broken phase, motivating our interest in this geometry. For the most general action we compute the manifestly Weyl gauge covariant equations of motion and present the conservation laws for the energy-momentum tensor and Weyl gauge current. These laws are valid both in Weyl conformal geometry (with respect to the Weyl gauge covariant derivative) but also in the Riemannian geometry equivalent picture (with respect to its associated covariant derivative). This interesting result is a consequence of gauged diffeomorphism invariance of the former versus usual diffeomorphism invariance of the latter. These results are first derived in $d=4$ dimensions. We then successfully derive the conservation laws and equations of motion in Weyl conformal geometry in arbitrary $d$ dimensions, while maintaining manifest Weyl gauge invariance/covariance. The results are useful in physical applications with this symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent proposal reinterprets the eikonal as the scattering generator, which computes scattering observables through an action as a symmetry generator. The aim of this study is to incorporate dissipative effects from radiation into this framework, where the eikonal is generalised to the radiation eikonal by including mediator field degrees of freedom. The proposed generalisation is tested through several post-Minkowskian scattering observables; scattering waveform, radiated momentum, and (time asymmetric) radiation loss in the impulse.</description>

      <title>Holographic Description of Bulk Wave Packets in AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the study of wave packets from the AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence to AdS$_4$/CFT$_3$ and examine properties of their energy density. We find that, while the energy still localizes on the light cone, its spatial distribution exhibits momentum dependence and is no longer localized in higher dimensions. This result is significant as it reflects leading $1/N$ corrections to the generalized free field theory associated with the free bulk theory at $N=\infty$. Our findings are consistent with previous studies on entanglement wedge reconstruction including $1/N$ corrections, and also provide new insights into the structure of wave packets in higher-dimensional holography.</description>
