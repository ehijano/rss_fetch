      <title>StyleSpeaker: Audio-Enhanced Fine-Grained Style Modeling for Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation is challenging due to the diversity in speaking styles and the limited availability of 3D audio-visual data. Speech predominantly dictates the coarse motion trends of the lip region, while specific styles determine the details of lip motion and the overall facial expressions. Prior works lack fine-grained learning in style modeling and do not adequately consider style biases across varying speech conditions, which reduce the accuracy of style modeling and hamper the adaptation capability to unseen speakers. To address this, we propose a novel framework, StyleSpeaker, which explicitly extracts speaking styles based on speaker characteristics while accounting for style biases caused by different speeches. Specifically, we utilize a style encoder to capture speakers' styles from facial motions and enhance them according to motion preferences elicited by varying speech conditions. The enhanced styles are then integrated into the coarse motion features via a style infusion module, which employs a set of style primitives to learn fine-grained style representation. Throughout training, we maintain this set of style primitives to comprehensively model the entire style space. Hence, StyleSpeaker possesses robust style modeling capability for seen speakers and can rapidly adapt to unseen speakers without fine-tuning. Additionally, we design a trend loss and a local contrastive loss to improve the synchronization between synthesized motions and speeches. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>AudioX: Diffusion Transformer for Anything-to-Audio Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio and music generation have emerged as crucial tasks in many applications, yet existing approaches face significant limitations: they operate in isolation without unified capabilities across modalities, suffer from scarce high-quality, multi-modal training data, and struggle to effectively integrate diverse inputs. In this work, we propose AudioX, a unified Diffusion Transformer model for Anything-to-Audio and Music Generation. Unlike previous domain-specific models, AudioX can generate both general audio and music with high quality, while offering flexible natural language control and seamless processing of various modalities including text, video, image, music, and audio. Its key innovation is a multi-modal masked training strategy that masks inputs across modalities and forces the model to learn from masked inputs, yielding robust and unified cross-modal representations. To address data scarcity, we curate two comprehensive datasets: vggsound-caps with 190K audio captions based on the VGGSound dataset, and V2M-caps with 6 million music captions derived from the V2M dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AudioX not only matches or outperforms state-of-the-art specialized models, but also offers remarkable versatility in handling diverse input modalities and generation tasks within a unified architecture. The code and datasets will be available at https://zeyuet.github.io/AudioX/</description>

      <title>Honey Trap or Romantic Utopia: A Case Study of Final Fantasy XIV Players PII Disclosure in Intimate Partner-Seeking Posts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) can foster social interaction and relationship formation, but they pose specific privacy and safety challenges, especially in the context of mediating intimate interpersonal connections. To explore the potential risks, we conducted a case study on Final Fantasy XIV (FFXIV) players intimate partner seeking posts on social media. We analyzed 1,288 posts from a public Weibo account using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling and thematic analysis. Our findings reveal that players disclose sensitive personal information and share vulnerabilities to establish trust but face difficulties in managing identity and privacy across multiple platforms. We also found that players expectations regarding intimate partner are diversified, and mismatch of expectations may leads to issues like privacy leakage or emotional exploitation. Based on our findings, we propose design implications for reducing privacy and safety risks and fostering healthier social interactions in virtual worlds.</description>

      <title>PanoGen++: Domain-Adapted Text-Guided Panoramic Environment Generation for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) tasks require agents to navigate three-dimensional environments guided by natural language instructions, offering substantial potential for diverse applications. However, the scarcity of training data impedes progress in this field. This paper introduces PanoGen++, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by generating varied and pertinent panoramic environments for VLN tasks. PanoGen++ incorporates pre-trained diffusion models with domain-specific fine-tuning, employing parameter-efficient techniques such as low-rank adaptation to minimize computational costs. We investigate two settings for environment generation: masked image inpainting and recursive image outpainting. The former maximizes novel environment creation by inpainting masked regions based on textual descriptions, while the latter facilitates agents' learning of spatial relationships within panoramas. Empirical evaluations on room-to-room (R2R), room-for-room (R4R), and cooperative vision-and-dialog navigation (CVDN) datasets reveal significant performance enhancements: a 2.44% increase in success rate on the R2R test leaderboard, a 0.63% improvement on the R4R validation unseen set, and a 0.75-meter enhancement in goal progress on the CVDN validation unseen set. PanoGen++ augments the diversity and relevance of training environments, resulting in improved generalization and efficacy in VLN tasks.</description>

      <title>Image Quality Assessment: From Human to Machine Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) based on human subjective preferences has undergone extensive research in the past decades. However, with the development of communication protocols, the visual data consumption volume of machines has gradually surpassed that of humans. For machines, the preference depends on downstream tasks such as segmentation and detection, rather than visual appeal. Considering the huge gap between human and machine visual systems, this paper proposes the topic: Image Quality Assessment for Machine Vision for the first time. Specifically, we (1) defined the subjective preferences of machines, including downstream tasks, test models, and evaluation metrics; (2) established the Machine Preference Database (MPD), which contains 2.25M fine-grained annotations and 30k reference/distorted image pair instances; (3) verified the performance of mainstream IQA algorithms on MPD. Experiments show that current IQA metrics are human-centric and cannot accurately characterize machine preferences. We sincerely hope that MPD can promote the evolution of IQA from human to machine preferences. Project page is on: https://github.com/lcysyzxdxc/MPD.</description>

      <title>Efficient Adapter Tuning for Joint Singing Voice Beat and Downbeat Tracking with Self-supervised Learning Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing voice beat tracking is a challenging task, due to the lack of musical accompaniment that often contains robust rhythmic and harmonic patterns, something most existing beat tracking systems utilize and can be essential for estimating beats. In this paper, a novel temporal convolutional network-based beat-tracking approach featuring self-supervised learning (SSL) representations and adapter tuning is proposed to track the beat and downbeat of singing voices jointly. The SSL DistilHuBERT representations are utilized to capture the semantic information of singing voices and are further fused with the generic spectral features to facilitate beat estimation. Sources of variabilities that are particularly prominent with the non-homogeneous singing voice data are reduced by the efficient adapter tuning. Extensive experiments show that feature fusion and adapter tuning improve the performance individually, and the combination of both leads to significantly better performances than the un-adapted baseline system, with up to 31.6% and 42.4% absolute F1-score improvements on beat and downbeat tracking, respectively.</description>

      <title>Proxy-Tuning: Tailoring Multimodal Autoregressive Models for Subject-Driven Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal autoregressive (AR) models, based on next-token prediction and transformer architecture, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various multimodal tasks including text-to-image (T2I) generation. Despite their strong performance in general T2I tasks, our research reveals that these models initially struggle with subject-driven image generation compared to dominant diffusion models. To address this limitation, we introduce Proxy-Tuning, leveraging diffusion models to enhance AR models' capabilities in subject-specific image generation. Our method reveals a striking weak-to-strong phenomenon: fine-tuned AR models consistently outperform their diffusion model supervisors in both subject fidelity and prompt adherence. We analyze this performance shift and identify scenarios where AR models excel, particularly in multi-subject compositions and contextual understanding. This work not only demonstrates impressive results in subject-driven AR image generation, but also unveils the potential of weak-to-strong generalization in the image generation domain, contributing to a deeper understanding of different architectures' strengths and limitations.</description>

      <title>ImageScope: Unifying Language-Guided Image Retrieval via Large Multimodal Model Collective Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the proliferation of images in online content, language-guided image retrieval (LGIR) has emerged as a research hotspot over the past decade, encompassing a variety of subtasks with diverse input forms. While the development of large multimodal models (LMMs) has significantly facilitated these tasks, existing approaches often address them in isolation, requiring the construction of separate systems for each task. This not only increases system complexity and maintenance costs, but also exacerbates challenges stemming from language ambiguity and complex image content, making it difficult for retrieval systems to provide accurate and reliable results. To this end, we propose ImageScope, a training-free, three-stage framework that leverages collective reasoning to unify LGIR tasks. The key insight behind the unification lies in the compositional nature of language, which transforms diverse LGIR tasks into a generalized text-to-image retrieval process, along with the reasoning of LMMs serving as a universal verification to refine the results. To be specific, in the first stage, we improve the robustness of the framework by synthesizing search intents across varying levels of semantic granularity using chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. In the second and third stages, we then reflect on retrieval results by verifying predicate propositions locally, and performing pairwise evaluations globally. Experiments conducted on six LGIR datasets demonstrate that ImageScope outperforms competitive baselines. Comprehensive evaluations and ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our design.</description>

      <title>IDEA: Inverted Text with Cooperative Deformable Aggregation for Multi-modal Object Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal object Re-IDentification (ReID) aims to retrieve specific objects by utilizing complementary information from various modalities. However, existing methods focus on fusing heterogeneous visual features, neglecting the potential benefits of text-based semantic information. To address this issue, we first construct three text-enhanced multi-modal object ReID benchmarks. To be specific, we propose a standardized multi-modal caption generation pipeline for structured and concise text annotations with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Besides, current methods often directly aggregate multi-modal information without selecting representative local features, leading to redundancy and high complexity. To address the above issues, we introduce IDEA, a novel feature learning framework comprising the Inverted Multi-modal Feature Extractor (IMFE) and Cooperative Deformable Aggregation (CDA). The IMFE utilizes Modal Prefixes and an InverseNet to integrate multi-modal information with semantic guidance from inverted text. The CDA adaptively generates sampling positions, enabling the model to focus on the interplay between global features and discriminative local features. With the constructed benchmarks and the proposed modules, our framework can generate more robust multi-modal features under complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on three multi-modal object ReID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Recommendation System in E-commerce using Passer learning optimization based on Bi-LSTM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online reviews play a crucial role in shaping consumer decisions, especially in the context of e-commerce. However, the quality and reliability of these reviews can vary significantly. Some reviews contain misleading or unhelpful information, such as advertisements, fake content, or irrelevant details. These issues pose significant challenges for recommendation systems, which rely on user-generated reviews to provide personalized suggestions. This article introduces a recommendation system based on Passer Learning Optimization-enhanced Bi-LSTM classifier applicable to e-commerce recommendation systems with improved accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. It achieves as low as 1.24% MSE on the baby dataset. This lifts it as high as 88.58%. Besides, there is also robust performance of the system on digital music and patio lawn garden datasets at F1 of 88.46% and 92.51%, correspondingly. These results, made possible by advanced graph embedding for effective knowledge extraction and fine-tuning of classifier parameters, establish the suitability of the proposed model in various e-commerce environments.</description>

      <title>ReLaX-VQA: Residual Fragment and Layer Stack Extraction for Enhancing Video Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11496v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild is increasingly evident. UGC is typically acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression (transcoding) before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that employ the original content as a reference are not suitable. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the quality of diverse video content without reference to the original uncompressed videos. ReLaX-VQA uses frame differences to select spatio-temporal fragments intelligently together with different expressions of spatial features associated with the sampled frames. These are then used to better capture spatial and temporal variabilities in the quality of neighbouring frames. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers. Extensive testing across four UGC datasets demonstrates that ReLaX-VQA consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving an average SRCC of 0.8658 and PLCC of 0.8873. Open-source code and trained models that will facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA can be found at https://github.com/xinyiW915/ReLaX-VQA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08137v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
