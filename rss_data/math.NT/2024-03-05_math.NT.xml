      <title>Sharp bounds for joint moments of the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In previous work, the first author obtained conjecturally sharp upper bounds for the joint moments of the $(2k-2h)^{\text{th}}$ power of the Riemann zeta function with the $2h^{\text{th}}$ power of its derivative on the critical line in the range $1\leq k \leq 2$, $0 \leq h \leq 1$. Unconditionally, we extend these upper bounds to all $0 \leq h\leq k \leq 2$, and obtain lower bounds for all $0\leq h \leq k+1/2$. Assuming the Riemann hypothesis, we give sharp bounds for all $0\leq h \leq k$. We also prove upper bounds of the conjectured order for more general joint moments of zeta with its higher derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a family of elliptic curves defined by $E_{m}: y^2= x^3 -m^2 x + (pqr)^2 $ where $m $ is a positive integer and $p, q, ~\text{and}~ r$ are distinct odd primes and study the torsion as well the rank of $E_{m}(\mathbb{Q})$. More specifically, we proved that if $m \not \equiv 0 \pmod{3}, m \not \equiv 0 \pmod{4} ~\text{and}~ m \equiv 2 \pmod {2^{k}}$ where $k \geq 5$, then the torsion subgroup of $E_{m}(\mathbb{Q})$ is trivial and lower bound of the $\mathbb{Q}$ rank of this family of elliptic curves is $2$.</description>

      <title>On q-series and the moment problem associated to local factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the moment problem and Jacobi matrix associated-- by the operator theoretic framework of the semilocal trace formula-- to each finite set $S$ of places of $\mathbb Q$ containing the archimedean place. The measure is given by the absolute value squared of the product over $S$ of local factors restricted to the critical line. We treat the case $S=\{p,\infty\}$, where a single prime $p$ is adjoined to the archimedean place. We find that all the key ingredients such as the moments, the orthogonal polynomials and the Jacobi matrices can be expressed as power series in terms of the parameter $q:=1/p$. We show that the series which appear for the moments themselves are Lambert series. The study of the $q$-series for the coefficients of the Jacobi matrix, and for the associated orthogonal polynomials reveals an intriguing integrality result: all those coefficients belong to the ring $\mathbb Z[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$ obtained by adjoining $1 / \sqrt{2}$ to the ring of integers. The main result of this paper is the conceptual explanation of this integrality property using Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of $p^2$-discriminant ideal twins over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isogenous elliptic curves have the same conductor but not necessarily the same minimal discriminant ideal. In this article, we explicitly classify all $p^2$-isogenous elliptic curves defined over a number field with the same minimal discriminant ideal for odd prime $p$ where $X_0(p^2)$ has genus $0$, i.e., $p = 3$ or $5$. As a consequence, we give a list of all $p^2$-isogenous discriminant (ideal) twins over $\mathbb{Q}$ for such $p$.</description>

      <title>On the adjoint Selmer groups of semi-stable elliptic curves and Flach's zeta elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explicitly construct the rank one primitive Stark (equivalently, Kolyvagin) system extending a constant multiple of Flach's zeta elements for semi-stable elliptic curves. As its arithmetic applications, we obtain the equivalence between a specific behavior of the Stark system and the minimal modularity lifting theorem, and we also discuss the cyclicity of the adjoint Selmer groups. This Stark system construction yields a more refined interpretation of the collection of Flach's zeta elements than the "geometric Euler system" approach due to Flach, Wiles, Mazur, and Weston.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an effective universality theorem of the Riemann zeta-function in short intervals $[T,T+H]$ with $T^{\frac{27}{82}}\le H\le T$ by following an effective multidimensional $\Omega$-result of Voronin. Furthermore, we also prove the results in short intervals $[T,T+H]$ with $T^\epsilon\le H\le T$ (for any fixed $\epsilon&gt;0$) under the assumption of the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Linear Congruences in several variables with congruence restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we consider systems of linear congruences in several variables and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions as well as explicit expressions for the number of solutions subject to certain restriction conditions. These results are in terms of Ramanujan sums and generalize the results of Lehmer \cite{DNL13} and Bibak et al. \cite{BBVRL17}. These results have analogues over $\mathbb{F}_q[t]$ where the proofs are similar, once notions such as Ramanujan sums are defined in this set-up. We use the recent description of Ramanujan sums over function fields as developed by Zhiyong Zheng \cite{ZZ18}. This is discussed in the last section. We illustrate the formulae obtained for the number of solutions through some examples. Over the integers, such problems have a rich history, some of which seem to have been forgotten - a number of papers written on the topic re-prove known results. The present authors also became aware of some of these old articles only while writing the present article and hence, we recall very briefly some of the old work by H. J. S. Smith, Rademacher, Brauer, Butson and Stewart, Ramanathan, McCarthy, and Spilker \cite{AB26, BS55, PJM76, HR25, KGR44, HJSS61, JS96}.</description>

      <title>Linear Congruences and a Conjecture of Bibak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address three questions posed by Bibak \cite{KB20}, and generalize some results of Bibak, Lehmer and K G Ramanathan on solutions of linear congruences $\sum_{i=1}^k a_i x_i \equiv b \Mod{n}$. In particular, we obtain explicit expressions for the number of solutions where $x_i$'s are squares modulo $n$. In addition, we obtain expressions for the number of solutions with order restrictions $x_1 \geq \cdots \geq x_k$ or, with strict order restrictions $x_1&gt; \cdots &gt; x_k$ in some special cases. In these results, the expressions for the number of solutions involve Ramanujan sums and are obtained using their properties.</description>

      <title>Rational distances from given rational points in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider sets of points in the plane with rational distances from a prescribed finite set of $n$ rational points. We show that for $n\le 3$, the points are dense in the real topology. On the other hand, for $n\ge 4$, we show that they correspond to rational points in a surface of general type, hence conjecturally degenerate. However, at the present, we lack methods to prove this, given the fact that the surface is simply-connected, as we shall show. We give explicit proofs as well as describe in detail the geometry of the surfaces involved. In addition we discuss certain cases of density of points with distances in certain ring of integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a discrete valuation ring $R$ with quotient field $K$ and residue field $F$ both of characteristic not 2, we study low-dimensional quadratic forms with Witt class in the $n$-th power of the fundamental ideal of $F$ resp. $K$ and point out connections between forms over these fields. We analyse the minimal number of Pfister forms such that a given form is Witt equivalent to the sum of these and study forms congruent modulo a higher power of the fundamental ideal towards similarity.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of short character sums and real zeros of Fekete polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a typical fundamental discriminant $D,$ the partial sums of the real character $\chi_D$ change sign $\gg (\log\log D)/\log\log\log \log D$ times on a very short initial interval (which goes beyond the range in Vinogradov's conjecture).
  We also prove that the number of real zeros (localized away from $1$) of Fekete polynomials associated to a typical fundamental discriminant is $\gg \frac{\log\log D}{\log\log\log\log D}.$ This comes close to establishing a conjecture of Baker and Montgomery which predicts $\asymp \log \log D$ real zeros.
  These results rely crucially on quantitative estimates for the joint distribution of $-\frac{L'}{L}(s, \chi_D)$ at several points $s$ in the vicinity of the central point $s=1/2$, as well as concentration results for $\log L(s,\chi_D)$ in the same range, which we establish.
  In the second part of the paper, we obtain, for large families of discriminants, non-trivial upper bounds on the number of real zeros of Fekete polynomials, breaking the square root bound. Finally, we construct families of discriminants with associated Fekete polynomials having no zeros away from $1.$</description>

      <title>On odd-normal numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A real number $x$ is considered normal in an integer base $b \geq 2$ if its digit expansion in this base is ``equitable'', ensuring that for each $k \geq 1$, every ordered sequence of $k$ digits from $\{0, 1, \ldots, b-1\}$ occurs in the digit expansion of $x$ with the same limiting frequency. Borel's classical result \cite{b09} asserts that Lebesgue-almost every $x \in \mathbb R$ is normal in every base $b \geq 2$. This paper serves as a case study of the measure-theoretic properties of Lebesgue-null sets containing numbers that are normal only in certain bases. We consider the set $\mathscr N(\mathscr{O}, \mathscr{E})$ of reals that are normal in odd bases but not in even ones. This set has full Hausdorff dimension \cite{p81} but zero Fourier dimension. The latter condition means that $\mathscr N(\mathscr{O}, \mathscr{E})$ cannot support a probability measure whose Fourier transform has power decay at infinity. Our main result is that $\mathscr N(\mathscr{O}, \mathscr{E})$ supports a Rajchman measure $\mu$, whose Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}(\xi)$ approaches 0 as $|\xi| \rightarrow \infty$ by definiton, albeit slower than any negative power of $|\xi|$. Moreover, the decay rate of $\widehat{\mu}$ is essentially optimal, subject to the constraints of its support. The methods draw inspiration from the number-theoretic results of Schmidt \cite{s60} and a construction of Lyons \cite{l86}. As a consequence, $\mathscr N(\mathscr{O}, \mathscr{E})$ emerges as a set of multiplicity, in the sense of Fourier analysis. This addresses a question posed by Kahane and Salem \cite{Kahane-Salem-64} in the special case of $\mathscr N(\mathscr{O}, \mathscr{E})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. We characterize the oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups whose $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra yields no essential $n$-fold Massey products for every $n&gt;2$, in terms of the associated oriented graph. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{F}_p$-cohomology algebra of such oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ groups is isomorphic to the exterior Stanley-Reisner $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra associated to the same oriented graph. This work also aims at providing a concrete and group-theoretic introduction to the study of Massey products in Galois cohomology for non-specialists, especially graduate students working in profinite group theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address a prime counting problem across the homology classes of a graph, presenting a graph-theoretical Dirichlet-type analogue of the prime number theorem. The main machinery we have developed and employed is a spectral antisymmetry theorem, revealing that the spectra of the twisted graph adjacency matrices have an antisymmetric distribution over the character group of the graph. Additionally, we derive some trace formulas based on the twisted adjacency matrices as part of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Cohomological flatness over discrete valuation rings: numerical and logarithmic criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give sufficient conditions for cohomological flatness (in dimension 0) over discrete valuation rings, generalising a classical result of Raynaud in two different ways. The first is an extension of Raynaud's numerical criterion to higher dimensions. The second is a logarithmic criterion: we show that a proper, fs log smooth morphism to a log regular discrete valuation ring is cohomologically flat in dimension 0. We apply this latter result to curves and torsors under abelian varieties with good reduction, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for the log smoothness of their regular models over arbitrary discrete valuation rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $F$-gauges for de Rham cohomology of smooth algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$. Applying to good reductions of Shimura varieties of Hodge type, we recover the Ekedahl-Oort stratifications by constructing universal de Rham $F$-gauges with $G$-structure. We also study the cohomology of de Rham $F$-gauges on these varieties. In particular, in the PEL type case and when the weights of the flat automorphic vector bundles are $p$-small, we determine the $F$-gauge structure on their de Rham cohomology by the associated dual BGG complexes.</description>

      <title>Linear independence of odd zeta values using Siegel's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that among 1 and the odd zeta values $\zeta(3)$, $\zeta(5)$, ..., $\zeta(s)$, at least $ 0.21 \sqrt{s / \log s}$ are linearly independent over the rationals, for any sufficiently large odd integer $s$. This improves on the lower bound $(1-\varepsilon) \log s / (1+\log 2)$ obtained by Ball-Rivoal in 2001. Up to the numerical constant $0.21$, it gives as a corollary a new proof of the lower bound on the number of irrationals in this family proved in 2020 by Lai-Yu.
  The proof is based on Siegel's lemma to construct non-explicit linear forms in odd zeta values, instead of using explicit well-poised hypergeometric series. Siegel's linear independence criterion (instead of Nesterenko's) is applied, with a multiplicity estimate (namely a generalization of Shidlovsky's lemma).
  The result is also adapted to deal with values of the first $s$ polylogarithms at a fixed algebraic point in the unit disk, improving bounds of Rivoal and Marcovecchio.</description>

      <title>Number of solutions to a special type of unit equations in two unknowns, II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper contributes to the conjecture of R. Scott and R. Styer which asserts that for any fixed relatively prime positive integers $a,b$ and $c$ all greater than 1 there is at most one solution to the equation $a^x+b^y=c^z$ in positive integers $x,y$ and $z$, except for specific cases. The fundamental result proves the conjecture under some congruence condition modulo $c$ on $a$ and $b$. As applications the conjecture is confirmed to be true if $c$ takes some small values including the Fermat primes found so far, and in particular this provides an analytic proof of the celebrated theorem of Scott [R. Scott, On the equations $p^x-b^y=c$ and $a^x+b^y=c^z$, J. Number Theory 44(1993), no.2, 153-165] solving the conjecture for $c=2$ in a purely algebraic manner. The method can be generalized for smaller modulus cases, and it turns out that the conjecture holds true for infinitely many specific values of $c$ not being perfect powers. The main novelty is to apply a special type of the $p$-adic analogue to Baker's theory on linear forms in logarithms via a certain divisibility relation arising from the existence of two hypothetical solutions to the equation. The other tools include Baker's theory in the complex case and its non-Archimedean analogue for number fields together with various elementary arguments through rational and quadratic numbers, and extensive computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13045v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genus Theory is a classical feature of integral binary quadratic forms. Using the author's generalization of the well-known correspondence between quadratic form classes and ideal classes of quadratic algebras, we extend it to the case when quadratic forms are twisted and have coefficients in any PID $R$. When ${R = \mathbb{K}[X]}$, we show that the Genus Theory map is the quadratic form version of the $2$-descent map on a certain hyperelliptic curve. As an application, we make a contribution to a question of Agboola and Pappas regarding a specialization problem of divisor classes on hyperelliptic curves. Under suitable assumptions, we prove that the set of non-trivial specializations has density $1$.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diophantine Exponents for $\mathrm{SL}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.05106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{Diophantine exponent} of an action of a group on a homogeneous space, as defined by Ghosh, Gorodnik, and Nevo, quantifies the complexity of approximating the points of the homogeneous space by the points on an orbit of the group. We show that the Diophantine exponent of the $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z}[1/p])$-action on the generalized upper half-space $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{SO}_n(\mathbb{R})$, lies in $[1,1+O(1/n)]$, substantially improving upon Ghosh--Gorodnik--Nevo's method which gives the above range to be $[1,n-1]$. We also show that the exponent is \emph{optimal}, i.e.\ equals one, under the assumption of \emph{Sarnak's density hypothesis}. The result, in particular, shows that the optimality of Diophantine exponents can be obtained even when the \emph{temperedness} of the underlying representations, the crucial assumption in Ghosh--Gorodnik--Nevo's work, is not satisfied. The proof uses the spectral decomposition of the homogeneous space and bounds on the local $L^2$-norms of the Eisenstein series.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for all integers $k \geq 1$, $q\ge (k-1)^4+ 6k$, and $m \geq 1$, every matrix in $ M_m(\mathbb F_q)$ is a sum of two kth powers: $M_m(\mathbb F_q)=\{A^k+B^k|A,B\in M_m(\mathbb F_q)\}$. We further generalize and refine this result in the cases when both $B$ and $C$ can be chosen to be invertible, cyclic, or split semisimple, when $k$ is coprime to $p$, or when $m$ is sufficiently large. We also give a criterion for the Waring problem in terms of stabilizers.</description>

Abstract: We study the moments of the function that counts the number of representations of an integer as sums of two prime squares. We refine some of the previous arguments and apply the Selberg sieve to get an unconditional upper bound for all moments. We also prove a lower bound for all moments conditional on some generalization of the Green-Tao theorem on linear equations in primes. More precisely, for the fifth moment and onward, we get the expected order of magnitude lower and upper bounds. In addition, we provide some heuristics on the mass function of this representation function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $p$-adic continued fractions, as an extension of the classical concept of classical continued fractions to the realm of $p$-adic numbers, offering a novel perspective on number representation and approximation. While numerous $p$-adic continued fraction expansion algorithms have been proposed by the researchers, the establishment of several excellent properties, such as the Lagrange Theorem for classic continued fractions, which indicates that every quadratic irrationals can be expanded periodically, remains elusive. In this paper, we present several new algorithms that can be viewed as refinements of the existing $p$-adic continued fraction algorithms. We give an upper bound of the length of partial quotients when expanding rational numbers, and prove that for small primes $p$, our algorithm can generate periodic continued fraction expansions for all quadratic irrationals. As confirmed through experimentation, one of our algorithms can be viewed as the best $p$-adic algorithm available to date. Furthermore, we provide an approach to establish a $p$-adic continued fraction expansion algorithm that could generate periodic expansions for all quadratic irrationals in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for a given prime $p$.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents an extension of Bhargava's theory of factorials associated to any nonempty subset $S$ of $\mathbb{Z}$. Bhargava's factorials $k!_S$ are invariants, constructed using the notion of $p$-orderings of $S$ where $p$ is a prime. This paper defines $b$-orderings of any nonempty subset $S$ of $\mathbb{Z}$ for all integers $b\ge2$, as well as "extreme" cases $b=1$ and $b=0$. It defines generalized factorials $k !_{S,T}$ and generalized binomial coefficients $\binom{k+\ell}{k}_{S,T}$ as nonnegative integers, for all nonempty $S$ and allowing only $b$ in $T\subseteq\mathbb{N}$. It computes $b$-ordering invariants when $S$ is $\mathbb{Z}$ and when $S$ is the set of all primes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute generators and relations for the section ring of a rational divisor on an elliptic curve. Our technique generalizes the work of O'Dorney (in genus zero) and Voight--Zureick-Brown (for specific divisors arising from the study of stacky curves). For effective divisors supported on at most two points, we give explicit descriptions of the generators and the leading terms of the relations for a minimal presentation. As in the genus zero case, the generators are parametrized by best lower approximations to the coefficients, but there are added wrinkles. Following Landesman, Ruhm and Zhang we can bound the degrees of generators for the section ring of an effective divisor supported at any finite number of points.</description>

Abstract: For a given irreducible and monic polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ of degree $4$, we consider the quadratic twists by square-free integers $q$ of the genus one quartic ${H\, :\, y^2=f(x)}$ \[ H_q \, :\, qy^2=f(x). \] We say that a curve $C$ is everywhere locally soluble (ELS) if it has a solution in $\mathbb{R}$ and in $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for every prime $p$ (i.e. if $C(\mathbb{R})\neq \emptyset$ and $C(\mathbb{Q}_p)\neq \emptyset$ for all primes $p$). Let $L=\{q\in \mathbb{N} :\, q \text{ is square-free and } H_q \text{ is ELS}\}$ denote the set of positive square-free integers $q$ for which $H_q$ is everywhere locally soluble. For a real number $x$ let ${L(x)= \#\{q\in L:\, q&lt;x\}}$ be the number of elements in $L$ that are less then $x$. Furthermore, let us denote with \[ F(s)=\sum_{n \in L} \frac{1}{n^s} \] the corresponding Dirichlet's series of the set $L$. In this paper, we obtain that \[ L(x) = c_f \frac{x}{(\ln{x})^{m}}+O\left(\frac{x}{(\ln{x})^\alpha}\right) \] for some constants $c_f$, $m$ and $\alpha$ only depending on $f$ such that $m&lt;\alpha \leq 1+m$. We also express the Dirichlet's series $F(s)$ via Dedekind's zeta functions of certain number fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a frequency sequence $\omega=(\omega_n)$ and a finite subset $J \subset \mathbb{N}$, we study the space $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}^{J}(\omega)$ of all Dirichlet polynomials $D(s) := \sum_{n \in J} a_n e^{-\omega_n s}, \, s \in \mathbb{C}$. The main aim is to prove asymptotically correct estimates for the projection constant $\boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal{H}_\infty^{J}(\omega) \big)$ of the finite dimensional Banach space $\mathcal{H}_\infty^{J}(\omega)$ equipped with the norm $\|D\|= \sup_{\text{Re}\,s&gt;0} |D(s)|$. Based on harmonic analysis on $\omega$-Dirichlet groups, we prove the formula $ \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal{H}_\infty^{J}(\omega) \big) = \lim_{T \to \infty} \frac{1}{2T} \int_{-T}^T \Big|\sum_{n \in J} e^{-i\omega_n t}\Big|\,dt\,, $ and apply it to various concrete frequencies $\omega$ and index sets $J$. To see an example, combining with a recent deep result of Harper from probabilistic analytic number theory, we for the space $\mathcal{H}_\infty^{\leq x}\big( (\log n)\big)$ of all ordinary Dirichlet polynomials $D(s) = \sum_{n \leq x} a_n n^{-s}$ of length $x$ show the asymptotically correct order $ \boldsymbol{\lambda}\big(\mathcal{H}_\infty^{\leq x}\big( (\log n)\big)\big) \sim \sqrt{x}/(\log \log x)^{\frac{1}{4}}. $</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (PFR) Conjecture, we develop a theory of locality in sumsets, with applications to John-type approximation and sets with small doubling. First we show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le (1-\epsilon) 2^d |A|$ is non-degenerate then $A$ is covered by $O(2^d)$ translates of a $d$-dimensional generalised arithmetic progression ($d$-GAP) $P$ with $|P| \le O_{d,\epsilon}(|A|)$; thus we obtain one of the polynomial bounds required by PFR, under the non-degeneracy assumption that $A$ is not efficiently covered by $O_{d,\epsilon}(1)$ translates of a $(d-1)$-GAP. We also prove a stability result showing for any $\epsilon,\alpha&gt;0$ that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le (2-\epsilon)2^d|A|$ is non-degenerate then some $A' \subset A$ with $|A'|&gt;(1-\alpha)|A|$ is efficiently covered by either a $(d+1)$-GAP or $O_{\alpha}(1)$ translates of a $d$-GAP. This `dimension-free' bound for approximate covering makes for a stark contrast with exact covering, where the required number of translates grows exponentially with $d$. We further show that if $A \subset \mathbb{Z}$ is non-degenerate with $|A+A| \le (2^d + \ell)|A|$ and $\ell \le 0.1 \cdot 2^d$ then $A$ is covered by $\ell+1$ translates of a $d$-GAP $P$ with $|P| \le O_d(|A|)$; this is tight, in that $\ell+1$ cannot be replaced by any smaller number. The above results also hold for $A \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, replacing GAPs by a suitable common generalisation of GAPs and convex bodies. In this setting the non-degeneracy condition holds automatically, so we obtain essentially optimal bounds with no additional assumption on $A$. These results are all deduced from a unifying theory, in which we introduce a new intrinsic structural approximation of any set, which we call the `additive hull', and develop its theory via a refinement of Freiman's theorem with additional separation properties.</description>

The similarity is discussed between the corresponding zeta-polynomials and superpolynomials of algebraic links, closely related to Khovanov-Rozansky polynomials. We focus on DAHA superpolynomials and motivic ones, defined via compactified Jacobians of plane curve singularities and their counterparts in arbitrary ranks; the non-unibranch construction is new. They conjecturally coincide with the corresponding generalizations of L-functions and satisfy the Riemann Hypothesis in some sectors of the parameters. Presumably, the motivic ones an be interpreted as certain partition functions of Landau-Ginzburg models associated with plane curve singularities; RH for them is remarkably similar to the Lee-Yang circle theorem for Ising models. A q,t-deformation of the Witten index is obtained as an application. General perspectives of the motivic theory of isolated curve and surface singularities are discussed, including possible implications in number theory. Also, we introduce super-analogs of $\rho_{ab}$-invariants and discuss super-deformations of the Riemann's zeta. Among other topics: Verlinde algebras, and the topological vertex.</description>

Abstract: In our previous work we conjectured - inspired by an algebro-geometric result of Fujita - that the height of an arithmetic Fano variety X of relative dimension $n$ is maximal when X is the projective space $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}}$ over the integers, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, if the corresponding complex Fano variety is K-semistable. In this work the conjecture is settled for diagonal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}_{\mathbb{Z}}$. The proof is based on a logarithmic extension of our previous conjecture, of independent interest, which is established for toric log Fano varieties of relative dimension at most three, hyperplane arrangements on $\mathbb{P}^n_{\mathbb{Z}}$, as well as for general arithmetic orbifold Fano surfaces.</description>
