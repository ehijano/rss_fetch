      <title>Learning Towards Emergence: Paving the Way to Induce Emergence by Inhibiting Monosemantic Neurons on Pre-trained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergence, the phenomenon of a rapid performance increase once the model scale reaches a threshold, has achieved widespread attention recently. The literature has observed that monosemantic neurons in neural networks gradually diminish as the model scale increases. Subsequently, Learning From Emergence is proposed to actively inhibit monosemantic neurons in relatively small neural networks (e.g., BERT and Swin-Transformer) for promoting model performance with fine-tuning. However, to ultimately achieve emergence, it is demanding to support the monosemantic neuron inhibition in the pretraining phase of large-scale models. Thus, this work further pushes the boundary of this research direction to be Learning Towards Emergence (L2E) and enables the training and validating of the impact of inhibiting monosemantic neurons on larger pre-trained neural networks (e.g., Pythia-70M, 410M, and 2.8B). More specifically, to bridge the gap in current research, we first conduct experiments on models of various scales (up to 6.9B) to validate the monosemantic ideas. Then, we present a novel method L2E to address the inefficient monosemantic neuron retrieval and ineffective monosemantic neuron inhibition when existing methods are applied in the pretraining phase of large-scale models. It employs an adjustable thresholding technique for efficient neuron retrieval, incorporates a False Killing Rate metric to assess inhibition effects, and proposes a regularization-style inhibition approach, which addresses the limitations of previous approaches in both efficiency and effectiveness. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of L2E's monosemantic neuron inhibition and its efficiency in implementation with large-scale models.</description>

      <title>An In-Situ Spatial-Temporal Sequence Detector for Neuromorphic Vision Sensor Empowered by High Density Vertical NAND Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic vision sensors require efficient real-time pattern recognition, yet conventional architectures struggle with energy and latency constraints. Here, we present a novel in-situ spatiotemporal sequence detector that leverages vertical NAND storage to achieve massively parallel pattern detection. By encoding each cell with two single-transistor-based multi-level cell (MLC) memory elements, such as ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), and mapping a pixel's temporal sequence onto consecutive word lines (WLs), we enable direct temporal pattern detection within NAND strings. Each NAND string serves as a dedicated reference for a single pixel, while different blocks store patterns for distinct pixels, allowing large-scale spatial-temporal pattern recognition via simple direct bit-line (BL) sensing, a well-established operation in vertical NAND storage. We experimentally validate our approach at both the cell and array levels, demonstrating that vertical NAND-based detector achieves more than six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency and more than three orders of magnitude reduction in latency compared to conventional CPU-based methods. These findings establish vertical NAND storage as a scalable and energy-efficient solution for next-generation neuromorphic vision processing.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-assisted High-speed Combinatorial Optimization with Ising Machines for Dynamically Changing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum or quantum-inspired Ising machines have recently shown promise in solving combinatorial optimization problems in a short time. Real-world applications, such as time division multiple access (TDMA) scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks and financial trading, require solving those problems sequentially where the size and characteristics change dynamically. However, using Ising machines involves challenges to shorten system-wide latency due to the transfer of large Ising model or the cloud access and to determine the parameters for each problem. Here we show a combinatorial optimization method using embedded Ising machines, which enables solving diverse problems at high speed without runtime parameter tuning. We customize the algorithm and circuit architecture of the simulated bifurcation-based Ising machine to compress the Ising model and accelerate computation and then built a machine learning model to estimate appropriate parameters using extensive training data. In TDMA scheduling for wireless multi-hop networks, our demonstration has shown that the sophisticated system can adapt to changes in the problem and showed that it has a speed advantage over conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Advanced Quantum Annealing Approach to Vehicle Routing Problems with Time Windows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential for quantum annealing to solve realistic routing problems. We focus on two NP-Hard problems, including the Traveling Salesman Problem with Time Windows and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows. We utilize D-Wave's Quantum Annealer and Constrained Quadratic Model (CQM) solver within a hybrid framework to solve these problems. We demonstrate that while the CQM solver effectively minimizes route costs, it struggles to maintain time window feasibility as the problem size increases. To address this limitation, we implement a heuristic method that fixes infeasible solutions through a series of swapping operations. Testing on benchmark instances shows our method achieves promising results with an average optimality gap of 3.86%.</description>

      <title>QUADRO: A Hybrid Quantum Optimization Framework for Drone Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds transformative potential for optimizing large-scale drone fleet operations, yet its near-term limitations necessitate hybrid approaches blending classical and quantum techniques. This work introduces Quantum Unmanned Aerial Delivery Routing Optimization (QUADRO), a novel hybrid framework addressing the Energy-Constrained Capacitated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Routing Problem and the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Scheduling Problem. By formulating these challenges as Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems, QUADRO leverages the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for routing and scheduling, enhanced by classical heuristics and post-processing. We minimize total transit time in routing, considering payload and battery constraints, and optimize makespan scheduling across various drone fleets. Evaluated on adapted Augerat benchmarks (16-51 nodes), QUADRO competes against classical and prior hybrid methods, achieving scalable solutions with fewer than one hundred qubits. The proposed results underscore the viability of hybrid quantum-classical strategies for real-world drone logistics, paving the way for quantum-enhanced optimization in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era.</description>

      <title>TANQ-Sim: Tensorcore Accelerated Noisy Quantum System Simulation via QIR on Perlmutter HPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13184v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although there have been remarkable advances in quantum computing (QC), it remains crucial to simulate quantum programs using classical large-scale parallel computing systems to validate quantum algorithms, comprehend the impact of noise, and develop resilient quantum applications. This is particularly important for bridging the gap between near-term noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum (NISQ) computing and future fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Nevertheless, current simulation methods either lack the capability to simulate noise, or simulate with excessive computational costs, or do not scale out effectively.
  In this paper, we propose TANQ-Sim, a full-scale density matrix based simulator designed to simulate practical deep circuits with both coherent and non-coherent noise. To address the significant computational cost associated with such simulations, we propose a new density-matrix simulation approach that enables TANQ-Sim to leverage the latest double-precision tensorcores (DPTCs) in NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper GPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of double-precision tensorcores for non-AI/ML workloads. To optimize performance, we also propose specific gate fusion techniques for density matrix simulation. For scaling, we rely on the advanced GPU-side communication library NVSHMEM and propose effective optimization methods for enhancing communication efficiency. Evaluations on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer demonstrate the functionality, performance, and scalability of the simulator. We also present three case studies to showcase the practical usage of TANQ-Sim, including teleportation, entanglement distillation, and Ising simulation. TANQ-Sim will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Performant near-term quantum combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16135v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial optimization is a promising application for near-term quantum computers, however, identifying performant algorithms suited to noisy quantum hardware remains as an important goal to potentially realizing quantum computational advantages. To address this we present a variational quantum algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems with linear-depth circuits. Our algorithm uses an ansatz composed of Hamiltonian generators designed to control each term in the target combinatorial function, along with parameter updates following a modified version of quantum imaginary time evolution. We evaluate this ansatz in numerical simulations that target solutions to the MAXCUT problem. The state evolution is shown to closely mimic imaginary time evolution, and its optimal-solution convergence is further improved using adaptive transformations of the classical Hamiltonian spectrum. With these innovations, the algorithm consistently converges to optimal solutions, with interesting highly-entangled dynamics along the way. We further demonstrate the success of this approach by performing optimization of a truncated version of our ansatz with up to 32 qubits in a trapped-ion quantum computer, using measurements from the quantum computer to train the ansatz and prepare optimal solutions with high fidelity in the majority of cases we consider. The success of these large-scale quantum circuit optimizations, in the presence of realistic hardware constraints and without error mitigation, mark significant progress on the path towards solving combinatorial problems using quantum computers. We conclude our performant and resource-minimal approach is a promising candidate for potential quantum computational advantages.</description>

      <title>LeForecast: Enterprise Hybrid Forecast by Time Series Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22747v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Demand is spiking in industrial fields for multidisciplinary forecasting, where a broad spectrum of sectors needs planning and forecasts to streamline intelligent business management, such as demand forecasting, product planning, inventory optimization, etc. Specifically, these tasks expecting intelligent approaches to learn from sequentially collected historical data and then foresee most possible trend, i.e. time series forecasting. Challenge of it lies in interpreting complex business contexts and the efficiency and generalisation of modelling. With aspirations of pre-trained foundational models for such purpose, given their remarkable success of large foundation model across legions of tasks, we disseminate \leforecast{}, an enterprise intelligence platform tailored for time series tasks. It integrates advanced interpretations of time series data and multi-source information, and a three-pillar modelling engine combining a large foundation model (Le-TSFM), multimodal model and hybrid model to derive insights, predict or infer futures, and then drive optimisation across multiple sectors in enterprise operations. The framework is composed by a model pool, model profiling module, and two different fusion approaches regarding original model architectures. Experimental results verify the efficiency of our trail fusion concepts: router-based fusion network and coordination of large and small models, resulting in high costs for redundant development and maintenance of models. This work reviews deployment of LeForecast and its performance in three industrial use cases. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that LeForecast is a profound and practical platform for efficient and competitive performance. And we do hope that this work can enlighten the research and grounding of time series techniques in accelerating enterprise.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Celestial Imaging: High Dynamic Range with Neuromorphic Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional frame-based cameras often struggle with limited dynamic range, leading to saturation and loss of detail when capturing scenes with significant brightness variations. Neuromorphic cameras, inspired by human retina, offer a solution by providing an inherently high dynamic range. This capability enables them to capture both bright and faint celestial objects without saturation effects, preserving details across a wide range of luminosities. This paper investigates the application of neuromorphic imaging technology for capturing celestial bodies across a wide range of flux levels. Its advantages are demonstrated through examples such as the bright planet Saturn with its faint moons and the bright star Sirius A alongside its faint companion, Sirius B.</description>

      <title>Figaro on GPUs: Two Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the implementation of the Figaro-GPU algorithm for computing a QR and SVD decomposition over a join matrix defined by the natural join over two tables on GPUs.
  Figaro-GPU's main novelty is a GPU implementation of the Figaro algorithm \cite{olteanu2022givens, vzivanovic2022linear,olteanu2024givens}: symbolical transformations combined with the GPU parallelized computations.
  This leads to the theoretical performance improvements proportional to the ratio of the join and input sizes.
  In experiments with the synthetic tables, for computing the upper triangular matrix and the right singular vectors matrix, Figaro-GPU outperforms in runtime NVIDIA cuSolver library for the upper triangular matrix by a factor proportional to the gap between the join and input sizes, which varies from 5x-150x for NVIDIA 2070 and up to 160x for NVIDIA 4080 while using up to 1000x less memory than the GPU cuSolver.
  For computing singular values, Figaro-GPU outperforms in runtime NVIDIA cuSolver library from 2.8x-31x for NVIDIA 4080.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) presents as a revolutionary approach to weather forecasting by using quantum computing to improve predictive modeling capabilities. In this study, we apply QML models, including Quantum Gated Recurrent Units (QGRUs), Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory(QLSTM), Variational Quantum Circuits(VQCs), and Quantum Support Vector Machines(QSVMs), to analyze meteorological time-series data from the ERA5 dataset. Our methodology includes preprocessing meteorological features, implementing QML architectures for both classification and regression tasks. The results demonstrate that QML models can achieve reasonable accuracy in both prediction and classification tasks, particularly in binary classification. However, challenges such as quantum hardware limitations and noise affect scalability and generalization. This research provides insights into the feasibility of QML for weather prediction, paving the way for further exploration of hybrid quantum-classical frameworks to enhance meteorological forecasting.</description>

      <title>GIScience in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Research Agenda Towards Autonomous GIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcend the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five levels of autonomy, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the ethical and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance solutions to pressing global challenges.</description>

      <title>ObfusQate: Unveiling the First Quantum Program Obfuscation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces ObfusQate, a novel tool that conducts obfuscations using quantum primitives to enhance the security of both classical and quantum programs. We have designed and implemented two primary categories of obfuscations: quantum circuit level obfuscation and code level obfuscation, encompassing a total of eight distinct methods. Quantum circuit-level obfuscation leverages on quantum gates and circuits, utilizing strategies such as quantum gate hiding and identity matrices to construct complex, non-intuitive circuits that effectively obscure core functionalities and resist reverse engineering, making the underlying code difficult to interpret. Meanwhile, code-level obfuscation manipulates the logical sequence of program operations through quantum-based opaque predicates, obfuscating execution paths and rendering program behavior more unpredictable and challenging to analyze. Additionally, ObfusQate can be used to obfuscate malicious code segments, making them harder to detect and analyze. These advancements establish a foundational framework for further exploration into the potential and limitations of quantum-based obfuscation techniques, positioning ObfusQate as a valuable tool for future developers to enhance code security in the evolving landscape of software development. To the best of our knowledge, ObfusQate represents the pioneering work in developing an automated framework for implementing obfuscations leveraging quantum primitives. Security evaluations show that obfuscations by ObfusQate maintain code behavior with polynomial overheads in space and time complexities. We have also demonstrated an offensive use case by embedding a keylogger into Shor's algorithm and obfuscating it using ObfusQate. Our results show that current Large language models like GPT 4o, GPT o3 mini and Grok 3 were not able to identify the malicious keylogger after obfuscation.</description>

This study benchmarks a ground-state algorithm, Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), against three leading quantum dynamics algorithms, Trotterization, Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VarQTE), and Adaptive Variational Quantum Dynamics Simulation (AVQDS), applied to the same PDE on small quantum hardware. While Trotterization is fully quantum, VarQTE and AVQDS are variational algorithms that reduce circuit depth for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. However, hardware results from these dynamics methods show sizable errors due to noise and limited shot statistics. To establish a noise-free performance baseline, we implement the VQE-based solver on a noiseless statevector simulator. Our results show VQE can reach final-time infidelities as low as ${O}(10^{-9})$ with $N=4$ qubits and moderate circuit depths, outperforming hardware-deployed dynamics methods that show infidelities $\gtrsim 10^{-2}$. By comparing noiseless VQE to shot-based and hardware-run algorithms, we assess their accuracy and resource demands, providing a baseline for future quantum PDE solvers. We conclude with a discussion of limitations and potential extensions to higher-dimensional, nonlinear PDEs relevant to engineering and finance.</description>

      <title>Q-fid: Quantum Circuit Fidelity Improvement with LSTM Networks</title>

Abstract: The fidelity of quantum circuits (QC) is influenced by several factors, including hardware characteristics, calibration status, and the transpilation process, all of which impact their susceptibility to noise. However, existing methods struggle to estimate and compare the noise performance of different circuit layouts due to fluctuating error rates and the absence of a standardized fidelity metric. In this work, Q-fid is introduced, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based fidelity prediction system accompanied by a novel metric designed to quantify the fidelity of quantum circuits. Q-fid provides an intuitive way to predict the noise performance of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) circuits. This approach frames fidelity prediction as a Time Series Forecasting problem to analyze the tokenized circuits, capturing the causal dependence of the gate sequences and their impact on overall fidelity. Additionally, the model is capable of dynamically adapting to changes in hardware characteristics, ensuring accurate fidelity predictions under varying conditions. Q-fid achieves a high prediction accuracy with an average RMSE of 0.0515, up to 24.7x more accurate than the Qiskit transpile tool mapomatic. By offering a reliable method for fidelity prediction, Q-fid empowers developers to optimize transpilation strategies, leading to more efficient and noise-resilient quantum circuit implementations.</description>

      <title>Spatially parallel decoding for multi-qubit lattice surgery</title>

Abstract: Running quantum algorithms protected by quantum error correction requires a real time, classical decoder. To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits.
  These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</description>

Abstract: In the contemporary data-driven landscape, ensuring data quality (DQ) is crucial for deriving actionable insights from vast data repositories. The objective of this study is to explore the potential for automating data quality management within data warehouses as data repository commonly used by large organizations. By conducting a systematic review of existing DQ tools available in the market and academic literature, the study assesses their capability to automatically detect and enforce data quality rules. The review encompassed 151 tools from various sources, revealing that most current tools focus on data cleansing and fixing in domain-specific databases rather than data warehouses. Only a limited number of tools, specifically ten, demonstrated the capability to detect DQ rules, not to mention implementing this in data warehouses. The findings underscore a significant gap in the market and academic research regarding AI-augmented DQ rule detection in data warehouses. This paper advocates for further development in this area to enhance the efficiency of DQ management processes, reduce human workload, and lower costs. The study highlights the necessity of advanced tools for automated DQ rule detection, paving the way for improved practices in data quality management tailored to data warehouse environments. The study can guide organizations in selecting data quality tool that would meet their requirements most.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Quantum Computers: Review and Acceleration Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize multiple fields by solving complex problems that can not be solved in reasonable time with current classical computers. Nevertheless, the development of quantum computers is still in its early stages and the available systems have still very limited resources. As such, currently, the most practical way to develop and test quantum algorithms is to use classical simulators of quantum computers. In addition, the development of new quantum computers and their components also depends on simulations.
  Given the characteristics of a quantum computer, their simulation is a very demanding application in terms of both computation and memory. As such, simulations do not scale well in current classical systems. Thus different optimization and approximation techniques need to be applied at different levels.
  This review provides an overview of the components of a quantum computer, the levels at which these components and the whole quantum computer can be simulated, and an in-depth analysis of different state-of-the-art acceleration approaches. Besides the optimizations that can be performed at the algorithmic level, this review presents the most promising hardware-aware optimizations and future directions that can be explored for improving the performance and scalability of the simulations.</description>

      <title>SPICE: Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) for human--computer interaction (HCI) provide the user with physical representations of digital information with the aim to overcome the limitations of screen-based interfaces. Although many compelling demonstrations of TUIs exist in the literature, there is a lack of research on TUIs intended for daily two-handed tasks and processes, such as cooking. In response to this gap, we propose SPICE (Smart Projection Interface for Cooking Enhancement). SPICE investigates TUIs in a kitchen setting, aiming to transform the recipe following experience from simply text-based to tangibly interactive. SPICE uses a tracking system, an agent-based simulation software, and vision large language models to create and interpret a kitchen environment where recipe information is projected directly onto the cooking surface. We conducted comparative usability and a validation studies of SPICE, with 30 participants. The results show that participants using SPICE completed the recipe with far less stops and in a substantially shorter time. Despite this, participants self-reported negligible change in feelings of difficulty, which is a direction for future research. Overall, the SPICE project demonstrates the potential of using TUIs to improve everyday activities, paving the way for future research in HCI and new computing interfaces.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model for Histogram Distribution-based Quantum Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum image representation and quantum measurement techniques has made quantum image processing research a hot topic. In this paper, a novel Adaptive Quantum Scaling Model (AQSM) is first proposed for scrambling watermark images. Then, on the basis of the proposed AQSM, a novel quantum watermarking scheme is presented. Unlike existing quantum watermarking schemes with fixed embedding scales, the proposed method can flexibly embed watermarks of different sizes. In order to improve the robustness of the watermarking algorithm, a novel Histogram Distribution-based Watermarking Mechanism (HDWM) is proposed, which utilizes the histogram distribution property of the watermark image to determine the embedding strategy. In order to improve the accuracy of extracted watermark information, a quantum refining method is suggested, which can realize a certain error correction. The required key quantum circuits are designed. Finally, the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed quantum watermarking method are evaluated by simulation experiments on three image size scales. The results demonstrate the invisibility and good robustness of the watermarking algorithm.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Smart Contract Reputability Analysis using Multimodal Data Fusion on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of smart contract reputability is essential to foster trust in decentralized ecosystems. However, existing methods that rely solely on code analysis or transactional data, offer limited insight into evolving trustworthiness. We propose a multimodal data fusion framework that integrates code features with transactional data to enhance reputability prediction. Our framework initially focuses on AI-based code analysis, utilizing GAN-augmented opcode embeddings to address class imbalance, achieving 97.67% accuracy and a recall of 0.942 in detecting illicit contracts, surpassing traditional oversampling methods. This forms the crux of a reputability-centric fusion strategy, where combining code and transactional data improves recall by 7.25% over single-source models, demonstrating robust performance across validation sets. By providing a holistic view of smart contract behaviour, our approach enhances the model's ability to assess reputability, identify fraudulent activities, and predict anomalous patterns. These capabilities contribute to more accurate reputability assessments, proactive risk mitigation, and enhanced blockchain security.</description>
