      <title>Discovery of Green's function based on symbolic regression with physical hard constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Green's function, serving as a kernel function that delineates the interaction relationships of physical quantities within a field, holds significant research implications across various disciplines. It forms the foundational basis for the renowned Biot-Savart formula in fluid dynamics, the theoretical solution of the pressure Poisson equation, and et al. Despite their importance, the theoretical derivation of the Green's function is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this study, we employed DISCOVER, an advanced symbolic regression method leveraging symbolic binary trees and reinforcement learning, to identify unknown Green's functions for several elementary partial differential operators, including Laplace operators, Helmholtz operators, and second-order differential operators with jump conditions. The Laplace and Helmholtz operators are particularly vital for resolving the pressure Poisson equation, while second-order differential operators with jump conditions are essential for analyzing multiphase flows and shock waves. By incorporating physical hard constraints, specifically symmetry properties inherent to these self-adjoint operators, we significantly enhanced the performance of the DISCOVER framework, potentially doubling its efficacy. Notably, the Green's functions discovered for the Laplace and Helmholtz operators precisely matched the true Green's functions. Furthermore, for operators without known exact Green's functions, such as the periodic Helmholtz operator and second-order differential operators with jump conditions, we identified potential Green's functions with solution error on the order of 10^(-10). This application of symbolic regression to the discovery of Green's functions represents a pivotal advancement in leveraging artificial intelligence to accelerate scientific discoveries, particularly in fluid dynamics and related fields.</description>

      <title>Exact average many-body interatomic interaction model for random alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical origin of deformation mechanisms in random alloys requires an understanding of their average behavior and, equally important, the role of local fluctuations around the average. Material properties of random alloys can be computed using direct simulations on random configurations but some properties are very difficult to compute, for others it is not even fully understood how to compute them using random sampling, in particular, interaction energies between multiple defects. To that end, we develop an atomistic model that does the averaging on the level of interatomic potentials. Then, the problem of averaging via random sampling is bypassed since computing material properties on random configurations reduces to computing material properties on a single crystal, the average alloy.
  We develop our average model on the class of linear machine-learning interatomic potentials. To that end, using tools from higher-order statistics, we derive an analytic expansion of the average many-body per-atom energy in terms of average tensor products of the feature vectors that scales linearly with the size of an atomic neighborhood. In order to avoid forming higher-order tensors composed of products of feature vectors, we develop an implementation using equivariant tensor network potentials in which the feature vectors are contracted to small-sized tensors before taking the average. We show that our average model predicts the compact screw dislocation core structure in the NbMoTaW medium-entropy alloy, in agreement with density functional theory, as opposed to state-of-the-art average embedded atom method potentials that predict artificial polarized cores. Hence, we anticipate that our model will become useful for understanding mechanistic origins of material properties and for developing predictive models of mechanical properties of random alloys.</description>

      <title>PLIC-Net: A Machine Learning Approach for 3D Interface Reconstruction in Volume of Fluid Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate reconstruction of immiscible fluid-fluid interfaces from the volume fraction field is a critical component of geometric Volume of Fluid (VOF) methods. A common strategy is the Piecewise Linear Interface Calculation (PLIC), which fits a plane in each mixed-phase computational cell. However, recent work goes beyond PLIC by using two planes or even a paraboloid. To select such planes or paraboloids, complex optimization algorithms as well as carefully crafted heuristics are necessary. Yet, the potential exists for a well-trained machine learning model to efficiently provide broadly applicable solutions to the interface reconstruction problem at lower costs. In this work, the viability of a machine learning approach is demonstrated in the context of a single plane reconstruction. A feed-forward deep neural network is used to predict the normal vector of a PLIC plane given volume fraction and phasic barycenter data in a $3\times3\times3$ stencil. The PLIC plane is then translated in its cell to ensure exact volume conservation. Our proposed neural network PLIC reconstruction (PLIC-Net) is equivariant to reflections about the Cartesian planes. Training data is analytically generated with $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ randomized paraboloid surfaces, which allows for sampling a wide range of interface shapes. PLIC-Net is tested in multiphase flow simulations where it is compared to standard (E)LVIRA reconstruction algorithms, and the impact of training data statistics on PLIC-Net's performance is also explored. It is found that PLIC-Net greatly limits the formation of spurious planes and generates cleaner numerical break-up of the interface. Additionally, the computational cost of PLIC-Net is lower than that of (E)LVIRA. These results establish that machine learning is a viable approach to VOF interface reconstruction and is superior to current reconstruction algorithms for some cases.</description>

      <title>Molecular influence on nuclear-quadrupole-coupling effects in laser induced alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the effect of nuclear-quadrupole interactions on the field-free impulsive alignment of different asymmetric-top molecules. Our analysis is focused on the influence of the hyperfine- and rotational-energy-level structures. These depend on the number of nuclear spins, the rotational constants, and the symmetry of the tensors involved in the nuclear spin and external field interactions. Comparing the prototypical large-nuclear-spin molecules iodobenzene, 1,2-diiodobenzene, 1,3-diiodobenzene, and 2,5-diiodobenzonitrile, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the hyperfine splittings compared to the rotational-energy splittings plays a crucial role in the spin-rotational dynamics after the laser pulse. Moreover, we point out that the impact of the quadrupole coupling on the rotational dynamics decreases when highly excited rotational states dominate the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of DGTD for linear Maxwell equations with inhomogeneous interface conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we consider linear and isotropic Maxwell equations with inhomogeneous interface conditions. We discretize the problem with the discontinuous Galerkin method in space and with the leapfrog scheme in time. An analytical setting is provided in which we show wellposedness of the problem, derive stability estimates, and exploit this in the error analysis to prove rigorous error bounds for both the spatial and full discretization. The theoretical findings are confirmed with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling Heat Conduction with Dual-Dissipative Variables: A Mechanism-Data Fusion Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many macroscopic non-Fourier heat conduction models have been developed in the past decades based on Chapman-Enskog, Hermite or other small perturbation expansion methods. These macroscopic models have made great success on capturing non-Fourier thermal behaviors in solid materials, but most of them are limited by small Knudsen numbers and incapable of capturing highly non-equilibrium or ballistic thermal transport. In this paper, we provide a new strategy for constructing macroscopic non-Fourier heat conduction modeling, that is, using data-driven deep learning methods combined with non-equilibrium thermodynamics instead of small perturbation expansion. We present the mechanism-data fusion method, an approach that seamlessly integrates the rigorous framework of Conservation-Dissipation Formalism (CDF) with the flexibility of machine learning to model non-Fourier heat conduction. Leveraging the conservation-dissipation principle with dual-dissipative variables, we derive an interpretable series of partial differential equations, fine-tuned through a training strategy informed by data from the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Moreover, we also present the inner-step operation to narrow the gap from the discrete form to the continuous system. Through numerical tests, our model demonstrates excellent predictive capabilities across various heat conduction regimes, including diffusive, hydrodynamic and ballistic regimes, and displays its robustness and precision even with discontinuous initial conditions.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Scale Boltzmann Equation for Complex Systems of Neutral Gases across All Flow Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07038v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Multi-scale Boltzmann Equation (MBE) is found from the gas-kinetic theory and the direct modeling philosophy as a master equation for complex physical systems of neutral gases across all flow regimes, which locates between the continuum limit and the free-molecular limit, covering a vast range of applications such as hypersonic flows over aerospace crafts and delicate flows around MEMS. The most explicit characteristic of MBE is evolving the variable observation time in the expression, which distinguishes the MBE from the single-scale master or governing equation where a fixed scale is implied in the assumptions. The fundamental properties of MBE, such as the asymptotic property, are proved theoretically, while a concise numerical scheme is developed for MBE to demonstrate its validity by benchmark multi-scale problems.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effect of Cu$^{2+}$ sorption in montmorillonite using density functional theory and molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Montmorillonite (MMT) is the main mineral component of bentonite, which is currently proposed as a sealing material in deep geological repositories (DGRs) for used nuclear fuel. In the Canadian program, which will utilize copper-cladded used fuel containers, safety analysis considers the effect of copper corrosion, during which Cu$^{2+}$ ions could potentially be adsorbed by the surrounding MMT. In such a scenario, ion exchange between Na$^+$ and Cu$^{2+}$ is expected. In this study, a multiscale approach that combines electronic density functional theory (DFT) and force-field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was employed to study the effect of introducing Cu$^{2+}$ ions to MMT. An extension to the ClayFF force field is parametrized and validated using DFT to model how Cu$^{2+}$ interacts with clay systems. MD simulations were performed to calculate the interaction free energies between MMT platelets containing Cu$^{2+}$ ions (Cu-MMT) and compared them to inter-platelet interaction energies in Na-MMT and Ca-MMT. Our calculations suggest Cu-MMT develops swelling pressures between those of Ca-MMT and Na-MMT. Furthermore, our MD simulations suggest that Cu$^{2+}$ has MMT interlayer mobility that is significantly slower than that of Ca$^{2+}$.</description>

      <title>An Entropy-Stable Discontinuous Galerkin Discretization of the Ideal Multi-Ion Magnetohydrodynamics System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an entropy-stable (ES) discretization using a nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for the ideal multi-ion magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) equations.
  We start by performing a continuous entropy analysis of the ideal multi-ion MHD system, described by, e.g., Toth (2010) [Multi-Ion Magnetohydrodynamics], which describes the motion of multi-ion plasmas with independent momentum and energy equations for each ion species. Following the continuous entropy analysis, we propose an algebraic manipulation to the multi-ion MHD system, such that entropy consistency can be transferred from the continuous analysis to its discrete approximation. Moreover, we augment the system of equations with a generalized Lagrange multiplier (GLM) technique to have an additional cleaning mechanism of the magnetic field divergence error.
  We first derive robust entropy-conservative (EC) fluxes for the alternative formulation of the multi-ion GLM-MHD system that satisfy a Tadmor-type condition and are consistent with existing EC fluxes for single-fluid GLM-MHD equations. Using these numerical two-point fluxes, we construct high-order EC and ES DG discretizations of the ideal multi-ion MHD system using collocated Legendre--Gauss--Lobatto summation-by-parts (SBP) operators. The resulting nodal DG schemes satisfy the second-law of thermodynamics at the semi-discrete level, while maintaining high-order convergence and local node-wise conservation properties.
  We demonstrate the high-order convergence, and the EC and ES properties of our scheme with numerical validation experiments. Moreover, we demonstrate the importance of the GLM divergence technique and the ES discretization to improve the robustness properties of a DG discretization of the multi-ion MHD system by solving a challenging magnetized Kelvin-Helmholtz instability problem that exhibits MHD turbulence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become indispensable for conducting accurate large-scale atomistic simulations and for the efficient prediction of crystal structures. Polynomial MLPs, defined by polynomial rotational invariants, have been systematically developed for a wide range of elemental, alloy, and ionic systems. This study introduces a highly efficient and robust methodology for enumerating globally stable and metastable structures utilizing polynomial MLPs. To develop MLPs that are sufficiently robust for structure enumeration, an iterative process involving random structure searches and subsequent updates to the MLPs is employed. This methodology has been systematically applied to elemental systems such as As, Bi, Ga, In, La, P, Sb, Sn, and Te, where numerous local minima present significant competition with the global minimum in terms of energy. The proposed approach facilitates robust global structure searches and structure enumerations by markedly accelerating the search process and expanding the search space.</description>

      <title>Bipartite reweight-annealing algorithm to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy and its derivative in high precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05324v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) scheme able to extract large-scale data of entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative with high precision and low technical barrier. We avoid directly computing the overlap of two partition functions within different spacetime manifolds and instead obtain them separately via reweight-annealing scheme. The incremental process can be designed along the path of real physical parameters in this frame, and all intermediates are EEs of corresponding parameters, so the algorithm efficiency is improved by more than $10^4$ of times. The calculation of EE becomes much cheaper and simpler. It opens a way to numerically detect the novel phases and phase transitions by scanning EE in a wide parameter-region in two and higher dimensional systems. We then show the feasibility of using EE and its derivative to find phase transition points and to probe novel phases.</description>

      <title>One-Dimensional, One-Phase and Two-Phase Eulerian Explicit Shock Tube Simulation Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14018v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, a one-dimensional simulation code was developed for both single-phase and two-phase systems, focusing on time-dependent Euler equations for gas and particles. These equations, non-linear hyperbolic conservation laws, describe the dynamics of compressible materials, where body forces, viscous stresses, and heat flux are neglected. The Euler equations were discretized using the finite volume method, and the code was written in MATLAB. To test the accuracy of the computational fluid code, the Sod shock tube problem, a physical analogue of the Riemann problem, was employed. This problem models a pressure discontinuity where high and low-pressure regions are separated by a diaphragm, which breaks at t=0, creating a discontinuity in density as well. Exact solutions were used for code verification. A key focus was on modeling a curtain of particles impacted by a shock wave, relevant to multiphase heterogeneous cylindrical explosion studies by the PSAAP II project. This initiative, funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing (ASC), involves Sandia National Laboratories and the Center for Compressible Multiphase Turbulence at the University of Florida. The propagation of uncertainties in the maximum density of the particle curtain was studied by varying initial curtain thickness and initial high density. Given the computational expense of multiple code evaluations for uncertainty propagation, a multi-fidelity surrogate model combining low and high-fidelity simulations was implemented. This model facilitated uncertainty propagation using DAKOTA, a flexible and extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Novel Silicon Allotropes with Optimized Band Gaps to Enhance Solar Cell Efficiency through Evolutionary Algorithms and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing solar energy technologies, this study presents 20 direct and quasi-direct band gap silicon crystalline semiconductors that satisfy the Shockley-Queisser limit, a benchmark for solar cell efficiency. Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. We examine the optical properties by studying the imaginary part of the dielectric function by solving the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on top of GW approximation. By calculating the SLME, we achieve an efficiency of 32.7% for Si$_{22}$ at a thickness of 500 nm. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of novel materials in recent years has been accelerated greatly by the use of computational modelling techniques aimed at elucidating the complex physics controlling microstructure formation in materials, the properties of which control material function. One such technique is the phase field method, a field theoretic approach that couples various thermophysical fields to microscopic order parameter fields that track the phases of microstructure. Phase field models are framed as multiple, non-linear, partial differential equations, which are extremely challenging to compute efficiently. Recent years have seen an explosion of computational algorithms aimed at enhancing the efficiency of phase field simulations. One such technique, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), dynamically adapts numerical meshes to be highly refined around steep spatial gradients of the PDE fields and coarser where the fields are smooth. This reduces the number of computations per time step significantly, thus reducing the total time of computation. What AMR doesn't do is allow for adaptive time stepping. This work combines AMR with a neural network algorithm that uses a U-Net with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (CLSTM) base to accelerate phase field simulations. Our neural network algorithm is described in detail and tested in on simulations of directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy, a paradigm that is highly practical for its relevance to the solidification of alloys.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the two-dimensional behavior of colloidal patchy ellipsoids specifically designed to follow a two-step assembly process from the monomer state to mesoscopic liquid-crystal phases, via the formation of so-called bent-core units at the intermediate stage. Our model comprises a binary mixture of ellipses interacting via the Gay-Berne potential and decorated by surface patches, with the binary components being mirror-image variants of each other - referred to as left-handed and right-handed ellipses according to the position of their patches. The surface patches are designed so as in the first stage of the assembly the monomers form bent-cores units, i.e. V-shaped dimers with a specific bent angle. The Gay-Berne interactions, which act between the ellipses, drive the dimers to subsequently form the characteristic phase observed in bent-core liquid crystals. We numerically investigate -- by means of both Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations -- the described two-step process: we first optimize a target bent-core unit and we then fully characterize its state diagram in temperature and density, defining the regions where the different liquid crystalline phases dominate.</description>
