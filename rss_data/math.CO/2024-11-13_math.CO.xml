      <title>Further Results on the Majority Roman Domination in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=(V,E)$ be a simple graph of order $n$. A Majority Roman Dominating Function (MRDF) on a graph G is a function $f: V\rightarrow\{-1, +1, 2\}$ if the sum of its function values over at least half the closed neighborhoods is at least one , this is , for at least half of the vertices $v\in V$, $f(N[v])\geq 1$. Moreover, every vertex u with $f(u)=-1$ is adjacent to at least one vertex $w$ with $f(w)=2$. The Majority Roman Domination number of a graph $G$, denoted by $\gamma_{MR}(G)$ , is the minimum value of $\sum_{v\in{V(G)}}f(v)$ over all Majority Roman Dominating Function $f$ of $G$. In this paper we study properties of the Majority Roman Domination in graphs and obtain lower and upper bounds the Majority Roman Domination number of some graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $f(n)$ denote the maximum total length of the sides of $n$ squares packed inside a unit square. Erd\H{o}s conjectured that $f(k^2+1)=k$. We show that the conjecture is true if we assume that the sides of the squares are parallel to the sides of the unit square.</description>

      <title>The Chirotropical Grassmannian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in particle physics have revealed deep connections between scattering amplitudes and tropical geometry. At the heart of this relationship are the chirotropical Grassmannian $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(k,n)$ and chirotropical Dressian $\text{Dr}^\chi(k,n)$, polyhedral fans built from uniform realizable chirotopes that encode the combinatorial structure of generalized Feynman diagrams. We prove that $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n) = \text{Dr}^\chi(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$, and develop algorithms to compute these objects from their rays modulo lineality. Using these algorithms, we compute all chirotropical Grassmannians $\text{Trop}^\chi \text{G}(3,n)$ for $n = 6,7,8$ across all isomorphism classes of chirotopes. We prove that each chirotopal configuration space $X^\chi(3,6)$ is diffeomorphic to a polytope with an associated canonical logarithmic differential form. Finally, we show that the equality between chirotropical Grassmannian and Dressian fails for $(k,n) = (4,8)$.</description>

      <title>Independent Domination of k-Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simple finite graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$, a vertex subset $D\subseteq V(G)$ is said to be a dominating set if every vertex $v\in V(G)-D$ is adjacent to a vertex in $D$. The independent domination number $\gamma_i(G)$ is the minimum cardinality among all independent dominating sets of $G$. As the problem of finding the domination number for general graphs is NP-complete, we focus on the class of $k$-trees. In particular, we determine a tight upper bound for the independent domination number of $k$-trees for all $k\in \mathbb{N}$.</description>

      <title>Shrinking Circular Nim</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of Nim, which has been well known for many years, has numerous variations. One such variation is Circular Nim, where piles of stones are arranged on a circumference, and players take stones from consecutive adjacent piles in one move. In this paper, we propose a new variant called Shrinking Circular Nim, in which the size of the circle decreases as the game progresses. We also examine the winning conditions in this variant. This paper discusses that Shrinking Circular Nim is solved for initial configurations with five or fewer piles. In addition, we derive the winning condition for the specific case with eight piles.</description>

      <title>Containers with non-uniform co-degree conditions, and an application to nearly orthogonal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a variant of the hypergraph container lemma with non-uniform conditions on the co-degrees. In particular, an upper bound on the co-degree of some subset of vertices $T$ is allowed to depend on where the vertices in $T$ live in the hypergraph, rather than having one condition which holds for all subsets. We use this to extend recent results on nearly-orthogonal sets in $\mathbb{F}_p^d$. For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d, k$ and $\ell$, a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $(k,\ell)$-nearly orthogonal if all vectors in $A$ are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors in $A$ contain $\ell + 1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors. Recently, Haviv, Mattheus, Milojevi\'{c} and Wigderson have improved the lower bound on nearly orthogonal sets over finite fields, using counting arguments and a hypergraph container lemma. They showed that for every prime $p$ and an integer $\ell$, there is a constant $\delta(p,\ell)$ such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $d \geq k \geq \ell + 1$, $\mathbb{F}^d$ contains a $(k,\ell)$-nearly orthogonal set of size $d^{\delta k / \log k}$. This nearly matches an upper bound $\binom{d+k}{k}$ coming from Ramsey theory. Moreover, they proved the same lower bound for the size of a largest set $A$ where for any two subsets of $A$ of size $k+1$ each, there is a vector in one of the subsets orthogonal to a vector in the other one. We prove that essentially the same lower bound holds for the size of a largest set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ with the stronger property that given any family of subsets $A_1, \ldots, A_{\ell+1} \subset A$, each of size $k+1$, we can find a vector in each $A_i$ such that they are all pairwise orthogonal.</description>

      <title>On the BCI Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. The BCI problem asks whether two Haar graphs of $G$ are isomorphic if and only if they are isomorphic by an element of an explicit list of isomorphisms. We first generalize this problem in a natural way and give a theoretical way to solve the isomorphism problem for the natural generalization. We then restrict our attention to abelian groups and, with an exception, reduce the problem to the isomorphism problem for a related quotient, component, or corresponding Cayley digraph. For Haar graphs of an abelian group of odd order with connection sets $S$ those of Cayley graphs (i.e. $S = -S$), the exception does not exist. For Haar graphs of cyclic groups of odd order with connection sets those of a Cayley graph, among others, we solve the isomorphism problem.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of pattern-avoiding alternating sign matrices: An asymptotic dichotomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We completely classify the asymptotic behavior of the number of alternating sign matrices classically avoiding a single permutation pattern, in the sense of [Johansson and Linusson 2007]. In particular, we give a uniform proof of an exponential upper bound for the number of alternating sign matrices classically avoiding one of twelve particular patterns, and a super-exponential lower bound for all other single-pattern avoidance classes. We also show that for any fixed integer $k$, there is an exponential upper bound for the number of alternating sign matrices that classically avoid any single permutation pattern and contain precisely $k$ negative ones. Finally, we prove that there must be at most $3$ negative ones in an alternating sign matrix which classically avoids both $2143$ and $3412$, and we exactly enumerate the number of them with precisely $3$ negative ones.</description>

      <title>Stability Theorems for Forbidden Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stability is a well investigated concept in extremal combinatorics. The main idea is that if some object is close in size to an extremal object, then it retains the structure of the extremal construction. In the present paper we study stability in the context of forbidden configurations. $(0,1)$-matrix $F$ is a configuration in a $(0,1)$-matrix $A$ if $F$ is a row and columns permutation of a submatrix of $A$. $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$ denotes the set of $m$-rowed $(0,1)$-matrices with pairwise distinct columns without configuration $F$, $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)$ is the largest number of columns of a matrix in $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$, while $\mathrm{ext}(m,F)$ is the set of matrices in $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$ of size $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)$. We show cases (i) when each element of $\mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$ have the structure of element(s) in $\mathrm{ext}(m,F)$, (ii) $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)=\Theta(m^2)$ and the size of $A\in \mathrm{Avoid}(m,F)$ deviates from $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)$ by a linear amount, or (iii) $\mathrm{forb}(m,F)=\Theta(m)$ and the size of $A$ is smaller by a constant, then the structure of $A$ is same as the structure of a matrix in $\mathrm{ext}(m,F)$.</description>

      <title>Spanning $H$-subdivisions and perfect $H$-subdivision tilings in dense digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a digraph $H$, we say a digraph $H^\prime$ is an $H$-subdivision if $H^\prime$ is obtained from $H$ by replacing one or more arcs from $H$ with internally vertex-disjoint path(s). In this paper, we prove that for any digraph $H$ with $h$ arcs and no isolated vertices, there is a constant $C_0&gt;0$ such that the following hold.
  $(1)$ For any integer $C\geq C_0$ and every digraph $D$ on $n\geq Ch$ vertices, if the minimum in- and out-degree of $D$ is at least $n/2$, then it contains an $H$-subdivision covering all vertices of $D$.
  $(2)$ For any integer partition $n=n_1+\cdots+n_m$ such that the sum of the $n_i$ less than $\alpha n$ is no more than $\beta n$, if a digraph $D$ has the order $n\geq Cm$ and the minimum in- and out-degree at least $\sum_{i=1}^m\lceil\frac{n_i}{2}\rceil$, then it contains $m$ disjoint $H$-subdivisions, where the order of these $H$-subdivisions is $n_1, \ldots, n_m$, respectively.
  The result of $(1)$ settles the conjecture raised by Pavez-Sing\'{e} \cite{Pavez} in a stronger form, and ameliorate the result of Lee \cite{Lee}. Also, the conclusion of $(2)$ partly answers of the conjecture of Lee \cite{Lee1} and generalizes the recent work of Lee \cite{Lee1}.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically sharp bounds for cancellative and union-free hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-graph is called $t$-cancellative if for arbitrary $t+2$ distinct edges $A_1,\ldots,A_t,B,C$, it holds that $(\cup_{i=1}^t A_i)\cup B\neq (\cup_{i=1}^t A_i)\cup C$; it is called $t$-union-free if for arbitrary two distinct subsets $\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}$, each consisting of at most $t$ edges, it holds that $\cup_{A\in\mathcal{A}} A\neq \cup_{B\in\mathcal{B}} B$. Let $C_t(n,r)$ and $U_t(n,r)$ denote the maximum number of edges that can be contained in an $n$-vertex $t$-cancellative and $t$-union-free $r$-graph, respectively. The study of $C_t(n,r)$ and $U_t(n,r)$ has a long history, dating back to the classic works of Erd\H{o}s and Katona, and Erd\H{o}s and Moser in the 1970s. In 2020, Shangguan and Tamo showed that $C_{2(t-1)}(n,tk)=\Theta(n^k)$ and $U_{t+1}(n,tk)=\Theta(n^k)$ for all $t\ge 2$ and $k\ge 2$. In this paper, we determine the asymptotics of these two functions up to a lower order term, by showing that for all $t\ge 2$ and $k\ge 2$,
  \begin{align*}
  \text{$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{C_{2(t-1)}(n,tk)}{n^k}=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{U_{t+1}(n,tk)}{n^k}=\frac{1}{k!}\cdot \frac{1}{\binom{tk-1}{k-1}}$.}
  \end{align*}
  Previously, it was only known by a result of F\"uredi in 2012 that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{C_{2}(n,4)}{n^2}=\frac{1}{6}$.
  To prove the lower bounds of the limits, we utilize a powerful framework developed recently by Delcourt and Postle, and independently by Glock, Joos, Kim, K\"uhn, and Lichev, which shows the existence of near-optimal hypergraph packings avoiding certain small configurations, and to prove the upper bounds, we apply a novel counting argument that connects $C_{2(t-1)}(n,tk)$ to a classic result of Kleitman and Frankl on a special case of the famous Erd\H{o}s Matching Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Variation in $\alpha$ trace norm of a digraph by deletion of a vertex or an arc and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a digraph of order $n$ with adjacency matrix $A(D)$. For $\alpha\in[0,1)$, the $A_{\alpha}$ matrix of $D$ is defined as $A_{\alpha}(D)=\alpha {\Delta}^{+}(D)+(1-\alpha)A(D)$, where ${\Delta}^{+}(D)=\mbox{diag}~(d_1^{+},d_2^{+},\dots,d_n^{+})$ is the diagonal matrix of vertex outdegrees of $D$. Let $\sigma_{1\alpha}(D),\sigma_{2\alpha}(D),\dots,\sigma_{n\alpha}(D)$ be the singular values of $A_{\alpha}(D)$. Then the trace norm of $A_{\alpha}(D)$, which we call $\alpha$ trace norm of $D$, is defined as $\|A_{\alpha}(D)\|_*=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{i\alpha}(D)$. In this paper, we study the variation in $\alpha$ trace norm of a digraph when a vertex or an arc is deleted. As an application of these results, we characterize oriented trees and unicyclic digraphs with maximum $\alpha$ trace norm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an upper bound on the minimum codegree necessary for the existence of spanning, fractional Steiner triple systems in $3$-uniform hypergraphs. This improves upon a result by Lee in 2023. In particular, together with results from Lee's paper, our results imply that if $n$ is sufficiently large and satisfies some necessary divisibility conditions, then a $3$-uniform, $n$-vertex hypergraph $H$ contains a Steiner triple system if every pair of vertices forms an edge in $H$ with at least $0.8579n$ other vertices.</description>

      <title>Largest component in Boolean sublattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a subfamily ${F}\subseteq 2^{[n]}$ of the Boolean lattice, consider the graph $G_{F}$ on ${F}$ based on the pairwise inclusion relations among its members. Given a positive integer $t$, how large can ${F}$ be before $G_{F}$ must contain some component of order greater than $t$? For $t=1$, this question was answered exactly almost a century ago by Sperner: the size of a middle layer of the Boolean lattice. For $t=2^n$, this question is trivial. We are interested in what happens between these two extremes. For $t=2^{g}$ with $g=g(n)$ being any integer function that satisfies $g(n)=o(n/\log n)$ as $n\to\infty$, we give an asymptotically sharp answer to the above question: not much larger than the size of a middle layer. This constitutes a nontrivial generalisation of Sperner's theorem. We do so by a reduction to a Tur\'an-type problem for rainbow cycles in properly edge-coloured graphs. Among other results, we also give a sharp answer to the question, how large can ${F}$ be before $G_{F}$ must be connected?</description>

Abstract: Patterns are words with terminals and variables. The language of a pattern is the set of words obtained by uniformly substituting all variables with words that contain only terminals. Regular constraints restrict valid substitutions of variables by associating with each variable a regular language representable by, e.g., finite automata. Pattern languages with regular constraints contain only words in which each variable is substituted according to a set of regular constraints. We consider the membership, inclusion, and equivalence problems for erasing and non-erasing pattern languages with regular constraints. Our main result shows that the erasing equivalence problem, one of the most prominent open problems in the realm of patterns, becomes undecidable if regular constraints are allowed in addition to variable equality.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Genus Algorithm Based on Graph Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the minimal genus of a given finite connected graph. We present an algorithm which, for an arbitrary graph $G$ with $n$ vertices, determines the orientable genus of $G$ in $\mathcal{O}({2^{(n^2+3n)}}/{n^{(n+1)}})$ steps. This algorithm avoids the difficulties that many other genus algorithms have with handling bridge placements which is a well-known issue. The algorithm has a number of properties that make it useful for practical use: it is simple to implement, it outputs the faces of the optimal embedding, it outputs a proof certificate for verification and it can be used to obtain upper and lower bounds. We illustrate the algorithm by determining the genus of the $(3,12)$ cage (which is 17); other graphs are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose $A$ is a subset of $\{1, \dotsc, N\}$ which does not contain any configurations of the form $x,x+\lfloor n^c \rfloor$ where $n \neq 0$ and $1&lt;c&lt;\frac{6}{5}$. We show that the density of $A$ relative to the first $N$ integers is $O_c(N^{1-\frac{6}{5c}})$. More generally, given a smooth and regular real valued function $h$ with "growth rate" $c \in (1,\frac{6}{5})$, we show that if $A$ lacks configurations of the form $x,x \pm \lfloor h(n) \rfloor$ then $\frac{|A|}{N} \ll_{h,\varepsilon} N^{1-\frac{6}{5c}+\varepsilon}$ for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>Machines and Mathematical Mutations: Using GNNs to Characterize Quiver Mutation Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming an increasingly valuable tool in mathematics, enabling one to identify subtle patterns across collections of examples so vast that they would be impossible for a single researcher to feasibly review and analyze. In this work, we use graph neural networks to investigate quiver mutation -- an operation that transforms one quiver (or directed multigraph) into another -- which is central to the theory of cluster algebras with deep connections to geometry, topology, and physics. In the study of cluster algebras, the question of mutation equivalence is of fundamental concern: given two quivers, can one efficiently determine if one quiver can be transformed into the other through a sequence of mutations? Currently, this question has only been resolved in specific cases. In this paper, we use graph neural networks and AI explainability techniques to discover mutation equivalence criteria for the previously unknown case of quivers of type $\tilde{D}_n$. Along the way, we also show that even without explicit training to do so, our model captures structure within its hidden representation that allows us to reconstruct known criteria from type $D_n$, adding to the growing evidence that modern machine learning models are capable of learning abstract and general rules from mathematical data.</description>

      <title>Dimension bounds on classes of interval orders with restricted representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.00089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, representations of interval orders may use an arbitrary set of interval lengths. We can define subclasses of interval orders by restricting the allowable lengths of intervals. Motivated by a recent paper of Keller, Trenk, and Young, we study the dimension of posets in some of these subclasses. Among other results, we answer several of their questions, and we simplify the proof of one of their main results.</description>

      <title>Two-sided permutation statistics via symmetric functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15785v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a permutation statistic $\operatorname{st}$, define its inverse statistic $\operatorname{ist}$ by $\operatorname{ist}(\pi):=\operatorname{st}(\pi^{-1})$. We give a general approach, based on the theory of symmetric functions, for finding the joint distribution of $\operatorname{st}_{1}$ and $\operatorname{st}_{2}$ whenever $\operatorname{st}_{1}$ and $\operatorname{st}_{2}$ are descent statistics: permutation statistics that depend only on the descent composition. We apply this method to a number of descent statistics, including the descent number, the peak number, the left peak number, the number of up-down runs, and the major index. Perhaps surprisingly, in many cases the polynomial giving the joint distribution of $\operatorname{st}_{1}$ and $\operatorname{ist}_{2}$ can be expressed as a simple sum involving products of the polynomials giving the (individual) distributions of $\operatorname{st}_{1}$ and $\operatorname{st}_{2}$. Our work leads to a rederivation of Stanley's generating function for doubly alternating permutations, as well as several conjectures concerning real-rootedness and $\gamma$-positivity.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study systems of $n \geq 1$, not necessarily linear, discrete differential equations (DDEs) of order $k \geq 1$ with one catalytic variable. We provide a constructive and elementary proof of algebraicity of the solutions of such equations. This part of the present article can be seen as a generalization of the pioneering work by Bousquet-M\'elou and Jehanne (2006) who settled down the case $n=1$. Moreover, we obtain effective bounds for the algebraicity degrees of the solutions and provide an algorithm for computing annihilating polynomials of the algebraic series. Finally, we carry out a first analysis in the direction of effectivity for solving systems of DDEs in view of practical applications.</description>

Abstract: We propose an open question that seeks to generalise the Four Colour Theorem from two to three dimensions. As an appetiser, we show that 12 instead of four colours are both sufficient and necessary to colour every 2-complex that embeds in a prescribed 3-manifold. However, our example of a 2-complex that requires 12 colours is not simplicial.</description>

      <title>On reduced expressions for core double cosets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of a reduced expression for a double coset in a Coxeter group was introduced by Williamson, and recent work of Elias and Ko has made this theory more accessible and combinatorial. One result of Elias-Ko is that any coset admits a reduced expression which factors through a reduced expression for a related coset called its core. In this paper we define a class of cosets called atomic cosets, and prove that every core coset admits a reduced expression as a composition of atomic cosets. This leads to an algorithmic construction of a reduced expression for any coset. In types $A$ and $B$ we prove that the combinatorics of compositions of atomic cosets matches the combinatorics of ordinary expressions in a smaller group. In other types the combinatorics is new, as explored in a sequel by Ko.</description>

Abstract: We study the symmetry groups and winding numbers of planar curves obtained as images of weighted sums of exponentials. More generally, we study the image of the complex unit circle under a finite or infinite Laurent series using a particular parametrization of the circle. We generalize various previous results on such sums of exponentials and relate them to other classes of curves present in the literature. Moreover, we consider the evolution under the wave equation of such curves for the case of binomials. Interestingly, our methods provide a unified and systematic way of constructing curves with prescribed properties, such as the number of cusps, the number of intersection points or the winding number.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Askey-Wilson relations using a projective geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalization of the Askey-Wilson relations that involves a projective geometry. A projective geometry is defined as follows. Let $h&gt;k\geq 1$ denote integers. Let $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $\mathcal{V}$ denote an $(h+k)$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. Let the set $P$ consist of the subspaces of $\mathcal{V}$. The set $P$, together with the inclusion partial order, is a poset called a projective geometry. We define a matrix $A\in \text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$ as follows. For $u,v\in P$, the $(u,v)$-entry of $A$ is $1$ if each of $u,v$ covers $u\cap v$, and $0$ otherwise. Fix $y\in P$ with $\dim y=k$. We define a diagonal matrix $A^*\in \text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$ as follows. For $u\in P$, the $(u,u)$-entry of $A^{*}$ is $q^{\dim(u\cap y)}$. We show that \begin{align*}
  &amp;A^2A^{*}-\bigl(q+q^{-1}\bigr)AA^{*}A+A^{*}A^{2}-\mathcal{Y}\bigl(AA^{*}+A^{*}A\bigr)-\mathcal{P} A^{*}=\Omega A+G, \newline
  &amp;A^{*2}A-\bigl(q+q^{-1}\bigr) A^*AA^*+AA^{*2}=\mathcal{Y}A^{*2}+\Omega A^{*}+G^{*}, \end{align*} where $\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{P}, \Omega, G, G^*$ are matrices in $\text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$ that commute with each of $A, A^*$. We give precise formulas for $\mathcal{Y}, \mathcal{P}, \Omega, G, G^*$.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum to the equivalent statement of the Laplacian Spread Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G,$ let $\alpha(G)$ denote its second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue. The Laplacian Spread Conjecture states that $\alpha(G)+\alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1,$ where $\overline{G}$ is the complement of $G.$ In this paper, we have corrected two conclusions: First, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\alpha(G) + \alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1$ is $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 1$ rather than $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ which has been proved in \cite{BS} as demonstrated in our study. Second, we show that the Laplacian spread of balanced digraph $\Gamma$ satisfies $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - \frac{1}{2}$ but not $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - 1$ in \cite{BCEHK}, since inequality $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ does not hold.</description>

      <title>Regions of Level $l$ of Exponential Sequence of Arrangements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper primarily investigates a specific type of deformation of the braid arrangement $\mathcal{B}_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, which is the set $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ of the following hyperplanes: \[ x_i-x_j=a_1,\ldots,a_m, \quad 1\le i&lt;j\le n, \] where $A=\{a_1,\ldots,a_m\}$ consists of distinct real numbers. We define an exponential generating function as $R_l(A;x):=\sum_{n\ge 0}r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)\frac{x^n}{n!}$, where $r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)$ represents the number of regions of level $l$ in $\mathcal{B}_n^A$. Using the weighted digraph model introduced by Hetyei \cite{Hetyei2024}, we establish a bijection between regions of level $l$ in $\mathcal{B}_n^A$ and valid $m$-acyclic weighted digraphs on the vertex set $[n]$ with exactly $l$ strong components. Based on the bijection, we demonstrate that the sequence $\big(r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)\big)_{n\ge 0}$ possesses a property analogous to that of a polynomial sequence of binomial type, that is, $R_l(A;x)$ satisfies the relation \[ R_l(A;x)=\big(R_1(A;x)\big)^l=R_k(A;x)R_{l-k}(A;x). \] Furthermore, we obtain a convolution formula for the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{\mathcal{B}_n^A}(t)$ in terms of $r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)$, stated as follows: \[\chi_{\mathcal{B}_n^A}(t)=\sum_{l=0}^n(-1)^{n-l}r_l(\mathcal{B}_n^A)\binom{t}{l}.\] For any non-negative integers $n\ge 2$, $a$ and $b$ with $b-a\ge n-1$, we also show that the characteristic polynomial $\chi_{\mathcal{B}_n^{[-a,b]}}(t)$ has a unique real root at $0$ if $n$ is odd as well as two simple real roots $0$ and $\frac{n(a+b+1)}{2}$ if $n$ is even.</description>

      <title>Lattice paths and the diagonal of the cube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study lattice paths in the cube, starting at $(n,n,n)$ and ending at $(0,0,0)$, with unit steps $(-1,0,0)$, $(0,-1,0)$, $(0,0,-1)$. Our main interest is the number of times the diagonal $x=y=z$ is visited during the random walk. We derive the corresponding generating function of such lattice paths. We also turn to the cuboid, enumerating lattice paths starting at $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ and ending at $(0,0,0)$ according to the visits to the cube's diagonal. Furthermore, we provide for the cube a refined enumeration according to visits after a detour of a certain length. These enumerations allow us to obtain distributional results for the corresponding random variables. Extensions to hypercube are discussed, as well as a summary of known results for the square. We collect applications to the sampling without replacement urn and a card guessing game. Finally, we also show how to recover (and extend) a very recent result of Li and Starr on Dyck bridges using generating functions and composition schemes.</description>

      <title>Positive codegree Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s theorem for the generalized triangle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Andr\'{a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s Theorem from 1974 shows that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph with minimum degree greater than $2n/5$ must be bipartite.
  We establish a positive codegree extension of this result for the $r$-uniform generalized triangle $\mathrm{T}_{r} = \left\{\{1,\ldots, r-1,r\}, \{1,\ldots, r-1,r+1\},\{r,r+1, \ldots, 2r-1\}\right\}$$\colon$ For every $n \ge (r-1)(2r+1)/2$, if $\mathcal{H}$ is an $n$-vertex $\mathrm{T}_{r}$-free $r$-uniform hypergraph in which each $(r-1)$-tuple of vertices is contained in either zero edges or more than $2n/(2r+1)$ edges of $\mathcal{H}$, then $\mathcal{H}$ is $r$-partite. This result provides the first tight positive codegree Andr{\'a}sfai--Erd\H{o}s--S\'{o}s type theorem for hypergraphs. It also immediately implies that the positive codegree Tur\'{a}n number of $\mathrm{T}_{r}$ is $\lfloor n/r \rfloor$ for all $r$. Additionally, for $r=3$, our result answers one of the questions posed by Hou et al.~\cite{HLYZZ22} in a strong form.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of joint co-tiles in $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An old theorem of Newman asserts that any tiling of $\mathbb{Z}$ by a finite set is periodic. A few years ago, Bhattacharya proved the periodic tiling conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Namely, he proved that for a finite subset $F$ of $\mathbb{Z}^2$, if there exists $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $F \oplus A = \mathbb{Z}^2$ then there exists a periodic $A' \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ such that $F \oplus A' = \mathbb{Z}^2$. The recent refutation of the periodic tiling conjecture in high dimensions due to Greenfeld and Tao motivates finding different generalizations of Newman's theorem and of Bhattacharya's theorem that hold in arbitrary dimension $d$. In this paper, we formulate and prove such generalizations. We do so by studying the structure of joint co-tiles in $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Our generalization of Newman's theorem states that for any $d \ge 1$, any joint co-tile for $d$ independent tiles is periodic. For a $(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy a certain technical condition that we call property $(\star)$, we prove that any joint co-tile decomposes into disjoint $(d-1)$-periodic sets. Consequently, we show that for a $(d-1)$-tuple of finite subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ that satisfy property $(\star)$, the existence of a joint co-tile implies the existence of periodic joint co-tile. Conversely, we prove that if a finite subset $F$ in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ admits a periodic co-tile $A$, then there exist $(d-1)$ additional tiles that together with $F$ are independent and admit $A$ as a joint co-tile, so that the first $(d-2)$ of these tiles together with $F$ satisfy property $(\star)$. Combined, our results give a new necessary and sufficient condition for a subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ to tile periodically. We also discuss tilings and joint tilings in other countable abelian groups.</description>

      <title>A characterization of graphs $G$ with $m_G(\lambda)= 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple connected graph. If every pendant path in $G$ is at least $P_s$, we denote that $G\in \mathbb{G}_s$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, let $Q_s(G)$ be the set of vertices in $G$ that are distance $s$ from the pendant vertex, and let $|Q_s(G)| = q_s(G)$. For $G \in \mathbb{G}_s$, Li et al. (2024) proved that when $\lambda$ is not an eigenvalue of $P_s$ and $G$ is neither a cycle nor a starlike tree $T_k$, it holds that $m_G(\lambda) \leq 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ and characterized the extremal graphs when $G$ is a tree. In this article, we characterize the extremal graphs for which $m_G(\lambda) = 2c(G) + q_s(G) - 1$ when $G \in \mathbb{G}_{s}$ and $\lambda\notin \sigma(P_s)$. Furthermore, we extend some of the results of Li et al. using star sets.</description>

      <title>Cochordal zero divisor graphs and Betti numbers of their edge ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We associate a sequence of positive integers, termed the type sequence, with a cochordal graph. Using this type sequence, we compute all graded Betti numbers of its edge ideal. We then classify all positive integer $n$ such that the zero divisor graph of $\mathbb{Z}/n \mathbb{Z}$ is cochordal and determine all the graded Betti numbers of its edge ideal.</description>
