      <title>Minimum Sample Size Calculation for Multivariable Regression of Continuous Outcomes in Chemometrics for Astrobiology and Planetary Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few decades, prediction models have become a fundamental tool in statistics, chemometrics, and related fields. However, to ensure that such models have high value, the inferences that they generate must be reliable. In this regard, the internal validity of a prediction model might be threatened if it is not calibrated with a sufficiently large sample size, as problems such as overfitting may occur. Such situations would be highly problematic in many fields, including space science, as the resulting inferences from prediction models often inform scientific inquiry about planetary bodies such as Mars. Therefore, to better inform the development of prediction models, we applied a theory-based guidance from the biomedical domain for establishing what the minimum sample size is under a range of conditions for continuous outcomes. This study aims to disseminate existing research criteria in biomedical research to a broader audience, specifically focusing on their potential applicability and utility within the field of chemometrics. As such, the paper emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinarity, bridging the gap between the medical domain and chemometrics. Lastly, we provide several examples of work in the context of space science. This work will be the foundation for more evidence-based model development and ensure rigorous predictive modelling in the search for life and possible habitable environments.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Modeling of the Three-Dimensional Magnetic Field in the Sun's Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel generative denoising diffusion model for synthesizing the Sun's three-dimensional coronal magnetic field, a complex and dynamic region characterized by evolving magnetic structures. Despite daily variability, these structures exhibit recurring patterns and long-term cyclic trends, presenting unique modeling challenges and opportunities at the intersection of physics and machine learning. Our generative approach employs an innovative architecture influenced by Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO), operating within the spherical harmonic domain, where the scalar field corresponds directly to the magnetic potential under physical constraints. We trained this model using an extensive dataset comprising 11.7 years of daily coupled simulations from the Air Force Data Assimilative Photospheric Flux Transport-Wang Sheeley Arge (ADAPT-WSA) model, further enhanced by data augmentation. Initial results demonstrate the model's capability to conditionally generate physically realistic magnetic fields reflective of distinct phases within the 11-year solar cycle: from solar minimum ($S = 0$) to solar maximum ($S = 1$). This approach represents a significant step toward advanced generative three-dimensional modeling in Heliophysics, with potential applications in solar forecasting, data assimilation, inverse problem-solving, and broader impacts in areas such as procedural generation of physically-informed graphical assets.</description>

      <title>PRESOL: a web-based computational setting for feature-based flare forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares are the most explosive phenomena in the solar system and the main trigger of the events' chain that starts from Coronal Mass Ejections and leads to geomagnetic storms with possible impacts on the infrastructures at Earth. Data-driven solar flare forecasting relies on either deep learning approaches, which are operationally promising but with a low explainability degree, or machine learning algorithms, which can provide information on the physical descriptors that mostly impact the prediction. This paper describes a web-based technological platform for the execution of a computational pipeline of feature-based machine learning methods that provide predictions of the flare occurrence, feature ranking information, and assessment of the prediction performances.</description>

      <title>Impact Plasma Amplification of the Ancient Mercury Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacecraft measurements of Mercury indicate it has a core dynamo with a surface field of 200-800 nT. These data also indicate that the crust contains remanent magnetization likely produced by an ancient magnetic field. The inferred magnetization intensity is consistent with a wide range of paleofield strengths (0.2-50 uT), possibly indicating that Mercury once had a dynamo field much stronger than today. Recent modeling of ancient lunar impacts has demonstrated that plasma generated during basin-formation can transiently amplify a planetary dynamo field near the surface. Simultaneous impact-induced pressure waves can then record these fields in the form of crustal shock remanent magnetization (SRM). Here, we present impact hydrocode and magnetohydrodynamic simulations of a Caloris-size basin (~1,550 km diameter) formation event. Our results demonstrate that the ancient magnetospheric field (~0.5-0.9 uT) created by the interaction of the ancient interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) and Mercury's dynamo field can be amplified by the plasma up to ~13 uT and, via impact pressure waves, be recorded as SRM in the basin antipode. Such magnetization could produce ~5 nT crustal fields at 20-km altitude antipodal to Caloris detectable by future spacecraft like BepiColombo. Furthermore, impacts in the southern hemisphere that formed ~1,000 km diameter basins (e.g., Andal-Coleridge, Matisse-Repin, Eitkou-Milton, and Sadi-Scopus) could impart crustal magnetization in the northern hemisphere, contributing to the overall remanent field measured by MESSENGER. Overall, the impact plasma amplification process can contribute to crustal magnetization on airless bodies and should be considered when reconstructing dynamo history from crustal anomaly measurements.</description>
