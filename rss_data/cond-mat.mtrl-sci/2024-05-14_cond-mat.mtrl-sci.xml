      <title>Towards the reproducible fabrication of conductive ferroelectric domain walls into lithium niobate bulk single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) are promising structures for assembling future nano-electronic circuit elements on a larger scale, since reporting domain wall currents of up to 1 mA per single DW. One key requirement hereto is their reproducible manufacturing by gaining preparative control over domain size and domain wall conductivity (DWC). To date, most works on DWC have focused on exploring the fundamental electrical properties of individual DWs within single shot experiments, with emphasis on quantifying the origins for DWC. Very few reports exist when it comes to compare the DWC properties between two separate DWs, and literally nothing exists where issues of reproducibility in DWC devices have been addressed. To fill this gap while facing the challenge of finding guidelines achieving predictable DWC performance, we report on a procedure that allows us to reproducibly prepare single hexagonal domains of a predefined diameter into uniaxial ferroelectric (FE) lithium niobate (LN) single crystals of 200 and 300 micrometers thickness, respectively. We show that the domain diameter can be controlled with an error of a few percent. As-grown DWs are then subjected to a standard procedure of current-controlled high-voltage DWC enhancement, repetitively reaching a DWC increase of 6 orders of magnitude. While all resulting DWs show significantly enhanced DWC values, subtle features in their individual current-voltage (I-V) characteristics hint towards different 3D shapes into the bulk, with variations probably reflecting local heterogeneities by defects, DW pinning, and surface-near DW inclination, which seem to have a larger impact than expected.</description>

      <title>Durability of MgO/hydromagnesite mortars -- Resistance to chlorides and corrosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The durability of MgO/hydromagnesite mortars was studied with respect to their corrosion performance and resistance to chloride attack and moisture. MgO/hydromagnesite pastes were cured in chloride solution to induce potential formation of Mg-chlorides; however, no such phases were observed. Rapid chloride ingress measurements demonstrated high penetration resistance and low chloride migration coefficients, i.e. D_Cl = 1e-13 to 1e-12 m^2/s. The corrosion rate of carbon steel embedded in MgO/HY mortars, as determined by linear polarization resistance measurements, was in the range icorr = 1e-9 A/cm^2 in dry and 1e-7 A/cm^2 in wet conditions, irrespective of the mortar composition or curing condition.These findings corroborate the hypothesis that, in the absence of chlorides, the moisture condition is the primary predictor of corrosion rate of carbon steel in the MgO/hydromagnesite binder. These accelerated, short-term experiments suggest that the binder may be suited to protect embedded carbon steel from corrosion under specific exposure conditions of practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Non-local twist sequences in floppy kagome chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The twisted kagome family comprises a spectrum of configurations, that can be realized through the sweep of a single configurational degree of freedom known as twist angle. Recently, it has been shown that certain pairs of configurations along this sweep are linked by duality transformations and display matching phonon spectra. In this work, we introduce an inter-cell connection system that spreads the lattice in the dimension orthogonal to the tessellation plane. The resulting 3D character of the lattice allows us to sweep the entirety of the twist angle spectrum, including all the compact configurations featuring overlapping triangles that, in a strictly 2D space, are forbidden. Duality provides precious guidance in interpreting the availability of floppy mechanisms arising in the compact configurations through the one-to-one correspondence with their expanded counterparts. Our focus is on the compact configuration corresponding to a null twist angle, where the lattice degenerates to a chain. From the perspective of the chain, several of the local connections between neighboring lattice cells play the role of non-local long-range interactions between cells of the chain. We demonstrate experimentally some peculiar behavior that results from such non-locality, including a selective activation of floppy sequences that is informed by the direction of loading.</description>

      <title>Topological grain boundary segregation transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering structure of grain boundaries (GBs) by solute segregation is a promising strategy to tailor the properties of polycrystalline materials. Theoretically it has been suggested that solute segregation can trigger phase transitions at GBs offering novel pathways to design interfaces. However, an understanding of their intrinsic atomistic nature is missing. Here, we combine atomic resolution electron microscopy atomistic simulations to discover that iron segregation to GBs in titanium stabilizes icosahedral units (cages) that form robust building blocks of distinct GB phases. Due to their five-fold symmetry, the Fe cages cluster and assemble into hierarchical GB phases characterised by a different number and arrangement of the constituent icosahedral units. Our advanced GB structure prediction algorithms and atomistic simulations validate the stability of these observed phases and the high excess of Fe at the GB that is accommodated by the phase transitions.</description>

      <title>High quality CVD deposition of Ge layers for Ge/SiGe Quantum Well heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A great deal of interest is directed nowadays towards the development of innovative technologies in the field of quantum information and quantum computing, with emphasis on obtaining reliable qubits as building blocks. The realization of highly stable, controllable and accessible hole spin qubits is strongly dependent on the quality of the materials hosting them. Ultra-clean germanium/silicon-germanium heterostructures have been predicted and proven to be promising candidates and due to their large scalability potential, they are opening the door towards the development of realistic and reliable solid state, all-electric, silicon-based quantum computers. In order to obtain ultra-clean germanium/silicon-germanium heterostructures in a reverse grading approach, the understanding and control over the growth of Ge virtual substrates and thin films is key. Here, we present a detailed study on the growth kinetics, morphology, and crystal quality of Ge thin films grown via chemical vapor deposition by investigating the effects of growth temperature, partial pressure of the precursor gas and the use of Ar or H2 atmosphere. The presence of carrier gases catalyzes the deposition rate and induces a smoothening on the surfaces of films grown at low temperatures. We investigated the surface roughness and threading dislocation density as a function of deposition temperature, partial pressure and gas mixture. Ge thin films deposited by diluting GeH4 in Ar or H2 were employed as virtual substrates for the growth of full Ge/SiGe QW heterostructures. Their defect density was analyzed and their electric transport properties were characterized via Hall measurements. Similar results were obtained for both carrier gases used.</description>

      <title>Tension-compression asymmetry in superelasticity of SrNi2P2 single crystals and the influence of low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ThCr2Si2-type intermetallic compounds are known to exhibit superelasticity associated with structural transitions through lattice collapse and expansion. These transitions occur via the formation and breaking of Si-type bonds, respectively, under uniaxial loading along the [0 0 1] direction. Unlike most ThCr2Si2-type intermetallic compounds, which have either an uncollapsed tetragonal structure or a collapsed tetragonal structure, SrNi2P2 possesses a third type of collapsed structured: a one-third orthorhombic structure, for which one expects the occurrence of unique structural transitions and superelastic behavior. In this study, uniaxial compression and tension tests were conducted on micron-sized SrNi2P2 single crystalline columns at room temperature, 200K, and 100K, to investigate the influence of loading direction and temperature on the superelasticity of SrNi2P2. Experimental data and density functional theory calculations revealed the presence of tension-compression asymmetry in the structural transitions and superelasticity, as well as an asymmetry in their temperature dependence, due to the opposite superelastic process associated with compression (forming P-P bonds) and tension (breaking P-P bonds). Additionally, following thermodynamics, the observations suggest that this asymmetric superelasticity could lead to an opposite elastocaloric effect between compression and tension, which could be beneficial potentially in obtaining large temperature changes compared to conventional superelastic solids that show the same elastocaloric effect regardless of loading direction. These results provide an important fundamental insight into the structural transitions, superelasticity processes, and potential elastocaloric effects in SrNi2P2.</description>

      <title>Impact of Surface Adsorbates and Dimensionality on Templating of Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites (HPs) are promising materials for various optoelectronic applications, yet a comprehensive understanding of their dynamics is still elusive. Here, we offer insight into the dynamics of prototypical 2D HPs based on MAPbI$_3$ as a function of linker molecule and the number of perovskite layers using atomic scale simulations. We show that the layers closest to the linker undergo transitions that are distinct from those of the interior layers. These transitions can take place anywhere between a few tens of Kelvin below to more than 100 K above the cubic-tetragonal transition of bulk MAPbI$_3$. In combination with the thickness of the perovskite layer this enables one to template phase transitions and tune the dynamics over a wide temperature range. Our results thereby reveal the details of an important and generalizable design mechanism for tuning the properties of these materials.</description>

      <title>A new ferromagnetic semiconductor system of Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP $(x = 0.0-0.6)$ compounds: Crystallographic, magnetic, and magneto-resistive properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adjusting chemical pressure through doping is a highly effective method for customizing the chemical and physical properties of materials, along with their respective phase diagrams, thereby uncovering novel quantum phenomena. Here, we successfully synthesized Sr-doped Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP $(x = 0.0-0.6)$ and conducted a comprehensive investigation involving crystallography, magnetization, heat capacity, and magnetoresistance. Utilizing X-ray diffraction and PPMS DynaCool measurements, we studied Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP in detail. The hexagonal structure of parent EuAgP at room temperature, with the $P6_3/mmc$ space group, remains unaltered, while the lattice constants expand. The magnetic phase transition from paramagnetism to ferromagnetism, as temperature decreases, is suppressed through the gradual introduction of strontium doping. Heat capacity measurements reveal a shift from magnon-dominated to predominantly phonon and electron contributions near the ferromagnetic phase with increasing doping levels. The resistivity-temperature relationship displays distinct characteristics, emphasizing the impact of Sr doping on modifying charge transport. Magnetoresistance measurements uncover novel phenomena, illustrating the adjustability of magnetoresistance through Sr doping. Notably, Sr doping results in both positive magnetoresistance (up to 20\%) and negative magnetoresistance (approximately -60\%). The resistivity and magnetic phase diagram were established for the first time, revealing the pronounced feasibility of Sr doping in modulating EuAgP's resistivity. This study has provided valuable insights into the intricate interplay between structural modifications and diverse physical properties. The potential for technological advancements and the exploration of novel quantum states make Sr-doped Eu$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$AgP a compelling subject for continued research in the field of applied physics.</description>

      <title>Exploring material compositions for synthesis using oxidation states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning techniques have made it possible to use high-throughput screening to identify novel materials with specific properties. However, the large number of potential candidates produced by these techniques can make it difficult to select the most promising ones. In this study, we develop the oxidation state probability (OSP) method which evaluates ternary compounds based on the probability (the OSP metric) of each element to adopt the required oxidation states for fulfilling charge neutrality. We compare this model with Roost and the Fourier-transformed crystal properties (FTCP)-based synthesizability score. Among the top 1000 systems with the most database entries in Materials Project (MP), more than 500 systems exhibit an attested compound among the top 3 compositions when ranked by the OSP metric. We find that the OSP method shows promising results for certain classes of ternary systems, especially those containing nonmetals, s-block, or transition metals. When applied to the Cu-In-Te ternary system, an interesting system for thermoelectric applications, the OSP method predicted the synthesizability of CuIn$_3$Te$_5$ without prior knowledge, and we have successfully synthesized CuIn$_3$Te$_5$ in experiment. Our method has the potential to accelerate the discovery of novel compounds by providing a guide for experimentalists to easily select the most synthesizable candidates from an arbitrarily large set of possible chemical compositions.</description>

      <title>Real time observation of oxygen diffusion in CGO thin films using spatially resolved Isotope Exchange Raman Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of advanced materials for novel energy, health and computing applications requires fundamental understanding of enabling physicochemical mechanisms, including ionic and electronic conductivity, defect formation processes and reaction kinetics. Therefore, access to underlying constants of functional materials via advanced but straightforward experimental techniques is key. We present a novel, cheap and widely applicable approach to analyze oxygen-tracer-diffusion in thin films with unprecedented time resolution based on the novel in situ isotope-exchange Raman spectroscopy (IERS) methodology. Raman spectroscopy is sensitive to changes in the local isotopic composition, manifested by a frequency shift of the oxygen Raman modes. Employing a Raman transparent capping layer allows to establish an in-plane tracer gradient and follow the isotope exchange and diffusion processes via consecutive spatial and time resolved in situ Raman line scans. Mass-transport coefficients are calculated from these isotopic gradients, similar to conventional techniques, but with an additional time-component, not accessible by other techniques. Here, we study gadolinium doped ceria (CGO) thin films, capped with Si3N4 or Al2O3. We report diffusion coefficients within the temperature range of interest for intermediate temperature emerging applications (300-500{\deg}C) and confirm the validity of the measurement procedure and extracted parameters by comparison with FEM simulations and literature results.</description>

      <title>Magnetization dynamics in skyrmions due to high-speed carrier injections from Dirac half-metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in the magnetization dynamics in spin textures, particularly skyrmions, offer promising new directions for magnetic storage technologies and spintronics. Skyrmions, characterized by their topological protection and efficient mobility at low current density, are increasingly recognized for their potential applications in next-generation logic and memory devices. This study investigates the dynamics of skyrmion magnetization, focusing on the manipulation of their topological states as a basis for bitwise data storage through a modified Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation (LLG). We introduce spin-polarized electrons from a topological ferromagnet that induce an electric dipole moment that interacts with the electric gauge field within the skyrmion domain. This interaction creates an effective magnetic field that results in a torque that can dynamically change the topological state of the skyrmion. In particular, we show that these torques can selectively destroy and create skyrmions, effectively writing and erasing bits, highlighting the potential of using controlled electron injection for robust and scalable skyrmion-based data storage solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Beats of a Multiexciton State in Rubrene Single Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe quantum beats in the nanosecond-scale photoluminescence decay of rubrene single crystals after photoexcitation with short laser pulses in a magnetic field of 0.1 to 0.3 T. The relative amplitude of the quantum beats is of the order of 5\%. Their frequency is $1.3$ GHz when the magnetic field is oriented parallel to the two-fold rotation axis of the rubrene molecules and decreases to $0.6$ GHz when the magnetic field is rotated to the crystal's molecular stacking direction. The amplitude of the quantum beats decays alongside the non-oscillatory photoluminescence background, which at low excitation densities has an exponential decay time of $ 4.0 \pm 0.2$~ns. We interpret this as the effective lifetime of a multiexciton state that originates from singlet-fission and can undergo geminate recombination back to the singlet state.</description>

      <title>Importance of hyper-parameter optimization during training of physics-informed deep learning networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating scientific knowledge into deep learning (DL) models for materials-based simulations can constrain the network's predictions to be within the boundaries of the material system. Altering loss functions or adding physics-based regularization (PBR) terms to reflect material properties informs a network about the physical constraints the simulation should obey. The training and tuning process of a DL network greatly affects the quality of the model, but how this process differs when using physics-based loss functions or regularization terms is not commonly discussed. In this manuscript, several PBR methods are implemented to enforce stress equilibrium on a network predicting the stress fields of a high elastic contrast composite. Models with PBR enforced the equilibrium constraint more accurately than a model without PBR, and the stress equilibrium converged more quickly. More importantly it was observed that independently fine-tuning each implementation resulted in more accurate models. More specifically each loss formulation and dataset required different learning rates and loss weights for the best performance. This result has important implications on assessing the relative effectiveness of different DL models and highlights important considerations when making a comparison between DL methods.</description>

      <title>Chemical-motif characterization of short-range order with E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline materials have atomic-scale fluctuations in their chemical composition that modulate various mesoscale properties. Establishing chemistry-microstructure relationships in such materials requires proper characterization of these chemical fluctuations. Yet, current characterization approaches (e.g., Warren-Cowley parameters) make only partial use of the complete chemical and structural information contained in local chemical motifs. Here we introduce a framework based on E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks that is capable of completely identifying chemical motifs in arbitrary crystalline structures with any number of chemical elements. This approach naturally leads to a proper information-theoretic measure for quantifying chemical short-range order (SRO) in chemically complex materials, and a reduced - but complete - representation of the chemical space. Our framework enables the correlation of any per-atom property with their corresponding local chemical motif, thereby offering novel avenues to explore structure-property relationships in chemically-complex materials. Using the MoTaNbTi high-entropy alloy as a test system, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by evaluating the lattice strain associated with each chemical motif, and computing the temperature dependence of chemical-fluctuations length scale.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of experiments in the context of machine-learning inter-atomic potentials: improving the efficiency and transferability of kernel based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven, machine learning (ML) models of atomistic interactions are often based on flexible and non-physical functions that can relate nuanced aspects of atomic arrangements into predictions of energies and forces. As a result, these potentials are as good as the training data (usually results of so-called ab initio simulations) and we need to make sure that we have enough information for a model to become sufficiently accurate, reliable and transferable. The main challenge stems from the fact that descriptors of chemical environments are often sparse high-dimensional objects without a well-defined continuous metric. Therefore, it is rather unlikely that any ad hoc method of choosing training examples will be indiscriminate, and it will be easy to fall into the trap of confirmation bias, where the same narrow and biased sampling is used to generate train- and test- sets. We will demonstrate that classical concepts of statistical planning of experiments and optimal design can help to mitigate such problems at a relatively low computational cost. The key feature of the method we will investigate is that they allow us to assess the informativeness of data (how much we can improve the model by adding/swapping a training example) and verify if the training is feasible with the current set before obtaining any reference energies and forces -- a so-called off-line approach. In other words, we are focusing on an approach that is easy to implement and doesn't require sophisticated frameworks that involve automated access to high-performance computational (HPC).</description>

      <title>Towards the Quantized Anomalous Hall effect in AlO$_x$-capped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum anomalous Hall effect in layered antiferromagnet MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ harbors a rich interplay between magnetism and topology, holding a significant promise for low-power electronic devices and topological antiferromagnetic spintronics. In recent years, MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ has garnered considerable attention as the only known material to exhibit the antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect. However, this field faces significant challenges as realizing quantized transport at zero magnetic fields depends critically on fabricating high-quality device. In this article, we address the detrimental influences of fabrication on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ by simply depositing an AlO$_x$ thin layer on the surface prior to fabrications. Optical contrast and magnetotransport measurements on over 50 samples demonstrate that AlO$_x$ can effectively preserve the pristine state of the samples and significantly enhance the anomalous Hall effect towards quantization. Scaling analysis reveals the Berry curvature dominated mechanism of the anomalous Hall effect at various magnetic configurations. By adjusting the gate voltage, we uncover a gate independent antiferromagnetism in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our experiment not only pave the way for fabricating high-quality transport devices but also advance the exploration of exotic quantum physics in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Selective incorporation of antimony into gallium nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilute concentrations of antimony (Sb) incorporation into GaN induce strong band-gap bowing and tunable room-temperature photoluminescence from the UV to the green spectral regions. However, the atomistic details of the incorporation of Sb into the GaN host remain unclear. In this work, we use first-principles calculations to understand the thermodynamics of Sb substitution into GaN, and its effect on the optical and Raman spectra. Although it is empirically considered that Sb is preferentially incorporated as an anion ($\mathrm{Sb^{3-}}$) into the N sublattice, we demonstrate that Sb can also be incorporated as a cation ($\mathrm{Sb^{3+}}$, $\mathrm{Sb^{5+}}$) into the metal sublattice. Our thermodynamic analysis demonstrates that $\mathrm{Sb_N^0}$, $\mathrm{Sb_{Ga}^{2+}}$, and $\mathrm{Sb_{Ga}^0}$ can co-exist under Ga-rich conditions in n-type samples. We further confirm the dual incorporation of Sb by calculating the vibrational frequencies of different anionic and cation substitutions to explain the origins of experimentally observed additional Raman peaks of Sb-doped GaN. Moreover, the calculated band structures of different Sb substitutions into GaN explain the experimental photoluminescence and optical absorption spectra. Overall, our analysis suggests that the coexistence of $\mathrm{Sb^{3-}}$, $\mathrm{Sb^{3+}}$, and $\mathrm{Sb^{5+}}$ substitutions into GaN explains the totality of experimental measurements. Our results demonstrate that the selective incorporation of Sb into GaN (and potentially other group-V elements such as As, P, or Bi) by tuning the growth conditions can drastically modify the electronic properties, for applications in visible light emitters and photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect Modulated by Spin Flips and Flops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between nontrivial band topology and layered antiferromagnetism in MnBi2Te4 has opened up a new avenue for exploring topological phases of matter. Representative examples include the quantum anomalous Hall effect and axion insulator state observed in odd and even number layers of MnBi2Te4, when the top and bottom surfaces have parallel and antiparallel spin alignments respectively. The rich and complex spin dynamics associated with the van der Waals antiferromagnetic order is expected to generate novel topological phases and phase transitions that are unique to MnBi2Te4. Here we fabricate a device of 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 covered with AlOx capping layer, which enables the investigation of antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect over wide parameter spaces. By tuning the gate voltage and perpendicular magnetic field, we uncover a cascade of quantum phase transitions that can be attributed to the influence of spin configurations on charge transport. Furthermore, we find that an in-plane magnetic field enhances both the coercive field and exchange gap of the surface state, in sharp contrast to that in ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall state. We propose that these peculiar features arise from the spin flip and flop transitions inherent to van der Waals antiferromagnet. The versatile tunability of the quantum anomalous Hall effect in MnBi2Te4 paves the way for potential applications in topological antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Evolution of ferroelectric properties in SmxBi1-xFeO3 via automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy across combinatorial spread libraries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combinatorial spread libraries offer a unique approach to explore evolution of materials properties over the broad concentration, temperature, and growth parameter spaces. However, the traditional limitation of this approach is the requirement for the read-out of functional properties across the library. Here we demonstrate the application of automated Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) for the exploration of the physics in the SmxBi1-xFeO3 system with the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric morphotropic phase boundary. This approach relies on the synergy of the quantitative nature of PFM and the implementation of automated experiments that allows PFM-based gird sampling over macroscopic samples. The concentration dependence of pertinent ferroelectric parameters has been determined and used to develop the mathematical framework based on Ginzburg-Landau theory describing the evolution of these properties across the concentration space. We pose that combination of automated scanning probe microscope and combinatorial spread library approach will emerge as an efficient research paradigm to close the characterization gap in the high-throughput materials discovery. We make the data sets open to the community and hope that will stimulate other efforts to interpret and understand the physics of these systems.</description>

      <title>LATTE: an atomic environment descriptor based on Cartesian tensor contractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new descriptor for local atomic environments, to be used in combination with machine learning models for the construction of interatomic potentials. The Local Atomic Tensors Trainable Expansion (LATTE) allows for the efficient construction of a variable number of many-body terms with learnable parameters, resulting in a descriptor that is efficient, expressive, and can be scaled to suit different accuracy and computational cost requirements. We compare this new descriptor to existing ones on several systems, showing it to be competitive with very fast potentials at one end of the spectrum, and extensible to an accuracy close to the state of the art.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pressure driven Mott-transition in Chromium doped V2O3 films is investigated by direct electrical measurements on polycrystalline films with thicknesses down to 10 nm, and doping concentrations of 2%, 5% and 15%. A change in resistivity of nearly two orders of magnitude is found for 2% doping. A simulation model based on a scaling law description of the phase transition and percolative behavior in a resistor lattice is developed. This is used to show that despite significant deviations in the film structure from single crystals, the transition behavior is very similar. Finally, the influence of the variability between grains on the characteristics of scaled devices is investigated and found to allow for scaling down to at least 50 nm device width.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced long-range charge-density wave order in the optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6}$ superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity in copper oxides (cuprate) remains elusive, with the pseudogap phase considered a potential factor. Recent attention has focused on a long-range symmetry-broken charge-density wave (CDW) order in the underdoped regime, induced by strong magnetic fields. Here by $^{63,65}$Cu-nuclear magnetic resonance, we report the discovery of a long-range CDW order in the optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_6$ superconductor, induced by in-plane strain exceeding $|$$\varepsilon$$|$ = 0.15 %, which deliberately breaks the crystal symmetry of the CuO$_2$ plane. We find that compressive/tensile strains reduce superconductivity but enhance CDW, leaving superconductivity to coexist with CDW. The findings show that a long-range CDW order is an underlying hidden order in the pseudogap state, not limited to the underdoped regime, becoming apparent under strain. Our result sheds light on the intertwining of various orders in the cuprates.</description>

Abstract: Hybridized nuclear and electron spin excitation in a MnCO$_3$ crystal, a weakly-anisotropic antiferromagnet, has been investigated. In this material, the hyperfine interaction is strong enough to form a nuclear spin wave. We measure the microwave absorption by a bulk MnCO$_3$ and observe the dispersion representing strong frequency repulsion between electron and nuclear modes due to their hybridization, the signature of nuclear spin wave. Additionally, we observe that the nuclear spin resonance enters a nonlinear regime above a certain excitation power, attributed to the excitation of finite wavenumber nuclear spin waves.</description>

Abstract: The intense research for efficient low-temperature thermoelectric materials motivates the exploration of innovative compounds and composite systems. This study examines the effects of integrating low-dimensional titanium trisulfide (TiS$_3$) into bulk tin-based halide perovskites (CsSnI$_3$) for use in thermoelectric applications. The addition of small amounts of two-dimensional titanium trisulfide (TiS$_3$) to bulk tin-based halide perovskites (CsSnI$_3$) significantly enhanced the structural stability of the composite material and suppressed oxidation processes. The CsSnI$_3$-TiS$_3$ composites demonstrated stabilization of temperature-dependent electrical properties (conductivity and Seebeck coefficient). This study provides valuable insights into the promising approach of using low-dimensional TiS3 as an additive to stabilize the thermoelectric performance of CsSnI$_3$.</description>

      <title>Imaging Localized Variable Capacitance During Switching Processes in Silicon Diodes by Time-Resolved Electron Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interference Gating or iGate is a unique method for ultrafast time-resolved electron holography in a transmission electron microscope enabling a spatiotemporal resolution in the nm and ns regime with a minimal technological effort. Here, iGate is used for the first image-based investigation of the local dynamics of the projected electric potential in the area of the space charge region of two different general purpose silicon diodes during switching between unbiased and reverse biased condition with a temporal resolution of $25\,\text{ns}$ at a repetition rate of $3\,\text{MHz}$. The obtained results for a focus-ion-beam-prepared ultrafast UG1A rectifier diode, which shows a decreasing capacitance with increasing reverse bias are in good agreement with an electric characterization of the macroscopic device as well as with theoretical expectations. For a severely modified 1N4007 device, however, time-resolved electron holography revealed a MOSCAP-like behavior with a rising capacitance in the area of the space charge region during the switching into reverse biased condition. Remarkably, a different behavior, dominated by the effective capacitance of the electrical setup, can be observed in the vacuum region outside both devices within the same measurements, clearly showing the benefits of localized dynamic potentiometry.</description>

      <title>On the superconducting gap structure of the miassite Rh17S15: Nodal or nodeless?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent penetration depth measurement claimed the observation of unconventional superconductivity in the miassite Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ single crystals, evidenced by the linear-in-temperature penetration depth at low temperatures, thereby arguing for the presence of the lines of node in its superconducting gap structure. Here we measure the thermal conductivity of Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ single crystals down to 110 mK and up to a field of 8 T ($\simeq 0.4H{\rm_{c2}}$). In marked contrast to the penetration depth measurement, we observe a negligible residual linear term $\kappa_0/T$ in zero field, in line with the nodeless gap structure. The field dependence of $\kappa_0(H)/T$ shows a profile that is more consistent with either a highly anisotropic gap structure or multiple nodeless gaps with significantly different magnitudes. Moreover, first-principles calculations give two electronic bands with complex shape of Fermi surfaces. These results suggest multigap nodeless superconductivity in this multiband Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ superconductor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we demonstrate that accurate ground state wave functions may be constructed for polarons in a fully ab initio setting across the wide range of couplings associated with both the large and small polaron limits. We present a single general unitary transformation approach which encompasses an ab initio version of the Lee-Low-Pines theory at weak coupling and the coherent state Landau-Pekar framework at strong coupling while interpolating between these limits in general cases. We show that perturbation theory around these limits may be performed in a facile manner to assess the accuracy of the approach, as well as provide an independent route to the ab initio properties of polarons. We test these ideas on the case of LiF, where the electron-polaron is expected to be large and relatively weakly coupled, while the hole-polaron is expected to be a strongly coupled small polaron.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of electron-phonon coupled systems using neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we use neural quantum states (NQS) to describe the high-dimensional wave functions of electron-phonon coupled systems. We demonstrate that NQS can accurately and systematically learn the underlying physics of such problems through a variational Monte Carlo optimization of the energy with minimal incorporation of physical information even in highly challenging cases. We assess the ability of our approach across various lattice model examples featuring different types of couplings. The flexibility of our NQS formulation is demonstrated via application to ab initio models parametrized by density functional perturbation theory consisting of electron or hole bands coupled linearly to dispersive phonons. We compute accurate real-frequency spectral properties of electron-phonon systems via a novel formalism based on NQS. Our work establishes a general framework for exploring diverse ground state and dynamical phenomena arising in electron-phonon systems, including the non-perturbative interplay of correlated electronic and electron-phonon effects in systems ranging from simple lattice models to realistic models of materials parametrized by ab initio calculations.</description>

Abstract: A recent $J. Am. Chem. Soc.$ Article (DOI: 10.1021/jacs.3c13094) details a pressure-temperature ($P$-$T$) phase diagram for the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO-2222) using synchrotron X-ray diffraction. This study identifies a phase transition from $Amam$ (#63) to $Fmmm$ (#69) within the temperature range of 104 K to 120 K under initial pressure and attributes the $I\rm{4/}$$mmm$ (#139) space group to the structure responsible for the superconductivity of LNO-2222. Herein, we examine the temperature-dependent structural evolution of LNO-2222 single crystals at ambient pressure. Contrary to symmetry increase and the established $Amam$-$Fmmm$ phase boundary, we observe an enhancement in the $Cmcm$ reflections as temperature decreases. This work not only establishes a benchmark method for single crystal structure studies of LNO-2222 using laboratory X-rays, but also enhances the understanding of the complex crystallographic behavior of this system, contributing insights to further experimental and theoretical explorations.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised learning for structure detection in plastically deformed crystals</title>

Abstract: Detecting structures at the particle scale within plastically deformed crystalline materials allows a better understanding of the occurring phenomena. While previous approaches mostly relied on applying hand-chosen criteria on different local parameters, these approaches could only detect already known structures.We introduce an unsupervised learning algorithm to automatically detect structures within a crystal under plastic deformation. This approach is based on a study developed for structural detection on colloidal materials. This algorithm has the advantage of being computationally fast and easy to implement. We show that by using local parameters based on bond-angle distributions, we are able to detect more structures and with a higher degree of precision than traditional hand-made criteria.</description>

      <title>Viscous heat backflow and temperature resonances in extreme thermal conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12777v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that non-diffusive, fluid-like heat transport, such as heat backflowing from cooler to warmer regions, can be induced, controlled, and amplified in extreme thermal conductors such as graphite and hexagonal boron nitride. We employ the viscous heat equations, i.e. the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations in the laminar regime, to show with first-principles quantitative accuracy that a finite thermal viscosity yields steady-state heat vortices, and governs the magnitude of transient temperature waves. Finally, we devise strategies that exploit devices' boundaries and resonance to amplify and control heat hydrodynamics, paving the way for novel experiments and applications in next-generation electronic and phononic technologies.</description>

      <title>Identifying Crystal Structures Beyond Known Prototypes from X-ray Powder Diffraction Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16454v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The large amount of powder diffraction data for which the corresponding crystal structures have not yet been identified suggests the existence of numerous undiscovered, physically relevant crystal structure prototypes. In this paper, we present a scheme to resolve powder diffraction data into crystal structures with precise atomic coordinates by screening the space of all possible atomic arrangements, i.e., structural prototypes, including those not previously observed, using a pre-trained machine learning (ML) model. This involves (i) enumerating all possible symmetry-confined ways in which a given composition can be accommodated in a given spacegroup, (ii) ranking the element-assigned prototype representations using energies predicted using the Wren ML model [Sci.Adv.8, eabn4117 (2022)], (iii) assigning and perturbing atoms along the degree of freedom allowed by the Wyckoff positions to match the experimental diffraction data (iv) validating the thermodynamic stability of the material using density-functional theory (DFT). An advantage of the presented method is that it does not rely on a database of previously observed prototypes and is, therefore capable of finding crystal structures with entirely new symmetric arrangements of atoms. We demonstrate the workflow on unidentified XRD spectra from the ICDD database and identify a number of stable structures, where a majority turns out to be derivable from known prototypes. However, at least two are found not to be part of our prior structural data sets.</description>

      <title>Accelerated intermetallic phase amorphization in a Mg-based high-entropy alloy powder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a novel mechanism for the synthesis of a stable high-entropy alloy powder from an otherwise immiscible Mg-Ti rich metallic mixture by employing high-energy mechanical milling. The presented methodology expedites the synthesis of amorphous alloy powder by strategically injecting entropic disorder through the inclusion of multi-principal elements in the alloy composition. Predictions from first principles and materials theory corroborate the results from microscopic characterizations that reveal a transition of the amorphous phase from a precursor intermetallic structure. This transformation, characterized by the emergence of antisite disorder, lattice expansion, and the presence of nanograin boundaries, signifies a departure from the precursor intermetallic structure. Additionally, this phase transformation is accelerated by the presence of multiple principal elements that induce severe lattice distortion and a higher configurational entropy. The atomic size mismatch of the dissimilar elements present in the alloy produces a stable amorphous phase that resists reverting to an ordered lattice even on annealing.</description>

      <title>Charge-4e and charge-6e flux quantization and higher charge superconductivity in kagome superconductor ring devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.10352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The flux quantization is a key indication of electron pairing in superconductors. For example, the well-known h/2e flux quantization is considered strong evidence for the existence of the charge-2e, two-electron Cooper pairs. Here we report evidence for multi-charge flux quantization in mesoscopic ring devices fabricated using the transition-metal kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. We perform systematic magneto-transport measurements and observe unprecedented quantization of magnetic flux in units of h/4e and h/6e in magnetoresistance oscillations. Specifically, at low temperatures, magnetoresistance oscillations with period h/2e are detected, as expected from the flux quantization for charge-2e superconductivity. We find that the h/2e oscillations are suppressed and replaced by resistance oscillations with h/4e periodicity when temperature is increased. Increasing the temperature further suppresses the h/4e oscillations and robust resistance oscillations with h/6e periodicity emerge as evidence for charge-6e flux quantization. Our observations provide the first experimental evidence for the existence of multi-charge flux quanta and emergent quantum matter exhibiting higher-charge superconductivity in the strongly fluctuating region above the charge-2e Cooper pair condensate, revealing new insights into the intertwined and vestigial electronic order in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Low temperature dynamic polaron liquid in a manganite exhibiting colossal magnetoresistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarons - fermionic charge carriers bearing a strong companion lattice deformation - exhibit a natural tendency for self-localization due to the recursive interaction between electrons and the lattice. While polarons are ubiquitous in insulators, how they evolve in transitions to metallic and superconducting states in quantum materials remains an open question. Here, we use resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) to track the electron-lattice coupling in the colossal magneto-resistive bi-layer manganite La$_{1.2}$Sr$_{1.8}$Mn$_2$O$_7$ across its metal-to-insulator transition. The response in the insulating high-temperature state features harmonic emissions of a dispersionless oxygen phonon at small energy transfer. Upon cooling into the metallic state, we observe a drastic redistribution of spectral weight from the region of these harmonic emissions to a broad high energy continuum. In concert with theoretical calculations, we show that this evolution implies a shift in electron-lattice coupling from static to dynamic lattice distortions that leads to a distinct polaronic ground state in the low temperature metallic phase - a dynamic polaron liquid.</description>

      <title>Annealing-tunable charge density wave in the kagome antiferromagnet FeGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented phenomenon that a charge density wave (CDW) emerges inside the antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase indicates an unusual CDW mechanism associated with magnetism in FeGe. Here, we demonstrate that both the CDW and magnetism of FeGe can be effectively tuned through post-growth annealing treatments. Instead of the short-range CDW reported earlier, a long-range CDW order is realized below 110 K in single crystals annealed at \SI{320}{\degreeCelsius} for over 48 h. The CDW and AFM transition temperatures appear to be inversely correlated with each other. The entrance of the CDW phase significantly reduces the critical field of the spin-flop transition, whereas the CDW transition remains stable against minor variations in magnetic orders such as annealing-induced magnetic clusters and spin-canting transitions. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction measurements reveal substantial disorder on the Ge1 site, which is characterized by displacement of the Ge1 atom from Fe$_3$Ge layer along the $c$ axis and can be reversibly modified by the annealing process. The observed annealing-tunable CDW and magnetic orders can be well understood in terms of disorder on the Ge1 site. Our study provides a vital starting point for the exploration of the unconventional CDW mechanism in FeGe and of kagome materials in general.</description>

      <title>Fragile dislocation modes in obstructed atomic topological phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We here introduce the concept of fragile topological dislocation modes, which are localized only in a fraction of a topological phase, while otherwise leak into the bulk continuum. We show that such dislocation modes are hosted in an obstructed atomic topological phase in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, but only in a finite region with an indirect gap at high energy. These dislocation modes are realized as chiral pairs at finite energies with protection stemming from a combination of the chiral (unitary particle-hole) and the point group (C$_{4v}$) symmetries, but only when the indirect gap is open. In this regime, we corroborate the stability of the defect modes by following their localization and also by explicitly adding a weak chemical potential disorder. Our findings, therefore, should be consequential for the experimental observation of such modes in designer topological crystals and classical metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Multivariable Regression for Material Property Prediction with Bayesian Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02495v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increased use of data-driven approaches and machine learning-based methods in material science, the importance of reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) of the predicted variables for informed decision-making cannot be overstated. UQ in material property prediction poses unique challenges, including the multi-scale and multi-physics nature of advanced materials, intricate interactions between numerous factors, limited availability of large curated datasets for model training, etc. Recently, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for UQ, offering a probabilistic framework for capturing uncertainties within neural networks. In this work, we introduce an approach for UQ within physics-informed BNNs, which integrates knowledge from governing laws in material modeling to guide the models toward physically consistent predictions. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we present case studies for predicting the creep rupture life of steel alloys. Experimental validation with three datasets of collected measurements from creep tests demonstrates the ability of BNNs to produce accurate point and uncertainty estimates that are competitive or exceed the performance of the conventional method of Gaussian Process Regression. Similarly, we evaluated the suitability of BNNs for UQ in an active learning application and reported competitive performance. The most promising framework for creep life prediction is BNNs based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo approximation of the posterior distribution of network parameters, as it provided more reliable results in comparison to BNNs based on variational inference approximation or related NNs with probabilistic outputs.

      <title>Higher-Order Equivariant Neural Networks for Charge Density Prediction in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calculation of electron density distribution using density functional theory (DFT) in materials and molecules is central to the study of their quantum and macro-scale properties, yet accurate and efficient calculation remains a long-standing challenge. We introduce ChargE3Net, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network for predicting electron density in atomic systems. ChargE3Net enables the learning of higher-order equivariant feature to achieve high predictive accuracy and model expressivity. We show that ChargE3Net exceeds the performance of prior work on diverse sets of molecules and materials. When trained on the massive dataset of over 100K materials in the Materials Project database, our model is able to capture the complexity and variability in the data, leading to a significant 26.7% reduction in self-consistent iterations when used to initialize DFT calculations on unseen materials. Furthermore, we show that non-self-consistent DFT calculations using our predicted charge densities yield near-DFT performance on electronic and thermodynamic property prediction at a fraction of the computational cost. Further analysis attributes the greater predictive accuracy to improved modeling of systems with high angular variations. These results illuminate a pathway towards a machine learning-accelerated ab initio calculations for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Mechanism of intermetallic charge transfer and bond disproportionation in BiNiO$_3$ and PbNiO$_3$ revealed by hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perovskites with Bi or Pb on the A-site host a number of interesting and yet to be understood phenomena such as negative thermal expansion in BiNiO$_3$. We employ hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy of Ni 2$p$ core-level as well as valence band to probe the electronic structure of BiNiO$_3$ and PbNiO$_3$. The experimental results supported by theoretical calculations using dynamical mean-field theory reveal essentially identical electronic structure of the Ni-O subsystem typical of Ni$^{2+}$ charge-transfer insulators. The two materials are distinguished by filling of the Bi(Pb)-O antibonding states in the vicinity of the Fermi level, which is responsible for the Bi disproportionation in BiNiO$_3$ at ambient pressure and absence of similar behavior in PbNiO$_3$. The present experiments provide evidence for this conclusion by revealing the presence/absence of Bi/Pb $6s$ states at the top of the valence band in the two materials.</description>
