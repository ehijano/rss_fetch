      <title>First integrals of some two-dimensional integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss some results on integrable Hamiltonian systems with two coordinate variables. We revisit the much-studied problem of the two-dimensional harmonic oscillator and discuss its (super)integrability in the light of a canonical transformation which can map the anisotropic oscillator to a corresponding isotropic one. Following this, we discuss the computation of first integrals for integrable two-dimensional systems using the framework of the Jacobi last multiplier. Using the latter, we describe some novel physical examples, namely, the classical Landau problem with a scalar-potential-induced hyperbolic mode, the two-dimensional Kepler problem, and a problem involving a linear curl force.</description>

      <title>Bi-stable thin soft robot for in-plane locomotion in narrow space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs), also recognized as artificial muscle, have been widely developed for the soft locomotion robot. With the complaint skeleton and miniaturized dimension, they are well suited for the narrow space inspection. In this work, we propose a novel low profile (1.1mm) and lightweight (1.8g) bi-stable in-plane DEA (Bi-DEA) constructed by supporting a dielectric elastomer onto a flat bi-stable mechanism. It has an amplified displacement and output force compared with the in-plane DEA (I-DEA) without the bi-stable mechanism. Then, the Bi-DEA is applied to a thin soft robot, using three electrostatic adhesive pads (EA-Pads) as anchoring elements. This robot is capable of crawling and climbing to access millimetre-scale narrow gaps. A theoretical model of the bi-stable mechanism and the DEA are presented. The enhanced performance of the Bi-DEA induced by the mechanism is experimentally validated. EA-Pad provides the adhesion between the actuator and the locomotion substrate, allowing crawling and climbing on various surfaces, i.e., paper and acrylic. The thin soft robot has been demonstrated to be capable of crawling through a 4mm narrow gap with a speed up to 3.3mm/s (0.07 body length per second and 2.78 body thickness per second).</description>

      <title>Dynamics: A different outlook</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present article deals with general mechanics in an unconventional manner. At first, Newtonian mechanics for a point particle has been described in vectorial picture, considering Cartesian, polar and tangent-normal formulations in a unified manner. An extensive differential geometric notions have been used when motion on curved surfaces has been considered. Both the Lagrangian and the Hamiltonian formulations have been discussed with various examples. The relevant part of the calculus of variation has been presented in the appendix. Also, a detailed study about the nature of the Lagrangian has been shown in the appendix and it has been found that the usual Lagrangian can be extended to curved space-time using the notion of differential geometry. The article may be suitable both for undergraduate and postgraduate students.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of the reverberation theory in a diffuse sound field by using reflection orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11670v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Room acoustics is mainly based on the reverberation theories of Saine and Eyring. In Sabine's theory however, the reverberation time does not reach zero, even if the condition of absolute absorption is fulfilled. Eyring revised reverberation theory to resolve this contradiction. However, Eyring's theory has an inconsistency between the formulations of the steady-state and decay processes. Therefore, the author revised Sabine's theory, taking a different approach from that of Eyring. This revised theory was constructed by introducing the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound." In this study, a new mathematical model of reverberation using reflection orders is proposed. This is a reconstruction of the author's revised theory. The new model includes the temporal energy distribution in each reflection order and uses the concept of "reverberation of a direct sound" for the entire reverberation process. It shows that the concept is also essential for the reflected sounds. In addition, the reverberation decay agrees with the revised theory previously proposed by the author. Overall, the new model showed good agreement with the simulation results.</description>

      <title>Generalized Minkowski spacetime with geometric algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5195</link>
      <description>arXiv:1205.5195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We begin from the generalised eight-dimensional Minkowski spacetime structure, previously developed in Clifford geometric algebra $ C\ell(\Re^3) $. We propose that this is the correct algebraic representation for physical three-dimensional space. We find that this representation incorporates spin and helicity directly into spacetime, in a Lorentz invariant manner. From this foundation, based on purely algebraic arguments, we derive Minkowski spacetime, the properties of electromagnetic radiation and Maxwell's equations. These results being achieved all without physical arguments, showing that these physical laws are actually purely geometric effects. This approach also leads to a generalization of complex mass and proper time. Several insight about time are produced, including an arrow of time, which ultimately becomes a five-dimensional property. We also provide a new argument explaining the non-existence of magnetic monopoles. We suggest that the rotational freedoms, inherent in three-dimensional physical space are an important aspect of nature, not properly addressed in physics, as they are not incorporated within the spacetime background, as achieved in this paper.</description>

      <title>A geometric effect of quantum particles originated from the classicality of their flow velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11624v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper, we propose a new quantum effect that naturally emerges from describing the quantum particle as a classical fluid. Following the hydrodynamical formulation of quantum mechanics for a particle in a finite convex region, we show how the maximum values of the wavefunction's amplitude lie along the boundaries of the region when imposing a vanished quantum potential, implying\ a classical flow velocity of the particle. The effect is obtained for the case of particles in curved space, described by Riemannian structures. We further show that such an effect\ cannot be achieved in the relativistic regime when dealing with quantum particles in flat or curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Deep noise squeezing in parametrically driven resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate white noise squeezing in the frequency domain of classical parametrically-driven resonators with added noise. We use Green's functions to analyse the response of the resonator to added noise. In one approach, we obtain the Green's function approximately using the first-order averaging method, while in the second approach, exactly, using Floquet theory. We characterize the noise squeezing by calculating the statistical properties of the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of the resonator response to added noise. In the noise spectral density, we observe that the squeezing effects occur only at half the parametric pump frequency. Due to correlation, the squeezing limit of $-6$~dB can be reached even with detuning at the instability threshold in a single parametrically-driven resonator. We also applied our techniques to investigate squeezing in a system consisting a parametric resonator linearly coupled to a harmonic resonator. In this system, we obtained deep squeezing at around $-40$~dB in one of the quadratures of the harmonic oscillator response. Finally, we also showed that our analysis of squeezing based on Floquet theory can be applied to multiple coupled resonators with parametric modulation and multiple noise inputs.</description>
