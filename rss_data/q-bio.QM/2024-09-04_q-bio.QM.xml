      <title>Uncertainty Quantification Using Ensemble Learning and Monte Carlo Sampling for Performance Prediction and Monitoring in Cell Culture Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biopharmaceutical products, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have gained prominence in the pharmaceutical market due to their high specificity and efficacy. As these products are projected to constitute a substantial portion of global pharmaceutical sales, the application of machine learning models in mAb development and manufacturing is gaining momentum. This paper addresses the critical need for uncertainty quantification in machine learning predictions, particularly in scenarios with limited training data. Leveraging ensemble learning and Monte Carlo simulations, our proposed method generates additional input samples to enhance the robustness of the model in small training datasets. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach through two case studies: predicting antibody concentrations in advance and real-time monitoring of glucose concentrations during bioreactor runs using Raman spectra data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating the uncertainty levels associated with process performance predictions and facilitating real-time decision-making in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. This contribution not only introduces a novel approach for uncertainty quantification but also provides insights into overcoming challenges posed by small training datasets in bioprocess development. The evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in addressing key challenges related to uncertainty estimation within upstream cell cultivation, illustrating its potential impact on enhancing process control and product quality in the dynamic field of biopharmaceuticals.</description>

      <title>Approximating mutual information of high-dimensional variables using learned representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutual information (MI) is a general measure of statistical dependence with widespread application across the sciences. However, estimating MI between multi-dimensional variables is challenging because the number of samples necessary to converge to an accurate estimate scales unfavorably with dimensionality. In practice, existing techniques can reliably estimate MI in up to tens of dimensions, but fail in higher dimensions, where sufficient sample sizes are infeasible. Here, we explore the idea that underlying low-dimensional structure in high-dimensional data can be exploited to faithfully approximate MI in high-dimensional settings with realistic sample sizes. We develop a method that we call latent MI (LMI) approximation, which applies a nonparametric MI estimator to low-dimensional representations learned by a simple, theoretically-motivated model architecture. Using several benchmarks, we show that unlike existing techniques, LMI can approximate MI well for variables with $&gt; 10^3$ dimensions if their dependence structure has low intrinsic dimensionality. Finally, we showcase LMI on two open problems in biology. First, we approximate MI between protein language model (pLM) representations of interacting proteins, and find that pLMs encode non-trivial information about protein-protein interactions. Second, we quantify cell fate information contained in single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) measurements of hematopoietic stem cells, and find a sharp transition during neutrophil differentiation when fate information captured by scRNA-seq increases dramatically.</description>

      <title>Conformal Prediction in Dynamic Biological Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is the process of systematically determining and characterizing the degree of confidence in computational model predictions. In the context of systems biology, especially with dynamic models, UQ is crucial because it addresses the challenges posed by nonlinearity and parameter sensitivity, allowing us to properly understand and extrapolate the behavior of complex biological systems. Here, we focus on dynamic models represented by deterministic nonlinear ordinary differential equations. Many current UQ approaches in this field rely on Bayesian statistical methods. While powerful, these methods often require strong prior specifications and make parametric assumptions that may not always hold in biological systems. Additionally, these methods face challenges in domains where sample sizes are limited, and statistical inference becomes constrained, with computational speed being a bottleneck in large models of biological systems. As an alternative, we propose the use of conformal inference methods, introducing two novel algorithms that, in some instances, offer non-asymptotic guarantees, enhancing robustness and scalability across various applications. We demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithms through several scenarios, highlighting their advantages over traditional Bayesian approaches. The proposed methods show promising results for diverse biological data structures and scenarios, offering a general framework to quantify uncertainty for dynamic models of biological systems.The software for the methodology and the reproduction of the results is available at https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13644870.</description>

      <title>Relationship between Decimal Hill Coefficient, Intermediate Processes and Mesoscopic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hill function is relevant for describing enzyme binding and other processes in gene regulatory networks. Despite its theoretical foundation, it is often empirically used as a useful fitting function. Theoretical predictions suggest that the Hill coefficient should be an integer. However, it is often assigned a decimal value. The deterministic approximation of binding processes leads to the derivation of the Hill function, which can be expanded around the fluctuation magnitude to derive mesoscopic corrections. This study establishes the relationships between intermediate processes and the decimal Hill coefficient through a direct relationship between the dissociation constants, both with and without fluctuations. This outcome contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying processes associated with the decimal Hill coefficient while also enabling the prediction of an effective value of the Hill coefficient from the underlying mechanism. This procedure allows us to have a simplified effective description of complex systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring tau protein and amyloid-beta propagation: a sensitivity analysis of mathematical models based on biological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is the most common dementia worldwide. Its pathological development is well known to be connected with the accumulation of two toxic proteins: tau protein and amyloid-$\beta$. Mathematical models and numerical simulations can predict the spreading patterns of misfolded proteins in this context. However, the calibration of the model parameters plays a crucial role in the final solution. In this work, we perform a sensitivity analysis of heterodimer and Fisher-Kolmogorov models to evaluate the impact of the equilibrium values of protein concentration on the solution patterns. We adopt advanced numerical methods such as the IMEX-DG method to accurately describe the propagating fronts in the propagation phenomena in a polygonal mesh of sagittal patient-specific brain geometry derived from magnetic resonance images. We calibrate the model parameters using biological measurements in the brain cortex for the tau protein and the amyloid-$\beta$ in Alzheimer's patients and controls. Finally, using the sensitivity analysis results, we discuss the applicability of both models in the correct simulation of the spreading of the two proteins.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Bidirectional Transformer Decision Threshold Adjustment Algorithm for Class-Imbalanced Molecular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data sets with imbalanced class sizes, where one class size is much smaller than that of others, occur exceedingly often in many applications, including those with biological foundations, such as disease diagnosis and drug discovery. Therefore, it is extremely important to be able to identify data elements of classes of various sizes, as a failure to do so can result in heavy costs. Nonetheless, many data classification procedures do not perform well on imbalanced data sets as they often fail to detect elements belonging to underrepresented classes. In this work, we propose the BTDT-MBO algorithm, incorporating Merriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) approaches and a bidirectional transformer, as well as distance correlation and decision threshold adjustments, for data classification tasks on highly imbalanced molecular data sets, where the sizes of the classes vary greatly. The proposed technique not only integrates adjustments in the classification threshold for the MBO algorithm in order to help deal with the class imbalance, but also uses a bidirectional transformer procedure based on an attention mechanism for self-supervised learning. In addition, the model implements distance correlation as a weight function for the similarity graph-based framework on which the adjusted MBO algorithm operates. The proposed method is validated using six molecular data sets and compared to other related techniques. The computational experiments show that the proposed technique is superior to competing approaches even in the case of a high class imbalance ratio.</description>
