      <title>Exact $q$-exponential Multi-Mode Solutions with Independent Centres and Power-Law Relaxation in the Plastino-Plastino Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first exact, multi-mode solutions to the Plastino-Plastino nonlinear diffusion equation with arbitrary power-law drift. By allowing each $q$-exponential mode to have its own independent, time-dependent centre, all inter-mode couplings in the drift term vanish, yielding fully separable evolution equations for centre motion, probability content, and (for the attractor mode) width. Transient modes exhibit constant width and decay via exact q-exponential (power-law) relaxation, while a single attractor mode irreversibly absorbs the entire probability flux, with fixed amplitude and time-growing width, driving the system to the known stationary q-exponential state from arbitrary initial conditions. The hierarchy closes exactly without approximation. These analytic solutions unify Tsallis nonextensive thermodynamics, fractal-space diffusion, and multi-scale relaxation dynamics, with direct applications to heavy-quark jets in quark-gluon plasma, L\'evy flights in fractal media, and urban population redistribution. All previous exact results are recovered as special cases.</description>

      <title>The Transformation of Broadband Demand: From Discretionary Service to Essential Infrastructure (2010-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Has broadband become a necessity good immune to price changes? Using a 15-year panel of 33 European countries (2010--2024) and two-way fixed effects with Driscoll--Kraay standard errors, we document a fundamental transformation in broadband demand. Pre-COVID, Eastern Partnership countries exhibited highly elastic demand ($\varepsilon = -0.61$, p$&lt;$0.001) -- a 10\% price reduction increased subscriptions by 6\% -- while EU countries showed moderate elasticity ($\varepsilon = -0.12$, p$&lt;$0.05). By 2020--2024, both regions converged to near-zero elasticity, with price changes having no detectable effect on adoption. Crucially, placebo tests reveal this transformation began in 2015, not 2020, indicating a decade-long digital integration process rather than a COVID-19 shock. We further demonstrate that price measurement critically affects inference: income-relative prices (as \% of GNI) yield significant results in 100\% of specifications, compared to only 25\% for PPP-adjusted prices. These findings have immediate policy relevance: as broadband transitions from discretionary service to essential utility, policy emphasis must shift from affordability subsidies to universal infrastructure deployment.</description>

      <title>The Wiener Path Integral Interpretation of the 3:1 Combat Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wiener path integral framework is proposed to model military combat dynamics by incorporating the neglected stochastic effects to the Lanchester's square law. This framework is applied to evaluate the empirical 3:1 combat rule, which posits that an attacker requires a threefold force superiority to achieve victory. Specifically, the attacker's winning probability is computed utilizing a semi-analytical Rayleigh-Ritz method. Numerical results demonstrate that the validity of the rule critically depends on specific parameter regimes, primarily contingent upon the relative combat effectiveness ratio between the opposing forces and the tolerance for attrition. This work establishes a physics-informed theoretical bridge between statistical mechanics and military operations research for analyzing uncertain combat systems.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites promotes cooperation in phenotypically diverse populations with tag-mediated interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Habitat loss and fragmentation have often been viewed as major threats to species interaction and global biodiversity conservation. However, habitat degradation can also give rise to positive ecological and behavioral responses, challenging the notion that its consequences are entirely detrimental. While controlling for the degree of total habitat loss, we studied the influence of habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity on the evolution of tag-based cooperation in structured populations with multiple strategies. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model with empty sites in which phenotypically diverse artificial decision makers engaged into pairwise Snowdrift-game interactions and imitated strategies of their opponent co-players. We systematically varied the number of phenotypic features in the population, the clustering degree of empty sites unsuitable for habitation, as well as the cost-to-benefit ratio $r$, and we measured the resulting equilibrium densities of conditional and unconditional strategies. Our Monte Carlo simulations revealed a complex interplay between the three investigated factors, such that higher phenotypic diversity in combination with lower $r$ and low to intermediate clustering degrees of empty sites markedly suppressed ethnocentric cooperation but simultaneously boosted unconditional, pure altruism. This dominance of unconditional cooperation was remarkably robust to variation in the initial conditions, suggesting that heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites in moderately degraded habitats can function as a potent cooperation-promoting mechanism even in the presence of initially more favorable strategies. Our study showcases anti-fragility of cooperators in spatially fragmented but phenotypically diverse populations, as they were also able to benefit from harsh environmental conditions emerging in sparsely connected habitat remnants.</description>

      <title>Classifying Urban Regions by Aggregated Pollutant Weather Correlation Strength: A Spatiotemporal Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding pollutant meteorology interactions is essential for environmental risk assessment. This study develops an entropy-based statistical framework to analyze static and temporal dependencies between urban air pollutants and meteorological variables across multiple Indian cities. Dependence is quantified using complementary linear and nonlinear measures, including Pearson correlation, mutual information, and relative conditional entropy. A key methodological contribution is a PCA based composite indexing framework that integrates these heterogeneous metrics into a unified and interpretable correlation score. For each pollutant meteorological pair within a city, PCA is used to extract a joint variability index, while spatial variability is assessed by aggregating correlations across cities. These indices are further combined to derive a comprehensive city-level correlation score that represents overall pollutant meteorology coupling strength and enables classification of cities into distinct interaction regimes. Sensitivity analysis, performed by systematically excluding individual variable pairs, demonstrates the robustness of the framework, with no single pair exerting disproportionate influence. Temporal dependencies are examined using transfer entropy and time-delayed mutual information. Results indicate that relative humidity generally leads changes in pollutant concentrations, whereas ambient temperature tends to lag, highlighting contrasting causal influences. Mutual information peaks at zero lag and decays rapidly, indicating strong short term interactions with limited persistence. Overall, the proposed framework provides a unified and interpretable approach for assessing complex pollutant meteorology interactions across diverse locations and time.</description>

      <title>Annealing approximation in master-node network model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates absorbing-state phase transitions in opinion dynamics through a master-node network model analyzed using annealing approximation. We develop a theoretical framework examining three fundamental regimes: systems converging to complete disagreement, complete consensus, or both states depending on initial conditions. The phase behavior is governed by two key chiral parameters: $R$ measuring right-oriented influence and $L$ measuring left-oriented influence in the network interactions. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring both continuous and discontinuous transitions between disordered and ordered phases. The discontinuous transition emerges in systems with two absorbing states, where the final configuration depends critically on initial opinion distributions. The annealing approximation provides fundamental insights into how asymmetric social influences (chirality) shape collective opinion formation, acting as a symmetry-breaking element that drives the system toward polarization or consensus.</description>
