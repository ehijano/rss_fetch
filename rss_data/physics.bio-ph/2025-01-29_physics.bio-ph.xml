      <title>Bridging spatial and temporal scales of developmental gene regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of multicellular organisms relies on the precise coordination of molecular events across multiple spatial and temporal scales. Understanding how information flows from molecular interactions to cellular processes and tissue organization during development is crucial for explaining the remarkable reproducibility of complex organisms. This review explores how chromatin-encoded information is transduced from localized transcriptional events to global gene expression patterns, highlighting the challenge of bridging these scales. We discuss recent experimental findings and theoretical frameworks, emphasizing polymer physics as a tool for describing the relationship between chromatin structure and dynamics across scales. By integrating these perspectives, we aim to clarify how gene regulation is coordinated across levels of biological organization and suggest strategies for future experimental approaches.</description>

      <title>Active chiral rotors: hydrodynamics and chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An active chiral rotor is a spherical object that can generate chiral flows in a fluid by rotating about an axis. For example, if the flow around the upper hemisphere of the chiral rotor is in a clockwise direction, then the flow in the lower hemisphere is in the anti-clockwise direction, and vice versa. In this paper, we aim to study the combined behaviour of hydrodynamically interacting chiral rotors in the presence of an external chemical gradient. While a single isolated rotor is stationary in a fluid, a pair of rotors can move in linear or circular paths as they hydrodynamically interact with each other. It is observed that the emergent linear or circular trajectories depend on the type of rotors and the orientation of their rotation axes. The dynamics of the rotors are altered in a more complex environment, such as in an external chemical field. Interestingly, we observe two types of motion: chemotaxis and anti-chemotaxis. While in the anti-chemotaxis case, both rotors are driving away from the target, in the chemotaxis case, one of the rotors successfully reaches the chemical target. This study helps to understand the collective behavior of self-propelled microorganisms and artificial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Q-learning with temporal memory to navigate turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of olfactory searches in a turbulent environment. We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor. We ask whether navigation to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent odors. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.</description>
