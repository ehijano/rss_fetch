      <title>A topos for extended Weihrauch degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weihrauch reducibility is a notion of reducibility between computational problems that is useful to calibrate the uniform computational strength of a multivalued function. It complements the analysis of mathematical theorems done in reverse mathematics, as multi-valued functions on represented spaces can be considered as realizers of theorems in a natural way. Despite the rich literature and the relevance of the applications of category theory in logic and realizability, actually there are just a few works starting to study the Weihrauch reducibility from a categorical point of view. The main purpose of this work is to provide a full categorical account to the notion of extended Weihrauch reducibility introduced by A. Bauer, which generalizes the original notion of Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we present a tripos and a topos for extended Weihrauch degrees. We start by defining a new tripos, abstracting the notion of extended Weihrauch degrees, and then we apply the tripos-to-topos construction to obtain the desired topos. Then we show that the Kleene-Vesley topos is a topos of $j$-sheaves for a certain Lawvere-Tierney topology over the topos of extended Weihrauch degrees.</description>

      <title>Morphisms and comorphisms of sites I -- Double categories of sites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We arrange morphisms and comorphisms of sites as the horizontal and vertical cells of a double category of sites; using the formalism of extensions and restrictions of presheaves, we explains how one can define a sheafification double functor from this double category to the quintet double category of Grothendieck topoi. We describe properties of this double functor and recover some classical results of topos theory through a new notion of locally exact square, generalizing exact squares in the presence of topologies. We also describe a 2-comonad on $\Cat$ for which lax morphisms of coalgebras are morphisms of sites and colax morphisms are comorphisms of sites, explaining the arrangement as a double category.</description>

      <title>Homotopical Dold-Kan Correspondences</title>

Abstract: This work originates from chapters V and VII of Grothendieck's manuscript Pursuing Stacks, which contains a series of questions, as well as a previously unexplored formalism, concerning the interactions between the notion of test categories and homology. The main objective of this thesis is to exhibit homotopical Dold-Kan correspondences in the context of test categories. More precisely, we introduce, following Grothendieck, a functor generalizing simplicial homology, from the category of abelian presheaves over any small category to the derived category of abelian groups in non-negative homological degree. We then look for conditions ensuring that this functor induces an equivalence of categories, after localization by the class of morphisms whose image in the derived category is an isomorphism. Generally, there exists a second class of weak equivalences, arising from the theory of test categories, on the category of abelian presheaves, and we call Whitehead Categories those small categories for which these two classes coincide, generalizing the case of $\Delta$. We show that important examples of test categories are Whitehead categories, notably Joyal's category $\Theta$. We construct, for any Whitehead local test category, a model category structure on its category of abelian presheaves with the weak equivalences mentioned above. We then prove that for any Whitehead test category, the homology functor does induce an equivalence between the localized categories. We obtain this way many examples of homotopical Dold-Kan correspondences, including, among others, the category $\Theta$.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <title>Hopf braces and semi-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hopf braces have been introduced as a Hopf-theoretic generalization of skew braces. Under the assumption of cocommutativity, these algebraic structures are equivalent to matched pairs of actions on Hopf algebras, that can be used to produce solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We prove that the category of cocommutative Hopf braces is semi-abelian and strongly protomodular. In particular, this implies that the main homological lemmas known for groups, Lie algebras and other classical algebraic structures also hold for cocommutative Hopf braces. Abelian objects are commutative and cocommutative Hopf algebras, that form an abelian Birkhoff subcategory of the category of cocommutative Hopf braces. Moreover, we show that the full subcategories of "primitive Hopf braces" and of "skew braces" form an hereditary torsion theory in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces, and that "skew braces" are also a Birkhoff subcategory and a localization of the latter category. Finally, we describe central extensions and commutators for cocommutative Hopf braces.</description>

      <title>Cyclic polytopes, orientals, and correspondences: some aspects of higher Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of higher Segal spaces at the interface of cyclic polytopes, orientals, and higher correspondences. Along the way we review examples from algebraic K-theory, show how cyclic polytopes provide a geometric model for the definition of orientals, and establish a characterization of higher Segal spaces as lax monadic structures in higher correspondence categories.</description>
