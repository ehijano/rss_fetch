      <title>Non-Singular Bouncing cosmology from Phantom Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet Coupling: Reconstruction with Observational Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine non-singular bounce cosmology within the framework of a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet term in both non-viscous and bulk-viscous cases. Using the scale factor ansatz $\alpha(t)=\left(\frac{\alpha}{\eta}+t^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2 \eta}}$, we reconstruct the scalar field potential $V(t)$, and observe a smooth potential well centered at the bounce point. The resulting energy density, pressure, and equation-of-state parameter show NEC violation necessary for successful bounce, while viscosity controls post-bounce dynamics with a positive and smooth squared speed of sound. In contrast, for the non-viscous model, sharp divergences occur just at the bounce and continues to be negative in the expanding phase, which in turn emphasises the stabilising role of dissipative effects. The energy condition analysis indicates a temporary NEC and SEC violation in the viscous scenario, whereas its persistent violation within the non-viscous model suggests a continuous accelerated expansion. Observational viability is found through Bayesian MCMC fitting in regards to the Pantheon+ supernova data, with best-fit parameters providing a reduced chi-squared of $\chi_{red}^2 =0.995$ while the inflation observables derived from the reconstructed potential place our model predictions inside $68\%$ CL Planck 2018 confidence contours. Our findings suggest that bounce cosmologies could offer a physically reasonable and observationally acceptable alternative or pre-inflationary scenario, while highlighting the role that viscosity could play for a stable and smooth cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic inference in very large universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Abridged] Some cosmological theories propose that the observable universe is a small part of a much larger universe in which parameters describing the low-energy laws of physics vary from region to region. How can we reasonably assess a theory that describes such a mostly unobservable universe? We propose a Bayesian method based on theory-generated probability distributions for our observations. We focus on basic principles, leaving aside concerns about practicality. (We also leave aside the measure problem, to discuss other issues.) We argue that cosmological theories can be tested by standard Bayesian updating, but we need to use theoretical predictions for "first-person" probabilities -- i.e., probabilities for our observations, accounting for all relevant selection effects. These selection effects can depend on the observer, and on time, so in principle first-person probabilities are defined for each observer-instant -- an observer at an instant of time. First-person probabilities should take into account everything the observer believes about herself and her surroundings -- i.e., her "subjective state". We advocate a "Principle of Self-Locating Indifference" (PSLI), asserting that any real observer should make predictions as if she were chosen randomly from the theoretically predicted observer-instants that share her subjective state. We believe the PSLI is intuitively very reasonable, but also argue that it maximizes the expected fraction of observers who will make correct predictions. Cosmological theories will in general predict a set of possible universes, each with a probability. To calculate first-person probabilities, we argue that each possible universe should be weighted by the number of observer-instants in the specified subjective state that it contains. We also discuss Boltzmann brains, the humans/Jovians parable of Hartle and Srednicki, and the use of "old evidence".</description>

      <title>Degeneracies and modelling choices in double-plane time-delay cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-plane gravitational lensing is a rare but increasingly observed phenomenon in which the light from a distant source is lensed by two foreground objects at different redshifts. Such systems can be used to provide simultaneous constraints on the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the dark-energy equation of state, independent of and complementary to other probes. However, just as for single-plane gravitational lenses, the precision of these constraints is limited by the so-called mass-sheet degeneracy (MSD) -- a fundamental limit to the knowledge of the mass profiles of lens galaxies and the line of sight that can be obtained from imaging constraints alone. In this work, we show explicitly how contributions from the line of sight appear in double-plane systems. Because these contributions modify angular diameter distances, we argue that cosmological priors should not be used to simply fix the ``cosmological scaling factor'', a ratio of angular diameter distances which is key to the modelling of double-plane lenses. Motivated by this fact, we generalise the double-plane MSD to account for this uncertainty in the scaling factor. While this complicates the time-delay function, we show that, using the ``unfolding relation'', a geometric relation between distances which holds even in the presence of line-of-sight corrections, the uncertainty in the Hubble constant reduces to the familiar mass-sheet transformation of the first lens plane, and a line-of-sight contribution between the observer and the second lens plane. Our main message is therefore a prescription for reducing the degrees of freedom within double-plane models, while still safely accounting for the MSD in measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Probing beyond the Standard Model with gravitational waves from phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review article is based on a seminar presented at the Higgs pairs workshop 2025. Stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds can serve as probe of the diverse phenomenology encountered in beyond-Standard-Model scenarios featuring phase transitions in the early Universe. Focussing on gravitational wave production from first-order phase transitions, we present the main results of a recent analysis by the LISA Cosmology Working Group concerning the detectability of such signals with LISA. Strong degeneracies, both among the parameters controlling the phase transition and between these and the parameters of the beyond-Standard-Model scenario underlying the phase transition, complicate the reconstruction of the model from a potential signal. Nonetheless, once a specific scenario is assumed, LISA observations can supply constraints possibly complementary to those obtainable from present and future particle colliders.</description>

      <title>Line-Intensity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line-Intensity Mapping (LIM) has emerged as a powerful technique for studying large-scale structure and the high-redshift universe, enabling three-dimensional maps of line emission across vast cosmological volumes. In this review, we summarize the LIM framework, its key scientific goals, and its future prospects. We describe the landscape of emission line tracers, theoretical modeling approaches, anticipated signals, and data-analysis methodologies. We also discuss experimental challenges, particularly those posed by astrophysical foregrounds, and review possible mitigation strategies. Further, we highlight a range of cross-correlation science cases, linking LIM with other cosmological surveys. Finally, we summarize current and upcoming experiments and early results, including recent first detections, while outlining the outlook for future discoveries. Specifically, LIM may offer new insights into galaxy formation and evolution and cosmology, while revealing the Epoch of Reionization, Cosmic Dawn, and possibly the Cosmic Dark Ages. LIM enables cosmological measurements that complement other probes and provide unique access to the high-redshift universe, potentially shedding light on dark matter, dark energy, and cosmic inflation.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a 3.0$\sigma$ Deviation in Gravitational Light Deflection from General Relativity at Cosmological Scales with KiDS-Legacy and CMB Lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) faces challenges from cosmic acceleration and observational tensions, necessitating stringent tests at cosmological scales. In this work, we probe GR deviations via a $\mu$-$\Sigma$ modified gravity parameterization, integrating KiDS-Legacy weak lensing (1347 deg$^2$, $z\leq 2.0$), joint CMB data (Planck/ACT/SPT), DESI DR2 BAO, and DES-Dovekie supernovae. KiDS-Legacy significantly improves constraint precision: $\mu_0$ (matter clustering) by $\sim 43\%$ and $\Sigma_0$ (gravitational light deflection) by $\sim 60\%$ relative to CMB alone. In the $\Lambda$CDM background, $\mu_0 = 0.21\pm 0.21$ is consistent with GR, while $\Sigma_0 = 0.149\pm 0.051$ deviates from GR at the 3.0$\sigma$ level -- attributed to large-scale CMB lensing from ACT/SPT. This precise separation of GR-consistent matter clustering and deviant light deflection provides key observational clues for new physics or data systematics. Our work underscores the critical role of synergizing high-precision CMB and WL data in advancing GR tests.</description>

      <title>Seeing Wiggles without Seeing Wiggles: BAO Recovery in 21 cm Intensity Mapping with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 21 cm intensity mapping provides a promising probe of the large-scale structure. Astrophysical foregrounds, as the main source of contamination to the cosmological 21 cm signal, persist in a wedge-like region of Fourier space due to the inherent chromaticity in radio interferometric observations. The foreground avoidance strategy focuses on utilizing data from relatively clean regions with minimal foreground leakage, at the cost of losing large-scale information. Non-linear structure formation, however, couples Fourier modes across scales, leaving imprints of the missing large-scale modes in the remaining data. In this work, we employ a deep learning approach to test whether large-scale features of the 21 cm brightness temperature fields, particularly the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO), can be recovered at the field level using only short-wavelength modes that are beyond the linear scales. To explicitly assess the dependence on the training cosmology, we train the network exclusively on de-wiggled simulations, providing a controlled test of whether the reconstruction arises from physical non-linear mode coupling rather than implicit encoding of BAO features. In the ideal noise-free case, the amplitude and phase of the lost modes can be restored with high fidelity. With instrumental noise included, the reconstructed amplitude becomes biased, while the phase information remains robust. The trained network also exhibits reasonable robustness to variations in the underlying cosmological model. Together, these results suggest that mode restoration offers a complementary approach for extracting cosmological information from future 21 cm intensity mapping analyses.</description>

      <title>Emulating galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering on non-linear scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the potential of cross-correlating galaxies and peculiar velocities on non-linear scales to enhance cosmological constraints. Leveraging the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and the halo occupation distribution (HOD) formalism, we train emulator models to describe the non-linear clustering of galaxies and velocities in redshift space. Our analysis demonstrates that combining galaxy and peculiar velocity clustering, provides tighter constraints on both HOD and cosmological parameters, particularly on $\sigma_8$ and $w_0$. We further apply our models to realistic mock catalogues, reproducing the expected density and peculiar velocity errors of type-Ia supernovae and Tully-Fisher/fundamental plane measurements for the combined ZTF and DESI measurements. While systematic biases arise in the HOD parameters, the cosmological constraints remain unbiased, yielding $3.8\%$ precision measurement on $f\sigma_8$ compared to $4.7\%$ using galaxy clustering alone. We demonstrate that, while combining tracers with realistic velocity measurements still yields improvement, the gains are diminished, highlighting the need for further efforts to reduce velocity measurement uncertainties and correct observational systematics on small scales.</description>

      <title>Surface Density of Disk Galaxies in MOND</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend a paper by Milgrom (2009, MNRAS 398, 1023) dealing with the existence of a quasi-universal surface density for object of all mass and structure, if they are in the Newtonian regime, i.e., that their mean acceleration is larger than MOND typical acceleration $a_0$. This result is in agreement with Donato et al. (2009)'s results, claiming the existence of a quasi-universal surface density in all masses in galaxies. The Milgrom paper also predicts that objects with mean inner acceleration smaller than the values discussed do %es not show the quasi-universal behavior of the surface density discussed. In the present paper, we extend the result of Milgrom's paper, based on a point mass model, considering spiral galaxies, modelled with a double exponential disk. Similar to Milgrom's results, we find the existence of a universal surface density for galaxies with large surface density, and a different behavior for galaxies having small surface density.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmological simulations with peculiar velocities: a forward-modeling approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are a key tool to decipher the dynamics of gravitation. Yet, they fail to spatially reproduce the Universe we observe, limiting comparison between observations and simulations to a statistical level. This is highly problematic for rare, faint or well studied nearby objects that are observed in a single environment. The computational cost of recovering this environment in random simulations is prohibitive.
  We present Hamlet-PM, a method that enables the constraining of initial conditions for cosmological simulations so as to produce evolved numerical universes that can be directly compared to observations of the Local Universe: constrained simulations.
  Our method implements the field-level forward modeling of the early-time density field from sparse and noisy measurements of late-time peculiar velocities. The dynamics are integrated with a particle-mesh gravity solver, thus probing the mildly non-linear regime. The code is applied to the Cosmicflows-4 compilation of peculiar velocities up to z &lt; 0.05 (160 Mpc/h). The constrained ICs a re-simulated with a high precision N-body code.
  A series of one hundred dark-matter only cosmological constrained simulations with a resolution of 512^3 particles in a 500^3 [Mpc/h]3 box is presented. Special attention is given to twelve prominent nearby galaxy clusters, whose simulated counterparts are matched on criteria of mass and separation. We provide a mass estimate constrained by the dynamical environment for each cluster.
  Field-level forward modeling of the initial conditions produces highly constrained cosmological simulations. Currently, this method already overtakes in quality the pipeline in use in the peculiar-velocity community, although systematic biases still need to be addressed. Furthermore, improving the model is easy thanks to the inherent flexibility of the Bayesian approach.</description>

      <title>Modified Teleparallel $f(T)$ Gravity, DESI BAO and the $H_0$ Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether late-time modifications of gravity in the teleparallel framework can impact the current tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, focusing on $f(T)$ cosmology as a minimal and well-controlled extension of General Relativity. We consider three representative $f(T)$ parametrisations that recover the teleparallel equivalent of General Relativity at early times and deviate from it only at late epochs. The models are confronted with unanchored Pantheon+ Type~Ia supernovae, DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations, compressed Planck cosmic microwave background distance priors, and redshift-space distortion data, allowing us to jointly probe the background expansion and the growth of cosmic structures. Two of the three models partially shift the inferred value of $H_0$ towards local measurements, while the third worsens the discrepancy. This behaviour is directly linked to the effective torsional dynamics, with phantom-like regimes favouring higher $H_0$ and quintessence-like regimes producing the opposite effect. A global statistical comparison shows that the minimal $f(T)$ extensions considered here are not favoured over $\Lambda$CDM by the combined data. Nevertheless, our results demonstrate that late-time torsional modifications can non-trivially redistribute current cosmological tensions among the background and growth sectors.</description>

      <title>Scale-Invariant Bounce Cosmology in Weyl f(Q) Gravity with Quintom Signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a bouncing cosmological model within the Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity framework, employing a power-law form of the non-metricity scalar $Q$. The model successfully resolves the initial singularity problem by demonstrating a nonsingular bounce, where the universe transitions from a contracting phase $ \dot{a}(t)&lt;0 $ to an expanding phase ($ \dot{a}(t)&gt;0 $) at the bouncing point $t \approx 0.$ Key features include the violation of the null energy condition (NEC) near the bounce and the crossing of the phantom divide line ($\omega=-1$) by the equation of state (EoS) parameter, indicating quintom-like behavior. The model exhibits accelerated expansion post-bounce, suggesting an inflationary phase. Stability analysis via the adiabatic index reveals instability near the bouncing point, while energy conditions highlight the dominance of dark energy. Additionally, the study explores scalar fields, showing that quintessence-like kinetic energy becomes negative and phantom-like kinetic energy peaks positively near the bounce, aligning with dark energy dynamics. The Hubble parameter, deceleration parameter, and Hubble radius further validate the bouncing scenario, with the latter displaying symmetric behaviour around the bounce. These results underscore the viability of Weyl-type $f(Q)$ gravity as a framework for nonsingular bouncing cosmologies, offering insights into early universe dynamics and dark energy behaviour.</description>

Abstract: This letter proposes a new avenue for understanding the cosmological singularity. The standard cosmological model contains a generic initial singularity usually referred to as the {\em big bang}. Herein, we present a novel idea to extend the description of our Universe beyond this limit. The proposal relies on rewriting physics in a purely Riemannian, {\em i.e.} locally Euclidean, 4-dimensional space and the emergence of Lorentzian patches owing to the interaction of all matter fields to a clock field that is responsible for a signature change. If our universe is contained within one of these patches, the initial singularity is replaced by a smooth boundary on which the signature of the physical metric flips. In this letter, we first define the model and draw the necessary conditions on its arbitrary functions for solutions to exist. Next, we prove the existence of solutions that lead to an emergent universe with a primordial (almost) de Sitter phase. To finish, we discuss the consequences of this construction for the universe on scales much larger than our observable universe: a large ``Euclidean sea'' in which Lorentzian islands locally emerge and host an expanding universe potentially similar to ours. While speculative, this scenario has specific features that can be tested, and the present letter sets the basis for further phenomenological investigations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic CO and [CII] backgrounds and the fueling of star formation over 12 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular gas, modest in mass yet pivotal within the cosmic inventory, regulates baryon cycling as the immediate fuel for star formation. Across most of cosmic history, its reservoir has remained elusive, with only the tip of the iceberg revealed by luminous carbon monoxide (CO) emitting galaxies. Here we report the first detections of the mean cosmic CO background across its rotational ladder at 7$\sigma$, together with ionized carbon ([CII]) at 3$\sigma$, over $0&lt;z&lt;4.2$. This uses tomographic clustering of diffuse broadband intensities with reference galaxies, directly probing aggregate emission in the cosmic web. From CO(1-0) we infer the total molecular gas density, $\Omega_{\rm H_2}$, finding it about twice that resolved in galaxy surveys. The global depletion time is $\sim$1 Gyr, shorter than the Hubble time, requiring sustained inflow. CO excitation links to star-formation surface density and, with depletion time, yields a super-linear Kennicutt-Schmidt law that appears universal. Together these results establish a global picture of galaxy growth fueled by a larger, short-lived molecular reservoir. The CO and [CII] detections mark a turning point for line-intensity mapping, replacing forecasts with empirical line strengths and defining sensitivity requirements for upcoming 3D experiments poised to open new windows on galaxy formation and cosmology.</description>

      <title>The Electromagnetically Isolated Global Signal Estimation Platform (EIGSEP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Electromagnetically Isolated Global Signal Estimation Platform (EIGSEP) is a new instrument designed to measure the global 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization, redshifted to frequencies below 250 MHz. To reduce spectral structure in the antenna beam associated with ground scattering, EIGSEP uses a shaped bowtie antenna suspended in a canyon 100 m above the ground. We describe the current system design of EIGSEP, including the rotating antenna platform, a transmitter antenna to characterise the beam of the bowtie antenna, and auxiliary ground antennas. We then discuss the EIGSEP calibration scheme, which incorporates traditional Dicke switching in the receiver, and novel approaches that include beam mapping, beam modulation, and interferometric cross-correlation. The instrument has been deployed near Marjum Pass, Utah, for testing and initial data collection. We discuss the site characteristics and present initial field measurements.</description>

      <title>Consistent Evaluation of the No-Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Hartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal. To extract probabilities, one must use the gravitational path integral (GPI) to compute not only the no-boundary amplitude, but also the norms by which its square is divided. We find that this dramatically alters predictions: the probability for any closed universe is either nearly 1, or exactly 1. That is, in the Hilbert space of closed universes defined by the GPI, the states of interest in cosmology are all nearly parallel to the Hartle-Hawking state up to nonperturbative corrections in $G_N^{-1}$. We also consider a statistical interpretation of the GPI, as an average of arbitrary products of amplitudes. We find that all amplitudes are exactly 1 in this case, consistent with recent arguments that the statistical approach to the GPI with a closed boundary computes an average over one-dimensional Hilbert spaces. As an example, we illustrate the consistent evaluation of the no-boundary proposal in inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Cosmological phase transitions: from particle physics to gravitational waves, semi-analytically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent evidence of a stochastic gravitational wave background found by pulsar timing array experiments, we focus on one of the prime cosmological explanations, i.e. a supercooled first order phase transition. If confirmed, it would offer a unique opportunity to probe early Universe dynamics and the related physics beyond the Standard Model of particles and interactions. However, the prediction of the gravitational wave spectrum from a given particle physics scenario requires theoretically and computationally demanding methods. While several tools have been put forward to reduce uncertainties and automatize these computations, we study here the possibility to perform the full pipeline of computations semi-analytically in the $4D$ theory, thus avoiding computationally intensive simulations. Our approach yields accurate results that can be used in phenomenological studies and allow for an efficient exploration of the connection between the particle physics models and their cosmological predictions.</description>

      <title>Validating the Angular Sizes of Red Clump Stars with Intensity Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The surface-brightness-color (SBC) relationship for Red Clump stars provides a critical foundation for precision distance ladder measurements, including the 1\% distance determination to the Large Magellanic Cloud. Current SBC calibrations rely on angular diameter measurements of nearby Red Clump stars obtained through long-baseline optical interferometry using the Very Large Telescope Interferometer. We explore the application of intensity interferometry to measure limb-darkened angular diameters of Red Clump stars, offering a complementary approach to traditional amplitude interferometry. We describe the framework for extracting angular diameters from squared visibility measurements in intensity interferometry, accounting for limb darkening through the stellar atmosphere models. For the Red Clump star HD~17652, we show that intensity interferometry in the $H$ band at baselines matching PIONIER ($\sim$100~m) could achieve $&lt;1$\% angular size uncertainties in 2-hour exposures by measuring the primary peak of the visibility function, enabling direct comparison with existing measurements. Critically, observations at shorter wavelengths probe the secondary visibility maximum, providing independent checks of both measurement and systematic errors that are largely insensitive to limb-darkening assumptions. Exploiting the multiplex advantage of simultaneous multi-bandpass observations and the large number of baselines available with telescope arrays such as the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory can reduce observing times to practical levels, making intensity interferometry a viable tool for validating the angular sizes for a subset of the Red Clump star calibration sample.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlator Discontinuities from Scattering Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has revealed that basic observables of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, known as in-in or cosmological correlators, exhibit surprisingly simple mathematical structure reminiscent of scattering amplitudes in flat space. For many theories, this simplicity can be made manifest using a set of ``cosmological dressing rules'' which uplift flat-space Feynman diagrams to in-in correlators in de Sitter space by attaching auxiliary propagators to the interaction vertices. In this paper, we show that discontinuities of cosmological correlators with respect to internal energy variables can be obtained by applying auxiliary propagators to unitarity cuts of flat space Feynman diagrams. Moreover, discontinuities with respect to external energy variables can be obtained by cutting auxiliary propagators attached to Feynman diagrams. This observation in turn implies highly non-trivial constraints on cosmological correlators in the form of simple sum rules. We illustrate these ideas in a number of examples at tree-level and 1-loop for conformally coupled scalar theories, although they hold more generally. Finally, we show how to reconstruct cosmological correlators from their discontinuities using dispersion relations, providing a powerful new approach to computing cosmological observables by systematically reconstructing them from data uplifted from flat space.</description>

      <title>Large scale structure prior knowledge in the dark siren method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave dark sirens are a powerful tool for cosmology and inference of compact object population hyperparameters. They allow for a measurement of the luminosity distance to the source, but not their redshift. Galaxy catalogues in the source localization volume can be used to infer the redshift of the source in a statistical manner. Catalogues are, however, limited by their incompleteness, which can be significant at redshifts corresponding to current GW events. In this work, we detail how to implement in practice variance completion, a novel galaxy completion method which uses knowledge of the large scale structure to optimize the potential of dark sirens analyses. We compress the prediction for the missing number of galaxies into a ratio between the predictions of variance completion and the standard homogeneous completion method. This ratio format can be easily incorporated into existing line of sight computations used in dark sirens software; we demonstrate this procedure using the GLADE+ galaxy catalogue and the gwcosmo software package. We discuss the robustness of the method, and apply it to well-localized event GW190814 as a proof of concept. Finally, we apply the method to data from the third observing run of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA, finding that it yields results that are consistent with homogeneous completion. We also discuss the prospects for an improvement if the GW localization volume shrinks.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey: implications for cosmological expansion models from the final DES Baryon Acoustic Oscillation and Supernova data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Survey (DES) recently released the final results of its two principal probes of the expansion history: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). We explore the cosmological implications of these data in combination with external Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN), and age-of-the-Universe information. The BAO measurement, $\sim2\sigma$ away from Planck's $\Lambda$CDM predictions, pushes for low values of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ compared to Planck, in contrast to SN which prefers a higher value. We identify several tensions among datasets in the $\Lambda$CDM model that cannot be resolved by including either curvature or a constant dark energy equation of state. By combining BAO+SN+CMB despite these mild tensions, we obtain $\Omega_k$=$-5.5^{+4.6}_{-4.2}\times10^{-3}$ in $k\Lambda$CDM, and $w=-0.948^{+0.028}_{-0.027}$ in $w$CDM. In $w$CDM, BAO and SN push again in different directions of parameter space, favoring, respectively $w&lt;-1$ and $w&gt;-1$. If we open the parameter space to $w_0w_a$CDM, all the datasets are mutually more compatible, and we find concordance in the $w_0&gt;-1,w_a&lt;0$ quadrant, with BAO pushing for $w_a&lt;0$ and SN for $[w_0&gt;-1,w_a&lt;0]$. For DES BAO and SN in combination with Planck-CMB, we find a $3.2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, with $w_0=-0.673^{+0.098}_{-0.097}$, $w_a = -1.37^{+0.51}_{-0.50}$, a Hubble constant of $H_0=67.81^{+0.96}_{-0.86}$km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$, and an abundance of matter of $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.3109^{+0.0086}_{-0.0099}$. For the combination of all the background cosmological probes considered we still find a deviation of $2.8\sigma$ from $\Lambda$CDM in the $w_0-w_a$ plane. Assuming a minimal neutrino mass, this work provides tentative evidence for non-$\Lambda$CDM physics, which is consistent with recent claims in support of evolving dark energy, or a source of unknown systematics.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Dark Photon Dark Matter with a Millimeter-Wave Dielectric Haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter remains one of the most profound and unresolved mysteries in modern physics. To unravel its nature, numerous haloscope experiments have been implemented across various mass ranges. However, very few haloscope experiments conducted within millimeter-wave frequency range, which is in the favored mass region for well-motivated dark matter candidates. Here we designed and constructed a millimeter-wave dielectric haloscope featuring a dark matter detector composed of dielectric disks and a mirror. Using this setup, we conducted a search for randomly polarized dark photon dark matter and found no evidence for its existence. Our results established new constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter in the mass range from $387.72$ to $391.03$ $\mu eV$, improving the existing limits by two orders of magnitude. With future enhancements, our system has the potential to explore new parameter space for dark photon as well as axion dark matter within the millimeter-wave frequency range.</description>

      <title>Power law $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we consider a generalization of Starobinsky inflation obtained by combining power law ($R^\beta$), and $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation ($E$-model). The Einstein frame potential for this model is that of power law Starobinsky inflation modified by a parameter $\alpha$ in the exponential. After computing power spectra for scalar and tensor perturbations numerically, we perform MCMC analysis to put constraints on the potential parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $M$, and the number of e-foldings $N_{pivot}$ during inflation, using Planck-2018, BICEP/Keck (BK18), DES and BAO observations. We find $\log_{10}\alpha= 0.37^{+0.82}_{-0.85}$, $\beta = 1.969^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$, $M=\left(3.54^{+2.62}_{-1.73}\right)\times 10^{-5}$ and $N_{pivot} = 47\pm{10}$. With these mean values of the potential parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and varying $N_{pivot}$ between $40$ to $55$, we also find that the $r-n_s$ predictions of our model lie well within the $1\sigma$ bounds of joint constraints from combined analysis of ACT, Planck-2018, BICEP and BAO observations. We compute the Bayesian evidences for our proposed model, power law Starobinsky inflation, $\alpha$-Starobinsky inflation and Starobinsky inflation. Considering the Starobinsky model as the base model, we calculate the Bayes factor and find that our proposed model is mildly favored by the CMB and LSS observations.</description>

      <title>Hubble Tension as an Effect of Horizon Entanglement Nonequilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an infrared mechanism for alleviating the Hubble constant tension, based on a small departure from entanglement equilibrium at the cosmological apparent horizon. If the horizon entanglement entropy falls slightly below the Bekenstein-Hawking value, we parametrize the shortfall by a fractional deficit $\delta(a)$ evolving with the FLRW scale factor $a$. The associated equipartition deficit at the Gibbons-Hawking temperature then sources a smooth, homogeneous component whose density scales as $H^{2}/G$, with a dimensionless coefficient $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ of order unity times $\delta(a)$. Because this component tracks $H^{2}$, it is negligible at early times but can activate at redshifts $z\lesssim 1$, raising the late time expansion rate by a few percent without affecting recombination or the sound horizon. We present a minimal three parameter activation model for $c_{e}^{2}(a)$ and derive its impact on the background expansion, effective equation of state, and linear growth for a smooth entanglement sector. The framework predicts a small boost in $H(z)$, a mild suppression of $f\sigma_{8}(z)$, and a corresponding modification of the low-$z$ distance-redshift relation. We test these predictions against current low-redshift data sets, including SN~Ia distance moduli, baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, cosmic chronometer $H(z)$ data, and redshift space distortion constraints, and discuss whether the $H_0$ tension can be consistently interpreted as a late-time, horizon-scale information deficit rather than an early universe modification.</description>

Abstract: Knowledge of the actual density distribution of matter in the local universe is needed for a variety of purposes, for instance as a baseline model for ultrahigh energy cosmic ray sources in the continuum limit and for predicting the diffuse dark matter annihilation signal. Determining the local mass density and velocity distribution is the aim of the CosmicFlows project. An alternate approach is based on catalogs of galaxies, supplemented with some scheme for filling in unseen galaxies. Here we compare the density field proposed by J. Biteau (2021) with the quasi-linear density field of CosmicFlows2 (Y. Hoffman et al. 2018) and the mean posterior field of CosmicFlows4 (A. Valade 2026). We find factor-of-two level differences in some regions and even larger discrepancies toward the Galactic center zone of avoidance (ZoA), defined by absolute longitude less than 30 degrees and absolute latitude less than 20 degrees, as filled by Biteau using cloning. Within 11 Mpc the density field is well determined by the Local Volume catalog (I. D. Karachentsev et al. 2018), which is directly incorporated by Biteau, and is preferred over the CosmicFlows modeling. At larger distances Biteau (2021) is also preferred for the direction and integrated mass of non-obscured structures, but the radial mass distribution is less robust due to line-of-sight peculiar velocities. Within the ZoA the galaxies of Biteau (2021) are entirely fictitious and their use is ill advised except where they do not contribute to the observable of interest. Moreover, as shown by the South Pole Wall, discovered by CosmicFlows but absent from galaxy catalogs, obscuration can be significant even outside the ZoA. Unexpectedly, we find that the angular positions of structures in CosmicFlows are sometimes misaligned with their true positions as seen in galaxy catalogs outside the ZoA.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Equivalence of STVG--MOG and $\Lambda$CDM and Its Breakdown in Large--Scale Anisotropic Cosmological Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity (STVG-MOG) is observationally equivalent to the standard model $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model for all probes that depend on isotropic and linear gravitational dynamics, including galaxy rotation curves, cluster lensing, the linear matter power spectrum P(k), $\sigma_8$, baryon acoustic oscillations, and the cosmic microwave background (CMB). This degeneracy arises from the scale-dependent effective gravitational coupling $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$, which ensures identical background evolution, transfer functions, and linear growth. Consequently, all early-universe, low and intermediate scale cosmological observables are equally well described by STVG-MOG without invoking non-baryonic dark matter. We argue that the equivalence implies that isotropic cosmological data alone cannot establish the physical existence of dark matter. The degeneracy is broken only by observables sensitive to large-scale, anisotropic gravitational response. In particular, recent measurements of enhanced radio-galaxy and quasar number-count dipoles at gigaparsec scales probe a regime where $G_{\mathrm{eff}}$ departs from its $\Lambda$CDM limit, allowing STVG-MOG to generate anisotropic bulk flows, while preserving consistency with all isotropic constraints. These observations provide a concrete pathway for empirically distinguishing modified gravity from particle dark matter.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Gravitational Wave Searches above 10 kHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first direct measurement of gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations has opened up new avenues to explore our Universe. This white paper outlines the challenges and gains expected in gravitational-wave searches at frequencies above the LIGO/Virgo band. The scarcity of possible astrophysical sources in most of this frequency range provides a unique opportunity to discover physics beyond the Standard Model operating both in the early and late Universe, and we highlight some of the most promising of these sources. We review several detector concepts that have been proposed to take up this challenge, and compare their expected sensitivity with the signal strength predicted in various models. This report is the summary of a series of workshops on the topic of high-frequency gravitational wave detection, held in 2019 (ICTP, Trieste, Italy), 2021 (online) and 2023 (CERN, Geneva, Switzerland).</description>

      <title>Probing displaced (dark)photons from low reheating freeze-in at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Standard Model (SM) by introducing a $U(1)'$ gauge boson and a real pseudo-scalar field, both odd under a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. The resulting low-energy spectrum consists of a stable vector as the dark matter candidate, and a pseudo-scalar mediator, which interacts with the SM via a Higgs portal coupling and a dimension-five portal connecting it to both the dark and visible photons. We explore the freeze-in of both particles at low reheating temperature, finding a rich yield evolution dynamics in the early Universe. This setup brings a consistent dark matter scenario in which the dark photon relic abundance is generated through freeze-in at low reheating temperatures. In addition to its cosmological viability, the model can be tested at the LHC: Higgs bosons can decay into dark photons and displaced visible photons via the long-lived mediator. These signatures allow us to constrain the Higgs portal coupling using recent searches for non-pointing photons and limits on invisible or undetected Higgs decays. We derive meaningful constraints on the dark matter parameter space, in particular excluding a thermalized mediator in the region compatible with the observed relic abundance.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy dark matter soliton as gravitational lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Poisson (SP) equations predict fuzzy dark matter (FDM) solitons. Given the FDM mass $\sim10^{-20}\rm~{eV}/c^2$, the FDM soliton in the Milky Way is massive $\sim 10^7~M_{\odot}$ but diffuse $\sim 10{\rm~pc}$. Therefore, such FDM soliton can serve as a gravitational lens for gravitational waves (GWs) with frequency $\sim10^{-8}{\rm~Hz}$. In this paper, we investigate its gravitational lensing effects by numerical simulation of the propagation of GWs through it. We find that the maximum magnification factor of GWs is very small $\sim10^{-4}$, but the corresponding magnification zone is huge $\sim6{\rm~pc}$ for FDM with mass equal to $8\times10^{-21}\rm~{eV}/c^2$. Consequently, this small magnification factor compounding over such large magnification zone results in a small antisotropy of $\sim10^{-4}$ over a large solid angle in the GW background. That level of antisotropy is out of the sensitivity, $&lt;20\%$, of the pulsar timing arrays today.</description>

      <title>Noninflationary solution to the monopole problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are a long-standing prediction of Grand Unified Theories, yet their efficient production in early universe phase transitions would lead to a monopole abundance that far exceeds observational limits. The standard solution of the problem invokes inflation occurring after monopole production, diluting their density to undetectable levels and eliminating any possibility of present-day observation. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on the breaking, in the early universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, of the Weyl conformal symmetry of the gauge kinetic sector of the Lagrangian. This mechanism enhances monopole annihilation, thereby reducing their abundance to acceptable levels without requiring inflation. This scenario also predicts a residual flux of GUT monopoles potentially within the sensitivity of current and upcoming cosmic ray detectors, making their discovery possible in the near future.</description>

      <title>A quantum information method for early universe with non-trivial sound speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many quantum gravitational frameworks, such as DBI inflation, k-essence, and effective field theories obtained by integrating out heavy modes, can lead to a non-trivial sound speed. Meanwhile, our universe can be described as an open system. Under the non-trivial sound speed, we employ the method of open quantum systems combined with Arnoldi iterations to study the Krylov complexity throughout the early universe, including the inflationary, radiation-dominated, and matter-dominated epochs. A key ingredient in our analysis is the open two-mode squeezed state formalism and the generalized Lanczos algorithm. To numerically compute the Krylov complexity, we are the first time to derive the evolution equations for the parameters $r_k$ and $\phi_k$ within an open two-mode squeezed state. Our results indicate that the Krylov complexity exhibits a similar trend in both the standard case and the case with non-trivial sound speed. To distinguish between these two scenarios, we also investigate the Krylov entropy for completeness. The evolution of the Krylov entropy shows a clear difference between the standard case and the non-trivial sound speed case. Furthermore, based on the behavior of the Lanczos coefficients, we find that the case of non-trivial sound speed behaves as a maximally chaotic system. However, our numerical results suggest that the Krylov complexity does not saturate to a constant value due to the huge expansion of spacetime background. This study offers a new perspective for exploring the early universe through the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry. The broken phase has two massless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes as dynamical fields, and they can be emitted by semilocal strings. In this paper, we numerically show that such NG bosons are copiously produced with the evolution of the semilocal string network in the early universe. Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the role of dark matter. This scenario typically predicts very light pseudo NG boson dark matter.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of an exponential model in $f(Q)$ gravity including linear dark-sector interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism. Following the method introduced by B\"ohmer \textit{et al} [Universe \textbf{9} no.4, 166 (2023)], the modified Friedmann modified equations are successfully reduced to an autonomous system. Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points. We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter attractor.</description>
