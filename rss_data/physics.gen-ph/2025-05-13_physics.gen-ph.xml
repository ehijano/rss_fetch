      <title>The happening of events in temporal relation to one another establishes bistable and self-sustaining dynamics of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.08826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: My goal is to study the dynamics of the Universe from a relational perspective based on the happening of events in temporal relation to each other and their respective points of reference. Accordingly, the flow of time was modeled as the progression of events that happen at the microscale relative to the macroscale. Kinetic modeling was predicated on transition state theory, and the direction of the reaction progresses from future events to now events to past events whereby past events also auto-catalyze their own production. Model rate equations and rate laws were used to analyze if the system possesses stable equilibria, steady state, perpetual, and bistable dynamics. The results show that the Universe is self-sustaining and exists as a dynamic bistability that has two distinct, stable equilibrium states. The idea that the Universe exists as a dynamic relation between two stable equilibrium states and switches between them through hysteresis might provide a means to understand new mechanisms that explain the dynamic structure of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Unitary quantum gravitational physics and the CMB parity asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposal of Direct-Sum Quantum Field Theory (DQFT) offers a new perspective for quantum fields by combining parity and time reversal operations, blurring the distinction between quantum past and future while preserving causality. This approach provides a unitary QFT in curved spacetime, resolving the information-loss paradox. When applied to inflationary quantum fluctuations, DQFT predicts variations in CMB measurements, explaining longstanding anomalies as a result of parity asymmetry. The data strongly supports the unitary treatment of quantum fluctuations, with a probability over 650 times greater than the standard prediction. This significant discrepancy underscores the validity and importance of the DQFT approach in understanding the intricate relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous fermions as a different energy source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A different energy source, compared to nuclear ones, is proposed. In contrast to nuclear fusion and fission, the anomalous mechanism is of an electron origin resulting in the energy production in the range of $10\,GeV$ per electron. There are unusual electron states generated by the Dirac equation. The related anomalous fermion qualitatively differs from the conventional electron state. It is formed by means of some velocity $\pmb v$, whereas the Dirac equation does not contain $\pmb v$. The anomalous wave function tends to be singular with the cut off singularity on the short length less than the Compton radius and proportional to $v$. These states can be formed either by a free electron or one acted by a nuclear field. The anomalous wave function cannot be expanded on usual Dirac eigenfunctions. Thus the usual and anomalous fermions exist independently. To get the photon emission due to transitions to anomalous levels, extended down to $-10\,GeV$, one should create in experiment the anomalous fermion that is an electron described by the anomalous wave function.</description>

      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavour Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavour Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can successfully account for many things of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryogenesis. Based on the model, I here focus on the fermion flavour issues, I introduce a realistic flavour symmetry to address the fermion mass and mixing, establish the relationship of the quark mixing and lepton mixing, and clarify the source of the difference between them. From the model Lagrangian I derive a neutrino mass matrix with a special structure form and fewer parameters, its numerical solutions are precisely fitting to all the data of the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton mixing, and clearly show a stable predicting power. In addition, I suggest a new scenario of the leptogenesis, which arises from two CP-asymmetric decays of a superheavy neutral Dirac fermion. This mechanism is closely related to the neutrino flavour violation, I derive its relationship with the neutrino mass and mixing. In short, the model can simply and elegantly address the fermion flavour issues and account for the matter-antimatter asymmetry, therefore it is very realistic and believable, we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>

      <title>Electron Wave-Spin Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a wave-entity perspective of the electron spin qubit, treating the electron as a continuous physical wave rather than a point-like particle. In this theoretical framework, each spin qubit corresponds to a distinct current density configuration, offering a resolution to the paradox of a particle appearing to spin both up and down simultaneously. We further predict the existence of a persistent, azimuthally asymmetric magnetic field associated with the wave-spin qubit, an effect not anticipated by the conventional particle-spin model. Notably, the qubit's relative phase governs the orientation of both the current and the magnetic field, suggesting a mechanism for direct, local interactions between qubits. This phase-dependent coupling could form the basis for inherently parallel quantum computing architectures, in contrast to the sequential operations of gate-based logic. While this framework is grounded in theoretical analysis, it yields testable predictions -- particularly regarding the magnetic field structure -- that invite experimental verification. By treating the electron wave as the fundamental physical entity, rather than a probabilistic abstraction, we explore a quantum model that is deterministic, local, causal, and fully consistent with special relativity.</description>
