      <title>New $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates corresponding to the temperature regime of thermonuclear X-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reaction rates using the latest experimental input supplemented with theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information. The experimental input consists of the latest proton thresholds of $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As, and the nuclear spectroscopic information of $^{65}$As, whereas the theoretical nuclear spectroscopic information for $^{64}$Ge and $^{65}$As are deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations with the GXPF1A Hamiltonian. Both thermonuclear reaction rates are determined with known uncertainties at the energies that correspond to the Gamow windows of the temperature regime relevant to Type I X-ray bursts, covering the typical temperature range of the thermonuclear runaway of the GS 1826$-$24 periodic bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts.</description>

      <title>Symplectic symmetry approach to clustering in atomic nuclei: The case of $^{24}$Mg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic symmetry approach to clustering (SSAC) in atomic nuclei, recently proposed, is modified and further developed in more detail. It is firstly applied to the light two-cluster $^{20}$Ne + $\alpha$ system of $^{24}$Mg, the latter exhibiting well developed low-energy $K^{\pi} = 0^{+}_{1}$, $K^{\pi} = 2^{+}_{1}$ and $K^{\pi} = 0^{-}_{1}$ rotational bands in its spectrum. A simple algebraic Hamiltonian, consisting of dynamical symmetry, residual and vertical mixing parts is used to describe these three lowest rotational bands of positive and negative parity in $^{24}$Mg. A good description of the excitation energies is obtain by considering only the $SU(3)$ cluster states restricted to the stretched many-particle Hilbert subspace, built on the leading Pauli allowed $SU(3)$ multiplet for the positive- and negative-parity states, respectively. The coupling to the higher cluster-model configurations allows to describe the known low-lying experimentally observed $B(E2)$ transition probabilities within and between the cluster states of the three bands under consideration without the use of an effective charge.</description>

      <title>$^3$He spin-dependent structure functions within the relativistic Light-Front Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^3$He spin-dependent structure functions, $g^3_1(x)$ and $g^3_2(x)$, which parametrize the hadronic tensor in polarized deep-inelastic scattering, were evaluated within the Poincar\'e covariant light-front framework. The Bakamjian-Thomas construction of the Poincar\'e generators allows us to make use of a realistic $^3$He wave function, obtained from refined nuclear phenomenological potentials. The same approach was already successfully applied to the $^3$He and $^4$He unpolarized deep-inelastic scattering. To investigate the neutron polarized structure functions, $g^n_1$ and $g^n_2$, a readily implementable procedure, aimed at extracting the neutron spin structure functions from those of $^3$He, is shown to hold. Moreover, the first moment of $g^3_1(x)$ was evaluated, aiming at providing a valuable check of the Bjorken sum rule. The present analysis is relevant for experiments nvolving polarized beams planned at the future facilities, like the Electron Ion Colliders.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Three-$\alpha$ Breathing Modes Uncovered by Control Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new Control Neural Network (Ctrl.NN) method to uncover evidence of exotic quantum state, \textit{i.e.}, the breathing modes in 3-$\alpha$ resonant states of $^{12}$C nucleus. We provide the most precise microscopic description to date for the $^{12}$C energy spectrum, identify two new exotic breathing states, and uncover strong evidence that directly connects the recent experimental observations to the breathing modes. The Ctrl.NN method significantly simplifies numerical calculations of quantum systems under multiple constraints and offers a new perspective for solving the nuclear many-body problem.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic isovector form factors of the transition from the $N^*(1520)$ to the nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15115v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dispersion theory is used to provide a model-independent low-energy representation of the three electromagnetic isovector transition form factors $N^{*}(1520)\to N$. At low energies the virtual photon couples dominantly to a pion pair. Taking the very well understood pion vector form factor and pion re-scattering into consideration, the determination of the transition form factors is traced back to the determination of pion-baryon scattering amplitudes. Their low-energy aspects are parametrized by baryon exchange, accounting for the main decay channels of the $N^*(1520)$. Short-distance physics is encoded in subtraction constants that are fitted to data on space-like form factors and hadronic decays. It is shown that a limitation in the determination of the subtraction constants lies in the fact that isovector form factors require sufficient information about the differences between protons and neutrons. In particular, this calls for improvements in the form factor extraction from the electroproduction of the $N^*(1520)$ on the neutron. Via the dispersion relations, space- and time-like regions are naturally connected from first principles. This allows to predict the time-like form factors that enter the Dalitz decays $N^*(1520)\to N e^- e^+$ and $N^*(1520)\to N \mu^- \mu^+$. Under the assumption of the dominance of the isovector over the isoscalar channel, the Dalitz decay distributions are predicted.</description>

      <title>Universality of scaled particle spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new observable derived from a centrality-dependent scaling of transverse particle spectra. By removing the global scales of total particle number and mean transverse momentum, we isolate the shape of the spectrum. In hydrodynamic simulations, while the multiplicity and mean transverse momentum fluctuate significantly, the scaled spectrum is found to be almost constant even at an event-by-event level and after resonance decays. This universality survives when averaging over events in each centrality bin before scaling. We then investigate the presence of this scaling in experimental data from the ALICE collaboration in Pb-Pb, Xe-Xe, and p-Pb collisions. We find a remarkable universality in the experimentally observed scaled spectra at low transverse momentum, compatible with hydrodynamic predictions. The data show a minor breaking of universality at large transverse momentum and hints of evolution with the system size that are not seen in simulations. Our results motivate further theoretical and experimental investigations of this new observable to bring to light the collective and non-collective behavior encoded in the transverse particle spectrum of different collision systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Star Properties with NJL and MFTQCD Model: A Bayesian Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. The possible existence of hybrid stars is investigated using microscopic models to describe the different phases of matter. Within these microscopic models we aim at calculating the properties of neutron stars and matter. We want to probe the influence of pQCD calculations and analyze the properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. A Bayesian approach using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling process is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state. A Maxwell construction describes the deconfinement transition. For the hadronic phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with non-linear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use two different models: the NJL model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, similar to the MIT bag model with a vector term. The model parameters were determined by Bayesian inference imposing observations from NICER and the phase transition density range. We have also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The restrictions of pQCD reduce the value of the maximum mass. However, even when applying this restriction, the models were able to reach 2.1 to 2.3 solar masses. The conformal limit was not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above two solar masses. The multiquark interactions affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <title>Anomalous thresholds in $B\to (P,V)\gamma^*$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of anomalous thresholds on the non-local form factors describing the hadronization of the light-quark contribution to $B\to(P,V)\gamma^*$ transitions. Starting from a comprehensive discussion of anomalous thresholds in the triangle loop function for different mass configurations, we detail how the dispersion relation for $\pi\pi$ intermediate states is affected by contour deformations mandated by the anomalous branch points. Phenomenological estimates of the size of the anomalous contributions to the form factors are provided with couplings determined from measured branching fractions and Dalitz plot distributions. Our key finding is that anomalous effects are suppressed on the $\rho(770)$ resonance, while off-peak the effects can become as large as $\mathcal{O}(10\%)$ of the full (light-quark-loop induced) non-local form factors. We comment on future generalizations towards higher intermediate states and the charm loop, outlining how the dispersive framework established in this work could help improve the non-local form factors needed as input for a robust interpretation of $B\to (P,V)\ell^+\ell^-$ decays.</description>

      <title>Gluon radiation inside a flowing medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the spectrum of gluons emitted by a highly energetic quark inside a flowing QCD medium, focusing on the soft gluon limit at first order in the opacity expansion. Specifically, we derive the leading energy-suppressed corrections to the double differential final parton distribution, and show that they are substantial for both static and flowing matter. In particular, we demonstrate that the corrections due to the transverse flow become large even at moderate energies and flow velocities, affecting drastically both the shape and magnitude of the spectrum. We observe that the final transverse momentum of the emitted gluon tends to align along the flow direction, resulting in a non-trivial azimuthal distribution. These results can be directly implemented into the estimation of multiple observables to get a better understanding of the jet-medium interaction processes in HICs.</description>

      <title>Electric Conductivity of QCD Matter and Dilepton Spectra in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric conductivity, $\sigma_{\rm el}$, is a fundamental transport coefficient of QCD matter that can be related to the zero-energy limit of the electromagnetic (EM) spectral function at vanishing 3-momentum in the medium. The EM spectral function is also the central quantity to describe the thermal emission rates and pertinent spectra of photon and dilepton radiation in heavy-ion collisions. Employing a model for dilepton rates that combines hadronic many-body theory with nonperturbative QGP emission constrained by lattice-QCD which describes existing dilepton measurements in heavy-ion collisions, we investigate the sensitivity of low-mass dilepton spectra in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC to $\sigma_{\rm el}$. In particular, we disentangle the contributions from QGP and hadronic emission, and identify signatures that can help to extract $\sigma_{\rm el}$ from high-precision experimental data expected to be attainable with future detector systems at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Inference of neutron-star properties with unified crust-core equations of state for parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relating different global neutron-star (NS) properties, such as tidal deformability and radius, or mass and radius, requires an equation of state (EoS). Determining the NS EoS is therefore not only the science goal of a variety of observational projects, but it also enters in the analysis process; for example, to predict a NS radius from a measured tidal deformability via gravitational waves (GW) during the inspiral of a binary NS merger. To this aim, it is important to estimate the theoretical uncertainties on the EoS, one of which is the possible bias coming from an inconsistent treatment of the low-density region; that is, the use of a so called non-unified NS crust. We propose a numerical tool allowing the user to consistently match a nuclear-physics informed crust to an arbitrary high-density EoS describing the core of the star. We introduce an inversion procedure of the EoS close to saturation density that allows users to extract nuclear-matter parameters and extend the EoS to lower densities in a consistent way. For the treatment of inhomogeneous matter in the crust, a standard approach based on the compressible liquid-drop (CLD) model approach was used in our work. A Bayesian analysis using a parametric agnostic EoS representation in the high-density region is also presented in order to quantify the uncertainties induced by an inconsistent treatment of the crust. We show that the use of a fixed, realistic-but-inconsistent model for the crust causes small but avoidable errors in the estimation of global NS properties and leads to an underestimation of the uncertainties in the inference of NS properties. Our results highlight the importance of employing a consistent EoS in inference schemes. The numerical tool that we developed to reconstruct such a thermodynamically consistent EoS, CUTER, has been tested and validated for use by the astrophysical community.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian character and irreversibility of real-time quantum many-body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of pairing correlations within the time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) extension to superfluid systems, is tantamount to the presence of a quantum collision integral in the evolution equations, which leads to an obviously non-Markovian behavior of the single-particle occupation probabilities, unexpected in a traditional quantum extension of kinetic equations. The quantum generalization of the Boltzmann equation, based on a collision integral in terms of phase-space occupation probabilities, is the most used approach to describe nuclear dynamics and which by construction has a Markovian character. By contrast, the extension of TDDFT to superfluid systems has similarities with the Baym and Kadanoff kinetic formalism, which however is formulated with much more complicated evolution equations with long-time memory terms and non-local interactions. The irreversibility of quantum dynamics is properly characterized using the canonical wave functions/natural orbitals, and the associated canonical occupation probabilities, which provide the smallest possible representation of any fermionic many-body wave function. In this basis, one can evaluate the orbital entanglement entropy, which is an excellent measure of the non-equilibrium dynamics of an isolated system. To explore the phenomena of memory effects and irreversibility, we investigate the use of canonical wave functions/natural orbitals in nuclear many-body calculations, assessing their utility for static calculations, dynamics, and symmetry restoration. As the number of single-particle states is generally quite large, it is highly desirable to work in the canonical basis whenever possible, preferably with a cutoff. We show that truncating the number of canonical wave functions can be a valid approach in the case of static calculations, but that such a truncation is not valid for time-dependent calculations...</description>

      <title>Hadron-quark phase transition in the neutron star with vector MIT bag model and Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the Korea-IBS-Daegu-SKKU (KIDS) density functional for the hadron phase and the MIT bag model with vector (vBag) model for the quark phase, we obtain hadron-quark phase transition in neutron stars considering Maxwell construction. The structural properties of the resultant hybrid stars are computed for three different values of bag constant ($B$) in the range $B^{1/4}=$(145$-$160 MeV). We study the effects of symmetry energy ($J$) on the hybrid star properties with the different KIDS model and found that $J$ has important influence not only on the transition properties like the transition mass, transition radius and jump in density due to phase transition, but also on the stability of the hybrid stars. The vector repulsion of the quark phase via the parameter $G_V$ has profound influence in obtaining reasonable hybrid star configurations, consistent with the recent astrophysical constraints on the structural properties of compact stars. Within the aforesaid range of $B$, the value of $G_V$ is constrained to be 0.3 $\lesssim G_V \lesssim$ 0.4 in order to obtain reasonable hybrid star configurations.</description>

      <title>Causality Criteria from Stability Analysis at Ultra-High Boost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have exclusively employed the linear stability analysis at ultra-high boost on two well-known stable-causal theories - second-order MIS and first-order BDNK, to identify the region of parameter space over which they are frame-invariantly stable and obey causal signal propagation. It has been shown that at near-luminal boost, stability criteria alone can provide the causality constraints on transport coefficients, which are identical to the asymptotic causality conditions, without actually going to the asymptotic limit of the theories. Thus, we present an alternative approach to derive the causality constraints, which is more appropriate for low-energy effective theories like relativistic hydrodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We present results for the $\tau_1$ and $\tau_{1a}$ 1-Jettiness global event shape distributions, for Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS), at the N$^3$LL + ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^2)$ level of accuracy. These event-shape distributions quantify and characterize the pattern of final state radiation in electron-nucleus collisions. They can be used as a probe of nuclear structure functions, nuclear medium effects in jet production, and for a precision extraction of the QCD strong coupling. The results presented here, along with the corresponding numerical codes, can be used for analyses with HERA data, in EIC simulation studies, and for eventual comparison with real EIC data.</description>

      <title>Structure of Heavy Mesons in the Light-Front Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of ground-state heavy mesons within the light-front quark model, utilizing wave functions derived from the Single Gaussian Ansatz (SGA) and the Gaussian Expansion Method (GEM). By performing a $\chi^2$ fit to static properties such as mass spectra and decay constants, we determine the model parameters for each approach. We then compare the impacts of both methods on the light-front wave functions and structural observables. Our analysis reveals significant differences in the distribution amplitudes (DAs) $\phi_{2;M}(x)$ near the endpoints, with GEM showing enhanced amplitudes and correct asymptotic behavior $\phi_{2;M}(x \to 1) \propto (1-x)$, consistent with perturbative QCD. This endpoint behavior is linked to the short-range (high-momentum) wave function governed by color Coulomb interaction and relativistic kinematics. GEM accurately reproduces a power-law damping $\psi_0(k \to \infty) \propto 1/k_\perp^2$, aligning with perturbative QCD predictions. Furthermore, the electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar mesons in the low-$Q^2$ region fall off faster with GEM than with SGA. Overall, while both methods adequately describe static properties, GEM provides a more accurate description of structural properties, being more sensitive to details and asymptotic behaviors.</description>

      <title>A potential approach to the $X(3872)$ thermal behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10125v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of $X(3872)$ at finite temperature in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation under the assumption that it is a tetraquark. We argue that, at large number of colors, it is a good approximation to assume that the potential consists in a real part plus a constant imaginary term. The real part is then computed adapting an approach by Rothkopf and Lafferty and using as input lattice QCD determinations of the potential for hybrids. This model allows us to qualitatively estimate at which temperature range the formation of a heavy tetraquark is possible, and to propose a qualitative picture for the dissociation of the state in a medium. Our approach can be applied to other suggested internal structures for the $X(3872)$ and to other exotic states.</description>
