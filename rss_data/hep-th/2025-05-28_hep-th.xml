      <title>It from ETH: Multi-interval Entanglement and Replica Wormholes from Large-$c$ BCFT Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a derivation of the Ryu-Takayanagi (RT) formula in 3D gravity for generic boundary subsystems--including RT surface phase transitions--directly from the dual two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT). Our approach relies on the universal statistics of the algebraic conformal data and the large-$c$ behavior of conformal blocks with Cardy boundaries involved. We observe the emergence of 3D multi-boundary black holes with Karch-Randall branes from entangled states of any number of CFT's with and without Cardy boundaries. We obtain the RT formula from the CFT, in the high-temperature regime. Two direct applications are: $\textbf{1)}$ A simple derivation of the multi-interval entanglement entropy for the vacuum state of a single CFT; $\textbf{2)}$ A CFT-based detection of the emergence of replica wormholes in the context of entanglement islands and black hole microstate counting. Our framework yields the first holographic random tensor network that faithfully captures the entanglement structure of holographic CFTs. These results imply that bulk spacetime geometries indeed emerge from the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) in the dual field theory in the large-$c$ limit--a paradigm we refer to as $\textit{It from ETH}$.</description>

      <title>Time-like Entanglement Entropy: a top-down approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of time-like entanglement entropy (tEE) within the framework of holography. We introduce a robust top-down prescription for computing tEE in higher-dimensional QFTs, both conformal and confining, eliminating the ambiguities typically associated with analytic continuation from Euclidean to Lorentzian signatures. We present accurate analytic approximations for tEE and time-like separations in slab geometries. We establish a clear stability criterion for bulk embeddings and demonstrate that tEE serves as a powerful tool for computing CFT central charges, extending and strengthening previous results. Finally, we apply our framework to holographic confining backgrounds, revealing distinctive behaviours like phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Quantum Gravity in a Closed Lorentzian Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how meaningful physical predictions can arise in nonperturbative quantum gravity in a closed Lorentzian universe. In such settings, recent developments suggest that the quantum gravitational Hilbert space is one-dimensional and real for each $\alpha$-sector, as induced by spacetime wormholes. This appears to obstruct the conventional quantum-mechanical prescription of assigning probabilities via projection onto a basis of states. While previous approaches have introduced external observers or augmented the theory to resolve this issue, we argue that quantum gravity itself contains all the necessary ingredients to make physical predictions. We demonstrate that the emergence of classical observables and probabilistic outcomes can be understood as a consequence of partial observability: physical observers access only a subsystem of the universe. Tracing out the inaccessible degrees of freedom yields reduced density matrices that encode classical information, with uncertainties exponentially suppressed by the environment's entropy. We develop this perspective using both the Lorentzian path integral and operator formalisms and support it with a simple microscopic model. Our results show that quantum gravity in a closed universe naturally gives rise to meaningful, robust predictions without recourse to external constructs.</description>

      <title>Holographic Correlators Beyond Maximal Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the AdS/CFT correspondence to explicitly calculate some of the three-point functions in the planar limit of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Leigh-Strassler SCFT. This strongly interacting CFT can be obtained as a mass deformation of the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory and admits a dual description in terms of an AdS$_5$ background of type IIB supergravity. Our analysis is based on the existence of a consistent truncation of the 10d supergravity to a tractable 5d gravitational theory with 10 scalar fields dual to some of the low-lying operators in the spectrum of the LS SCFT. We apply standard holographic techniques to this 10-scalar model to analytically calculate the correlators of interest and thus provide a rare example of explicit three-point functions of scalar non-BPS operators in strongly coupled 4d CFTs. Using superconformal Ward identities we perform several consistency checks of these holographic correlators. As a byproduct of our analysis we discuss some subtleties related to the calculation of extremal correlators in AdS/CFT and the contribution of scalar derivative couplings to the evaluation of Witten diagrams. Our work provides a blueprint for the holographic calculation of other correlators in the LS SCFT and similar top-down holographic models.</description>

      <title>Holographic Timelike c-function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincar\'e-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous quantization of the Yang-Mills gradient flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>LSZ ghostbusters in the quadratic gravity stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present letter considers the quantization method developed in [1]-[9], which postulates that, in several situations, negative norm or ghost states can be avoided in order to give positive probabilities. These authors also postulate a candidate for a path integral for those theories, following pioneer works initiated by Dirac [10]} and Pauli \[11]. However, taking into account the non standard oscillator algebra inherent to this method, in order to be sure that unitarity is not violated, one should derived the LSZ rules for the model and check the absence of negative contributions to the $S$ matrix. In addition, the derivation of the LSZ rules is of interest, since it may not be clear at first sight that has the usual form of the textbooks. This is done here, applied to Stelle gravity [12]-[13]. In addition, an equivalent but simpler way to deal with negative norm states is worked out, in which hermiticity is more explicit. As far as we understand, our conclusions fully agree with the arguments and expectations of those authors.</description>

      <title>Positive Mass in Scalar-Torsion Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20661v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic renormalization of scalar-torsion gravity in a four-dimensional bulk spacetime with non-minimal derivative coupling. The asymptotic behavior of the static equations leads to an anti-de Sitter geometry for negative cosmological constants, allowing for a holographic interpretation via the AdS/CFT correspondence. The existence of unique solutions throughout the bulk is addressed. We study the effect of the non-minimal coupling parameter on the conformal dimension and the expectation value of the dual scalar operator, showing that the effective bulk mass can be tuned through the non-minimal coupling. Our results provide a formalism for finding non-tachyonic bulk scalar fields which vanish at the boundary.</description>

      <title>Holographic superconductor with dark matter probed by entanglement entropy in higher dimensional AdS spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the holographic entanglement entropy (HEE) with dark matter in a higher-dimensional AdS black hole spacetime including full back reaction, revealing its role as a diagnostic tool for critical phenomena in strongly coupled systems. By analyzing the HEE, we uncover distinct signatures of the metal/superconductor phase transition, demonstrating that the critical temperature is dynamically tuned by both the dark matter coupling strength and the chemical potential ratio between visible and dark matter sectors. Notably, near the criticality, the HEE exhibits a novel scaling behavior: it grows linearly with the dark matter coupling but displays a nonlinear, accelerated enhancement as the chemical potential ratio between the Maxwell and dark matter sectors increases.</description>

      <title>Integrable Non-Holonomic Constraints and Gauge Fixing in Classical Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how the usual derivation of the equations of motion for a classical field theory with non-holonomic constraints, constraints that depend on the derivatives of the field, fails. As a result, the usual method for gauge fixing in classical and quantum field theories fails for general gauges that depend on the derivatives of the fields, such as the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges. The point of failure occurs at the use of the transposition rule, $\delta(\partial_\nu A^\mu)=\partial_\nu(\delta A^\mu)$, in the derivation of the equations of motion from the extremization of the action; we show that the transposition rule does not hold for general non-holonomic constraints. We define the concept of integrability of non-holonomic constraints in field theory and prove that the usual transposition rule holds for theories with these constraints. We are thus able to recover the usual treatment of gauge fixing for gauges of this type. We apply our formalism to the specific examples of the Coulomb and Lorenz gauges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between covariant fracton gauge theory and Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji extension of teleparallel gravity is investigated. The former is the gauge theory of a rank two symmetric tensor with gauge symmetry given by the double derivative of a scalar parameter; the latter is a class of theories which generalises Einstein gravity, whose action is quadratic in the Weitzenb\"ock torsion. We show that the solutions of covariant fracton gauge theory can be viewed as solutions of Moller-Hayashi-Shirafuji theory, providing a new insight in the relation between covariant fractons and gravity, and elucidating the meaning of covariant fracton theories as a new type of gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Warped G$_2$-throats in IIA and uplift dSillusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux compactifications of IIA supergravity on orientifolded G$_2$-manifolds have been argued to allow for classical Minkowski$_3$ vacua with moduli and scale-separated AdS$_3$ vacua with full moduli stabilisation. To further uplift these vacua to meta-stable dS$_3$ vacua using anti-D2 branes, warped throats are desirable. We study the flux-stabilisation of local "CGLP-type" throats in compact G$_2$ spaces, and discuss consistency constraints on anti-brane uplifting. Despite the classical AdS$_3$ vacua to be free of tachyons, we find that uplifting from anti-branes down warped throats is forbidden. If instead we rely on hypothetical AdS$_3$ vacua that arise from quantum corrections to the classical Minkowski$_3$ vacua, we find that (similarly to the 4d analogues) consistency constraints point in opposite directions. However, there is potentially an advantage over 4d when it comes to concrete fine-tuning freedom of numbers, such as tadpole constraints.</description>

      <title>Euclidean wormholes stability analysis revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies of linearized stability of asymptotically flat Euclidean axion wormholes found that symmetric modes suffered from divergences. We show that such divergences were an artifact of a particular way of solving the constraints, and that a full treatment leads to finite actions for such modes. The modes must thus be included in a stability analysis. However, since the action for these modes turns out to be positive, this turns out not to affect previous statements about stability of axion wormholes. We also introduce a technique that allows us to show this positivity at a pseudo-analytic level that avoids heavy numerics. Our techniques should be useful to future studies of stabilities of other wormholes as well.</description>

      <title>Dyons in higher-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the 't Hooft-Polyakov (TP) monopole and then dyon in the framework of the higher dimensional gauge theories, such as the gauge-Higgs unification models. First, we point out that the Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) monopole is nothing but a self-dual gauge field in the 4-dimensional (4D) space including the extra dimension. This property is argued to have an inevitable remarkable consequence that the mass of the BPS monopole $M_{{\rm TPM}}$ and therefore the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the Higgs field are topologically quantized. Next, the argument is generalized to the case of dyon.The mass of the BPS dyon, $M_{{\rm BPS}}$, is still proportional to the quantized Higgs VEV, though it also depends on a parameter $\mu$, denoting the ratio of the electric and magnetic charges of the dyon. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism to quantize the parameter $\mu$ too. We demonstrate that in the 5D gauge theories the Chern-Simons term is induced at the quantum level, which, after the extra space component of the gauge field is replaced by its VEV, produces the $\theta$ term. Here again the VEV is quantized and through the Witten effect we reach to a remarkable conclusion that the electric charge of the dyon, and therefore the parameter $\mu$ is discretized. This means that $M_{{\rm BPS}}$ is also discretized. In addition, we propose a numerical method to obtain the field configurations and the mass of the non-BPS dyons by use of ``modified" gradient flow equations. We find that the obtained field configurations of non-BPS dyon and its mass are rather close to those of the BPS dyon.</description>

      <title>More on Slavnov Products of Spin Chains and KP Hierarchy Tau Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Connections between classical and quantum integrable systems are analyzed from the viewpoint of Slavnov products of Bethe states. It is well known that, modulo model dependent aspects, the functional structure of Slavnov products generally takes the form of determinants. Building on recent results on the structure of rational and trigonometric models, we show that, provided certain conditions are satisfied, the Slavnov product of a given model can be interpreted as a tau function of the KP hierarchy, thus extending known results in a more general setting. Moreover, we show that Slavnov products can be expanded in terms of other tau functions. We also prove that their homogeneous limit can be systematically expressed as a Wronskian of functions related to the eigenvalues of the transfer matrices. Finally, we compute the Baker-Akhiezer functions associated with these Slavnov products and show that, apart from a universal multiplicative factor, they admit a closed determinantal representation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Collective Coordinate Quantization of Solitons with Topological Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the $\theta+$ pentaquark does not exist in the Skyrme model. For the solitons of the theory with topological terms, the standard collective coordinate quantization does not construct the proper low energy effective theory. In the presence of topological terms, zero modes are classified into three groups: dynamical zero modes with constant velocity, cyclotron zero modes in a circular orbit, and static constraint zero modes. According to the mode expansion, the topological term contributes to the moduli metric of the dynamical zero modes. In addition, constraint zero modes do not have the kinetic term and produce constraints that strongly restrict the spectrum instead. In this paper, we propose a generalized collective coordinate quantization method and apply it to the SU(3) Skyrmion with the Wess- Zumino-Witten term. We find five constraints. These reproduce the results of [1], eliminating all the SU(3) multiplets except the nucleon octet and $\Delta$ baryon decuplet from the baryon spectrum.</description>

      <title>Scalar field stochastic dynamics in de Sitter spacetime from exact solutions of quantum deficient oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process, to which exact distribution and correlation functions are constructed by utilising the correspondence between diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators, based on which this article constructs a new class of exact solutions in stochastic inflation. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactly solvable double-well model is also presented. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>Representations of the fractional d'Alembertian and initial conditions in fractional dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct representations of complex powers of the d'Alembertian operator $\Box$ in Lorentzian signature and pinpoint one which is self-adjoint and suitable for classical and quantum fractional field theory. This self-adjoint fractional d'Alembertian is associated with complex-conjugate poles, which are removed from the physical spectrum via the Anselmi-Piva prescription. As an example of empty spectrum, we consider a purely fractional propagator and its K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. Using a cleaned-up version of the diffusion method, we formulate and solve the problem of initial conditions of the classical dynamics with a standard plus a fractional d'Alembertian, showing that the number of initial conditions is two. We generalize this result to a much wider class of nonlocal theories and discuss its applications to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>5-Dimensional Gravitational Raman Scattering: Scalar Wave Perturbations in Schwarzschild-Tangherlini Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study scalar wave perturbations of arbitrary frequency to the 5D Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black hole (STBH) within general relativity. For the first time, we derive a closed formula for the 5D partial wave gravitational Raman scattering amplitude applicable to a broad class of boundary conditions, expressed in terms of the Nekrasov-Shatashvili (NS) function for the reduced confluent Heun problem. Furthermore, up to $O(G^2)$ we compute the dynamical $\ell=0$, and the static $\ell=1$, scalar tidal Love numbers of the STBH by matching an effective field theory description for a scalar wave scattering off the black hole, to our novel ultraviolet-NS solutions. The matched Love numbers do not vanish and present renormalization group running behavior.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the most up-to-date determinations of the normalization of the leading renormalons of the pole mass, the singlet static potential, the octet static potential, and the gluelump energy. They read $Z^{\rm MS}_m=-Z^{\rm MS}_{V_s}/2=\{0.604(17),0.551(20)\}$, $Z^{\rm MS}_{V_o}=\{0.136(8),0.121(13)\}$, and $Z^{\rm MS}_A=\{-1.343(36),-1.224(43)\}$, for $n_f=0$ and $n_f=3$ respectively. We obtain two independent renormalization group invariant and renormalization scale independent determinations of the energy of the ground state gluelump in the principal value summation scheme: $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.47(9)r_0^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.38(11)r_0^{-1}$. They combine in $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.44(7)r_0^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Tidal Dissipation Numbers of Non-rotating Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A set of tidal dissipation numbers (TDNs) quantifies the absorption of the tidal force exerted by a companion during an inspiralling phase of a binary compact object. This tidal dissipation generally affects the gravitational waveform, and measuring the TDNs of a black hole (BH) allows us to test the nature of gravity in the strong-field regime. In this paper, we develop a parametrized formalism for calculating the TDNs of static and spherically symmetric BH backgrounds using the Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi method, which connects the underlying perturbative equations with observable quantities in gravitational-wave observations in a theory-agnostic manner. Our formalism applies to any system where the master equation has the form of the Regge-Wheeler/Zerilli equation with a small correction to the effective potential. As an application of our formalism, we consider three examples: the effective field theory of BH perturbations with timelike scalar profile, the Einstein-Maxwell system, and a higher-curvature extension of general relativity. We also discuss the absence of logarithmic running for the TDNs.</description>

      <title>Stable soliton dark matter wormhole in non-minimally coupled $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that non-minimal coupling between matter and geometry can indeed help in constructing stable, traversable, wormholes (WHs) without requiring exotic matter under certain conditions. In models like $f({\cal Q},{\cal T})={\cal Q}+\beta {\cal T}$ gravity, where ${\cal Q}$ is the non-metricity scalar, and ${\cal T}$ is the trace of the energy-momentum tensor, the coupling between matter and geometry introduces additional degrees of freedom in terms of the parameter $\beta$. These can mimic the effects of exotic matter or even replace it entirely under specific parameter choice. The analysis involves deriving WH shape functions based on two dark matter (DM) density profiles: a solitonic core at the center of DM halos, and the outer halo follows the universal Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) density profile of cold DM (CDM). The wormhole solutions derived in these models satisfy important geometric conditions like: Flaring-out condition (necessary for traversability) and asymptotic flatness condition. For large positive coupling parameter, the null energy condition (NEC) can be satisfied at the wormhole throat, meaning exotic matter is not needed, while the wormhole is no longer Lorentzian and the flaring-out condition is broken. However, for large negative coupling parameter, the NEC can be satisfied, allowing for healthy wormholes without exotic matter, provided the coupling strength remains within certain bounds. In the latter case, the NEC is broken only effectively. We investigate the stability of the obtained wormhole solutions by virtue of a modified version of Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation, which includes a new force due to matter-geometry non-minimal, showing that these wormholes can be dynamically stable.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous ghostification: how a dying black hole comes back as a naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum ghost that destabilizes the Schwarzschild solution, transforming it into a naked singularity, may seem like a physicist's worst nightmare. However, we argue that this scenario represents the natural evolution of a black hole within a conservative high-energy gravity framework and may, in fact, be a desirable outcome. Quadratic curvature terms typically appear as corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action at high energies; nonetheless, such theories are generally considered incomplete due to the presence of ghost particles at the quantum level, which can spoil vacuum stability. We argue that this instability can only be triggered at the final stages of black hole evaporation, starting a phase transition-like process that alters the nature of the spacetime, similarly to spontaneous scalarization. We propose that the endpoint is a stable, exotic naked singularity, possible only in modified gravity theories, and avoids some of the pathological features associated with standard naked singularities.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.</description>

      <title>Precision Unitarity Calculations in Inflationary Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit perturbative unitarity in scalar field inflation with a nonminimal coupling, with Higgs inflation serving as the most prominent example. Although such models are phenomenologically successful, it is critical to examine whether or not unitarity violations spoil their theoretical self-consistency. The analysis of these issues has so far typically relied on order-of-magnitude estimates of scattering amplitudes, which are appropriate for generic parameters. It is not evident that these methods apply to scenarios relying on a near-critical inflationary potential, for which an interplay of both small scalar self-couplings and nonminimal couplings could partially alleviate the unitarity issues. To allow for an exploration of this possibility, we consider the full $S$-matrix for the relevant scattering processes, taking into account important phase space volume factors, leading to a precise evaluation of the cut-off scale. In the single-field case, we demonstrate that near-criticality raises the cut-off scale considerably, compared to previous estimates. In the multifield case, momentum-dependent self-interactions in the kinetic sector lower the cut-off compared to the single-field case to a value comparable to but slightly larger than previous estimates. We carefully study both the single-field and multifield cases in metric and metric-affine (Palatini) formulations of gravity, as well as introduce a new phenomenologically viable model with a canonical kinetic term and a significantly raised cut-off, and discuss the importance of background field effects.</description>

Abstract: We show that solutions to the strong CP problem based on modular invariance can be extended to incorporate features that appear in string compactifications: quarks with mostly positive modular weights and non-trivial gauge kinetic functions. This requires assuming that singularities and zeroes only appear at special points, such as decompactification limits. We discuss the impact of these assumptions on string gauge unification.</description>

      <title>Probing supermassive black hole scalarization with Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories with a scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant can evade no-hair theorems and allow for non-trivial scalar profiles around black holes. This coupling is characterized by a length scale $\lambda$, which, in an effective field theory perspective, sets the threshold below which deviations from General Relativity become significant. LIGO/VIRGO constraints indicate $\lambda$ is small, implying supermassive black holes should not scalarize. However, recent work suggests that scalarization can occur within a narrow window of masses, allowing supermassive black holes to scalarize, while leaving LIGO/VIRGO sources unaffected. We explore the impact of this scenario on the stochastic gravitational wave background recently observed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. We find that scalarization can alter the characteristic strain produced by circularly inspiralling SMBH binaries and that current data shows a marginal preference for a non-zero $\lambda$. However, similar signatures could arise from astrophysical effects such as orbital eccentricity or environmental interactions, emphasizing the need for improved modeling and longer observations to discriminate among the different scenarios.</description>

Abstract: $\mathrm{O}(N)$ vector models in three dimensions, when defined in a geometry with a compact direction and tuned to criticality, exhibit long-range fluctuations which induce a Casimir effect. The strength of the resulting interaction is encoded in the excess free-energy density, which depends on a universal coefficient: the Casimir amplitude. We present a high-precision numerical calculation of the latter, by means of a novel non-equilibrium Monte Carlo algorithm, and compare our findings with results obtained from large-$N$ expansions and from the conformal bootstrap.</description>

      <title>Ill-posedness of the Cauchy problem for linearized gravity in a cavity with conformal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Lorentzian General Relativity in a cavity with a timelike boundary, with conformal boundary conditions and also a generalization of these boundary conditions. We focus on the linearized gravitational dynamics about the static empty cavity whose boundary has spherical spatial geometry. It has been recently shown that there exist dynamical instabilities, whose angular dependence is given in terms of spherical harmonics $Y_{\ell m}$, and whose coefficient of exponential growth in time goes as $\sim \ell^{1/3}$. We use these modes to construct a sequence of solutions for which the initial data converge to zero as $\ell \rightarrow \infty$ but for which the solution itself does not converge to zero. This implies a lack of continuity of solutions on initial data, which shows that the initial value problem with these boundary conditions is not well-posed. This is in tension with recent mathematical work on well-posedness for such boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with improved chiral properties, starting from a construction of Creutz-Horvath-Neuberger that provides a doubler-free Hamiltonian lattice regularization for Dirac fermions in even spacetime dimensions. We use a higher-order generalization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation due to Fujikawa, which yields an order-$k$ Hamiltonian overlap operator for each integer $k \geq 0$, with an exactly conserved but nonquantized chiral charge that becomes quantized as $k \to \infty$. Our construction provides physical insight into how Fujikawa's higher-order Ginsparg-Wilson relation improves chiral symmetry while reproducing the anomaly, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in any Hamiltonian lattice realization of an anomalous chiral symmetry. This class of Hamiltonian lattice regularizations, with their tunable chiral symmetry properties, offers potential advantages for quantum and tensor-network simulations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Mapping the transverse spin sum rule in position space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss in detail the relativistic spatial distribution of transverse angular momentum, including both orbital and intrinsic spin contributions. Using the quantum phase-space formalism, we begin with the definition of the three-dimensional spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum and intrinsic spin in a generic Lorentz frame. By integrating these three-dimensional spatial distributions over the longitudinal axis, we derive for the first time the relativistic spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum for spin-0 and spin-1/2 targets in the transverse plane. We verify the transverse spin sum rule for spin-0 and spin-1/2 systems, and find that the transverse total angular momentum distribution is nontrivial, even for spin-0 targets. We also show how the distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum change with the target momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These proceedings summarize a newly found connection between the factorial growth of coefficients in perturbative QCD and power corrections to the perturbation series, discussed in refs. [1-4]. The improved convergence is shown for three quantities four which four terms in the series are available: the static energy, the quark pole mass, and the polarized Bjorken sum rule. Prospects for determinations of $\alpha_\text{s}$ with controlled truncation uncertainties are discussed, as was found earlier in quark-mass determinations [3,5].</description>

      <title>Strong coupling and instabilities in singularity-free inflation from an infinite sum of curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional gravitational theories derived from an infinite sum of Lovelock curvature invariants, combined with a conformal rescaling of the metric, are equivalent to a subclass of shift-symmetric Horndeski theories that possess a single scalar degree of freedom. Under the assumption of a homogeneous and isotropic cosmological background, the theory admits an inflationary solution that replaces the Big Bang singularity. This can be achieved by a solution where the Hubble expansion rate $H$ is equal to the time derivative of the scalar field $\dot{\phi}$. We show that the solution $H=\dot{\phi}$ suffers from a strong coupling problem, characterized by the vanishing kinetic term of linear scalar perturbations at all times. Consequently, nonlinear scalar perturbations remain uncontrolled from the onset of inflation throughout the subsequent cosmological evolution. Moreover, tensor perturbations are generally subject to Laplacian instabilities during inflation. This instability in the tensor sector also persists under background initial conditions where $H \neq \dot{\phi}$. In the latter case, both the coefficient of the kinetic term for scalar perturbations and the scalar sound speed diverge at the onset of inflation. Thus, the dominance of inhomogeneities in this theory renders the homogeneous background solution illegitimate.</description>

      <title>Inflationary power spectrum from the Lanczos algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The generalized Lanczos algorithm can provide a universal method for constructing the wave function under the group structure of Hamiltonian. Based on this fact, we obtain an open two-mode squeezed state as the quantum origin for the curvature perturbation. In light of this wave function in the open system, we successfully develop a new method to calculate its corresponding power spectrum by using the Bogoliubov transformation. Unlike traditional approaches, we explicitly retain the Bogoliubov coefficients in terms of the squeezing amplitude \( r_k \) and the squeezing rotation angle \( \phi_k \). As a result, the power spectrum of the open two-mode squeezed state will match that of the Bunch-Davies vacuum numerically. Furthermore, the derivation of the open two-mode squeezed state relies on the second kind Meixner polynomial (equivalent to the generalized Lanczos algorithm) and the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Therefore, our research may offer a new insight into the calculation of the correlation functions through a group-theoretic perspective.</description>

      <title>Magnetically arrested transmutation of a compact star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel mechanism -- Magnetically Arrested Transmutation (MAT) -- to account for the observed absence of ordinary pulsars near the Galactic centre, a longstanding puzzle known as the missing pulsar problem and the over-representation of magnetic white dwarfs in the same region. In this scenario, compact stars capture and accumulate dark matter, eventually forming an endoparasitic black hole (EBH) of initial mass $M_0$ at their core. Although such EBHs generally grow by accreting host matter, we show that sufficiently strong core magnetic fields can establish pressure equilibrium, thereby stalling further accretion and halting the star's transmutation into a black hole. We derive the conditions for MAT to occur, identifying a critical parameter $\beta$, which encapsulates the interplay between the magnetic field strength, host matter density, and EBH mass. For $0 &lt; \beta \leq 4/27$, the growth of the EBH is arrested, limiting its final mass ($M_{\rm f}$) to $M_0 &lt; M_{\rm f} \leq 3/2 M_0$, whereas for $\beta &gt; 4/27$, full transmutation may ensue. This framework offers a plausible unified explanation for the absence of ordinary pulsars and the survival of the magnetar PSR J1745-2900, and the elevated population of magnetic white dwarfs, in the Galactic centre, and hence could be tested and should have implications for understanding dark matter and compact objects.</description>

      <title>Violation of weak cosmic censorship by the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the possibility that the weak cosmic censorship conjecture can be violated using the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse model with a perfect fluid star interior. Metric models with a naked singularity can be used, and the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse might be possible; the null energy condition is also satisfied in these models. However, this is just a toy model because no known model as a solution to the Einstein equation. To avoid this problem, we can consider a naked singularity solution as a proper solution of the Einstein equation, but in this case, we need to introduce a thin-shell on top of the perfect fluid star. In this case, gravitational collapse is allowed, but the null energy condition should be violated at the thin-shell. In conclusion, we could not find a physically viable model that violates weak cosmic censorship, but it opens a window to study the properties of cosmic censorship constructively. The violation of weak cosmic censorship might be possible if a modified gravity model provides a solution that allows the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse without a shell. Also, regarding the thin-shell case, the shell approaches the naked singularity closer without violating the null energy condition, although it must violate the null energy condition at the singularity eventually; this might be regarded as an effective violation of cosmic censorship in some sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black hole thermodynamics is a crucial and foundational aspect of black hole physics, yet its observational verification remains exceptionally challenging. The photon sphere of a black hole, a manifestation of strong gravitational effects, is intrinsically linked to its shadow, which has been directly captured through observations made by the Event Horizon Telescope. Investigating black hole thermodynamics from a gravitational perspective presents an intriguing avenue for research. This paper investigates the relationship between the thermodynamic phase transition and the photon sphere of a black hole with quantum anomaly. It proposes that the photon sphere encodes information about the black hole phase transition, arguing that the change in the photon sphere radius can serve as an order parameter characterizing the black hole's phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary metaplectic representations of the group $SL_2(\mathbb{Z}_{2^n})$ are necessary to describe the evolution of $2^n$-dimensional quantum systems, such as systems involving $n$ qubits. We construct the general matrix form of such representations, together with appropriately defined magnetic translations based on the diagonal subgroup of the tensor product of the finite Heisenberg group $HW_{2^n} \otimes HW_{2^n}$. It is shown that in order for the metaplectic property to be fulfilled, an increase in the dimensionality of the involved $n$-qubit Hilbert spaces, from $2^n$ to $2^{2n}$, is necessary.</description>

      <title>Parameter inference of microlensed gravitational waves using neural spline flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When gravitational waves (GWs) propagate near massive objects, they undergo gravitational lensing that imprints lens model dependent modulations on the waveform. This effect provides a powerful tool for cosmological and astrophysical studies. However, conventional Bayesian parameter inference methods for GWs are computationally expensive, especially for lensed events with additional lens parameters, necessitating more efficient approaches. In this work, we explore the use of neural spline flows (NSFs) for posterior inference of microlensed GWs, and successfully apply NSFs to the inference of 13-dimensional lens parameters. Our results demonstrate that compared with traditional methods like Bilby dynesty that rely on Bayesian inference, the NSF network we built not only achieves inference accuracy comparable to traditional methods for the main parameters, but also can reduce the inference time from approximately 3 days to 0.8 s on average. Additionally, the network exhibits strong generalization for the spin parameters of GW sources. It is anticipated to become a powerful tool for future low-latency searches for lensed GW signals.</description>

      <title>What triggers type Ia supernovae: Prompt detonations from primordial black holes or companion stars?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We set up and perform collision rate simulations between dark matter in the form of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) and white dwarf stars. These encounters trigger prompt detonations and could be the key to solving the ignition mystery of type Ia supernovae. Our framework is flexible enough to cover the full range of progenitor white dwarf masses, host galaxy stellar masses, galactocentric radial offsets, and cosmic time. The rate distribution pattern is consistent with exhaustive literature observational determinations for a slightly extended log-normal PBH mass spectrum. Most strikingly, the so far unexplained brightness distribution comes out without finetuning. We find no severe contradictions, except that the inferred PBH mass scale is unpredicted from first principles.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter-induced transients over cosmic time: The role of star formation history profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dark matter (DM) conundrum is one of the most intriguing due to its resistance in direct detection experiments. In recent years, attempts to identify non-gravitational signatures as the result of DM traversing or accumulating within stars have attracted a lot of attention. These calculations are usually evaluated at the order-of-magnitude level for stellar populations where the DM density is highest, such as galactic centers. However, if the signature implies the destruction of the host star, their population could have been diminished over a Hubble time in the most DM-dense regions, unless replenished by star formation. This circumstance exemplifies the need for galactic star formation history profiles when deriving DM-induced transient rates, in particular for predicting the host-offset distribution. Here, we combine theoretical and empirical scaling relations of galaxy structure, star formation, and stellar initial mass function to construct a simple and efficient framework that permits us to estimate the target population formation rate and mass function within galactocentric radial zones across galaxy stellar masses and cosmic time. In a companion paper, we apply the framework to the hypothesis that DM in the form of primordial black holes accounts for the ignition of normal type Ia supernovae when colliding with white dwarf stars.</description>

Abstract: Quantum anomalies are deeply connected to the renowned Atiyah-Singer (AS) index theorem. While often associated with fermionic systems, anomalies can also emerge in purely bosonic settings. In this paper, we explore a particularly simple example of such a case: the quantum harmonic oscillator. We investigate how its internal energy relates to the Atiyah-Singer index theorem, showing that the partition function can be interpreted as the Chern character of "physiacl sheaf" over Eucildean spacetime. This correspondence reveals the internal energy of oscillator as a concrete manifestation of the index theorem. Moreover, we show that this connection naturally leads to the emergence of a quantum anomaly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{mosca}$, a $\texttt{Mathematica}$ package designed to facilitate on-shell calculations in effective field theories (EFTs). This initial release focuses on the reduction of Green's bases to physical bases, as well as transformations between arbitrary operator bases. The core of the package is based on a diagrammatic on-shell matching procedure, grounded in the equivalence of physical observables derived from both redundant and non-redundant Lagrangians. $\texttt{mosca}$ offers a complete set of tools for performing basis transformations, diagram isomorphism detection, numerical substitution of kinematic configurations, and symbolic manipulation of algebraic expressions. Planned future developments include extension to one-loop computations, thus providing support for EFT renormalization directly in a physical basis and automated computation of one-loop finite matching, including contributions from evanescent operators. The package, along with example notebooks and documentation, is available at: https://gitlab.com/matchingonshell/mosca.</description>

Abstract: Type IIB flux vacua based on Landau-Ginzburg models without K\"ahler deformations provide fully-controlled insights into the non-geometric and strongly-coupled string landscape. We show here that supersymmetric flux configurations at the Fermat point of the $1^9$ model, which were found long-time ago to saturate the orientifold tadpole, leave a number of massless fields, which however are not all flat directions of the superpotential at higher order. More generally, the rank of the Hessian of the superpotential is compatible with a suitably formulated tadpole conjecture for all fluxes that we found. Moreover, we describe new infinite families of supersymmetric 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minkowski and AdS vacua and confront them with several other swampland conjectures.</description>

Abstract: We study the entanglement dynamics of accelerated atoms using the theory of open quantum systems. We consider two atoms travelling along different hyperbolic trajectories with different proper times. We use the generalized master equation to discuss the dynamics of a pair of dipoles interacting with the electromagnetic field. The fundamental role played by proper acceleration in the entanglement harvesting and sudden death phenomenon is discussed. Finally, we discuss how the polarization of the atoms affects our results. For some choices of the polarization's configuration, we no longer observe the entanglement harvesting phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We explore dilaton gravity with general dilaton potentials in the semi-classical limit viewed both as a gas of blunt defects and also as a semi-classical theory in its own right. We compare the exact defect gas picture with that obtained by naively canonically quantizing the theory in geodesic gauge. We find a subtlety in the canonical approach due to a non-perturbative ambiguity in geodesic gauge. Unlike in JT gravity, this ambiguity arises already at the disk level. This leads to a distinct mechanism from that in JT gravity by which the semi-classical approximation breaks down at low temperatures. Along the way, we propose that new, previously un-studied saddles contribute to the density of states of dilaton gravity. This in particular leads to a re-interpretation of the disk-level density of states in JT gravity in terms of two saddles with fixed energy boundary conditions: the disk, which caps off on the outer horizon, and another, sub-leading complex saddle which caps off on the inner horizon. When the theory is studied using a defect expansion, we show how the smooth classical geometries of dilaton gravity arise from a dense gas of very blunt defects in the $G_N \to 0$ limit. The classical saddle points arise from a balance between the attractive force on the defects toward negative dilaton and a statistical pressure from the entropy of the configuration. We end with speculations on the nature of the space-like singularity present inside black holes described by certain dilaton potentials.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Corrections to 3d BPS Indices and Topological Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a 3d gauged linear sigma model parametrized by a Kahler manifold X, the 3d BPS index defines a q-series that can be analytically continued in the Kahler modulus by standard methods. It is argued that an SL(2,Z)-transform of the Birkhoff connection matrix captures non-perturbative corrections to the 3d GLSM. As an application, a 3d lift of the standard 2d GLSM for the resolved conifold is shown to provide a world-volume dual for the non-perturbative topological string on the resolved conifold. The perturbative 3d BPS index computes the Gopakumar-Vafa partition function, while the analytic continuation matches existing proposals for a non-perturbative completion of the topological string.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing massless fields with fluxes in Landau-Ginzburg models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work on flux compactifications suggests that the tadpole constraint generically allows only a limited number of complex structure moduli to become massive, i.e., be stabilized at quadratic order in the spacetime superpotential. We study the effects of higher-order terms systematically around the Fermat point in the $1^9$ Landau-Ginzburg model. This model lives at strong coupling and features no K\"ahler moduli. We show that, depending on the flux, several massless fields can indeed be stabilized in this fashion, and argue that this paves the way to explicit ${\mathcal N}=1$ Minkowski vacua without flat directions. Along the way, we complete the classification of integral flux vectors with small tadpole contribution. Thereby we are closing in on a future complete understanding of all possible flux configurations in the $1^9$ Landau-Ginzburg model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory for fusion of conformal defects of any codimension in $d\geq 3$ conformal field theories. We fully solve the constraints of Weyl invariance for defects of arbitrary shape on general curved bulk manifolds and discuss the simplifications that arise for spherical defects on the conformal sphere. As applications, we study the structure of cusp anomalous dimensions in the anti-parallel lines limit and derive high-energy spin-dependent asymptotics for the one-point functions of bulk operators. We point out the potential importance of defects that break transverse rotations and initiate a classification of their Weyl anomalies.</description>

Abstract: We study moduli stabilization via fluxes in the $2^6$ Landau-Ginzburg model. Fluxes not only give masses to scalar fields but can also induce higher order couplings that stabilize massless fields. We investigate this for several different flux choices in the $2^6$ model and find two examples that are inconsistent with the Refined Tadpole Conjecture. We also present, to our knowledge, the first 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ Minkowski solution in string theory without any flat direction.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^{\i}tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that mirror duals of 3d and 4d theories with four super-charges can be described by generalized quiver theories, constructed using strongly coupled SCFTs as elementary building blocks that replace and improve standard bifundamentals. In this work we study and extend the family of such improved bifundamentals and discuss the network of star-triangle dualities they satisfy. We provide a field theoretic proof of the star-triangle dualities, which only assumes the basic Seiberg dualities, using the sequential deconfinement technique.</description>

      <title>1d Ising model with $1/r^{1.99}$ interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field theories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\leq s\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with quartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled near the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which becomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a number of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT data around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2) the analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between the two methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the connection between super $\mathcal{W}$-algebras ($\mathcal{SW}$-algebras) and $\mathrm{G}$-structures with torsion. The former are realised as symmetry algebras of strings with $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetry on the worldsheet, while the latter are associated with generic string backgrounds with non-trivial Neveu-Schwarz flux $H$. In particular, we focus on manifolds featuring $\mathrm{Spin}(7)$, $\mathrm{G}_2$, $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$-structures. We compare the full quantum algebras with their classical limits, obtained by studying the commutators of superconformal and $\mathcal{W}$-symmetry transformations, which preserve the action of the $(1,0)$ non-linear $\sigma$-model. We show that, at first order in the string length scale $\ell_s$, the torsion deforms some of the OPE coefficients corresponding to special holonomy through a scalar torsion class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study thermal two-point functions and four-point functions involving two heavy twisted operators and two light probes in symmetric product orbifolds. We identify cases where they are universal at large $N$, that is, they are only sensitive to the orbifold structure. Surprisingly, such observables mimic correlators obtained from the BTZ background, even though symmetric product orbifolds are not dual to semi-classical gravity. We discuss the interpretation of these results in light of the criteria for emergence of spacetime via Von Neumann algebras. Our analysis implies that a condition on the infinite $N$ thermal two-point functions cannot be stringent enough to define an emergent spacetime and the concept of a sharp horizon.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of branes in infinite distance limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider flat slices of moduli spaces where the $(-\nabla \log T)$-vectors of particle-towers and branes are constant, and I show that the Emergent String Conjecture constrains these vectors to reside on lattices. In asymptotic limits, this results in exponentially separated, discretized hierarchies of energy scales. I further identify conditions that determine whether a given lattice site must be populated, and I show that only a finite set of configurations satisfies these conditions. I classify all such configurations for 0d, 1d, and 2d moduli spaces in theories with 3 to 11 spacetime dimensions, and I argue that 11d is the maximal spacetime dimension compatible with my assumptions. Remarkably, this classification reproduces the detailed particle and brane content of various string theory examples with 32, 16, and 8 supercharges. It also describes some examples where the assumptions I use are violated, suggesting that my assumptions can be relaxed and the scope of this classification can be expanded. It might also predict new branes. For instance, if heterotic string theory is described by this classification, then it must possess non-BPS branes with D-brane-like tensions. Similarly, if this classification applies to the Dark Dimension Scenario with an extra modulus, then it requires the existence of strings with tensions related to the cosmological constant by $T\lesssim \Lambda^{1/6}$ in 4d Planck units.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the butterfly velocity in holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study quantum chaos in a variety of holographic QCD models at finite temperature and chemical potentials. This includes the 1 R-Charge black hole (1RCBH) model, the 2 R-Charge black hole (2RCBH) model, a potential reconstruction-based analytic bottom-up model, and a numerical bottom-up model. All these models are different avatars of the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity action, distinguished by their specific choices of dilaton potentials and gauge-kinetic coupling functions. We focus on computing the chaos parameter, the butterfly velocity, using three distinct methods: entanglement wedge reconstruction, out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and pole-skipping. We show that all three methods yield identical results for the butterfly velocity across all the holographic QCD models considered, further establishing the equivalence between the three approaches. Furthermore, we analyze in detail the behavior of the butterfly velocity as a function of chemical potential and temperature. Interestingly, a universal trend emerges across all models: the butterfly velocity increases/decreases with temperature/chemical potential for thermodynamically stable phases. Additionally, in the high-temperature limit, the butterfly velocity in all models approaches that of the chargeless plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.</description>

Abstract: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the 2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or 10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties. For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian gauge Higgs theories</title>

Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality. Effective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge modes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard critical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. We discuss the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems with a classical partition function, focusing mainly on three-dimensional systems, and only briefly discussing two-dimensional models. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Wreath Macdonald polynomials, quiver varieties, and quasimap counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical.</description>

      <title>On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.</description>

      <title>Friedmann-Lema\^itre universes and their metamorphoses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of the Friedmann-Lema\^itre universes taking into account the different roles played by the fluid parameter and the cosmological constant, as well as the degenerate character of the equations. We find that the Friedmann-Lema\^itre system reduces to four qualitatively inequivalent normal forms and write down the sets of all stable perturbations that may result (the `versal unfoldings'). These sets are of small codimension up to three. We then describe all possible parameter-dependent solutions and their transfigurations to other forms during evolution through the bifurcation sets, these are also fully described. This analysis leads to a picture of cosmological evolution determined by new parameters related to codimension which are zero in standard cosmology. The emerging versal solutions are all free of singularities, while other properties of them are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral decomposition with respect to the wave functions of Ruijsenaars hyperbolic system defines an integral transform, which generalizes classical Fourier integral. For a certain class of analytical symmetric functions we prove inversion formula and orthogonality relations, valid for complex valued parameters of the system. Besides, we study four regimes of unitarity, when this transform defines isomorphisms of the corresponding $L_2$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermal phase structure of the Berenstein--Maldacena--Nastase (BMN) matrix model using non-perturbative lattice Monte Carlo calculations. Our main analyses span three orders of magnitude in the coupling, involving systems with sizes up to $N_{\tau} = 24$ lattice sites and SU($N$) gauge groups with $8 \leq N \leq 16$. In addition, we carry out extended checks of discretization artifacts for $N_{\tau} \leq 128$ and gauge group SU(4). We find results for the deconfinement temperature that interpolate between the perturbative prediction at weak coupling and the large-$N$ dual supergravity calculation at strong coupling. While we confirm that the phase transition is first order for strong coupling, it appears to be continuous for weaker couplings.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the Search for New Physics in Pulsar Timing Data and the Case of Kination-amplified Gravitational-wave Background from Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>
