      <title>UniOTalign: A Global Matching Framework for Protein Alignment via Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein sequence alignment is a cornerstone of bioinformatics, traditionally approached using dynamic programming (DP) algorithms that find an optimal sequential path. This paper introduces UniOTalign, a novel framework that recasts alignment from a fundamentally different perspective: global matching via Optimal Transport (OT). Instead of finding a path, UniOTalign computes an optimal flow or transport plan between two proteins, which are represented as distributions of residues in a high-dimensional feature space. We leverage pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) to generate rich, context-aware embeddings for each residue. The core of our method is the Fused Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (FUGW) distance, which finds a correspondence that simultaneously minimizes feature dissimilarity and preserves the internal geometric structure of the sequences. This approach naturally handles sequences of different lengths and is particularly powerful for aligning proteins with nonsequential similarities, such as domain shuffling or circular permutations, which are challenging for traditional DP methods. UniOTalign therefore offers a new, mathematically principled, global matching paradigm for protein alignment, moving beyond the limitations of path-finding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Novel point cloud registration approach for noninvasive patient specific estimation of leaflet strain from 3D images of heart valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Valvular heart disease is prevalent and a major contributor to heart failure. Valve leaflet strain is a promising metric for evaluating the mechanics underlying the initiation and progression of valvular pathology. However, robust and generalizable methods for noninvasively quantifying valvular strain from clinically acquired patient images remain limited. In this work, we present a novel feature-tracking framework for quantifying leaflet strain in atrioventricular valves using 3D echocardiographic images of pediatric and adult patients. Our method demonstrated superior accuracy in the assessment of anatomical deformation and strain of heart valves compared to other point-based approaches, as verified against a finite element benchmark. Further, our approach can robustly track inter-phase deformation of valves across highly variable morphologies without parameter tuning. Our analysis revealed that a median and interquartile range of the 1st principal strain greater than 0.5 is associated with leaflet billow (prolapse). Further investigation of the biomechanical signatures of heart valve disease has the potential to enhance prognostic assessment and longitudinal evaluation of valvular disease.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Profiles for Protein Fitness Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the fitness impact of mutations is central to protein engineering but constrained by limited assays relative to the size of sequence space. Protein language models (pLMs) trained with masked language modeling (MLM) exhibit strong zero-shot fitness prediction; we provide a unifying view by interpreting natural evolution as implicit reward maximization and MLM as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), in which extant sequences act as expert demonstrations and pLM log-odds serve as fitness estimates. Building on this perspective, we introduce EvoIF, a lightweight model that integrates two complementary sources of evolutionary signal: (i) within-family profiles from retrieved homologs and (ii) cross-family structural-evolutionary constraints distilled from inverse folding logits. EvoIF fuses sequence-structure representations with these profiles via a compact transition block, yielding calibrated probabilities for log-odds scoring. On ProteinGym (217 mutational assays; &gt;2.5M mutants), EvoIF and its MSA-enabled variant achieve state-of-the-art or competitive performance while using only 0.15% of the training data and fewer parameters than recent large models. Ablations confirm that within-family and cross-family profiles are complementary, improving robustness across function types, MSA depths, taxa, and mutation depths. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/aim-uofa/EvoIF.</description>

      <title>The Multivariate SEM-PGS Model: Using Polygenic Scores to Investigate Cross-Trait Genetic Nurture and Assortative Mating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genetic nurture effects and assortative mating (AM) occur across many human behaviors and can bias estimates from traditional genetic models. These influences are typically studied univariately, within the same trait. However, estimation of cross-trait genetic nurture effects and cross-trait AM remains underexplored due to the absence of suitable approaches. To address this, we developed a multivariate extension of the SEM-PGS model for datasets with genotyped and phenotyped parents and offspring, enabling joint estimation of within-trait and cross-trait genetic and environmental influences. By integrating haplotypic polygenic scores (PGS) into a structural equation modeling framework, the model simultaneously estimates same-trait and cross-trait direct effects, genetic nurture, vertical transmission, and assortative mating. We also provide the first formal description of how copaths can be used to model multivariate assortative mating and derive the corresponding parameter expectations in matrix form. Forward-time Monte Carlo simulations under varying conditions of r^2_PGS and N_trio demonstrate that the model yields unbiased estimates of both within-trait and cross-trait effects when assumptions are met. The precision of estimates was adequate with large sample sizes (N_trio &gt; 16k) and improved as PGS predictive power increased. In addition, our simulation results show that failing to model cross-trait effects biases within-trait estimates, underscoring the importance of incorporating cross-trait effects. The multivariate SEM-PGS model offers a powerful and flexible tool for disentangling gene-environment interplay and advancing the understanding of familial influences on human traits.</description>

      <title>SafeProtein: Red-Teaming Framework and Benchmark for Protein Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/jigang-fan/SafeProtein.</description>

      <title>acia-workflows: Automated Single-cell Imaging Analysis for Scalable and Deep Learning-based Live-cell Imaging Analysis Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Live-cell imaging (LCI) technology enables the detailed spatio-temporal characterization of living cells at the single-cell level, which is critical for advancing research in the life sciences, from biomedical applications to bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However, these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support routine application in biological research. In this work, we present acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten application workflows is open source and publicly available at https://github.com/JuBiotech/acia-workflows.</description>
