      <title>Giant exoplanet composition: Why do the hydrogen-helium equation of state and interior structure matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Revealing the internal composition and structure of giant planets is fundamental for understanding planetary formation. However, the bulk composition can only be inferred through interior models. As a result, advancements in modelling aspects are essential to better characterise the interiors of giant planets. We investigate the effects of model assumptions such as the interior structure and the hydrogen-helium (H-He) equation of state (EOS) on the inferred interiors of giant exoplanets. We first assess these effects on a few test cases and compare H-He EOSs. We then calculate evolution models and infer the planetary bulk metallicity of 45 warm exoplanets, ranging from 0.1 to 10~$M_{\rm J}$. Planets with masses between about 0.2 and 0.6~$M_{\rm J}$ are most sensitive to the H-He EOS. Updating the H-He EOS reduces the inferred heavy-element mass, with an absolute difference in bulk metallicity of up to 13\%. Concentrating heavy elements in a core, rather than distributing them uniformly (and scaling opacities with metallicity), reduces the inferred metallicity (up to 17\%). The assumed internal structure, along with its effect on the envelope opacity, has the greatest effect on the inferred composition of massive planets ($M_{\rm p}&gt;4~M_{\rm J}$). For $M_{\rm p}&gt;0.6~M_{\rm J}$, the observational uncertainties on radii and ages lead to uncertainties in the inferred metallicity (up to 31\%) which are larger than the ones associated with the used H-He EOS and the assumed interior structure. However, for planets with $0.2&lt;M_{\rm p}&lt;0.6~M_{\rm J}$, the theoretical uncertainties are larger. Advancements in equations of state and our understanding of giant planet interior structures combined with accurate measurements of the planetary radius and age are crucial for characterising giant exoplanets.</description>

      <title>MANTA-Ray: Supercharging Speeds for Calculating the Optical Properties of Fractal Aggregates in the Long-Wavelength Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correctly modelling the absorptive properties of dust and haze particles is of great importance for determining the abundance of solid matter within protoplanetary disks and planetary atmospheres. Rigorous analyses such as the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) can be used to obtain accurate absorption cross-sections, but these require significant computing time and are often impractical to use in models. A simple analytical equation exists for spherical particles in the long-wavelength limit (where the wavelength is much larger than the size of the dust particle), but we demonstrate that this can significantly underestimate the absorption. This effect is found to depend strongly on refractive index, with values of m = 1 + 11i corresponding to an underestimate in absorption by a factor of 1,000. Here we present MANTA-Ray (Modified Absorption of Non-spherical Tiny Aggregates in the RAYleigh regime): a simple model that can calculate absorption efficiencies within 10-20% of the values predicted by DDA, but 10^(13) times faster. MANTA-Ray is very versatile and works for any wavelength and particle size in the long wavelength regime. It is also very flexible with regards to particle shape, and can correctly model structures ranging from long linear chains to tight compact clusters, composed of any material with refractive index 1+0.01i &lt; m &lt; 11+11i. The packaged model is provided as publicly-available code for use by the astrophysical community.</description>

      <title>Influence of Modeling Assumptions on the Inferred Dynamical State of Resonant Systems: A Case Study of the HD 45364 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary systems exhibiting mean-motion resonances (MMRs) offer unique opportunities to study the imprint of disk-induced migration on the orbital architectures of planetary systems. The HD 45364 system, discovered via the radial velocity (RV) method to host two giant planets in a 3:2 MMR, has been the subject of several studies attempting to reconstruct the system's orbital migration history based on its present-day resonant configuration. Recently, Li et al. (2022) called into question the system's residence in the 3:2 MMR based on a revised orbital solution derived from an expanded set of RV observations that extend the time baseline of the original discovery data by over a decade. However, we show that inferences about the planets' dynamical state with respect to the 3:2 MMR are sensitive to the particular prior assumptions adopted in the orbital modeling. Using $N$-body dynamical models, we show that orbital solutions constrained to reside deep in the 3:2 MMR fit the RV data with a similar quality to unconstrained orbital solutions. We conclude that the RV observations of HD 45364 are consistent with orbital configurations produced by smooth migration and resonance capture. We further show that past convergent orbital migration can reproduce the system's present-day orbital configuration provided that the ratio of migration to eccentricity damping timescales, $K$, was in the range $10\lesssim K \lesssim 175$. We also find that dynamical interactions in the system can break the usual mass-inclination degeneracy inherent to Keplerian models of RV observations and constrain the planets' absolute masses to within a factor of $\sim2$.</description>

      <title>PEPSI's non-detection of escaping hydrogen and metal lines adds to the enigma of WASP-12 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-12 b is an ultra-hot Jupiter (UHJ) of special interest for atmospheric studies since it is on an inspiraling orbit in an extreme environment of intense radiation and circumstellar gas. Previously claimed detections of active mass loss from this planet are controversial across the literature. To address this controversy, we obtain two new transit observations of WASP-12 b with the optical high-resolution PEPSI spectrograph on the Large Binocular Telescope. Contrary to previous work, we do not observe planetary H$\alpha$ absorption and rule out the amplitude of previously reported detections. Our non-detection may be limited by the sensitivity of our data or could indicate weaker mass loss than suggested by previous studies. We conduct injection-recovery experiments to place constraints on the radial extent of WASP-12 b's escaping atmosphere as probed by Balmer lines, but find that our data do not have the sensitivity to probe down to the planet's Roche Lobe. Using physically motivated models of atmospheric escape, we explore upper limit constraints on the planet's mass-loss rate and deem the data quality in the wavelength regime of Balmer lines insufficient to determine a physically meaningful constraint. We also conduct a spectral survey of other optical absorbers to trace atmospheric circulation but detect no additional absorption. We conclude that previous claims of H$\alpha$ absorption from the atmosphere of WASP-12 b should be reevaluated. Given the anticipated line strength of Balmer/optical features, observing the atmosphere of this faint target will require stacking more observations even with the largest telescope facilities available.</description>

      <title>Reassessing Sub-Neptune Structure, Radii, and Thermal Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel python-based 1D sub-Neptune evolution model that emphasizes the thermal evolution and potential solidification of the rock/iron core and the structure of the radiative atmosphere. This model explores planetary structure from the molten center to nbar pressure levels. Treating the radiative atmosphere is crucial for sub-Neptunes, due to the large scale height and low gravity, which contributes up to 40\% of their observed radius, especially for low-mass, highly irradiated planets. Consequently, we generically find that lower H/He mass fractions are needed to match a given planetary radius, compared to previous work. While the presence of metal-enrichment in the H/He layers (here modeled as 50$\times$ solar) does not substantially influence the size of the convective envelope, it notably reduces the transit radius by shrinking the radiative atmospheric scale height. Sub-Neptunes cool differently from terrestrial planets, with the rock/iron core's cooling rate limited by the envelope, leading to longer solidification timescales. Complete solidification of the silicate mantle by 10 Gyr is found only for planets with very low masses ($\leq 1M_\oplus$) and small H/He envelopes ($\leq$ 0.1\%). Dynamo action in sub-Neptune iron cores persists as long as the mantle surface remains molten, often exceeding 10 Gyr, and becomes sensitive to core thermal conductivity after solidification. We examine aspects of ''boil-off,'' which sets the maximum allowed H/He mass and planetary radius for subsequent evolution. The rock/iron's cooling energy moderately decreases the post-boil-off H/He mass fraction in planets with large atmospheric scale heights only.</description>

      <title>Near Earth stream decoherence revisited: the limits of orbital similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Orbital similarity measures, such as the D-values, have been extensively used in meteor science to identify meteoroid streams and associate meteorite falls with near-Earth objects (NEOs). However, the chaotic nature of near-Earth space challenges the long-term reliability of these measures for stream identification, and the increasing size of our fireball, meteorite fall, and NEO databases make random associations more common. Despite this, many researchers erroneously continue to use orbital similarity beyond its inherent limits.
  Aims. We aim to assess the statistical significance of using orbital similarity measures for identifying streams of meteoroids or asteroids and explore the implications of chaotic dynamics on the long-term coherence of these streams.
  Conclusions. The rapid decoherence of meteoroid streams and the chaotic dynamics of near-Earth orbits suggest that no reported stream or NEO associations of meteorites or fireballs are statistically significant according to orbital discriminates. Many are likely coincidental rather than indicative of a true physical link. However, several statistically significant clusters found within the NEO population are consistent with a tidal disruption formation. This contrast and lack of statistically significant associations amongst the impact datasets is likely due to the fireball databases being 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the NEO database and the higher intrinsic uncertainties of fireball observation derived orbits.</description>

      <title>A novel ephemeris model for Martian moons incorporating their free rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High precision ephemerides not only support space missions, but can also be used to study the origin and future of celestial bodies. In this paper, a coupled orbit rotation dynamics model that fully takes into account the rotation of the Martian moons is developed. Phobos and Deimos rotation are firstly described by Eulerian rotational equations, and integrated simultaneously with the orbital motion equations. Orbital and orientational parameters of Mars satellites were simultaneously obtained by numerical integration for the first time. In order to compare the differences between our newly developed model and the one now used in the ephemerides, we first reproduced and simulated the current model using our own parameters, and then fit it to the IMCCE ephemerides using least square procedures. The adjustment test simulations show Phobos and Deimos orbital differences between the refined model and the current model is no more than 300 meters and 125 meters, respectively. The orientation parameters are confirmed and the results are in good agreement with the IAU results. Moreover, we simulated two perturbations (main asteroids and mutual torques) which were not included in our refined model, and find that their effects on the orbits are completely negligible. As for the effect on rotation, we propose to take care of the role of mutual attraction in future models.</description>

      <title>A Unified, Physical Framework for Mean Motion Resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional approach to analyzing mean motion resonances is through canonical perturbation theory. While this is a powerful method, its generality leads to complicated combinations of variables that are challenging to interpret and require looking up numerical coefficients particular to every different resonance. In this paper we develop simpler scaling relations in the limit where orbits are closely spaced (period ratios $\lesssim 2$) and interplanetary interactions can be approximated by only considering the close-approaches each time the inner planet overtakes the outer at conjunction. We develop geometric arguments for several powerful results: (i) that $p$:$p-q$ MMRs of the same order $q$ are all rescaled versions of one another (ii) that the general case of two massive planets on closely spaced, eccentric, co-planar orbits can be approximately mapped onto the much simpler case of an eccentric test particle perturbed by a massive planet on a co-planar circular orbit and (iii) that while the effects of consecutive conjunctions add up coherently for first-order ($p$:$p-1$) MMRs, they partially cancel for $p$:$p-q$ MMRs with order $q&gt;1$, providing a physical explanation for why these higher order MMRs are weaker and can often be ignored. Finally, we provide simple expressions for the widths of MMRs and their associated oscillation frequencies that are universal to all closely spaced MMRs of a given order $q$, in the pendulum approximation.</description>

      <title>Depth Dependent Dynamics Explain the Equatorial Jet Difference Between Jupiter and Saturn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter's equatorial eastward zonal flows reach wind velocities of ~100 m/s, while on Saturn they are three times as strong and extend about twice as wide in latitude, despite the two planets being overall dynamically similar. Recent gravity measurements obtained by the Juno and Cassini spacecraft uncovered that the depth of zonal flows on Saturn is about three times greater than on Jupiter. Here we show, using 3D deep convection simulations, that the atmospheric depth is the determining factor controlling both the strength and latitudinal extent of the equatorial zonal flows, consistent with the measurements for both planets. We show that the atmospheric depth is proportional to the convectively driven eddy momentum flux, which controls the strength of the zonal flows. These results provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed differences in the equatorial regions of Jupiter and Saturn, and offer new understandings about the dynamics of gas giants beyond the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Planet-star interactions with precise transit timing. IV. Probing the regime of dynamical tides for GK host stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical studies show that stars of GK spectral types, with masses below 1.1 Sun mass, are depleted in hot Jupiters. This finding is evidence of tidal orbital decay during the main-sequence lifetime. Theoretical considerations show that in some configurations, the tidal energy dissipation can be boosted by non-linear effects in dynamical tides, which are wave-like responses to tidal forcing. To probe the regime of these dynamical tides in GK stars, we searched for orbital period shortening for 6 selected hot Jupiters in systems with 0.8-1 Sun mass host stars: HATS-18, HIP 65A, TrES-3, WASP-19, WASP-43, and WASP-173A. For the hot Jupiters of our sample, we analysed transit timing data sets based on mid-transit points homogeneously determined from observations performed with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite and high-quality data available in the literature. For the TrES-3 system, we also used new transit light curves we acquired with ground-based telescopes. The mid-transit times were searched for shortening of orbital periods through statistical testing of quadratic transit ephemerides. Theoretical predictions on the dissipation rate for dynamical tides were calculated under the regimes of internal gravity waves (IGWs) undergoing wave breaking (WB) in stellar centres and weak non-linear (WNL) wave-wave interactions in radiative layers. Stellar parameters of the host stars, such as mass and age, which were used in those computations, were homogeneously redetermined using evolutionary models with the Bayesian inference. We found that transit times follow the refined linear ephemerides for all ultra-hot Jupiters of our sample. Non-detection of orbital decay allowed us to place lower constraints on the tidal dissipation rates in those planet-star systems. In three systems, HATS-18, WASP-19, and WASP-43, we reject a scenario with total dissipation of IGWs. We conclude that...</description>

      <title>Discrete element simulations of self-gravitating rubble pile collisions: the effects of non-uniform particle size and rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel implementation of a soft sphere, discrete elements code to simulate the dynamics of self-gravitating granular materials. The code is used to study the outcome of sub-sonic collisions between self-gravitating rubble piles with masses ranging from $\sim6\times10^{21}$ to $\sim6\times10^{22}$ g. These masses are representative of asteroids and planetesimals in the $\sim100$~km range. We simulate rubble piles composed of a range of particle sizes and analyze the collisions outcome focusing on the properties of the largest surviving fragment. We successfully test and validate the code against previous results. The results of our study show that rubble piles formed by collision of two parent rubble piles do not maintain the same particle size distribution as their parents. Rubble piles formed in low velocity collisions are characterized by a larger fraction of large particles, while the largest fragments of high-velocity collisions show a significant decrease in their mean particle size. We ascribe this effect to the fact that large particles transmit most of the forces during the collisions. In addition, we find that the mass of the largest post-collision fragment does depend on the rotation of the colliding rubble piles. This effect is especially noticeable when the pre-collision spin axes are parallel with each other and perpendicular to the relative velocity. This finding can be particularly relevant for meter to kilometer sized bodies embedded in protostellar accretion disks, where viscous stresses can efficiently align the target and projectile spin axes.</description>

      <title>easyCHEM: A Python package for calculating chemical equilibrium abundances in exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For modeling the spectra of exoplanets one must know their atmospheric composition. This is necessary because the abundance of molecules, atoms, ions and condensates is needed to construct the total cross-section for the interaction between electro-magnetic radiation and matter. In addition, when solving for the temperature structure of an atmosphere the so-called adiabatic temperature gradient must be known, which describes the pressure-temperature dependence in convectively unstable regions well. Depending on the planetary properties, the composition and adiabatic gradients may be well described by equilibrium chemistry, which means that chemical reactions occur faster than any other relevant processes in the atmosphere, such as mixing. What is more, the equilibrium assumption often serves as a useful starting point for non-equilibrium calculations. Efficient and easy-to-use codes for determining equilibrium abundances are therefore needed. Here we report on our easyCHEM Python package that calculates atmospheric compositions and adiabatic temperature gradients in chemical equilibrium for any user-specified elemental composition.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Atmospheric Retrieval of Exoplanets: Where Reliability meets Adaptive Noise Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring atmospheric properties of exoplanets from observed spectra is key to understanding their formation, evolution, and habitability. Since traditional Bayesian approaches to atmospheric retrieval (e.g., nested sampling) are computationally expensive, a growing number of machine learning (ML) methods such as neural posterior estimation (NPE) have been proposed. We seek to make ML-based atmospheric retrieval (1) more reliable and accurate with verified results, and (2) more flexible with respect to the underlying neural networks and the choice of the assumed noise models. First, we adopt flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) as a new ML approach to atmospheric retrieval. FMPE maintains many advantages of NPE, but provides greater architectural flexibility and scalability. Second, we use importance sampling (IS) to verify and correct ML results, and to compute an estimate of the Bayesian evidence. Third, we condition our ML models on the assumed noise level of a spectrum (i.e., error bars), thus making them adaptable to different noise models. Both our noise level-conditional FMPE and NPE models perform on par with nested sampling across a range of noise levels when tested on simulated data. FMPE trains about 3 times faster than NPE and yields higher IS efficiencies. IS successfully corrects inaccurate ML results, identifies model failures via low efficiencies, and provides accurate estimates of the Bayesian evidence. FMPE is a powerful alternative to NPE for fast, amortized, and parallelizable atmospheric retrieval. IS can verify results, thus helping to build confidence in ML-based approaches, while also facilitating model comparison via the evidence ratio. Noise level conditioning allows design studies for future instruments to be scaled up, for example, in terms of the range of signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>Organic compounds in metallic hydrogen</title>

Abstract: Metallic hydrogen is the most common condensed material in the universe, comprising the centre of gas giant planets. However, experimental studies are extremely challenging, and most of our understanding of this material has been led by theory. Chemistry in this environment has not been probed experimentally, so here we examine hydrocarbon chemistry in metallic hydrogen using density functional theory calculations. We find that carbon and oxygen react with metallic hydrogen to produce an entirely new type of hydrocarbon chemistry based on sixfold coordinated carbon with organic-style molecules CH6, C2H8, C3H10 OH3 NH4 and CH4OH. These are charged molecules stabilised by the metallic environment. Their associated electric fields are screened, giving oscillation in the surrounding electron and proton densities. In view of the excess hydrogen we refer to them as hypermethane, hyperethane etc. The relationship to traditional chemistry is that the metallic background acts as an electron donor and stabilizes negatively charged ions. This enables the formation of six covalent bonds per carbon atom, or three per oxygen atom. This demonstrates that organic chemistry may take place in very different environments from those found on earth, and may be common throughout the universe.</description>

      <title>Laboratory characterisation bench for high precision astrometry</title>

Abstract: High precision differential astrometry assesses the positions, distances, and motions of celestial objects in relation to the stars. The focal plane of such space telescope must be calibrated with a precision down to the level of 1e-5 pixel in order to be able to detect Earth-like planets in the close vicinity of the Sun. The presented characterization bench is designed to improve the technology readiness level for the following key points: calibration of new detectors with a high number of pixels and correcting the field distortion using stars in the field of view. The first aim of the project concentrates on the characterization of a 46 megapixels sensor from PYXALIS, to assess its typical parameters using an integrating sphere. The next objective intends to map the intra and extra pixel quantum yield of the detector with a precision of 1e-5 pixels and investigate the evolution of the pixel geometry in response to environment fluctuations. To conduct these tests, an optical bench is designed with an LCD screen and a doublet, used as a source that allows directing light to specific groups of pixels. Interferometric calibration of the detector pixel centroid position will be achieved using fibers that illuminate the detector with Young's fringes. To characterize the distortion of the detector, a diaphragm will produce adjustable optical aberrations to be corrected and therefore change the source sensor positional relationship. The final step involves the simulation of a star's field, which will be imaged on the detector to assess optical quality.</description>

      <title>Kilometer-baseline interferometry: science drivers for the next generation instrument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared interferometry has seen a revolution over the last few years. The advent of GRAVITY+ is about to enable high-contrast observations, all-sky coverage and faint science up to K=21, with the implementation on 8m-class telescope of extreme adaptive optics, wide-field observations, and soon laser guide stars, following a long-term vision of technological and infrastructure development at VLTI. This major progress in sensitivity lift a fundamental limitation of infrared interferometry, namely the brightness temperature achievable with this technique down to milli-arcsecond resolution imaging. This change of paradigm is a crucial element for the expansion of current arrays to a facility up to one to ten kilometer baselines. Micro-arcsecond scales imaging in the infrared on thermal objects, reaching the highest angular resolution possible even compared to VLBI, could offer a unique window in observational astronomy for the next generation instrument.</description>

      <title>Weighing Single-lined Spectroscopic Binaries Using Tidal Effects on Radial Velocities: The Case of V723 Monocerotis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In single-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB1s) where flux variations due to tidal deformation of the primary star (ellipsoidal variations, EVs) are detected, the binary mass can be determined by combining EVs with the primary's radial velocity (RV) variations from orbital motion and information about the primary's radius. This method has been used for mass estimation in close binaries including X-ray systems, but it has been pointed out that contaminating light from sources other than the primary star could introduce systematic errors in the mass and inclination estimates. Here, we focus on the apparent RV variations caused by asymmetric distortion of the absorption lines of the tidally deformed primary star (tidal RV). Because this signal contains information equivalent to that from photometric EVs, it enables mass estimation of the binary system using only the primary star's absorption lines from high-resolution spectroscopic data, providing a potentially more robust approach against contaminating light. We apply the method to the binary system V723 Monocerotis, where both photometric EV and tidal RV signals are detected, and successfully determine the component masses using only the primary star's RVs and projected rotational velocity, without relying on absolute flux measurements or on stellar evolutionary models. The masses derived from the tidal RV model show a reasonable agreement with those obtained from EVs after carefully modeling the flux contamination from the secondary. This result demonstrates that tidal RVs provide a useful alternative means for mass estimation in SB1s.</description>

      <title>Infrared photometry with InGaAs detectors: First light with SPECULOOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the photometric performance of SPIRIT, a ground-based near-infrared InGaAs CMOS-based instrument (1280 by 1024 pixels, 12 micron pitch), using on-sky results from the SPECULOOS-Southern Observatory during 2022 - 2023. SPIRIT was specifically designed to optimise time-series photometric precision for observing late M and L type stars. To achieve this, a custom wide-pass filter (0.81 - 1.33 microns, zYJ ) was used, which was also designed to minimise the effects of atmospheric precipitable water vapour (PWV) variability on differential photometry. Additionally, SPIRIT was designed to be maintenance-free by eliminating the need for liquid nitrogen for cooling. We compared SPIRIT's performance with a deeply-depleted (2048 by 2048 pixels, 13.5 micron pitch) CCD-based instrument (using an I+z' filter, 0.7 - 1.1 microns) through simultaneous observations. For L type stars and cooler, SPIRIT exhibited better photometric noise performance compared to the CCD-based instrument. The custom filter also significantly minimised red noise in the observed light curves typically introduced by atmospheric PWV variability. In SPIRIT observations, the detector's read noise was the dominant limitation, although in some cases, we were limited by the lack of comparison stars.</description>

      <title>Bolometric Corrections for FU Ori Object Accretion Disk Luminosities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accretion luminosity of an FU Ori disk is a fundamental system parameter, but a challenging one to estimate for all but the most well-studied systems. FU Ori objects are dynamically evolving accretion disks, especially close in time to the outburst epoch. They have a complex multi-temperature disk structure that results in distinctly shaped, broad SEDs. Detailed spectroscopic analysis is required for simultaneous constraint on relevant physical parameters such as the central stellar mass, inner disk radius, disk inclination, and disk accretion rate. However, outbursting systems that are deeply embedded and/or distant may be limited to only photometric measurement, and over only a narrow range of wavelengths. The bolometric corrections necessary to estimate accretion luminosities are not straightforward, and in particular can not be adopted from existing literature on isotropically radiating stars. We present bolometric corrections specific to astrophysical accretion disks for a variety of filters in ongoing and upcoming all-sky surveys.</description>

      <title>Effects from different grades of stickiness between icy and silicate particles on carbon depletion in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth and other rocky bodies in the inner Solar System are significantly depleted in carbon compared to the Sun and interstellar medium (ISM) dust. Observations indicate that over half of carbon in the ISM and comets is in refractory forms, like amorphous hydrocarbons and complex organics, which can be building blocks of rocky bodies. While amorphous hydrocarbons are destroyed by photolysis and oxidation, radial transport of solid particles can limit carbon depletion, except when complex organics, which are less refractory, are the main carbon source. We aim to identify conditions for severe carbon depletion in the inner Solar System by introducing more realistic factors: differences in stickiness between icy and silicate particles, and high-temperature regions in the disk's upper optically-thin layer, which were not considered in previous studies. We perform a 3D Monte Carlo simulation of radial drift and turbulent diffusion in a steady accretion disk, incorporating ice evaporation/re-condensation, photolysis/oxidation of hydrocarbons in the upper layer, and pyrolysis of complex organics. Our results show that the carbon fraction drops by two orders of magnitude inside the snow line under two conditions: i) silicate particles are much less sticky than icy particles, leading to a rapid decline in icy pebble flux while silicates accumulate inside the snow line, and ii) high-temperature regions in the disk's upper layer stir silicate particles into UV-exposed areas. These conditions reproduce carbon depletion patterns consistent with observations and allow for diverse carbon fractions in rocky bodies. This diversity may explain the wide variation of metals in white dwarf photospheres and suggest different surface environments for rocky planets in habitable zones.</description>
