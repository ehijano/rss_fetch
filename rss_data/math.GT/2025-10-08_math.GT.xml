      <title>Combinatorial Characterizations and Branched Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A family of compact n-manifolds is locally combinatorially defined (LCD) if it can be specified by a finite number of local triangulations. We show that LCD is equivalent to the existence of a compact branched n-manifold W, such that the family is precisely those manifolds that immerse into W. In subsequent papers, the equivalence will be used to show that, for each of the eight Thurston geometries, the family of closed 3-manifolds admitting that geometry is LCD.</description>

      <title>Whitehead doubling, rank estimate and nonembeddability of contractible open manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a nontrivial knot. For each $n\in \mathbb{N}$, we prove that the rank of its $n$th iterated Whitehead doubled knot group $\pi_1(S^3 \setminus \operatorname{WD}^n(K))$ is bounded below by $n+1$. As an application, we show that there exist infinitely many non-homeomorphic contractible open $n$-manifolds ($n\geq 3$) which cannot embed in a compact, locally connected and locally 1-connected $n$-dimensional metric space.</description>

      <title>3-manifold polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a way to derive polynomial invariants of closed, orientable $3$-manifolds from Heegaard diagrams via cellularly embedded graphs. Given a Heegaard diagram of an irreducible $3$-manifold $M$, we associate a Heegaard graph $G\subset S$ on the Heegaard surface and restrict to those arising from minimal-genus splittings with a minimal number of vertices. We prove that, up to the natural equivalence of embedded graphs, only finitely many of such minimal Heegaard graphs occur for a fixed manifold. This finiteness enables the definition of $3$-manifold polynomials by evaluating embedded-graph polynomials on representatives of these classes.
  For lens spaces we show that the associated Heegaard graphs can be fully classified, and that this classification coincides with the classical one for $L(p,q)$. In this setting the Tutte, Penrose, and Bollob\'as-Riordan polynomials behave as invariants of lens spaces, and computational evidence suggests that they may in fact be complete invariants. For the Poincar\'e homology sphere we find that distinct minimal Heegaard diagrams yield coinciding ribbon-graph polynomials, opening the way to interesting conjectures about their discriminating power and the possibility of completeness for broader families of $3$-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bending map of a hyperbolic 3-manifold with boundary maps a geometrically hyperbolic metric to its bending measured geodesic lamination. We show that the bending map is proper. As a byproduct of the proof we show that the group of isotopy classes of homeomorphisms of M acts properly discontinuously on the set of doubly incompressible measured geodesic laminations.</description>

      <title>On knot detection via picture recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our goal is to one day take a photo of a knot and have a phone automatically recognize it. In this expository work, we explain a strategy to approximate this goal, using a mixture of modern machine learning methods (in particular convolutional neural networks and transformers for image recognition) and traditional algorithms (to compute quantum invariants like the Jones polynomial). We present simple baselines that predict crossing number directly from images, showing that even lightweight CNN and transformer architectures can recover meaningful structural information. The longer-term aim is to combine these perception modules with symbolic reconstruction into planar diagram (PD) codes, enabling downstream invariant computation for robust knot classification. This two-stage approach highlights the complementarity between machine learning, which handles noisy visual data, and invariants, which enforce rigorous topological distinctions.</description>

      <title>$\pi_1$ of trigonal loci of strata of abelian differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate locally closed subspaces of projectivized strata of abelian differentials which classify trigonal curves with canonical divisor a multiple of a trigonal divisor. We describe their orbifold structure using linear systems on Segre-Hirzebruch surfaces and obtain results for their orbifold fundamental groups.
  Most notable among these orbifolds is the connected component $\mathbf P\mathcal H^{ev}_4(6)$, the projectivisation of the space $\mathcal H^{ev}_4(6)$ of abelian differentials on non-hyperelliptic genus $4$ curves with a single zero of multiplicity 6 providing an even spin structure. Its orbifold fundamental group is identified with the quotient of the Artin group of type $E_8$ by its maximal central subgroup.</description>

      <title>Bonded braids and the Markov theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bonded knots arise naturally in topological protein modeling, where intramolecular interactions such as disulfide bridges stabilize folded configurations. These structures extend classical knot theory by incorporating embedded graphs, and have been formalized as bonded knots. In this paper, we develop the algebraic theory of bonded braids, introducing the bonded braid monoid in the topological and rigid settings, which encodes both classical braid crossings and (rigid) bonded connections. We prove bonded analogues of the Alexander and Markov theorems, establishing that every bonded knot arises as the closure of a bonded braid and that two bonded knots are equivalent if and only if their braid representatives are related by a finite sequence of algebraic (Markov-like) moves. In addition, we define the bonded Burau and reduced bonded Burau representations of the monoid, extending classical braid group representations to the bonded setting, and analyze their (non-)faithfulness in low dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the equality $\dTC(\Gamma)=\TC(\Gamma)$ for distributional topological complexity of torsion free hyperbolic and of torsion free nilpotent groups.
  For the distributional topological complexity of lens spaces we prove the inequality $\dTC(L^n_p)\le 2p-1$ and for the distributional LS-category the inequality $d\cat(L^n_p)\le p-1$ which turns into equality for prime $p$ and $n&gt;p$. We use these inequalities to bring counter-examples to the product formula for $d\cat$ and $\dTC$.</description>

      <title>Integrable measure equivalence rigidity of right-angled Artin groups via quasi-isometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a right-angled Artin group with $|\mathrm{Out}(G)|&lt;+\infty$. We prove that if a countable group $H$ with bounded torsion is measure equivalent to $G$, with an $L^1$-integrable measure equivalence cocycle towards $G$, then $H$ is finitely generated and quasi-isometric to $G$. In particular, through work of Kleiner and the second-named author, $H$ acts properly and cocompactly on a $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ cube complex which is quasi-isometric to $G$ and equivariantly projects to the right-angled building of $G$.
  As a consequence of work of the second-named author, we derive a superrigidity theorem in integrable measure equivalence for an infinite class of right-angled Artin groups, including those whose defining graph is an $n$-gon with $n\ge 5$. In contrast, we also prove that if a right-angled Artin group $G$ with $|\mathrm{Out}(G)|&lt;+\infty$ splits non-trivially as a product, then there does not exist any locally compact group which contains all groups $H$ that are $L^1$-measure equivalent to $G$ as lattices, even up to replacing $H$ by a finite-index subgroup and taking the quotient by a finite normal subgroup.</description>

      <title>Pointed Quandle Coloring Quivers of Linkoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, for a finite spectrum $X$, the Spanier-Whitehead duality isomorphism induces an isomorphism between the cohomological and homological Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequences. As an application, it follows that Poincar\'e duality for a Poincar\'e duality complex, which is oriented over a ring spectrum $E$, induces an isomorphism between the two spectral sequences.</description>

      <title>Canonical Reduction Systems in Artin-Tits groups of spherical type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the canonical reduction system of an element in an Artin-Tits group of spherical type, which generalizes the similar notion for braids (and mapping classes) introduced by Birman, Lubotzky and McCarthy. We show its basic properties, which coincide with those satisfied in braid groups, and we provide an algorithm to compute it. We improve the algorithm in the case of braid groups, and discuss its complexity in this case. As a necessary result for obtaining the general algorithm, we prove that the centralizers of positive powers of an element form a periodic sequence and we show how to compute its period.</description>
