      <title>Investigating the effects of QCD matter's electrical conductivity on charge dependent directed flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charge dependent directed flow is an important observable of electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate how the difference in charge dependent directed flows between protons and antiprotons is sensitive to the resistivity, inverse of quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity, over different collision centralities. Our model numerically solves the 3+1D relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) equations, assuming the electric conductivity to be a scalar. For this work, we focus on symmetric Au + Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We illustrate the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields in our model and connect that to the charge dependent directed flow results. Our results highlight the importance of modeling quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity for charge dependent observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Probing properties of nuclear spin-orbit interaction with nucleon spin polarization in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleon spin polarization perpendicular to the reaction plane ($P_y$) and along the beam direction ($P_z$) in Au+Au collisions at the beam energy of 100A MeV with different nuclear spin-orbit interactions has been studied based on a spin- and isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (SIBUU) transport model. While the spin polarization is weaker with a weaker nuclear spin-orbit coupling as intuitively expected, a density-dependent nuclear spin-orbit coupling enhances the $P_y$ at large rapidities and leads to a less negative or large $P_y$ at high transverse momenta. The difference in the $P_y$ of free neutrons and protons at midrapidities and at small transverse momenta is sensitive to the isospin dependence of the nuclear spin-orbit interaction. While the $P_z$ is also affected by the properties of nuclear spin-orbit interaction in some sense, the behavior of the $P_y$ serves as a good probe of the strength, density dependence, and isospin dependence of nuclear spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our contribution aims to celebrate the immeasurable contribution that Tom Kuo has provided to the understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei, and also of the infinite nuclear matter, in terms of the fundamental principles governing the realistic nuclear potential. The authors want to testify Tom Kuo's heritage and impact on their approach to the study of nuclear systems by reviewing some recent findings on the role of the two-body component of shell-model effective $\beta$-decay operators. The focus is spotted on the so-called Pauli-blocking effect, that plays a non-negligible role in nuclei characterized by a large number of valence nucleons.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of quadrupole-hexadecapole coupling in radium, thorium, uranium and plutonium isotopes with the Gogny energy density functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence and stability of static hexadecapole deformations as well as the impact in the development of dynamic deformation due to collective motion considering quadrupole-hexadecapole coupling are studied for a selected set of radium, thorium, uranium and plutonium isotopes, using the Gogny Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and Generator Coordinate Method frameworks. Sizable hexadecapole deformations are found to play a significant role in the ground and excited states of nuclei in the neighborhood of $^{238}$U. For each of the studied isotopic chains, it is shown that a region with small negative hexadecapole deformation, just below the neutron magic number $N =184$, remains stable once zero-point quadrupole-hexadecapole fluctuations are taken into account. A transition is predicted, with increasing mass number, from a regime in which the quadrupole and hexadecapole degrees of freedom are interwoven to a regime in which they are decoupled, accompanied by an enhanced shape coexistence in the more neutron-rich sectors of the isotopic chains. It is also shown, that quadrupole-hexadecapole configuration mixing brings a nontrivial additional correlation energy gain comparable to the quadrupole correlation energy itself.</description>

      <title>Nuclear size, electric monopole transitions, and the location of $0^+_2$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work addresses the isotopic shift of nuclear radii for the even-even $^{36-52}$Ca isotopes using the interacting boson model (IBM) that includes the mixing from normal and intruder configurations. We obtain a good agreement between the calculated and experimental data, particularly for the dip at $^{48}$Ca. A direct correlation between nuclear size and electric monopole transitions is established to compute the electric monopole transition strengths, $\rho^2(E0)$. We further study the isotopic shift for the even-even $^{32-46}$Ar and $^{44-50}$Ti isotopes.</description>

      <title>Collision energy dependence in heavy ion collisions from nonlinear QCD evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the effects of including the energy dependence determined from evolution equations within the color glass condensate framework on observables in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. This amounts to integrating the JIMWLK evolution equations into the IP-Glasma model, which is then coupled to viscous relativistic hydrodynamics. This methodology allows for a systematic representation of nuclei at specific Bjorken-$x$ values, which are probed at different center-of-mass energies of the collision and rapidities of final state particles. Comparing to the conventional IP-Glasma model, we find significant effects on multiplicity distributions and particle spectra, especially in smaller collision systems at the highest center of mass energies. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating nonlinear QCD evolution in the description of heavy ion collisions at varying center of mass energies, as the precise extraction of transport coefficients will be affected. This work establishes a robust framework for understanding the quark gluon plasma and nuclear structure at high energy, integrating small-$x$ physics into the initial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Establishing the vector-meson-exchange dominance for the short range interactions of light quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I give a brief comment on a recent study revealing the vector meson exchange (VME) dominant for the short range interactions between u/d quarks in the $NN$, $D_{03}$, and $D_{30}$ systems. The finding echoes nicely with an earlier study of hadron spectroscopy using a quark model with hidden local symmetry which also favors the VME dominant for the short range interactions of light quarks. The VME dominance for the short range interactions of light quarks gives a natural explanation of the empiric VME dominance for the interactions between hadrons containing light quarks.</description>

      <title>High-precision direct decay energy measurements of the electron-capture decay of $^{97}$Tc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct measurement of the ground-state-to-ground-state electron-capture decay $Q$ ($Q_{\rm EC}$) value of $^{97}$Tc has been conducted employing the high resolving power phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique with the double Penning trap mass spectrometer JYFLTRAP. The resulting $Q_{\rm EC}$ value for $^{97}$Tc is 324.82(21) keV, exhibiting a precision approximately 19 times higher than the value adopted in the newest Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020) and differing by 1.2$\sigma$. Furthermore, by combining this refined $Q$ value with nuclear energy-level data for the decay-daughter $^{97}$Mo, a potential ultra-low Q-value transition, possibly of allowed type, $^{97}$Tc (9/2$^{+}$, ground state) $\rightarrow$ $^{97}$Mo$^{*}$ (320(1) keV), was evaluated for future long-term neutrino-mass determination experiments. The ground-state-to-excited-state electron-capture decay $Q$ value ($Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$) of this transition was determined to be 4.8(10) keV, confirming it to be energetically allowed with a confidence level of exceeding 4$\sigma$. The captures of electrons occupying the L and higher shells for this transition are energetically allowed, giving a value of 2.0(10) keV for the closest distance of $Q^{*}_{\rm EC}$ to the allowed binding energy of the L1 shell. To predict partial half-lives and energy-release distributions for this transition, the atomic self-consistent many-electron Dirac--Hartree--Fock--Slater method and the nuclear shell model have been employed. Dominant correction terms such as exchange and overlap corrections, as well as shake-up and shake-off effects, were included in the final results. Moreover, the normalized distribution of released energy in the electron-capture decay of $^{97}$Tc to excited states of $^{97}$Mo, is compared with that of $^{163}$Ho, which is being used for electron-neutrino-mass determination.</description>

      <title>Chiral effective model of cold and dense two-color QCD: The linear sigma model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review is devoted to summarizing recent developments of the linear sigma model (LSM) in cold and dense two-color QCD (QC$_2$D), in which lattice simulations are straightforwardly applicable thanks to the disappearance of the sign problem. In QC$_2$D, both theoretical and numerical studies derive the presence of the so-called baryon superfluid phase at sufficiently large chemical potential ($\mu_q$), where diquark condensates govern the ground state. The hadron mass spectrum simulated in this phase shows that the mass of an iso-singlet ($I=0$) and $0^-$ state is remarkably reduced, but such a mode cannot be described by the chiral perturbation theory. Motivated by this fact, I invent the LSM constructed upon the linear representation of chiral symmetry, or more precisely the Pauli-G\"ursey symmetry. Then, it is shown that my LSM successfully reproduces the low-lying hadron mass spectrum in a broad range of $\mu_q$ simulated on the lattice. As applications of the LSM, topological susceptibility and sound velocity in cold and dense QC$_2$D are evaluated to compare with lattice results. Besides, generalized Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation and hardon mass spectrum in the presence of a diquark source are analyzed. I also introduce an extended version of the LSM incorporating spin-$1$ hadrons.</description>

      <title>Lattice perspectives on doubly heavy tetraquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doubly heavy tetraquarks have emerged as new probes to study the heavy hadron spectrum. With the experimental observation of the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{cc}^+$, they pose a unique opportunity to bring together efforts in experiment, phenomenology, and lattice QCD. In lattice calculations they are accessible as ground states, unlike hidden flavor tetraquarks, and this enables accurate determinations of the scattering parameters alongside the binding energies of these tetraquarks. Today, lattice calculations firmly predict $J^P=1^+$ $T_{bb}^{ud}$ and $T_{bb}^{us}$ as QCD bound states, while recent studies approaching the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{cc}^{ud}$ find it to be a virtual bound state at slightly non-physical input quark masses. Studies of the $J^P=1^+$ $T_{bc}^{ud}$ are ongoing and a new focus area. In light of these developments the evolution of this field until this point is reviewed. Emphasis is put on the methods in lattice spectroscopy that enable a robust evaluation of the lattice studies gathered. They are further reviewed towards their limitations and achievements. Current challenges and opportunities are discussed, including possibilities to approach the left-hand cut in the scattering analysis of the charm candidates and towards understanding the structure of those including two bottom quarks.</description>

Abstract: A five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein spacetime model is considered, with one extra compactified spatial dimension. The equation of state of an electrically neutral, zero-temperature Fermi gas with a repulsive linear potential is described. From the equation of state, the speed of sound squared is calculated and shown for different model parameters. Its properties are studied from lower energies up to the conformal limit.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, in ideal-spin hydrodynamics, the components of the spin tensor follow damped wave equations. The damping rate is related to nonlocal collisions of the particles in the fluid, which enter at first order in $\hbar$ in a semi-classical expansion. This rate provides an estimate for the timescale of spin equilibration and is computed by considering a system of spin-1/2 fermions interacting via a quartic self-interaction as well as via (screened) one-gluon exchange. It is found that the relaxation times of the components of the spin tensor can become very large compared to the usual dissipative timescales of the system. Our results suggest that the spin degrees of freedom in a heavy-ion collision may not be in equilibrium by the time of freeze-out, and thus should be treated dynamically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in predicting nuclear binding energies, leveraging their ability to decompose complex multi-parameter systems into simpler univariate functions. By utilizing data from the Atomic Mass Evaluation (AME2020) and incorporating features such as atomic number, neutron number, and shell effects, KANs achieved a significant lower root mean square error (0.26~MeV), surpassing traditional models. The symbolic regression analysis yielded simplified analytical expressions for binding energies, aligning with classical models like the liquid drop model and the Bethe-Weizs\"acker formula. These results highlight KANs' potential in enhancing the interpretability and understanding of nuclear phenomena, paving the way for future applications in nuclear physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopic study of the $ \Omega \alpha $ interaction in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-particle momentum correlation between the Omega-baryon ($\Omega$) and the $^{4}He (\alpha) $ in high-energy heavy ion collisions is explored.
  Such correlations as an alternative source of information can help us further understand the interaction between $ \Omega $ and nucleons (N).
  $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials in the single-folding potential approach are constructed by employing two different available $\Omega N $ interactions in $^{5}S_{2}$ channel, i.e, one is based on the (2 + 1)-flavor lattice QCD simulations near the physical point by the HAL QCD collaboration, and another is based on the meson exchanges with effective Lagrangian, where in the latter case coupled channels effect is considered.
  It is found that the correlation functions at small size source depends on the used potential model. This implicitly means that at high density nuclear medium, $ \Omega \alpha $ momentum correlation could drive the feature of $ \Omega N $ interactions.
  Moreover, by extracting the scattering length and the effective range from obtained $ \Omega\alpha $ potentials, the correlation functions are calculated within the Lednicky-Lyuboshits (LL) formalism.
  It is shown that since the $\Omega\alpha $ has large interaction range, the LL formula leads to different results at small source size.</description>

      <title>Imprints of high-density nuclear symmetry energy on the crustal fraction of neutron star moment of inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06238</link>

Abstract: The density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ remains the most uncertain aspect of the equation of state (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. Implications of observational crustal fraction of neutron star (NS) moment of inertia $\Delta I/I$ on the $E_{\rm sym}(\rho)$ are examined in the present work, utilizing an isospin-dependent parameterization of NS EOS. We find that symmetry energy parameters significantly influence the $\Delta I/I$, while the EOS of symmetric nuclear matter has a negligible effect. An increase in the slope $L$ and skewness $J_{\rm sym}$ of symmetry energy results in a larger $\Delta I/I$, whereas an increase in the curvature $K_{\rm sym}$ leads to a reduction in $\Delta I/I$. Additionally, we discuss the imprints of observational $\Delta I/I$ on the symmetry energy for NSs with masses of 1.0 M$_\odot$ or 1.4 M$_\odot$. Our results indicate that the $\Delta I/I$ has the potential to set a lower limit of symmetry energy at densities exceeding $3\rho_0$, particularly when $L$ is constrained to values less than $60$ MeV, thereby enhancing our understanding of supradense NS matter.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole-hexadecapole correlations in neutron-rich samarium and gadolinium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extensive study of quadrupole-hexadecapole correlation effects in even-even Sm and Gd isotopes with neutron number $N=88-106$. The calculations are performed in the framework of the Gogny energy density functional (EDF) with the D1S parametrization and the $sdg$ interacting boson model (IBM). The quadrupole-hexadecapole constrained self-consistent mean-field potential energy surface is mapped onto the expectation value of the $sdg$-boson Hamiltonian. This procedure determines the parameters of the $sdg$-IBM Hamiltonian microscopically. Calculated excitation energies and transition strengths are compared to the ones obtained with a simpler $sd$-IBM, as well as with the experimental data. The Gogny-EDF mapped $sdg$-IBM reproduces spectroscopic properties of the studied nuclei as reasonably as in the case of the previous $sdg$-boson mapping calculations that were based on the relativistic EDF, indicating that the axial quadrupole-hexadecapole method is sound regardless of whether relativistic or nonrelativistic EDF is employed. The mapped $sdg$-IBM improves some of the results in lighter Sm and Gd isotopes compared to the mapped $sd$-IBM, implying the existence of significant hexadecapole correlations in those nuclei. For those nuclei with $N \geq 94$, hexadecapole effects are minor, and the only significant difference between the two boson models can be found in the description of $E0$ monopole transitions.</description>

      <title>Exploring $ \Lambda{\text-} $ and $ \Xi{\text -}$triton correlation functions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $ \Lambda{\text -} $ and $ \Xi{\text -}$triton(t) momentum correlation functions, to be measured in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, are explored.
  Mainly, STAR detector acquired data provides an opportunity to explore the $ \Lambda t $ correlation function.
  The $ \Lambda t $ correlation functions are calculated using
  an isle-type and spin-averaged $ \Lambda t $ potential,
  also, its sensitivity to changes in potential strength has also been investigated.
  %
  Besides, even though there is no experimental data on the $ \Xi{\text -} $triton interaction yet,
  I constructed $\Xi t$ potentials based on the first principles HAL QCD and Nijmegen extended soft-core (ESC08c) model of spin- and isospin averaged $\Xi N$ interactions in single-folding potentials (SFP) approach. 
  Then, the $\Xi t$ correlation functions are calculated for these two modern potentials as well as for Nijmegen hard-core model D (NHC-D) $\Xi N$ potential.
  The numerical results predict that, with good measurement resolution, it might be possible to recognize different potentials with a correlation function at relatively small source sizes, i.e., $ R = 1-3 $ fm.</description>

      <title>Successful $\nu p$-process in neutrino-driven outflows in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of the solar system abundances of several proton-rich isotopes, especially $^{92,94}$Mo and $^{96,98}$Ru, has been an enduring mystery in nuclear astrophysics. An attractive proposal to solve this problem is the $\nu p$-process, which can operate in neutrino-driven outflows in a core-collapse supernova after the shock is launched. Years of detailed studies, however, have cast doubt over the ability of this process to generate sufficiently high absolute and relative amounts of various $p$-nuclei. The $\nu p$-process is also thought to be excluded by arguments based on the long-lived radionuclide $^{92}$Nb.Here, we present explicit calculations, in which both the abundance ratios and the absolute yields of the $p$-nuclei up to $A\lesssim 105$ are successfully reproduced, even when using the modern (medium enhanced) triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates. The process is also shown to produce the necessary amounts of $^{92}$Nb. The models are characterized by subsonic outflows and by the protoneutron star masses in the $\gtrsim 1.7 M_\odot$ range. This suggests that the Mo and Ru $p$-nuclides observed in the Solar System were made in CCSN explosions characterized by an extended accretion stage.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fluid Models of the Braginskii Type. Part 2. The Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00467v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper (Hunana et al. 2022) we have employed the Landau collisional operator together with the moment method of Grad and considered various generalizations of the Braginskii model, such as a multi-fluid formulation of the 21- and 22-moment models valid for general masses and temperatures, where all of the considered moments are described by their evolution equations (with fully non-linear left-hand-sides). Here we consider the same models, however, we employ the Boltzmann operator and calculate the collisional contributions via expressing them through the Chapman-Cowling collisional integrals. These ``integrals'' just represent a useful mathematical technique/notation introduced roughly 100 years ago, which (in the usual semi-linear approximation) allows one to postpone specifying the particular collisional process and finish all of the calculations with the Boltzmann operator. We thus consider multi-fluid 21- and 22-moment models which are valid for a large class of elastic collisional processes describable by the Boltzmann operator. Reduction into the 13-moment approximation recovers the models of Schunk and Burgers. We only focus on the particular cases of hard spheres, Coulomb collisions, purely repulsive inverse power force $|K|/r^\nu$ and attractive force $-|K|/r^\nu$ with repulsive rigid core (or potential $V(r)=\delta(r)- |c|/r^n$, so that the particles bounce from each other when they meet), but other cases can be found in the literature. In the Appendix, we introduce the Boltzmann operator in a way suitable for newcomers and we discuss a surprisingly simple recipe how to calculate the collisional contributions with analytic software.</description>

      <title>Partonic distribution functions and amplitudes using tensor network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Calculations of the parton distribution function (PDF) and distribution amplitude (DA) are highly relevant to core experimental programs as they provide non-perturbative inputs to inclusive and exclusive processes, respectively. Direct computation of the PDFs and DAs remains challenging because they are non-perturbative quantities defined as light-cone correlators of quark and gluon fields, and are therefore inherently time-dependent. In this work, we use a uniform quantum strategy based on tensor network simulation techniques to directly extract these hadronic quantities from first principles using the matrix product state of the hadrons in the same setup. We present exemplary numerical calculations with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in 1+1 dimensions and compare with available exact diagonalization and quantum circuit simulation results. Using tensor networks, we evaluate the PDF and DA at various strong couplings in the large-qubit limit, which is consistent with expectations at perturbative and non-relativistic limits.</description>
