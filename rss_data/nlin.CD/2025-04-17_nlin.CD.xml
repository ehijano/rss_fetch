      <title>The effect of timescale separation on the tipping window for chaotically forced systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tipping behaviour can occur when an equilibrium loses stability in response to a slowly varying parameter crossing a bifurcation threshold, or where noise drives a system from one attractor to another, or some combination of these effects. Similar behaviour can be expected when a multistable system is forced by a chaotic deterministic system rather than by noise. In this context, the chaotic tipping window was recently introduced and investigated for discrete-time dynamics. In this paper, we find tipping windows for continuous-time nonlinear systems forced by chaos. We characterise the tipping window in terms of forcing by unstable periodic orbits of the chaos, and we show how the location and structure of this window depend on the relative timescales between the forcing and the responding system. We illustrate this by finding tipping windows for two examples of coupled bistable ODEs forced with chaos. Additionally, we describe the dynamic tipping window in the setting of a changing system parameter.</description>

      <title>Revisiting multifunctionality in reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifunctionality is ubiquitous in biological neurons. Several studies have translated the concept to artificial neural networks as well. Recently, multifunctionality in reservoir computing (RC) has gained the widespread attention of researchers. Multistable dynamics of the reservoir can be configured to capture multiple tasks, each by one of the co-existing attractors. However, there are several limitations in the applicability of this approach. So far, multifunctional RC has been shown to be able to reconstruct different attractor climates only when the attractors are well separated in the phase space. We propose a more flexible reservoir computing scheme capable of multifunctioning beyond the earlier limitations. The proposed architecture holds striking similarity with the multifunctional biological neural networks and showcases superior performance. It is capable of learning multiple chaotic attractors with overlapping phase space. We successfully train the RC to achieve multifunctionality with wide range of tasks.</description>

      <title>Attractor-merging Crises and Intermittency in Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing can embed attractors into random neural networks (RNNs), generating a ``mirror'' of a target attractor because of its inherent symmetrical constraints. In these RNNs, we report that an attractor-merging crisis accompanied by intermittency emerges simply by adjusting the global parameter. We further reveal its underlying mechanism through a detailed analysis of the phase-space structure and demonstrate that this bifurcation scenario is intrinsic to a general class of RNNs, independent of training data.</description>

      <title>Chaos indicators for non-linear dynamics in circular particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The understanding of non-linear effects in circular storage rings and colliders based on superconducting magnets is a key issue for the luminosity the beam lifetime optimisation. A detailed analysis of the multidimensional phase space requires a large computing effort when many variants of the magnetic lattice, representing the realisation of magnetic errors or configurations for performance optimisation, have to be considered. Dynamic indicators for chaos detection have proven to be very effective in finding and distinguishing the weakly-chaotic regions of phase space where diffusion takes place and regions that remain stable over time scales in the order of multiple hours of continuous operation. This paper explores the use of advanced chaos indicators, including the Fast Lyapunov Indicator with Birkhoff weights and the Reverse Error Method, in realistic lattice models for the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Their convergence, predictive power, and potential to define a magnetic lattice quality factor linked to long-term dynamic aperture are assessed. The results demonstrate the efficiency of these indicators in identifying chaotic dynamics, offering valuable insights of these chaos indicators for optimising accelerator lattices with reduced computational cost compared to the classical approach based on CPU-demanding long-term tracking campaigns.</description>

      <title>Route to hyperchaos in quadratic optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperchaos is a qualitatively stronger form of chaos, in which several degrees of freedom contribute simultaneously to exponential divergence of small changes. A hyperchaotic dynamical system is therefore even more unpredictable than a chaotic one, and has a higher fractal dimension. While hyperchaos has been studied extensively over the last decades, only a few experimental systems are known to exhibit hyperchaotic dynamics. Here we introduce hyperchaos in the context of cavity optomechanics, in which light inside an optical resonator interacts with a suspended oscillating mass. We show that hyperchaos can arise in optomechanical systems with quadratic coupling and is well within reach of current experiments. We compute the two positive Lyapunov exponents, characteristic of hyperchaos, and independently verify the correlation dimension. We also identify a possible mechanism for the emergence of hyperchaos. As systems designed for high-precision measurements, optomechanical systems enable direct measurement of all four dynamical variables and therefore the full reconstruction of the hyperchaotic attractor. Our results may contribute to better understanding of nonlinear systems and the chaos-hyperchaos transition, and allow the study of hyperchaos in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Long-window tandem variational data assimilation methods for chaotic climate models tested with the Lorenz 63 system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03166v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 4D-variational data assimilation is applied to the Lorenz '63 model to introduce a new method for parameter estimation in chaotic climate models. The approach aims to optimise an Earth system model (ESM), for which no adjoint exists, by utilising the adjoint of a different, potentially simpler ESM. This relies on the synchronisation of the model to observed data. Dynamical state and parameter estimation (DSPE) is used to stabilise the tangent linear system by reducing all positive Lyapunov exponents to negative values, thereby improving parameter estimation by enabling long assimilation windows. The method introduces a second layer of synchronisation between the two models, with and without an adjoint, to facilitate linearisation around the trajectory of the model for which no adjoint exists. This is achieved by synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems, one with and the other without an adjoint model. Results are presented for an idealised case of identical, perfect models and for a more realistic case in which they differ from one another. If employed on a high-resolution ESM for which a coarse resolution adjoint exists, the method will save computational resources as only one forward run with the full high-resolution ESM per iteration is needed. It is demonstrated that there is negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the traditional optimisation of a full ESM with an adjoint. Stemming from this approach, it is shown that the synchronisation between two identical models can be used to filter noisy data in a dynamical way which reduces the parametric uncertainty of the optimised model by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.</description>

      <title>Chaotic advection in a steady three-dimensional MHD flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the 3D stationary flow of a weakly conducting fluid in a cubic cavity, driven by the Lorentz force created by two permanent magnets and a weak constant current. Our goal is to determine the conditions leading to efficient mixing within the cavity. The flow is composed of a large cell created by one side magnet, superposed to two cells created by a central magnet perpendicular to the first one. The overall structure of this flow, obtained here by solving the Stokes equations with Lorentz forcing, is similar to the tri-cellular model flow studied by Toussaint et. al. (Phys. Fluids. 7, 1995). Chaotic advection in this flow is analyzed by means of Poincar\'e sections, Lyapunov exponents and expansion entropies. In addition, we quantify the quality of mixing by computing contamination rates, homogeneity, as well as mixing times. We observe that, though individual vortices have poor mixing properties, the superposition of both flows creates chaotic streamlines and efficient mixing.</description>

      <title>Complex multiannual cycles of Mycoplasma pneumoniae: persistence and the role of stochasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The epidemiological dynamics of Mycoplasma pneumoniae are characterized by complex and poorly understood multiannual cycles, posing challenges for forecasting. Using Bayesian methods to fit a seasonally forced transmission model to long-term surveillance data from Denmark (1958-1995, 2010-2025), we investigate the mechanisms driving recurrent outbreaks of M. pneumoniae. The period of the multiannual cycles (predominantly approx. 5 years in Denmark) are explained as a consequence of the interaction of two time-scales in the system, one intrinsic and one extrinsic (seasonal). While it provides an excellent fit to shorter time series (a few decades), we find that the deterministic model eventually settles into an annual cycle, failing to reproduce the observed 4-5-year periodicity long-term. Upon further analysis, the system is found to exhibit transient chaos and thus high sensitivity to stochasticity. We show that environmental (but not purely demographic) stochasticity can sustain the multi-year cycles via stochastic resonance. The disruptive effects of COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) on M. pneumoniae circulation constitute a natural experiment on the effects of large perturbations. Consequently, the effects of NPIs are included in the model and medium-term predictions are explored. Our findings highlight the intrinsic sensitivity of M. pneumoniae dynamics to perturbations and interventions, underscoring the limitations of deterministic epidemic models for long-term prediction. More generally, our results emphasize the potential role of stochasticity as a driver of complex cycles across endemic and recurring pathogens.</description>
