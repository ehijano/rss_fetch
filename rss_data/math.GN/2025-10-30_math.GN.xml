      <title>An Elementary Expository Study: From Metric Spaces to Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric spaces are a fundamental component of mathematics and have a paramount importance as a framework for measuring distance. They can be found in many different branches of mathematics, such as analysis and topology. This paper offers an elementary exposition of metric spaces and their associated topologies. We start by recalling the basic axioms through which we understand a metric and examine various examples. The induced topology is next discussed with emphasis on open and closed sets, continuity and limits. In addition, we compare equivalent metric spaces and illustrate how different metrics can generate but the same topological structure. The presentation is designed to be easy to follow and accessible to undergraduate students, by combining classical definitions with illustrative examples that allow a deeper understanding of the aforementioned concepts.</description>

      <title>On Quasi-Modular Pseudometric Spaces and Asymmetric Uniformities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze quasi-modular pseudometric spaces: structures generated by left/right (generally non-symmetric) Luxemburg-type gauges coming from one-sided modulars. This relaxes symmetry in Chistyakov's modular metric setting and places it within the context of quasi-metrics and quasi-uniform spaces.
  We develop the basic theory: induced (quasi-)topologies and quasi-uniformities; unit-ball characterizations; and Cauchy notions tailored to asymmetry. We give criteria for completeness, precompactness, and compactness, and prove bicompletion results. A symmetrization principle relates the asymmetric gauges to a canonical modular space; under mild $\Delta_2/\nabla_2$-type hypotheses, symmetrized and bicomplete constructions agree.
  Categorically, we treat these spaces as Lawvere-enriched objects and describe symmetrization as a Kan-style construction in the enriched setting; the induced entourages admit an Isbell-style uniform interpretation.
  Applications cover weighted and generalized Orlicz models (including variable-exponent and double-phase growth), asymmetric function spaces built from positive/negative parts, and directed-graph energies with time-dependent costs. These examples yield modular Sobolev-type estimates and demonstrate fixed-point and stability principles for directional media. Overall, this setting unifies analytic, topological, and categorical perspectives for non-symmetric variational problems and provides practical criteria for compactness, duality, and well-posedness in asymmetric settings.</description>

      <title>Countable dense homogeneity in large products of Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a unified treatment of the countable dense homogeneity of products of Polish spaces, with a focus on uncountable products. Our main result states that a product of fewer than $\mathfrak{p}$ Polish spaces is countable dense homogeneous if the following conditions hold: (1) Each factor is strongly locally homogeneous, (2) Each factor is strongly $n$-homogeneous for every $n\in\omega$, (3) Every countable subset of the product can be brought in general position. For example, using the above theorem, one can show that $2^\kappa$, $\omega^\kappa$, $\mathbb{R}^\kappa$ and $[0,1]^\kappa$ are countable dense homogeneous for every infinite $\kappa &lt;\mathfrak{p}$ (these results are due to Stepr\={a}ns and Zhou, except for the one concerning $\omega^\kappa$). In fact, as a new application, we will show that every product of fewer than $\mathfrak{p}$ connected manifolds with boundary is countable dense homogeneous, provided that none or infinitely many of the boundaries are non-empty. This generalizes a result of Yang. Along the way, we will discuss and employ several results concerning the general position of countable sets. Finally, we will show that our main result and its corollaries are optimal.</description>

      <title>When the conformal dimension of a self-affine sponge of Lalley-Gatzouras type is zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that if a metric space is uniformly disconnected, then its conformal dimension is zero. First, we characterize when a self-affine sponge of Lalley-Gatzouras type is uniformly disconnected. Thanks to this characterization, we show that a self-affine sponge of Lalley-Gatzouras type has conformal dimension zero if and only if it is uniformly disconnected.</description>
