      <title>Efficiently preparing chiral states via fermionic cooling on bosonic quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient protocol for preparing low energy states of arbitrary fermionic Hamiltonians on a noisy bosonic quantum simulator. This procedure involves performing adiabatic cooling by coupling the target system with a simulated bath. The bath is periodically monitored in order to extract entropy from the system. By fermionizing the simulated target system and the bath together, we allow individual fermionic excitations of the system to coherently hop to the bath sites. In this way, we achieve a cooling rate linearly proportional to the density of these excitations, despite the fact that they are non-local in terms of the bosonic degrees of freedom of the hardware. In particular, we show that certain topological phases, such as the chiral (non-Abelian) phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model can be prepared efficiently using our protocol. We find that our protocol performs favorably in the presence of noise, making it suitable for execution on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties of the macroscopically degenerate tetramer-dimer phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.</description>

      <title>$Z_2$ flux binding to higher-spin impurities in the Kitaev spin liquid: mechanisms and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stabilizing $Z_2$ fluxes in Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) is crucial for both characterizing candidate materials and identifying Ising anyons. In this study, we investigate the effects of spin-$S$ magnetic impurities embedded in the spin-1/2 KSL. Utilizing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, we examine the impurity magnetization and ground-state flux sector with varying impurity coupling and spin size. Our findings reveal that impurity magnetization exhibits an integer/half-integer spin dependence, which aligns with analytical predictions, and a flux-sector transition from bound-flux to zero-flux occurs at low coupling strengths, independent of the impurity spin. Notably, for spin-3/2 impurities, we observe a reentrant bound-flux sector, which remains stable under magnetic fields. By introducing a minimal model based on Majorana fermions, we provide phenomenological explanations for the transitions. Our results suggest a novel way of binding a flux in KSLs, beyond the proposals of vacancies or Kondo impurities.</description>

      <title>(Pre-)Modern (Non-)Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note addresses the problem of constructing a proper bosonized description of the collective modes in strongly interacting (non-)Fermi liquids which is specific to two spatial dimensions. Although, in a mild form, this subtlety exists in the Fermi liquid as well, the discussion focuses on the effects of long-ranged and/or retarded interactions which can completely destroy the fermionic quasiparticles. The present analysis also provides a further insight into the nature and properties of the collective bosonic modes in such systems.</description>

      <title>Electronic correlations and spin frustration in the molecular conductors $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X probed by magnetic quantum oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered molecular conductors $\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X are a perfect experimental platform for studying the physics of the Mott transition and related exotic electronic states. In these materials, the subtle balance between various instabilities of the normal metallic state can be efficiently changed by applying a very moderate external pressure or by subtle chemical modifications, e.g. by a replacement of the insulating anion X$^{-}$, frequently referred to as ``chemical pressure''. A crucially important but still unsettled issue is an exact understanding of the influence of physical and chemical pressure on the electronic structure. Here, we use magnetic quantum oscillations to explore in a broad pressure range the behavior of the key parameters governing the Mott physics, the electronic correlation strength ratio $U/t$ and the spin frustration ratio $t'/t$ in two $\kappa$ salts, the ambient-pressure antiferromagnetic insulator with X = Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl and the ambient-pressure superconductor with X = Cu(NCS)$_2$. Our analysis shows that pressure effectively changes not only the conduction bandwidth but also the degree of spin frustration, thus weakening both the electronic correlation strength and the magnetic ordering instability. At the same time, we find that the replacement of the anion Cu[N(CN)$_2$]Cl$^-$ by Cu(NCS)$_2^-$ results in a significant increase of the frustration parameter $t'/t$, leaving the correlation strength essentially unchanged.</description>

      <title>Frustrated S = 1/2 Chains in One-Dimensional Correlated Metal Ti4MnBi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chains. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming it is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point separating two T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. The lack of magnetic order above 0.3 K results from these quantum critical fluctuations, potentially compounded by Kondo moment compensation. Ti4MnBi2 provides the first experimental evidence that 1D magnetism, previously the exclusive domain of insulators, persists in metallic systems with moderate correlations.</description>

      <title>Classification of spin-$1/2$ fermionic quantum spin liquids on the trillium lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fermionic quantum spin liquids (QSLs) on the three-dimensonal trillium lattice of corner-sharing triangles. We are motivated by recent experimental and theoretical investigations that have explored various classical and quantum spin liquid states on similar networks of triangular motifs with strong geometric frustration. Using the framework of Projective Symmetry Groups (PSG), we obtain a classification of all symmetric $\mathsf{Z}_2$ and $\mathsf{U}(1)$ QSLs on the trillium lattice. We find 2 $\mathsf{Z}_2$ spin-liquids, and a single $\mathsf{U}(1)$ spin-liquid which is proximate to one of the $\mathsf{Z}_2$ states. The small number of solutions reflects the constraints imposed by the two non-symmorphic symmetries in the space group of trillium. Using self-consistency conditions of the mean-field equations, we obtain the spinon band-structure and spin structure factors corresponding to these states. All three of our spin liquids are gapless at their saddle points: the $\mathsf{Z}_2$ QSLs are both nodal, while the $\mathsf{U}(1)$ case hosting a spinon Fermi surface. One of our $\mathsf{Z}_2$ spin liquids hosts a stable gapless nodal star, that is protected by projective symmetries against additions of further neighbour terms in the mean field ansatz. We comment on directions for further work.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tube Algebras, Symmetry-Resolved Partition Functions, and Twisted Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of generalized tube algebras which describe how finite, non-invertible global symmetries of bosonic 1+1d QFTs act on operators which sit at the intersection point of a collection of boundaries and interfaces. We develop a 2+1d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) picture of boundaries and interfaces which, among other things, allows us to deduce the representation theory of these algebras. In particular, we initiate the study of a character theory, echoing that of finite groups, and demonstrate how many representation-theoretic quantities can be expressed as partition functions of the SymTFT on various backgrounds, which in turn can be evaluated explicitly in terms of generalized half-linking numbers. We use this technology to explain how the torus and annulus partition functions of a 1+1d QFT can be refined with information about its symmetries. We are led to a vast generalization of Ishibashi states in CFT: to any multiplet of conformal boundary conditions which transform into each other under the action of a symmetry, we associate a collection of generalized Ishibashi states, in terms of which the twisted sector boundary states of the theory and all of its orbifolds can be obtained as linear combinations. We derive a generalized Verlinde formula involving the characters of the boundary tube algebra which ensures that our formulas for the twisted sector boundary states respect open-closed duality. Our approach does not rely on rationality or the existence of an extended chiral algebra; however, in the special case of a diagonal RCFT with chiral algebra $V$ and modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$, our formalism produces explicit closed-form expressions - in terms of the $F$-symbols and $R$-matrices of $\mathscr{C}$, and the characters of $V$ - for the twisted Cardy states, and the torus and annulus partition functions decorated by Verlinde lines.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry Resolution of Entanglement in CFT for Twisted and Anyonic sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A comprehensive symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy (EE) in $(1+1)$-d rational conformal field theories (RCFT) with categorical non-invertible symmetries is presented. This amounts to symmetry resolving the entanglement with respect to the generalized twisted and anyonic charge sectors of the theory. The anyonic sectors label the irreducible representations of a modular fusion category defining the symmetry and can be understood through the $(2+1)$-d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) that encodes the symmetry features of the CFT. Using this, we define the corresponding generalized boundary dependent charged moments necessary for the symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy, which is the main result of this work. Furthermore, contrary to the case of invertible symmetries, we observe the breakdown of entanglement equipartition between different charged sectors at the next-to-leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study properties of boundary conditions (BCs) in theories with categorical (or non-invertible) symmetries. We describe how the transformation properties, or (generalized) charges, of BCs are captured by topological BCs of Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), which is a topological field theory in one higher spacetime dimension. As an application of the SymTFT chracterization, we discuss the symmetry properties of boundary conditions for (1+1)d gapped and gapless phases. We provide a number of concrete examples in spacetime dimensions $d=2,3$. We furthermore expand the lattice description for (1+1)d anyon chains with categorical symmetries to include boundary conditions carrying arbitrary 1-charges under the symmetry.</description>

      <title>State Dependent Spread Complexity Dynamics in Many-Body Localization Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the Many-Body Localization (MBL) phase transition using the dynamics of spread complexity and inverse participation ratio in the Krylov space starting from different initial states. Our analysis of the disordered Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain unravels that the ergodic-to-MBL transition can be determined from the transition of the pre-saturation peak in the thermofield double state (TFD) spread complexity. On the other hand, if an initially ordered state or a superposition of a small number of such states is chosen, then the saturation value of spread complexity and Krylov inverse participation ratio (KIPR) can distinguish the ergodic phase from the integrable phases, with no sharp difference between the integrable phases. Interestingly, the distinction between the disorder-free integrable and the MBL integrable phase is established by the spread complexity study of random states chosen from unitary and orthogonal Haar ensembles. We also study the complexity dynamics by coupling the system to a bath, which shows distinctive profiles in different phases. A stretched exponential decay of KIPR is observed when the MBL system is connected to the bath, with the decay starting at an earlier time for a greater value of environmental dephasing. Our work sheds light on the efficacy of Krylov space dynamics in understanding phase transitions in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a framework for computing the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy for non-invertible symmetries in $1{+}1$d conformal field theories has been proposed by Saura-Bastida, Das, Sierra and Molina-Vilaplana [Phys. Rev. D109, 105026]. We revisit their theoretical setup, paying particular attention to possible contributions from the conformal boundary conditions imposed at the entangling surface -- a potential subtlety that was not addressed in the original proposal. We find that the presence of boundaries modifies the construction of projectors onto irreducible sectors, compared to what can be expected from a pure bulk approach. This is a direct consequence of the fusion algebra of non-invertible symmetries being different in the presence or absence of boundaries on which defects can end. We apply our formalism to the case of the Fibonacci category symmetry in the three-state Potts and tricritical Ising model and the Rep($S_3$) fusion category symmetry in the $SU(2)_4$ Wess-Zumino-Witten conformal field theory. We numerically corroborate our findings by simulating critical anyonic chains with these symmetries as a finite lattice substitute for the expected entanglement Hamiltonian. Our predictions for the symmetry-resolved entanglement for non-invertible symmetries seem to disagree with the recent work by Saura-Bastida et al.</description>

      <title>Nodeless superconductivity and topological nodal states in molybdenum carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orthorhombic molybdenum carbide superconductor with $T_c$ = 3.2 K was investigated by muon-spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements and by first-principle calculations. The low-temperature superfluid density, determined by transverse-field $\mu$SR, suggests a fully-gapped superconducting state in Mo$_2$C, with a zero-temperature gap $\Delta_0$ = 0.44 meV and a magnetic penetration depth $\lambda_0$ = 291 nm. The time-reversal symmetry is preserved in the superconducting state, as confirmed by the absence of an additional muon-spin relaxation in the zero-field $\mu$SR spectra. Band-structure calculations indicate that the density of states at the Fermi level is dominated by the Mo $4d$-orbitals, which are marginally hybridized with the C $2p$-orbitals over a wide energy range. The symmetry analysis confirms that, in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Mo$_2$C hosts twofold-degenerate nodal surfaces and fourfold-degenerate nodal lines. When considering SOC, the fourfold-degenerate nodal lines cross the Fermi level and contribute to the electronic properties. Our results suggest that, similarly to other phases of carbides, also the orthorhombic transition-metal carbides host topological nodal states and may be potential candidates for future studies of topological superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the thermodynamic properties of many-body quantum systems and their emergence from microscopic laws is a topic of great significance due to its profound fundamental implications and extensive practical applications. Recent advances in experimental techniques for controlling and preparing these systems have increased interest in this area, as they have the potential to drive the development of quantum technologies. In this study, we present a density-functional theory approach to extract detailed information about the statistics of work and the irreversible entropy associated with quantum quenches at finite temperature. Specifically, we demonstrate that these quantities can be expressed as functionals of thermal and out-of-equilibrium densities, which may serve as fundamental variables for understanding finite-temperature many-body processes. We, then, apply our method to the case of the inhomogeneous Hubbard model, showing that our density functional theory based approach can be usefully employed to unveil the distinctive roles of interaction and external potential on the thermodynamic properties of such a system.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in an intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of novel opportunities covering various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest important additions to the growing list of materials due to its unique triple-Q (3Q) ground state possessing topological characteristics. Careful bulk characterisations have shown the ground state of CoxTaS2 to be a rare 3Q tetrahedral structure for x less than 1/3. The uniqueness of this ground state arises from the dense real-space Berry curvature due to scalar spin chirality, giving rise to a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate that we can control this topological phase via gating. Using three kinds of CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we have established that we can cover the whole 3Q topological phase with ionic gating. This work reports a rare demonstration of electrical gating control of layered antiferromagnetic metal. More importantly, our work constitutes one of the first examples of the electrical control of the scalar spin chirality using antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <title>Nevanlinna Analytic Continuation for Migdal-Eliashberg Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a method to reconstruct real-frequency properties from analytically continued causal Green's functions within the framework of Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) theory for superconductivity. ME theory involves solving a set of coupled equations self-consistently in imaginary frequency space, but to obtain experimentally measurable properties like the spectral function and quasiparticle density of states, it is necessary to perform an analytic continuation to real frequency space. Traditionally, the ME Green's function is decomposed into three fundamental complex functions, which are analytically continued independently. However, these functions do not possess the causal properties of Green's functions, complicating or even preventing the application of standard methods such as Maximum Entropy. Our approach overcomes these challenges, enabling the use of various analytic continuation techniques that were previously impractical. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by combining it with Nevanlinna analytic continuation to achieve accurate real-frequency results for ME theory, which are directly comparable to experimental data, with applications highlighted for the superconductors MgB$_2$ and LaBeH$_8$.</description>

      <title>A Non-Invertible Symmetry-Resolved Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy Formula and Entanglement Entropy from the Boundary Tube Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a refined version of the Affleck-Ludwig-Cardy formula for a 1+1d conformal field theory, which controls the asymptotic density of high energy states on an interval transforming under a given representation of a non-invertible global symmetry. We use this to determine the universal leading and sub-leading contributions to the non-invertible symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of a single interval. As a concrete example, we show that the ground state entanglement Hamiltonian for a single interval in the critical double Ising model enjoys a Kac-Paljutkin $H_8$ Hopf algebra symmetry when the boundary conditions at the entanglement cuts are chosen to preserve the product of two Kramers-Wannier symmetries, and we present the corresponding symmetry-resolved entanglement entropies. Our analysis utilizes recent developments in symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform to simulate a number of exotic quantum ground states and phase transitions. To verify these capabilities numerically, we develop a versatile quantum Monte Carlo sampling technique which operates in the reduced Hilbert space generated by enforcing the constraint of a Rydberg blockade. We use the framework of stochastic series expansion and show that in the restricted space, the configuration space of operator strings can be understood as a hard rod gas in $d+1$ dimensions. We use this mapping to develop cluster algorithms which can be visualized as various non-local movements of rods. We study the efficiency of each of our updates individually and collectively. To elucidate the utility of the algorithm, we show that it can efficiently generate the phase diagram of a Rydberg atom array, to temperatures much smaller than all energy scales involved, on a Kagom\'e link lattice. This is of broad interest as the presence of a $Z_2$ spin liquid has been hypothesized recently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is extensive current interest about electronic topology in correlated settings. In strongly correlated systems, contours of Green's function zeros may develop in frequency-momentum space, and their role in correlated topology has increasingly been recognized. However, whether and how the zeros contribute to electronic properties is a matter of uncertainty. Here we address the issue in an exactly solvable model for Mott insulator. We show that the Green's function zeros contribute to several physically measurable correlation functions, in a way that does not run into inconsistencies. In particular, the physical properties remain robust to chemical potential variations up to the Mott gap as it should be based on general considerations. Our work sets the stage for further understandings on the rich interplay among topology, symmetry and strong correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While altermagnetic materials are characterized by a vanishing net magnetic moment, their symmetry in principle allows for the existence of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Here we introduce a model with altermagnetism in which the emergence of an AHE is driven by interactions. This model is grounded in a modified Kane-Mele framework with antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-spin correlations. Quantum Monte Carlo simulations show that the system undergoes a finite temperature phase transition governed by a primary AFM order parameter accompanied by a secondary one of Haldane type. The emergence of both orders turns the metallic state of the system, away from half-filling, to an altermagnet with a finite anomalous Hall conductivity. A mean field ansatz corroborates these results, which pave the way into the study of correlation induced altermagnets with finite Berry curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A promising route towards the realization of chiral spin liquids is the quantum melting of classically noncoplanar spin states via quantum fluctuations. In the classical realm, such noncoplanar orders can effectively be stabilized by interactions beyond nearest neighbors. Motivated by the recent synthesis of materials with a maple-leaf lattice geometry, we study the effect of cross-plaquette couplings on elementary Heisenberg antiferromagnets for this geometry (as well as their ferromagnetic counterparts). We find a rich spectrum of noncoplanar states, including a novel icosahedral order as well as incommensurate spin spirals, using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations in combination with a semi-analytical analysis. To inspect the potential quantum melting of these states, we analyze the quantum $S = 1/2$ variant of these models using pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group (pf-FRG) simulations. Notably, we indeed find extended parameter regimes lacking long-range magnetic order -- in regions classically occupied by noncoplanar orders -- which we putatively identify with the possible formation of chiral quantum spin liquids.</description>

Abstract: Precise algorithms capable of providing controlled solutions in the presence of strong interactions are transforming the landscape of quantum many-body physics. Particularly exciting breakthroughs are enabling the computation of non-zero temperature correlation functions. However, computational challenges arise due to constraints in resources and memory limitations, especially in scenarios involving complex Green's functions and lattice effects. Leveraging the principles of signal processing and data compression, this paper explores the wavelet decomposition as a versatile and efficient method for obtaining compact and resource-efficient representations of the many-body theory of interacting systems. The effectiveness of the wavelet decomposition is illustrated through its application to the representation of generalized susceptibilities and self-energies in a prototypical interacting fermionic system, namely the Hubbard model at half-filling in its atomic limit. These results are the first proof-of-principle application of the wavelet compression within the realm of many-body physics and demonstrate the potential of this wavelet-based compression scheme for understanding the physics of correlated electron systems.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities within a subsystem are non-local observables that provide unique insights into quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we explore the behaviors of bipartite charge (and spin) fluctuations across interaction-driven "metal-insulator transitions" out of Landau Fermi liquids. The "charge insulators" include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin-$1/2$ electrons). We find that charge fluctuations $F$ exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the phase transition: $F \sim L\log(L)$ in Landau Fermi liquids and $F \sim L$ in charge insulators, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem under bipartition. In the case of composite Fermi liquids (under certain conditions), we also identify a universal constant term $-f(\theta)|\sigma_{xy}|/(2\pi)$ arising when the subsystem geometry incorporates a sharp corner. Here, $f(\theta)$ represents a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ denotes the Hall conductivity. At the critical point of each example, provided the transition is continuous, we find that the leading-order scaling $F \sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\log(L)f(\theta)C_{\rho}/2$ with the same angle dependence $f(\theta)$. The universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is linked to the predicted universal longitudinal (and Hall) resistivity jump $\Delta\rho_{xx}$ (and $\Delta\rho_{xy}$) at the critical point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09050v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) at the filling factor with an even denominator, 5/2, occurs despite the expectation, due to the electron statistics, that the denominator must be an odd number. It is believed that the Cooper pairing of underlying quasiparticles, composite fermions (CFs), leads to the explanation of this effect. Such a state should have a Pfaffian form of the BCS wave function (due to the absence of spin) and non-Abelian statistics of possible vortex-like excitations (due to the $p$-wave nature of the pairing). Here we expose the origin of pairing by using the effective dipole representation of the problem and show that pairing is encoded in a Hamiltonian that describes the interaction of the charge density with dipoles i.e. the current of CFs. The necessary condition for the paired state to exist is the effective dipole physics at the Fermi level as a consequence of the non-trivial topology of the ideal band in which electrons live - a Landau level (LL); the paired state is a resolution of the unstable, critical behaviour characterized by the distancing of correlation hole with respect to electron (and thus dipole) at the Fermi level due to the topology. We describe analytically this deconfined critical point, at which deconfinement of Majorana neutral fermions takes place. In the presence of large, short-range repulsive interaction inside a LL, the critical behavior may be stabilized into a regularized Fermi-liquid-like (FLL) state, like the one that characterizes the physics in the lowest LL (LLL), but in general, for an interaction with slowly decaying pseudopotentials, the system is prone to pairing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform infrared magneto-spectroscopy of Landau level (LL) transitions in dual-gated bilayer graphene. At $\nu=4$ when the zeroth LL (octet) is filled, two resonances are observed indicating the opening of a gap. At $\nu=0$ when the octet is half-filled, multiple resonances disperse non-monotonically with increasing displacement field, $D$, perpendicular to the sheet, showing a phase transition at modest displacement fields from a canted anti-ferromagnet (CAFM) to the layer-polarized state, with a gap that opens linearly in $D$. When $D=0$ and $\nu$ is varied, resonances at $\pm\nu$ show an electron-hole asymmetry with multiple line splittings as the octet is progressively filled. The $\nu=4$ data show good agreement with predictions from a mean-field Hartree-Fock calculation when accounting for multiple tight-binding terms in a four-band model of bilayer graphene. However even by incorporating a valley interaction anisotropy tuned to the CAFM ground state, only partial agreement is found at $\nu=0$. Our results suggest additional physics is required to understand bilayer graphene at half-filling.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triple-Q density waves are commonly found in various materials, such as charge density waves in transition metal dichalcogenides and spin density waves (skyrmion crystals) in B20 compounds. Compared to single-Q density waves, triple-Q density waves possess an additional internal degree of freedom-a phase shift arising from the phase of the order parameters, in addition to the translations of the density waves. In this study, we systematically investigate the significant effects stemming from both triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters, with particular emphasis on potential phase shifts. We demonstrate that these phase shifts play a crucial role in influencing the interference effects of triple-Q density waves on electronic states. Due to such interference, the band geometry in the momentum space becomes nontrivial at the hot spots, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that the nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hedin's equations provide an elegant route to compute the exact one-body Green's function (or propagator) via the self-consistent iteration of a set of non-linear equations.
  Its first-order approximation, known as $GW$, corresponds to a resummation of ring diagrams and has shown to be extremely successful in physics and chemistry. Systematic improvement is possible, although challenging, via the introduction of vertex corrections.
  Considering anomalous propagators and an external pairing potential, we derive a new self-consistent set of closed equations equivalent to the famous Hedin equations but having as a first-order approximation the particle-particle (pp) $T$-matrix approximation where one performs a resummation of the ladder diagrams.
  This pp version of Hedin's equations offers a way to go systematically beyond the $T$-matrix approximation by accounting for low-order pp vertex corrections.</description>

      <title>Towards All Categorical Symmetries in 2+1 Dimensions</title>

Abstract: We investigate the most general gauging operations in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories with finite symmetry groups, which correspond to gapped boundary conditions in 3+1 dimensional Dijkgraaf-Witten theory. The classification is achieved by enumerating 2+1 dimensional oriented topological quantum field theories that cancel the 't Hooft anomaly associated with the symmetry. This framework is rigorously formulated using twisted crossed extensions of modular fusion categories and projective 3-representations. Additionally, we explore the resulting fusion 2-category symmetries and argue that this framework captures all possible categorical symmetries in 2+1 dimensional oriented field theories.</description>
