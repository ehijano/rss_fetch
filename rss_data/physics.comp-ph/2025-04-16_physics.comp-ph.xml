      <title>Permutation of Tensor-Train Cores for Computing Moments on Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor networks, particularly the tensor train (TT) format, have emerged as powerful tools for high-dimensional computations in physics and computer science. In solving coupled differential equations, such as those arising from stochastic differential equations (SDEs) via duality relations, ordering the TT cores significantly influences numerical accuracy. In this study, we first systematically investigate how different orderings of the TT cores affect the accuracy of computed moments using the duality relation in stochastic processes. Through numerical experiments on a two-body interaction model, we demonstrate that specific orderings of the TT cores yield lower relative errors, particularly when they align with the underlying interaction structure of the system. Motivated by these findings, we then propose a novel quantitative measure, $score$, which is defined based on an ordering of the TT cores and an SDE parameter set. While the score is independent of the accuracy of moments to compute by definition, we assess its effectiveness by evaluating the accuracy of computed moments. Our results indicate that orderings that minimize the score tend to yield higher accuracy. This study provides insights into optimizing orderings of the TT cores, which is essential for efficient and reliable high-dimensional simulations of stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>SWtools: A Python module implementing iterative solvers for soliton solutions of nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solitons are ubiquitous in nature and play a pivotal role in the structure and dynamics of solutions of nonlinear propagation equations. In many instances where solitons exist, analytical expressions of these special objects are not available. The presented software fills this gap, allowing users to numerically calculate soliton solutions for nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equations by iteratively solving an associated nonlinear eigenvalue problem. The package implements a range of methods, including the spectral renormalization method (SRM), and a relaxation method for the problem with additional normalization constraint (NSOM). We verify the implemented methods in terms of a problem for which an analytical soliton expression is available, and demonstrate the implemented functionality by numerical experiments for example problems in nonlinear optics and matter-wave solitons in quantum mechanics. The presented Python package is open-source and released under the MIT License in a publicly available software repository (https://github.com/omelchert/SWtools).</description>

      <title>Fundamental Limits of Characteristic Mode Slopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characteristic Mode analysis is a widely used technique in antenna design, providing insight into the fundamental electromagnetic properties of radiating structures. In this paper, we establish fundamental bounds on the slope of characteristic mode eigenvalues and angles, demonstrating that their rate of change is subject to fundamental constraints for all possible realizations within a given design region. These bounds are derived using the method of moments and reformulating the frequency derivative (slope) of the eigenvalue quantities as an optimization problem over the current distribution confined to the design region. The results reveal a direct analogy between these constraints and classical antenna Q-factors, highlighting the intrinsic limitations on modal evolution and their implications for bandwidth and miniaturization in antenna design. Moreover, by iteratively enforcing orthogonality among the modes the derived bounds can be tightened for higher-order modes, providing deeper insight into the number of simultaneous, usable modes and their associated degrees of freedom. These bounds provide a feasibility criterion for achievable modal behavior, offering insights that can guide the design process. Examples are given for various surface PEC structures.</description>

      <title>Generalizability of local neural operator: example for elastodynamic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local neural operator (LNO) conception has provided a feasible way for scientific computations. The LNO learns transient partial differential equations from random field samples, and then the pre-trained LNO solves practical problems on specific computational domains. For applications, we may ask: Are the training samples rich enough? To what extent can we trust the solutions obtained from pre-trained LNO models for unknown cases? The generalizability of LNO could answer these questions. Here, we propose to use two plain scalar features, the amplitude and wavenumber of the input functions, to indicate the richness of training samples and to evaluate the generalization error of pre-trained LNO. In elastodynamic practices, we find that isolated evolving wavenumber modes for Lam\'e-Navier equation caused the training dataset to lack mode diversity. By data supplementation and model fine-tuning targeting to the discovered lack modes, the pre-trained and fine-tuned LNO model solves Lamb problem correctly and efficiently. These results and the proposed generalization criteria provide a paradigm for LNO applications.</description>

      <title>A Navier-Stokes-Peridynamics hybrid algorithm for the coupling of compressible flows and fracturing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling and simulation of fluid-structure interactions are crucial to the success of aerospace engineering. This work addresses a novel hybrid algorithm that models the close coupling between compressible flows and deformable materials using a mesoscopic approach. Specifically, the high-speed flows are described by the gas-kinetic scheme, which is a robust Navier-Stokes alternative solver built on the molecular kinetic theory. The deformation, damage, and fracture of materials are depicted using the bond-based peridynamics, which serves as coarse-grained molecular dynamics to construct non-local extensions of classical continuum mechanics. The evolution of fluids and materials are closely coupled using the ghost-cell immersed boundary method. Within each time step, the solutions of flow and solid fields are updated simultaneously, and physics-driven boundary conditions are exchanged for each other via ghost cells. Extensive numerical experiments, including crack propagation in a pre-cracked plate, subsonic flow around the NACA0012 airfoil, supersonic flow around the circular cylinder, and shock wave impacting on the elastic panel, are performed to validate the algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate the unique advantages of current hybrid algorithm in solving fracture propagation induced by high-speed flows.</description>

      <title>Subspace Approximations to the Focused Transport Equation of Energetic Particles, I. The Standard Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fokker-Planck equation describing the transport of energetic particles interacting with turbulence is difficult to solve analytically. Numerical solutions are of course possible but they are not always useful for applications. In the past a subspace approximation was proposed which allows to compute important quantities such as the characteristic function as well as certain expectation values. This previous approach was applied to solve the one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation which contains only a pitch-angle scattering term. In the current paper we extend this approach in order to solve the Fokker-Planck equation with a focusing term. We employ two- and three-dimensional subspace approximations to achieve a pure analytical description of particle transport. Additionally, we show that with higher dimensions, the subspace method can be used as a hybrid analytical-numerical method which produces an accurate approximation. Although the latter approach does not lead to analytical results, it is much faster compared to pure numerical solutions of the considered transport equation.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Advances Towards a Realizable Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Quantum Lattice Boltzmann Method (QLBM) is one of the most promising approaches for realizing the potential of quantum computing in simulating computational fluid dynamics. Many recent works mostly focus on classical simulation, and rely on full state tomography. Several key algorithmic issues like observable readout, data encoding, and impractical circuit depth remain unsolved. As a result, these are not directly realizable on any quantum hardware. We present a series of novel algorithmic advances which allow us to implement the QLBM algorithm, for the first time, on a quantum computer. Hardware results for the time evolution of a 2D Gaussian initial density distribution subject to a uniform advection-diffusion field are presented. Furthermore, 3D simulation results are presented for particular non-uniform advection fields, devised so as to avoid the problem of diminishing probability of success due to repeated post-selection operations required for multiple timesteps. We demonstrate the evolution of an initial quantum state governed by the advection-diffusion equation, accounting for the iterative nature of the explicit QLBM algorithm. A tensor network encoding scheme is used to represent the initial condition supplied to the advection-diffusion equation, significantly reducing the two-qubit gate count affording a shorter circuit depth. Further reductions are made in the collision and streaming operators. Collectively, these advances give a path to realizing more practical, 2D and 3D QLBM applications with non-trivial velocity fields on quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>douka: A universal platform of data assimilation for materials modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large-scale, general-purpose data assimilation (DA) platform for materials modeling, douka, was developed and applied to nonlinear materials models. The platform demonstrated its effectiveness in estimating physical properties that cannot be directly obtained from observed data. DA was successfully performed using experimental images of oxygen evolution reaction at a water electrolysis electrode, enabling the estimation of oxygen gas injection velocity and bubble contact angle. Furthermore, large-scale ensemble DA was conducted on the supercomputer Fugaku, achieving state estimation with up to 8,192 ensemble members. The results confirmed that runtime scaling for the prediction step follows the weak scaling law, ensuring computational efficiency even with increased ensemble sizes. These findings highlight the potential of douka as a new approach for data-driven materials science, integrating experimental data with numerical simulation.</description>

      <title>Modeling liquid-mediated interactions for close-to-substrate magnetic microparticle transport in dynamic magnetic field landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the on-chip motion of magnetic particles in a microfluidic environment is key to realizing magnetic particle-based Lab-on-a-chip systems for medical diagnostics. In this work, a simulation model is established to quantify the trajectory of a single particle moving close to a polymer surface in a quiescent liquid. The simulations include hydrodynamic, magnetostatic, and Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. They are applied to particle motion driven by a dynamically changing magnetic field landscape created by engineered parallel-stripe magnetic domains superposed by a homogeneous, time-varying external magnetic field. The simulation model is adapted to experiments in terms of fluid-particle interactions with the magnetic field landscape approximated by analytic equations under the assumption of surface charges. Varying simulation parameters, we especially clarify the impact of liquid-mediated DLVO interactions, which are essential for diagnostic applications, on the 3D trajectory of the particle. A comparison to experimental results validates our simulation approach.</description>

      <title>Dynamical errors in machine learning forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11074v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machine learning forecasting, standard error metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) quantify discrepancies between predictions and target values. However, these metrics do not directly evaluate the physical and/or dynamical consistency of forecasts, an increasingly critical concern in scientific and engineering applications.
  Indeed, a fundamental yet often overlooked question is whether machine learning forecasts preserve the dynamical behavior of the underlying system. Addressing this issue is essential for assessing the fidelity of machine learning models and identifying potential failure modes, particularly in applications where maintaining correct dynamical behavior is crucial.
  In this work, we investigate the relationship between standard forecasting error metrics, such as MAE and MSE, and the dynamical properties of the underlying system. To achieve this goal, we use two recently developed dynamical indices: the instantaneous dimension ($d$), and the inverse persistence ($\theta$). Our results indicate that larger forecast errors -- e.g., higher MSE -- tend to occur in states with higher $d$ (higher complexity) and higher $\theta$ (lower persistence). To further assess dynamical consistency, we propose error metrics based on the dynamical indices that measure the discrepancy of the forecasted $d$ and $\theta$ versus their correct values. Leveraging these dynamical indices-based metrics, we analyze direct and recursive forecasting strategies for three canonical datasets -- Lorenz, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and Kolmogorov flow -- as well as a real-world weather forecasting task. Our findings reveal substantial distortions in dynamical properties in ML forecasts, especially for long forecast lead times or long recursive simulations, providing complementary information on ML forecast fidelity that can be used to improve ML models.</description>

      <title>A Quantum-Inspired Algorithm for Wave Simulation Using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient classical algorithm based on the construction of a unitary quantum circuit for simulating the Isotropic Wave Equation (IWE) in one, two, or three dimensions. Using an analogy with the massless Dirac equation, second order time and space derivatives in the IWE are reduced to first order, resulting in a Schr\"odinger equation of motion. Exact diagonalization of the unitary circuit in combination with Tensor Networks allows simulation of the wave equation with a resolution of $10^{13}$ grid points on a laptop. A method for encoding arbitrary analytical functions into diagonal Matrix Product Operators is employed to prepare and evolve a Matrix Product State (MPS) encoding the solution. Since the method relies on the Quantum Fourier Transform, which has been shown to generate small entanglement when applied to arbitrary MPSs, simulating the evolution of initial conditions with sufficiently low bond dimensions to high accuracy becomes highly efficient, up to the cost of Trotterized propagation and sampling of the wavefunction. We conclude by discussing possible extensions of the approach for carrying out Tensor Network simulations of other partial differential equations such as Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Influence of a Xenon interlayer on dissociative electron attachment to deuterated methane on a platinum substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of intercalating a xenon layer between a thin condensed CD4 film of two monolayers (ML) and a platinum surface on the dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The observed desorption results are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal the binding energies of various anionic and neutral species as a function of the xenon film thickness on the Pt (111) substrate. The theoretical results suggest that 6 ML of xenon are sufficient to diminish the surface effect, enabling physisorbed anionic fragments to desorb from the CD4 film. In contrast, 20 ML (approximately 10 nm) are experimentally necessary to achieve saturation in the desorption of D-. In addition, the presence of xenon layers enables the coupling of resonance states with Xe excited states, thereby inhibiting the electrons from returning to the metal. Aside from reducing surface interactions, the xenon interlayer significantly enhances DEA to CD4.</description>

Abstract: This works focuses on participation number -- a parameter that allows to quantitatively asses the level of kinetic energy localization. The author presents a clear way of deriving participation number in a continuous case without making any assumptions about the system, fluid or flow regime. Moreover, a method of computing participation number in discretized cases is discussed and verified against well known analytical solutions using three methods, in which one was used previously in research on fluid flow through porous media. A robust formula, that works for both uniform and nonuniform discretization grids is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of policy heterogeneity in enhancing the olfactory search capabilities of cooperative agent swarms operating in complex, real-world turbulent environments. Using odor fields from direct numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, we demonstrate that heterogeneous groups, with exploratory and exploitative agents, consistently outperform homogeneous swarms where the exploration-exploitation tradeoff is managed at the individual level. Our results reveal that policy diversity enables the group to reach the odor source more efficiently by mitigating the detrimental effects of spatial correlations in the signal. These findings provide new insights into collective search behavior in biological systems and offer promising strategies for the design of robust, bioinspired search algorithms in engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modulating the number of particles in a region is key to accurately capturing the nuances in compressible flows with Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). This paper details the implementation of a volume-based adaptive refinement and derefinement procedure, incorporating state-of-the-art features such as automatic local adaptivity and solution adaptivity. A shock-aware particle shifting procedure is introduced to regularize the particle distribution while preserving the integrity of shocks. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of shock-based solution adaptivity and shock-aware particle shifting in the literature. A wide variety of test problems, which involve flow in and around boundaries, are employed to highlight the utility of these adaptivity features in improving the results and in making simulations faster. For instance, the adaptive resolution procedure is shown to deliver an order of magnitude speedup. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the adaptivity procedure in resolving existing issues like errors due to interaction with differently spaced ghost particles at boundaries, formation of spot-like structures due to particle clumping, and poorly resolved low-density regions.

      <title>MLPs and KANs for data-driven learning in physical problems: A performance comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increasing interest in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by casting them as machine learning problems. Recently, there has been a spike in exploring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as an alternative to traditional neural networks represented by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While showing promise, their performance advantages in physics-based problems remain largely unexplored. Several critical questions persist: Can KANs capture complex physical dynamics and under what conditions might they outperform traditional architectures? In this work, we present a comparative study of KANs and MLPs for learning physical systems governed by PDEs. We assess their performance when applied in deep operator networks (DeepONet) and graph network-based simulators (GNS), and test them on physical problems that vary significantly in scale and complexity. Drawing inspiration from the Kolmogorov Representation Theorem, we examine the behavior of KANs and MLPs across shallow and deep network architectures. Our results reveal that although KANs do not consistently outperform MLPs when configured as deep neural networks, they demonstrate superior expressiveness in shallow network settings, significantly outpacing MLPs in accuracy over our test cases. This suggests that KANs are a promising choice, offering a balance of efficiency and accuracy in applications involving physical systems.</description>

      <title>KPROJ: A Program for Unfolding Electronic and Phononic Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10910v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.</description>

      <title>Air Quality Prediction with Physics-Guided Dual Neural ODEs in Open Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air pollution significantly threatens human health and ecosystems, necessitating effective air quality prediction to inform public policy. Traditional approaches are generally categorized into physics-based and data-driven models. Physics-based models usually struggle with high computational demands and closed-system assumptions, while data-driven models may overlook essential physical dynamics, confusing the capturing of spatiotemporal correlations. Although some physics-guided approaches combine the strengths of both models, they often face a mismatch between explicit physical equations and implicit learned representations. To address these challenges, we propose Air-DualODE, a novel physics-guided approach that integrates dual branches of Neural ODEs for air quality prediction. The first branch applies open-system physical equations to capture spatiotemporal dependencies for learning physics dynamics, while the second branch identifies the dependencies not addressed by the first in a fully data-driven way. These dual representations are temporally aligned and fused to enhance prediction accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that Air-DualODE achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting pollutant concentrations across various spatial scales, thereby offering a promising solution for real-world air quality challenges.</description>

      <title>Towards Monte Carlo based Full Spectrum Modeling of Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph presents advancements in Airborne Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (AGRS), a critical tool for emergency response to radiological incidents such as severe nuclear accidents or nuclear weapon detonations. Current AGRS calibration and data evaluation methods struggle to accurately quantify many radioactive materials expected in radiological emergencies, limiting the risk assessment and, hence, the effectiveness of emergency response actions. To address these limitations, this work introduces a full spectrum numerical modeling approach that features three key innovations: high-fidelity Monte Carlo simulations that combine an advanced scintillation physics model with detailed geometric representations of the aircraft and detector system; a surrogate model that replicates the Monte Carlo simulations with significantly reduced computation time; and a data evaluation methodology that leverages the surrogate model within a Bayesian inversion framework, enabling the quantification of arbitrarily complex gamma-ray fields. The methodology presented here, rigorously validated through laboratory and field measurements, achieves not only a significant improvement in accuracy and sensitivity over traditional methods but also substantially expands the operational capabilities of AGRS systems for both emergency response scenarios and geophysical surveys. These innovations lay the groundwork for establishing a new global standard for AGRS, ultimately supporting better-informed protective actions and reducing health risks during radiological emergencies.</description>

      <title>Re-anchoring Quantum Monte Carlo with Tensor-Train Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07194v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel algorithm for calculating the ground-state energy of quantum many-body systems by combining auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) with tensor-train sketching. In AFQMC, a good trial wavefunction to guide the random walk is crucial for improving the sampling efficiency and controlling the sign problem. Our proposed method iterates between determining a new trial wavefunction in the form of a tensor train, derived from the current walkers, and using this updated trial wavefunction to anchor the next phase of AFQMC. Numerical results demonstrate that the algorithm is highly accurate for large spin systems. The overlap between the estimated trial wavefunction and the ground-state wavefunction also achieves high fidelity. We additionally provide a convergence analysis, highlighting how an effective trial wavefunction can reduce the variance in the AFQMC energy estimation. From a complementary perspective, our algorithm also extends the reach of tensor-train methods for studying quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Characterization of local energy transfer in large-scale intermittent stratified turbulent flows via coarse graining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies based on simulations of the Boussinesq equations indicate that stratified turbulent flows can develop large-scale intermittency in the velocity and temperature fields, as detected in the atmosphere and oceans. In particular, emerging powerful vertical drafts were found to generate local turbulence, proving necessary for stratified flows to dissipate the energy as efficiently as homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. The existence of regions characterized by enhanced turbulence and dissipation, as observed, for instance, in the ocean, requires appropriate tools to assess how energy is transferred across the scales and at the same time locally in the physical space. After refining a classical space-filtering procedure, here we investigate the feedback of extreme vertical velocity drafts on energy transfer and exchanges in subdomains of simulations of stably stratified flows of geophysical interest. Our analysis shows that vertical drafts are indeed able to trigger upscale and downscale energy transfers, strengthening the coupling between kinetic and potential energies at certain scales, depending on the intensity of the local vertical velocity.</description>

      <title>A projection method for particle resampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13681v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle discretizations of partial differential equations are advantageous for high-dimensional kinetic models in phase space due to their better scalability than continuum approaches with respect to dimension. Complex processes collectively referred to as \textit{particle noise} hamper long-time simulations with particle methods. One approach to address this problem is particle mesh adaptivity or remapping, known as \textit{particle resampling}. This paper introduces a resampling method that projects particles to and from a (finite element) function space. The method is simple; using standard sparse linear algebra and finite element techniques, it can adapt to almost any set of new particle locations and preserves all moments up to the order of polynomial represented exactly by the continuum function space.
  This work is motivated by the Vlasov-Maxwell-Landau model of magnetized plasmas with up to six dimensions, $3X$ in physical space and $3V$ in velocity space, and is developed in the context of a $1X$ + $1V$ Vlasov-Poisson model of Landau damping with logically regular particle and continuum phase space grids. The evaluation codes are publicly available, along with the data and reproducibility artifacts, and developed in the PETSc numerical library (petsc.org).</description>

      <title>JanusDDG: A Thermodynamics-Compliant Model for Sequence-Based Protein Stability via Two-Fronts Multi-Head Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03278v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding how residue variations affect protein stability is crucial for designing functional proteins and deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying disease-related mutations. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.

      <title>Benchmarking vibrational spectra: 5000 accurate eigenstates of acetonitrile using tree tensor network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate vibrational spectra are essential for understanding how molecules behave, yet their computation remains challenging and benchmark data to reliably compare different methods are sparse. Here, we present high-accuracy eigenstate computations for the six-atom, 12-dimensional acetonitrile molecule, a prototypical, strongly coupled, anharmonic system. Using a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm with a tree-tensor-network-state (TTNS) ansatz, a refinement using TTNSs as basis set, and reliable procedures to estimate energy errors, we compute up to 5,000 vibrational states with error estimates below 0.0007 $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our analysis reveals that previous works underestimated the energy error by up to two orders of magnitude. Our data serve as a benchmark for future vibrational spectroscopy methods and our new method offers a path toward similarly precise computations of large, complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>What metric to optimize for suppressing instability in a Vlasov-Poisson system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing plasma dynamics is an important task in green energy generation via nuclear fusion. One common strategy is to introduce an external field to prevent the plasma distribution from developing turbulence. However, finding such external fields efficiently remains an open question, even for simplified models such as the Vlasov-Poisson (VP) system. In this work, we leverage two different approaches to build such fields: for the first approach, we use an analytical derivation of the dispersion relation of the VP system to find a range of reasonable fields that can potentially suppress instability, providing a qualitative suggestion. For the second approach, we leverage PDE-constrained optimization to obtain a locally optimal field using different loss functions. As the stability of the system can be characterized in several different ways, the objective functions need to be tailored accordingly. We show, through extensive numerical tests, that objective functions such as the relative entropy (KL divergence) and the $L^{2}$ norm result in a highly non-convex problem, rendering the global minimum difficult to find. However, we show that using the electric energy of the system as a loss function is advantageous, as it has a large convex basin close to the global minimum. Unfortunately, outside the basin, the electric energy landscape consists of unphysical flat local minima, thus rendering a good initial guess key for the overall convergence of the optimization problem, particularly for solvers with adaptive steps.</description>
