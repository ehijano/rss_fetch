      <title>Output correction factors in a 1.5 T magnetic field determined at the central axis and at the lateral dose maximum for five detectors using alanine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent literature, the output correction factor in a 1.5T magnetic field, kB,Q,Clin, were determined only for the central axis (CAX), including our last work. At an MR-linac, the determination of the CAX position relies on e.g. MV-imaging and is at small field sizes located at the penumbra, whereas the maximum of the lateral profile (MAX) position is directly measurable. This study determined kB,Q,Ratio - the influence of the magnetic field on the output correction factor without a magnetic field, kQ,Clin - and kB,Q,Clin for both CAX and MAX fully experimentally for two MR-optimized ionization chambers, their conventional counterparts, and a solid-state detector. Additionally, the uncertainty due to intra-type variation for tabulated kB,Q,Clin was estimated. Measurements were conducted using an experimental setup consisting of a mobile electromagnet positioned in front of a standard clinical linac (6MV, 1.5T). Intra-type variation for the solid-state detector was assessed using four detectors. The change of absorbed dose to water was determined with alanine. Within the uncertainty, no difference in kB,Q,Ratio was observed between the MR-optimized chambers and their conventional counterparts. For the solid-state detector, no difference between CAX and MAX was observed. For all detectors, kB,Q,Clin remained constant down to a field size of 3x3cm2. At smaller field sizes, for MAX and for all detectors, kB,Q,Ratio decreased linearly. The maximum intra-type variation standard uncertainty was 0.009 for the smallest field size, with and without a magnetic field. In summary, kB,Q,Ratio and kB,Q,Clin, including its uncertainty, was successfully determined for five detectors at both CAX and MAX. For ionization chambers, kB,Q,Clin is lower at MAX, whereas for the solid-state detector, it remains the same. For the tabulated correction factors uncertainty, intra-type variation must be considered.</description>

      <title>Fourier-based Inversion of Partial X-ray Transforms in $n$ Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two theorems describing analytic left-inverses of partial X-ray transforms. The first theorem concerns X-ray data collected with an arbitrary distribution of parallel projections; it contains a convolution-backprojection formula and a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is sufficient. The second theorem concerns X-ray data collected with a cone-beam; it contains a backprojection-convolution formula for recovering the transformed volume, provided the data is amenable to this method. The cone-beam method is usable for X-ray source point loci that are multidimensional and that adequately surround the reconstruction support; it supports data collected with a flat 2D detector of finite size.</description>

      <title>Data Standards in Audiology: A Mixed-Methods Exploration of Community Perspectives and Implementation Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: The purpose of this study was to explore options for data standardisation in audiology and document the global audiology community's current knowledge and views of data standards, explore their needs and preferences, and develop recommendations for data standardisation as a result.
  Design: A mixed-methods approach, combining a structured survey with an in-depth exploration of themes by experts during a special session on "Big Data and Data Standards in Audiology" at the 2024 Virtual Conference of Computational Audiology.
  Study Sample: The survey sample consisted of 82 members of the global audiology community; five experts joined the panel discussion.
  Results: Survey results emphasized the need for data standardisation in audiology aimed at facilitating research and improving patient care. Knowledge of existing initiatives was low: 38% were aware of initiatives. Yet, 90% envisioned contributing to them moving forward. The panel discussion explored emerging standardisation initiatives in audiology (OMOP, openEHR, HIMSA's Noah standard), challenges (e.g., data quality and privacy), and opportunities (e.g., conversion between approaches and synergies with other medical fields).
  Conclusions: The community support identified in this study could be leveraged to further develop standardisation initiatives for audiology, ensuring alignment between initiatives and with other medical fields.</description>

      <title>A Dataset and Toolkit for Multiparameter Cardiovascular Physiology Sensing on Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart rings offer a convenient way to continuously and unobtrusively monitor cardiovascular physiological signals. However, a gap remains between the ring hardware and reliable methods for estimating cardiovascular parameters, partly due to the lack of publicly available datasets and standardized analysis tools. In this work, we present $\tau$-Ring, the first open-source ring-based dataset designed for cardiovascular physiological sensing. The dataset comprises photoplethysmography signals (infrared and red channels) and 3-axis accelerometer data collected from two rings (reflective and transmissive optical paths), with 28.21 hours of raw data from 34 subjects across seven activities. $\tau$-Ring encompasses both stationary and motion scenarios, as well as stimulus-evoked abnormal physiological states, annotated with four ground-truth labels: heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Using our proposed RingTool toolkit, we evaluated three widely-used physics-based methods and four cutting-edge deep learning approaches. Our results show superior performance compared to commercial rings, achieving best MAE values of 5.18 BPM for heart rate, 2.98 BPM for respiratory rate, 3.22\% for oxygen saturation, and 13.33/7.56 mmHg for systolic/diastolic blood pressure estimation. The open-sourced dataset and toolkit aim to foster further research and community-driven advances in ring-based cardiovascular health sensing.</description>
