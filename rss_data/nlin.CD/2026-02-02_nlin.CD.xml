      <title>Analytical prediction of delayed Hopf bifurcations in a simplified stochastic model of reed musical instruments</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic behavior of a simplified single reed instrument model subject to a stochastic forcing of white noise type when one of its bifurcation parameters (the dimensionless blowing pressure) increases linearly over time and crosses the Hopf bifurcation point of its trivial equilibrium position. The stochastic slow dynamics of the model is first obtained by means of the stochastic averaging method. The resulting averaged system reduces to a non-autonomous one-dimensional It{\^o} stochastic differential equation governing the time evolution of the mouthpiece pressure amplitude. Under relevant approximations the latter is solved analytically treating separately cases where noise can be ignored and cases where it cannot. From that, two analytical expressions of the bifurcation parameter value for which the mouthpiece pressure amplitude gets its initial value back are deduced. These special values of the bifurcation parameter characterize the effective appearance of sound in the instrument and are called deterministic dynamic bifurcation point if the noise can be neglected and stochastic dynamic bifurcation point otherwise. Finally, for illustration and validation purposes, the analytical results are compared with direct numerical integration of the model in both deterministic and stochastic situations. In each considered case, a good agreement is observed between theoretical results and numerical simulations, which validates the proposed analysis.</description>

      <title>State Estimation Using Sparse DEIM and Recurrent Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (S-DEIM) was recently proposed for state estimation in dynamical systems when only a sparse subset of the state variables can be observed. The S-DEIM estimate involves a kernel vector whose optimal value is inferred through a data assimilation algorithm. This data assimilation step suffers from two drawbacks: (i) It requires the knowledge of the governing equations of the dynamical system, and (ii) It is not generally guaranteed to converge to the optimal kernel vector. To address these issues, here we introduce an equation-free S-DEIM framework that estimates the optimal kernel vector from sparse observational time series using recurrent neural networks (RNNs). We show that the recurrent architecture is necessary since the kernel vector cannot be estimated from instantaneous observations. But RNNs, which incorporate the past history of the observations in the learning process, lead to nearly optimal estimations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on three numerical examples with increasing degree of spatiotemporal complexity: a conceptual model of atmospheric flow known as the Lorenz-96 system, the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and the Rayleigh-Benard convection. In each case, the resulting S-DEIM estimates are satisfactory even when a relatively simple RNN architecture, namely the reservoir computing network, is used. More specifically, our RNN-based S-DEIM state estimations reduce the relative error between 42% and 58% when compared to Q-DEIM which ignores the kernel vector by setting it equal to zero.</description>
