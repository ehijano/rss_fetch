      <title>CHEX-MATE: the intracluster medium entropy distribution in the gravity-dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the entropy profiles of 32 very high mass ($M_{500}&gt;7.75\times10^{14}~M_{\odot}$) galaxy clusters (HIGHMz), selected from the CHEX-MATE sample, to study the intracluster medium (ICM) entropy distribution in a regime where non-gravitational effects are minimised. Using XMM-Newton measurements, we measure the entropy profiles up to ~$R_{500}$ for all objects. The scaled profiles exhibit large dispersion in the central regions, but converge rapidly to the expectation from pure gravitational collapse beyond the core. We quantify the correlation between the ICM morphological parameters and scaled entropy as a function of radius, showing that morphologically relaxed (disturbed) objects have low (high) central entropy. We compare our data to other observational samples, finding differences in normalisation which are linked to the average mass of the samples in question. We find that a weaker mass dependence than self-similar in the scaling (Am ~ -0.25) allows us to minimise the dispersion in the radial range [0.3-0.8]$R_{500}$ for clusters spanning over a decade in mass. The deviation from self-similarity is radially dependent and is more pronounced at small and intermediate radii than at $R_{500}$. We also investigate the distribution of central entropy $K_0$, finding no evidence for bimodality, and outer slopes $\alpha$, which peaks at ~1.1. Using weak lensing masses, we find indication for a small suppression of the scatter (~30%) beyond the core when using masses derived from Yx in the rescaling. Finally, we compare to recent cosmological numerical simulations from THE THREE HUNDRED and MACSIS, finding good agreement with our observational data. These results provide a robust observational benchmark in the gravity-dominated regime and will serve as a future reference for samples at lower mass, higher redshifts, and for ongoing work using cosmological numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Inflationary and Gravitational Wave Signatures of Small Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mounting evidence suggests that the semi-classical description of a black hole breaks down at the latest after losing an O(1) fraction of its mass. As a result, effects such as memory burden can slow down evaporation so that small primordial black holes (PBHs), in particular those in the mass range 10^6 g to 10^9 g, become viable dark matter candidates. In this paper, we investigate the production of PBHs from a prototype model of polynomial inflation with a non-minimal coupling to gravity. We show that a sufficiently small PBH mass alleviates any tension with CMB observations. Moreover, we develop efficient numerical procedures to identify model parameters and evolve Mukhanov-Sasaki modes to place bounds on the scalar-induced stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background. Whilst we identify some prospects for observation with future GW detectors, our results highlight the need to develop new experiments for high-frequency GW detection in the ~kHz to ~MHz range. Finally, we demonstrate that previously-used ans\"atze for modelling the power spectrum only yield a reliable approximation for the GW signal if some input from inflation is used.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytic estimate for the effective sound speed counterterm in the EFTofLSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Effective Field Theory of Large Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) has found tremendous success as a perturbative framework for the evolution of large scale structure, and it is now routinely used to compare theoretical predictions against cosmological observations. The model for the total matter field includes one nuisance parameter at 1-loop order, the effective sound speed, which can be extracted by matching the EFT to full N-body simulations. In this work we first leverage the Layzer-Irvine cosmic energy equation to show that the equation of state can be exactly computed with knowledge of the fully nonlinear power spectrum. When augmented with separate universe methods, we show one can estimate the effective sound speed. This estimate is in good agreement with simulation results, with errors at the few tens of percent level. We apply our method to investigate the cosmology dependence of the effective sound speed and to shed light on what cosmic structures shape its value.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group approaches to Quantum Gravity and Tensions in Modern Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymptotic Safety is a promising framework towards the understanding, in a non-perturbative way, of Quantum Gravity. It treats the Newton's constant G_N and the cosmological constant \Lambda as running coupling of an effective action. At the phenomenological point of view the values of G_N and \Lambda depend on the energy density of the system under consideration. This fact has interesting astrophysical and cosmological consequences. The present work discusses the effects on the distance measurements from SNIa light curves and on the strong and weak gravitational lensing measurements.</description>

      <title>BICEP/Keck XVIII: Measurement of BICEP3 polarization angles and consequences for constraining cosmic birefringence and inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a custom-made calibrator to measure individual detectors' polarization angles of BICEP3, a small aperture telescope observing the cosmic microwave background (CMB) at 95GHz from the South Pole. We describe our calibration strategy and the statistical and systematic uncertainties associated with the measurement. We reach an unprecedented precision for such measurement on a CMB experiment, with a repeatability for each detector pair of $0.02\deg$. We show that the relative angles measured using this method are in excellent agreement with those extracted from CMB data. Because the absolute measurement is currently limited by a systematic uncertainty, we do not derive cosmic birefringence constraints from BICEP3 data in this work. Rather, we forecast the sensitivity of BICEP3 sky maps for such analysis. We investigate the relative contributions of instrument noise, lensing, and dust, as well as astrophysical and instrumental systematics. We also explore the constraining power of different angle estimators, depending on analysis choices. We establish that the BICEP3 2-year dataset (2017--2018) has an on-sky sensitivity to the cosmic birefringence angle of $\sigma = 0.078\deg$, which could be improved to $\sigma = 0.055\deg$ by adding all of the existing BICEP3 data (through 2023). Furthermore, we emphasize the possibility of using the BICEP3 sky patch as a polarization calibration source for CMB experiments, which with the present data could reach a precision of $0.035\deg$. Finally, in the context of inflation searches, we investigate the impact of detector-to-detector variations in polarization angles as they may bias the tensor-to-scalar ratio r. We show that while the effect is expected to remain subdominant to other sources of systematic uncertainty, it can be reliably calibrated using polarization angle measurements such as the ones we present in this paper.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Static Black Holes in Effective Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate strong gravitational lensing by two static black hole models (Model-1 and Model-2) within the Effective Quantum Gravity (EQG) framework, characterized by mass $M$ and parameter $\zeta$. For $\zeta = 0$, they reduce to the Schwarzschild solution, and depending on the parameters, they describe black holes with an event and Cauchy horizon (Model-1), a single horizon (Model-2), or no horizons. Using SMBHs Sgr A* and M87* as lenses and integrating theoretical predictions with recent EHT data, we identify significant differences in lensing signatures due to quantum corrections. For Model-1, the deviations of the lensing observables: $|\delta\theta_{\infty}|$ of black holes in EQG from Schwarzschild black hole, for SMBHs Sgr A* and M87, can reach as much as $1.75~\mu$as and $1.32~\mu$as, while $|\delta s|$ is about $30.12$~nas for Sgr A* and $22.63$~nas for M87*. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent packed images indicates that EQG black hole images are brighter than their Schwarzschild counterparts, with a deviation in the brightness ratio $|\delta r_{mag}|$ reaching up to 2.02. The time delays between the second and first images, denoted $|\delta T_{2,1}|$, exhibit substantial deviations from the GR counterpart, reaching up to 1.53 min for Sgr A* and 1159.9 min for M87*. The EHT constraints on $\theta_{sh}$ of Sgr A* and M87* within the $1\sigma$ region limit the parameters $\zeta$. Our analysis concludes that EQG black holes are consistent with the EHT observations within this finite space.</description>

      <title>Mitigating baryon feedback bias in cosmic shear through a theoretical error covariance in the matter power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forthcoming cosmic shear surveys will make precise measurements of the matter density field down to very small scales, scales which are dominated by baryon feedback. The modelling of baryon feedback is crucial to ensure unbiased cosmological parameter constraints; the most efficient approach is to use analytic models, but these are limited by how well they can capture the physics of baryon feedback. We investigate the fitting and residual errors of various baryon feedback models to a suite of hydrodynamic simulations, and propagate these to cosmological parameter constraints for cosmic shear. We present an alternative formalism to binary scale-cuts through the use of a theoretical error covariance, which is a well-motivated alternative using errors in the power spectrum modelling itself. We depart from previous works by modelling baryonic feedback errors directly in the matter power spectrum, which is the natural basis to do so and thus preserves information in the lensing kernels. When including angular multipoles up to $\ell_{\mathrm{max}} = 5000$, and assuming Euclid-like survey properties, we find that even multi-parameter models of baryon feedback can introduce significant levels of bias. In contrast, our theoretical error reduces the bias in $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $S_{8}$ to acceptable levels, with only a modest increase in parameter variances. The theoretical error approach bypasses the need to directly determine the per-bin $\ell_{\mathrm{max}}$ values, as it naturally suppresses the biassing small-scale information. We also present a detailed study of how flexible HMCode-2020, a widely-used non-linear and baryonic feedback model, is at fitting a range of hydrodynamical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate time delays of gravitational wave and scalar wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet effective field theories of gravity. By requiring infrared causality, we impose a lower bound on the cutoff scale of the theories. With this bound, we further discuss the detectability of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Comparing with the gravitational effective field theories that only contain the two tensor modes, adding a scalar degree of freedom opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference with scattering representations: scattering is all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first successful use of scattering representations without further compression for simulation-based inference (SBI) with images (i.e. field-level), illustrated with a cosmological case study. Scattering representations provide a highly effective representational space for subsequent learning tasks, although the higher dimensional compressed space introduces challenges. We overcome these through spatial averaging, coupled with more expressive density estimators. Compared to alternative methods, such an approach does not require additional simulations for either training or computing derivatives, is interpretable, and resilient to covariate shift. As expected, we show that a scattering only approach extracts more information than traditional second order summary statistics.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing inflationary potential from NANOGrav 15-year Data: A robust study using Non-Bunch Davies initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the theoretical framework behind reconstruction of a generic class of inflationary potentials for canonical single-field slow-roll inflation in a model-independent fashion. The Non-Bunch Davies (NBD) initial condition is an essential choice to determine the structure of potential and to accommodate the blue-tilted tensor power spectrum feature recently observed in NANOGrav. Using the reconstruction technique we found the favoured parameter space which supports blue tilted tensor power spectrum. The validity of the EFT prescription in inflation is also maintained through the use of a new field excursion formula while keeping the necessary and sufficient conditions on the sub-Planckian field values in check. We find that the reconstructed potential display inflection point behaviour, which has deeper connection with high energy physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the sensitivity of relic neutrino detection methods within the Standard Model, extended to include right-chiral neutrino singlets with Majorana mass terms. In particular, we study neutrino capture on unstable nuclei, the Stodolsky effect, coherent scattering, and an accelerator experiment. We demonstrate that the sensitivity transitions smoothly between Dirac and Majorana regimes, depending on the scale of lepton number violation. Importantly, neutral current interactions lead to transitions between the light and heavy neutrino states, necessitating the use of a density matrix formalism for accurate sensitivity calculations. As the oldest source of neutrinos in the universe, relic neutrinos would be able to provide an ultimate constraint on the lepton number violating scale, $m_R\gtrsim 10^{-33}~{\rm eV}$, below which neutrinos would behave as Dirac fermions for all practical purposes.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

      <title>Ultra Long Period Cepheids as standard candles from Gaia to Rubin-LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analysis of the Ultra Long Period Cepheids (ULPs) properties could significantly contribute to understanding the Hubble constant tension, e.g. the current discrepancy between determinations based on local distance indicators and those relying on cosmic microwave background measurements. These highly luminous variables are observable beyond 100 Mpc, so if they were confirmed to behave as standard candles, they would allow us a direct measurement of cosmological distances without any secondary distance indicator, thus reducing potential systematic errors in the calibration of the cosmic distance scale. This paper presents an analysis of the largest known sample of 73 ULPs, including 15 objects in nearby galaxies, with new accurate and homogeneous photometry obtained by Gaia DR3, and a new object, in our Galaxy, identified as Long Period Variable in Gaia DR3, but recently reclassified as ULP. The obtained results suggest that, by improving photometric accuracy, the ULP Period-Wesenheit relation shows a smaller dispersion than that obtained in literature and is in better agreement with the Classical Cepheid (CC) one, supporting the hypothesis that ULPs are the extension of the CCs at higher period, mass and luminosity. However, to reach this aim, it is necessary to enrich the sample with high-quality data. The Rubin-LSST survey offers the possibility to achieve this thanks to its photometric characteristics and time extension. In particular, we will explore the capabilities of the Rubin-LSST survey to recover ULP theoretical light-curves by using a new tool called PulsationStarRecovery, built by our group for this type of analysis.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Roles of Dark Photons in Axion-induced Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By coupling to both the Higgs and electroweak gauge sectors, an axion can generate the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe via electroweak baryogenesis when the axion decay constant lies within the range of approximately $10^5$ and $10^7$ GeV, corresponding to axion masses between the MeV and GeV scales. In this work, we explore the intriguing possibility that the axion interacts with a dark sector, particularly with dark photons through anomalous couplings. Notably, axion-coupled dark photons can play multiple roles, including $(i)$ suppressing the branching ratio of axion decay to Standard Model (SM) particles, which would otherwise conflict with the constraints from supernovae explosions and Big Bang nucleosynthesis, $(ii)$ serving as a candidate for cold dark matter if they are massive and stable, and $(iii)$ contributing to dark radiation if they are ultralight. The axion decouples from the SM thermal bath when it becomes non-relativistic, facilitating the production of dark matter dark photons through the freeze-in mechanism, while dark radiation dark photons are thermally generated prior to the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <title>Modified $f(R,T)$ theory in light of gravitational wave standard sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we ponder observational constraints on the modified $f(R,T)$ gravity, where the gravitational action is a function of Ricci scalar $R$ plus the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $T$. For this purpose, we utilize recently available data, including cosmic microwave background, weak lensing, supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions measurements, together with future gravitational wave data from Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In particular, we create three LISA mock catalogs, namely Pop III, Delay, and No Delay, to improve the obtained constraints on cosmological parameters from current observations. Numerical analysis reveals that LISA standard sirens (SS) make improvements on constraining $f(R,T)$ model cosmological parameters. Moreover, MCMC results based on mock LISA SS denote strong evidence in favor of $f(R,T)$ gravity. Thereupon, we perceive that LISA SS are capable to provide novel constraints on modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Searching for Dark Clumps with Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>

Abstract: Dark compact objects ("clumps") transiting the Solar System exert accelerations on the test masses (TM) in a gravitational-wave (GW) detector. We reexamine the detectability of these clump transits in a variety of current and future GW detectors, operating over a broad range of frequencies. TM accelerations induced by clump transits through the inner Solar System have frequency content around $f \sim \mu$Hz. Some of us [arXiv:2112.11431] recently proposed a GW detection concept with $\mu$Hz sensitivity, based on asteroid-to-asteroid ranging. From the detailed sensitivity projection for this concept, we find both analytically and in simulation that purely gravitational clump-matter interactions would yield one detectable transit every $\sim 20$ yrs, if clumps with mass $m_{\text{cl}} \sim 10^{14} \text{kg}$ saturate the dark-matter (DM) density. Other (proposed) GW detectors using local TMs and operating in higher frequency bands are sensitive to smaller clump masses and have smaller rates of discoverable signals. We also consider the case of clumps endowed with an additional attractive long-range clump-matter fifth force significantly stronger than gravity (but evading known fifth-force constraints). For the $\mu$Hz detector concept, we use simulations to show that, for example, a clump-matter fifth-force $\sim 10^3$ times stronger than gravity with a range of $\sim\text{AU}$ would boost the rate of detectable transits to a few per year for clumps in the mass range $10^{11} \text{kg} \lesssim m_{\text{cl}} \lesssim 10^{14} \text{kg}$, even if they are a $\sim 1$% sub-component of the DM. The ability of $\mu$Hz GW detectors to probe asteroid-mass-scale dark objects that may otherwise be undetectable bolsters the science case for their development.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Black Holes with Intermediate Masses at High Redshifts: an earlier generation of Quasars and observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.02143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Energy is the largest fraction of the energy density of our Universe - yet it remains one of the enduring enigmas of our times. Here we show that Dark Energy can be used to solve 2 tantalizing mysteries of the observable universe. We build on existing models of Dark Energy linked to neutrino masses. In these models Dark Energy can undergo Phase Transitions and form Black Holes. Here we look at the implications of the family structure of neutrinos for the phase transitions in dark energy and associated peaks in black hole formation. It has been previously shown that one of these peaks in Black Hole formation is associated with the observed peak in Quasar formation. Here, we predict that there will also be an earlier peak in the Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts. These Dark Energy Black Holes formed at high redshifts are Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs).These Dark Energy Black Holes at large redshift can help explain both the EDGES observations and the observations of large Supermassive Black Holes (SMBHs) at redshifts $z \sim 7$. The existence of an earlier phase of Dark Energy Black Holes take care of some current challenges to theory implied by existing astronomical data and also helps us look for these Dark Energy Black Holes at high redshifts as predicted here through targeted searches for these Black Holes at the redshifts $z \sim 18$. There is a slight dependence of the location of the peak on the lightest neutrino mass - so the peak may be located at a slightly lower value of the redshift. This may actually enable a measurement of the lightest neutrino mass. Finding these Dark Energy Black Holes of Intermediate Mass should be within the reach of upcoming observations - particularly with the James Webb Space Telescope - but perhaps also through the use of other innovative techniques focusing specifically on the redshifts around $z \sim 18$.</description>

      <title>"SNe Ia twins for life" towards a precise determination of H$_{0}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we present an approach to the measurement of extragalactic distances using twin SNe Ia, taken from the early down to the nebular phase.The approach is purely empirical, although we can give a theoretical background on why the method is reliable. By studying those twins in galaxies where peculiar velocities are relatively unimportant, we can tackle the H$_{0}$ tension problem. Here we apply the method to the determination of the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 2525, who hosted respectively SN 2013dy and SN 2018gv, twins of two different SNe Ia prototypes: SN 2013aa/SN 2017cbv and SN2011fe. From the study of the SN 2013aa and SN 2017cbv twin pair, by comparing it with SN 2011fe and applying the difference between the SN 2013aa/2017cbv and the SN 2011fe class, we find as well a good estimate of the distance to NGC 5643. We have just started to measure distances with this method for the samples in Freedman et al. and Riess et al. There are differences in measured distances to the same galaxy using Cepheids or TRGBs. In this context of discrepancy, the ''twins for life '' method is very competitive because it can provide distance estimates with a modulus error of $\sigma_{\mu}$ $=$ 0.04 mag. Our findings called for a revision of the distances measured with Cepheids in Riess et al. (2022). NGC 7250 and NGC 2525 needed better measurements with Cepheids. We have noticed that the Cepheids--based distance obtained with the {\it JWST} in Riess et al. (2024a) for NGC 5643 is in a a good agreement with what we find, unlike their previous estimate in Riess et al. (2022). We address the local SNe Ia distances as part of the Hubble tension problem. We expect to apply the 'twin' SNe Ia comparison from the local sample to galaxies with z $&gt;$0.02--0.03 well into the Hubble flow to obtain a reliable value of H$_{0.}$</description>

Abstract: Making observable predictions for cosmic inflation requires determining when the wavenumbers of astrophysical interest today exited the Hubble radius during the inflationary epoch. These instants are commonly evaluated using the slow-roll approximation and measured in e-folds $\Delta N=N-N_\mathrm{end}$, in reference to the e-fold $N_\mathrm{end}$ at which inflation ended. Slow roll being necessarily violated towards the end of inflation, both the approximated trajectory and $N_\mathrm{end}$ are determined at, typically, one or two e-folds precision. Up to now, such an uncertainty has been innocuous, but this will no longer be the case with the forthcoming cosmological measurements. In this work, we introduce a new and simple analytical method, on top of the usual slow-roll approximation, that reduces uncertainties on $\Delta N$ to less than a tenth of an e-fold.</description>

      <title>Curbing PBHs with PTAs</title>

Abstract: Sizeable primordial curvature perturbations needed to seed a population of primordial black holes (PBHs) will be accompanied by a scalar-induced gravitational wave signal that can be detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTA). We derive conservative bounds on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum at the PTA frequencies and estimate the implied constraints on the PBH abundance. We show that only a small fraction of dark matter can consist of stellar mass PBHs when the abundance is calculated using threshold statistics. The strength and the shape of the constraint depend on the shape of the power spectrum and the nature of the non-Gaussianities. We find that constraints on the PBH abundance arise in the mass range $0.1-10^3\, M_{\odot}$, with the sub-solar mass range being constrained only for narrow curvature power spectra. These constraints are softened when positive non-Gaussianity is introduced and can be eliminated when $f_{\rm NL} \gtrsim 5$. On the other hand, if the PBH abundance is computed via the theory of peaks, the PTA constraints on PBHs are significantly relaxed, signalling once more the theoretical uncertainties in assessing the PBH abundance. We further discuss how strong positive non-Gaussianites can allow for heavy PBHs to potentially seed supermassive BHs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we use Lagrangian perturbation theory to analyze the harmonic space galaxy clustering signal of Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) and Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) targeted by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), combined with the galaxy--galaxy lensing signal measured around these galaxies using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 source galaxies. The BGS and LRG galaxies are extremely well characterized by DESI spectroscopy and, as a result, lens galaxy redshift uncertainty and photometric systematics contribute negligibly to the error budget of our ``$2\times2$-point'' analysis. On the modeling side, this work represents the first application of the \texttt{spinosaurus} code, implementing an effective field theory model for galaxy intrinsic alignments, and we additionally introduce a new scheme (\texttt{MAIAR}) for marginalizing over the large uncertainties in the redshift evolution of the intrinsic alignment signal. Furthermore, this is the first application of a hybrid effective field theory (HEFT) model for galaxy bias based on the $\texttt{Aemulus}\, \nu$ simulations. Our main result is a measurement of the amplitude of the lensing signal, $S_8=\sigma_8 \left(\Omega_m/0.3\right)^{0.5} = 0.850^{+0.042}_{-0.050}$, consistent with values of this parameter derived from the primary CMB. This constraint is artificially improved by a factor of $51\%$ if we assume a more standard, but restrictive parameterization for the redshift evolution and sample dependence of the intrinsic alignment signal, and $63\%$ if we additionally assume the nonlinear alignment model. We show that when fixing the cosmological model to the best-fit values from Planck PR4 there is $&gt; 5 \sigma$ evidence for a deviation of the evolution of the intrinsic alignment signal from the functional form that is usually assumed in cosmic shear and galaxy--galaxy lensing studies.</description>

Abstract: We present a stacked lensing analysis of 96 galaxy clusters selected by the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect in maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We select foreground galaxy clusters with a $5\sigma$-level SZ threshold in CMB observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, while we define background source galaxies for the lensing analysis with secure photometric redshift cuts in Year 3 data of the Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam survey. We detect the stacked lensing signal in the range of $0.1 &lt; R\, [h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}] &lt; 100$ in each of three cluster redshift bins, $0.092&lt;z\le0.445$, $0.445&lt;z\le0.695$, and $0.695&lt;z\le1.180$, with 32 galaxy clusters in each bin. The cumulative signal-to-noise ratios of the lensing signal are $14.6$, $12.0$, and $6.6$, respectively. Using a halo-based forward model, we then constrain statistical relationships between the mass inferred from the SZ observation (i.e. SZ mass) and the total mass derived from our stacked lensing measurements. At the average SZ mass in the cluster sample ($2.1-2.4\times10^{14}\, h^{-1}M_\odot$), our likelihood analysis shows that the average total mass differs from the SZ counterpart by a factor of $1.3 \pm 0.2$, $1.6 \pm 0.2$, and $1.6 \pm 0.3$ ($68\%$) in the aforementioned redshift ranges, respectively. Our limits are consistent with previous lensing measurements, and we find that the cluster modeling choices can introduce a $1\sigma$-level difference in our parameter inferences.</description>

Abstract: The Perseus cluster is the brightest X-ray cluster in the sky and is known as a cool-core galaxy cluster. Being a very nearby cluster, it has been extensively studied. This has provided a comprehensive view of the physical processes that operate in the intracluster medium (ICM), including feedback from the AGN 3C84 and measurements of ICM turbulence. Additionally, the Perseus cluster contains a central radio mini-halo. This diffuse radio source traces cosmic ray electrons (re-)accelerated in-situ in the ICM.
  Here we report on LOFAR high-band antenna 120-168 MHz observations of the Perseus cluster that probe a range of four orders of magnitude in angular scales. In our 0.3 arcsec resolution image, we find that the northern extension of the 3C84 lobe consists of several narrow 1.5-3 kpc parallel strands of emission. In addition, we detect steep-spectrum filaments associated with a previous outburst of the central AGN radio emission filling two known X-ray ghost cavities. At 7 arcsec resolution, our images show a complex structured radio mini-halo, with several edges and filaments. At resolutions of 26 arcsec and 80 arcsec, we discover diffuse radio emission with a 1.1 Mpc extent. We classify this emission as a giant radio halo and its properties are distinct from the inner mini-halo. We also detect two diffuse sources at projected cluster centric radii of 0.7 and 1.0 Mpc. Finally, we observe a 0.9 Mpc long trail of radio emission from the cluster member galaxy IC310, connecting it with the giant radio halo. Together with other recent studies of relaxed clusters, our LOFAR observations indicate that cluster-wide radio emission could be (more) common in cool-core clusters. In the case of the Perseus cluster, a past off-axis merger event that preserved the cool core might have generated enough turbulence to produce an extended radio halo observable at low frequencies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate chiral gravitational wave (GW) signals generated from inflation to reheating, driven by a parity-violating (PV) term coupled to the inflaton. During inflation, the PV term reduces the sound horizon for right-handed circularly polarized GWs, and amplifies their power spectra relative to left-handed GWs. At CMB scales, these chiral GWs induce BB as well as non-vanishing EB and TB correlations in CMB, which are potentially detectable by LiteBIRD. During reheating, subhorizon modes undergo tachyonic instability, leading to fully circularly polarized GWs with enhanced amplitudes, detectable through the resonant cavity experiment. The absence of backreaction effect of enhanced chiral GWs imposes constraints on the energy scale of the PV term, the inflationary potential, and the reheating history. Our findings highlight the potential of multi-frequency GW experiments to offer a unique probe of the parity violation and early Universe.</description>

      <title>First-order electroweak phase transitions: a nonperturbative update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.07238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study first-order electroweak phase transitions nonperturbatively, assuming any particles beyond the Standard Model are sufficiently heavy to be integrated out at the phase transition. Utilising high temperature dimensional reduction, we perform lattice Monte-Carlo simulations to calculate the main quantities characterising the transition: the critical temperature, the latent heat, the surface tension and the bubble nucleation rate, updating and extending previous lattice studies. We focus on the region where the theory gives first-order phase transitions due to an effective reduction in the Higgs self-coupling and give a detailed comparison with perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The conditional colour-magnitude distribution: II. A comparison of galaxy colour and luminosity distribution in galaxy groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Conditional Colour-Magnitude Distribution (CCMD) is a comprehensive formalism of the colour-magnitude-halo mass relation of galaxies. With joint modelling of a large sample of SDSS galaxies in fine bins of galaxy colour and luminosity, Xu et al. inferred parameters of a CCMD model that well reproduces colour- and luminosity-dependent abundance and clustering of present-day galaxies. In this work, we provide a test and investigation of the CCMD model by studying the colour and luminosity distribution of galaxies in galaxy groups. An apples-to-apples comparison of group galaxies is achieved by applying the same galaxy group finder to identify groups from the CCMD galaxy mocks and from the SDSS data, avoiding any systematic effect of group finding and mass assignment on the comparison. We find an overall nice agreement in the conditional luminosity function (CLF), the conditional colour function (CCF), and the CCMD of galaxies in galaxy groups inferred from CCMD mock and SDSS data. We also discuss the subtle differences revealed by the comparison. In addition, using two external catalogues constructed to only include central galaxies with halo mass measured through weak lensing, we find that their colour-magnitude distribution shows two distinct and orthogonal components, in line with the prediction of the CCMD model. Our results suggest that the CCMD model provides a good description of halo mass dependent galaxy colour and luminosity distribution. The halo and CCMD mock catalogues are made publicly available to facilitate other investigations.</description>

      <title>Parametric resonance of gravitational waves in general scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves offer a potent mean to test the underlying theory of gravity. In general theories of gravity, such as scalar-tensor theories, one expects modifications in the friction term and the sound speed in the gravitational wave equation. In that case, rapid oscillations in such coefficients, e.g. due to an oscillating scalar field, may lead to narrow parametric resonances in the gravitational wave strain. We perform a general analysis of such possibility within DHOST theories. We use disformal transformations to find the theory space with larger resonances, within an effective field theory approach. We then apply our formalism to a non-minimally coupled ultra-light dark matter scalar field, assuming the presence of a primordial gravitational wave background, e.g., from inflation. We find that the resonant peaks in the spectral density may be detectable by forthcoming detectors such as LISA, Taiji, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer.</description>

      <title>Boosting gravitational waves: a review of kinematic effects on amplitude, polarization, frequency and energy density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the kinematic effects on a gravitational wave due to either a peculiar motion of the astrophysical source emitting it or a local motion of the observer. Working in the context of general relativity, we show at fully non-linear order in velocity, that the amplitude of the wave is amplified by the Doppler factor in the case in which the source moves with respect to a reference frame, while it is invariant if the observer moves (with respect to a reference observer). However, the observed specific intensity transforms in the same way under a boost of the source or of the observer. We also show at fully non-linear order that under a boost (of either source or observer), the polarization tensor is rotated in the same way the wave direction is rotated by aberration, such that the only net effect of a boost on polarization is to change the phase of the helicity components. We apply these results to a wave emitted by a binary system of compact objects in the cosmological context.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning and genetic algorithms for cosmological Bayesian inference speed-up</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to accelerate the Bayesian inference process, focusing specifically on the nested sampling algorithms. Bayesian inference plays a crucial role in cosmological parameter estimation, providing a robust framework for extracting theoretical insights from observational data. However, its computational demands can be substantial, primarily due to the need for numerous likelihood function evaluations. Our proposed method utilizes the power of deep learning, employing feedforward neural networks to approximate the likelihood function dynamically during the Bayesian inference process. Unlike traditional approaches, our method trains neural networks on-the-fly using the current set of live points as training data, without the need for pre-training. This flexibility enables adaptation to various theoretical models and datasets. We perform simple hyperparameter optimization using genetic algorithms to suggest initial neural network architectures for learning each likelihood function. Once sufficient accuracy is achieved, the neural network replaces the original likelihood function. The implementation integrates with nested sampling algorithms and has been thoroughly evaluated using both simple cosmological dark energy models and diverse observational datasets. Additionally, we explore the potential of genetic algorithms for generating initial live points within nested sampling inference, opening up new avenues for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of Bayesian inference methods.</description>

      <title>Orbital dynamics in galactic potentials under mass transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent potentials are common in galactic systems that undergo significant evolution, interactions, or encounters with other galaxies, or when there are dynamic processes like star formation and merging events. Recent studies show that an ensemble approach along with the so-called snapshot framework in dynamical system theory provide a powerful tool to analyze time dependent dynamics.
  In this work, we aim to explore and quantify the phase space structure and dynamical complexity in time-dependent galactic potentials consisting of multiple components. We apply the classical method of Poincar\'e-surface of section to analyze the phase space structure in a chaotic Hamiltonian system subjected to parameter drift. This, however, makes sense only when the evolution of a large ensemble of initial conditions is followed. Numerical simulations explore the phase space structure of such ensembles while the system undergoes a continuous parameter change. The pair-wise average distance of ensemble members allows us to define a generalized Lyapunov-exponent, that might also be time dependent, to describe the system stability. We provide a comprehensive dynamical analysis of the system under circumstances where linear mass transfer undergoes between the disk and bulge components of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an inflection point inflation scenario where a flat direction of the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) is identified with the inflaton. We focus on the case where the flat direction (inflaton) has non-zero baryon number, and consider a non-thermal baryogenesis scenario where the decay of the inflaton at the reheating directly generates baryon asymmetry of the Universe. Specifically, we consider a udd flat direction that is lifted by a superpotential operator of dimension 6, and show that inflection point inflation with the udd flat direction can be compatible with cosmological observations and can account for the baryon asymmetry of the Universe.</description>

      <title>A New Twist on Spinning (A)dS Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massless spinning correlators in cosmology are extremely complicated. In contrast, the scattering amplitudes of massless particles with spin are very simple. We propose that the reason for the unreasonable complexity of these correlators lies in the use of inconvenient kinematic variables. For example, in de Sitter space, consistency with unitarity and the background isometries imply that the correlators must be conformally covariant and also conserved. However, the commonly used kinematic variables for correlators do not make all of these properties manifest. In this paper, we introduce twistor space as a powerful way to satisfy all kinematic constraints. We show that conformal correlators of conserved currents can be written as twistor integrals, where the conservation condition translates into holomorphicity of the integrand. The functional form of the twistor-space correlators is very simple and easily bootstrapped. For the case of three-point functions, we verify explicitly that this reproduces known results in embedding space. We also perform a half-Fourier transform of the twistor-space correlators to obtain their counterparts in momentum space. We conclude that twistors provide a promising new avenue to study conformal correlation functions that exposes their hidden simplicity.</description>

      <title>Galaxy populations in protoclusters at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties and redshift evolution of simulated galaxies residing in protoclusters at cosmic noon, to understand the influence of the environment on galaxy formation. This work is to build clear expectations for the ongoing ODIN survey, devoted to mapping large-scale structures at z=2.4, 3.1, and 4.5 using Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (LAEs) as tracers. From the IllustrisTNG simulations, we define subregions centered on the most massive clusters ranked by total stellar mass at z=0 and study the properties of galaxies within, including LAEs. To model the LAE population, we take a semi-analytical approach that assigns Ly$\alpha$ luminosity and equivalent width based on the UV luminosities to galaxies in a probabilistic manner. We investigate stellar mass, star formation rate, major mergers, and specific star formation rate of the population of star-forming galaxies and LAEs in the field and protocluster environment and trace their evolution. We find that the overall shape of the UV luminosity function (LF) in simulated protocluster environments is characterized by a shallower faint-end slope and an excess on the bright end, signaling different formation histories for galaxies therein. The difference is milder for the Ly$\alpha$ LF. While protocluster galaxies follow the same SFR-$M_{\odot}$ scaling relation as average field galaxies, a larger fraction appears to have experienced major mergers in the last 200 Myr and as a result shows enhanced star formation at a ~60% level, leading to a flatter distribution in both SFR and $M_{\odot}$ relative to galaxies in the average field. We find that protocluster galaxies, including LAEs, begin to quench much earlier (z~0.8-1.6) than field galaxies (z~0.5-0.9); our result is in agreement with recent observational results and highlights the importance of large-scale environment on the overall formation history of galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently suggested (arxiv:2410.06604) that the small value of the dark energy of the universe could be explained in terms of the scale of neutrino masses through a simple quantum field theoretic mechanism. I clarify that the quantity computed is only a threshold correction to the vacuum energy at the low $m_\nu$ scale, and therefore cannot explain the magnitude of the vacuum energy.</description>
