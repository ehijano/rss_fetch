      <title>Symmetry Theories, Wigner's Function, Compactification, and Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global symmetry data of a $D$-dimensional absolute quantum field theory can sometimes be packaged in terms of a $(D+1)$-dimensional bulk system obtained by extending along an interval, with a relative QFT$_D$ at one end and suitable gapped / free boundary conditions at the other end. The partition function of the QFT$_D$ can then be interpreted as a wavefunction depending on background fields. However, in some cases, it is not possible or simply cumbersome to fix an absolute form of the symmetry data. Additionally, it is also of interest to consider entangled and mixed states of relative QFTs as well as entangled and mixed states of gapped / free boundary conditions. We argue that Wigner's quasi-probabilistic function on phase space provides a physical interpretation of the symmetry data in all such situations. We illustrate these considerations in the case of string compactifications and holographic systems.</description>

      <title>1-loop renormalisability of integrable sigma-models from 4d Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large families of integrable 2d sigma-models have been constructed at the classical level, partly motivated by the utility of integrability on the string worldsheet. It is natural to ask whether these theories are renormalisable at the quantum level, and whether they define quantum integrable field theories. By considering examples, a folk theorem has emerged: the classically integrable sigma-models always turn out to be renormalisable, at least at 1-loop order. We prove this theorem for a large class of models engineered on surface defects in the 4d Chern-Simons theory by Costello and Yamazaki. We derive the flow of the 'twist 1-form' (a 4d coupling constant that distinguishes different 2d models), proving earlier conjectures and extending previous results. Our approach is general, using the 'universal' form of 2d integrable models' UV divergences in terms of their Lax connection and reinterpreting the result in the language of 4d Chern-Simons. These results apply equally to rational, trigonometric and elliptic models.</description>

      <title>A microscopic Normal Matrix Model for $(A)dS_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the duality between the gravitating $c=1$ (compact) Sine-Gordon model and a normal matrix model. From a two-dimensional quantum gravity perspective and due to the periodic nature of the potential, this model admits both anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter saddles, similarly to simpler models of Sine-Dilaton gravity, as well as more complicated interpolating "wineglass wormhole" geometries. From a string theory perspective the Euclidean de-Sitter (genus zero) saddles are related to the presence of a classical entropic contribution associated to the target space geometry. The gravitating Sine-Gordon model corresponds to a well defined CFT by construction and the eigenvalues of the dual normal matrix model are supported in a compact region of the complex plane. The duality with the normal matrix model is operationally defined even for a finite, but sufficiently large matrix size $N$, depending on the precise observable to be determined. We define and study a "microscopic" version of the large-N limit that allows us to recover non-perturbative results for all physical observables.</description>

      <title>Can metric-affine gravity be saved?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like general relativity, metric-affine gravity should be a viable effective quantum theory, otherwise it is a mathematical curiosity without physical application. Assuming a perturbative quantum field theory, the universal, flat limit of metric-affine gravity offers a good foundation for model-building only when symmetry constraints are themselves sufficient to get rid of ghosts and tachyons, without requiring any further tuning of the couplings. Using this symmetry-first criterion, we find that for parity-preserving models with a totally symmetric distortion, only massless spin-one and spin-three modes are possible besides the graviton. Moreover, no viable models result from gauge symmetries generated by a scalar field.</description>

      <title>Gauge algebra and diffeomorphisms in string field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the gauge algebra of closed string field theory with a focus on diffeomorphisms. This algebra contains off-shell information in two ways. The first way is geometric, through the choice of three-punctured sphere defining the three-string vertex. We establish that to leading order in derivatives the superstring algebra is universal: identical for any choice of vertex. For bosonic strings, however, some off-shell dependence remains for vertices that require symmetrization. Off-shell information also appears because field-dependent redefinition of the gauge parameters can alter the algebra. We analyze this dependence in the language of $L_\infty$ algebras, looking at the role of trivial gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces and Multifractal Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The critical dynamics of conformal field theories on random surfaces is investigated beyond the dynamics of the overall area and the genus. It is found that the evolution of the order parameter in physical time is a multifractal random walk. Accordingly, the higher moments of time variations of the order parameter exhibit multifractal scaling. The series of Hurst exponents is computed and illustrated with the examples of the Ising-, 3-state-Potts-, and general minimal models on a random surface. Models are identified that can replicate the observed multifractal scaling in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Extremal couplings, graviton exchange, and gluon scattering in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremal cubic couplings in AdS relate bulk fields such that $\Delta_i+\Delta_j=\Delta_k$. Such couplings lead to divergent 3-point Witten diagrams, and do not occur in theories with maximal supersymmetry. We consider the simplest theories where such coupling are non-zero, which is type IIB string theory with $N$ D3 branes probing various configurations of sevenbranes, which are dual to certain 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs. At large $N$, the low energy effective theory is supergravity on $AdS_5\times S^5$ with a singularity, whose fixed point locus is $AdS_5\times S^3$. These theories have infinite towers of graviton modes, as well as gluon modes on the sevenbranes. We compute the nonzero coupling between these modes, which is in general (super)-extremal. We use these couplings to compute the graviton exchange term in the holographic correlator of gluon KK modes $\langle22pp\rangle$, which appears at the same order $1/N^2$ as 1-loop gluon exchange, and receives contributions from a whole tower of graviton modes. We use this graviton exchange term to compute the unmixing of the single trace graviton modes with double traces of gluon modes, which explains the divergent 3-point diagrams. Finally, for $\langle 2222\rangle$ for the simplest 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory, we use supersymmetric localization and the new graviton exchange term to completely fix the correlator at order $1/N^2$.</description>

      <title>The Special Locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The special locus plays an important role in the construction of the non-BPS microstate geometries known as microstrata. These supergravity solutions are dual to combinations of left-moving and right-moving momentum states in the D1-D5 CFT and because supersymmetry is broken the anomalous dimensions of these states are not protected. This means even the simplest combinations of excitations can create a cascade of frequency dependences through the non-linearities of the supergravity interactions. Solutions on the special locus manage to lock some of these anomalous dimensions together and allow one to construct complete solutions using gauged supergravity in three dimensions. In the dual holographic CFT, the special locus has been shown to correspond to creating a "pure" gas of single particle states, however, in supergravity the special locus remains mysterious especially because it does not seem to be defined by a geometric symmetry. In this paper we reveal the supergravity structure of the special locus, first in three-dimensional supergravity and then in the uplift to six dimensions and IIB supergravity. The key insight is that, in three dimensions, a family of dual vector fields must vanish, and this implies that there are algebraic relations between tensor gauge fields in six and ten dimensions. These insights show how one can generalize the special locus Ansatz to more general mode excitations of six-dimensional supergravity. We also construct the full six-dimensional uplift of the simplest special locus.</description>

      <title>Forms of BRST symmetry on a Prototypical First-Class System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the various forms of BRST symmetry by using the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism in a prototypical first class system. We have shown that the various forms of symmetry can be obtained through canonical transformation in the ghost sector. The so called "dual-BRST" symmetry which is claimed to be an independent symmetry due to its roots in differential geometry is obtained from usual BRST symmetry by making a canonical transformation in the ghost sector.</description>

      <title>A Unified Scale Factor for the Cosmic Evolution -Motivated by Brane World Models-</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel cosmological scale factor, $a(t)=e^{H(t)} { (1-e^{-k(t)t}) }^{b(t)}$, as a strong candidate for effectively modeling the universe in a unified and continuous description across all major epochs of cosmic evolution. We provide a detailed analysis, supported by graphical representations of the universe's evolution with smooth transition from the early inflation to the present acceleration expansion, proposing a coherent and comprehensive picture of cosmic history, consistent with current observational constraints. Furthermore, we explore the theoretical foundations of this model within extra-dimensional physics, demonstrating its compatibility with the brane-world paradigm. Through analytical approximations, the model describes a natural transition from a high-energy, brane-dominated early universe to the low-energy regime governed by general relativity, providing a compelling narrative of cosmic evolution across disparate energy scales. Additionally, the explicit presence of quantum statistical corrections to the Hubble parameter of this scale factor, as a prominent feature of the model, offers a phenomenological approach to incorporating quantum statistic into the classical evolution of the universe.</description>

      <title>Sphere amplitudes and observing the universe's size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sine dilaton gravity is holographically related to DSSYK. We explain how to interpret sine dilaton as 2d quantum cosmology. This paves the way for using two copies of DSSYK as hologram for Big-Bang cosmologies. We study the most basic cosmological observable: the sphere amplitude. Via canonical quantization we find a finite answer that matches the on-shell action of a dual matrix integral. The sphere amplitude (or the norm of the no-boundary wavefunction) also gives a prediction for the universe's size. In the context of slow-roll inflation, the no-boundary state is non-normalizable, and predicts a small universe, in contradiction with experiments. We argue that an avatar of these issues exists in dS JT gravity. By considering sine dilaton as a UV completion of dS JT gravity, the state becomes normalizable. We then consider the observer's no-boundary state and show that this prefers neither small nor large universes. The resulting distribution is flat.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute two-loop electroweak corrections to double Higgs boson production in gluon fusion mediated by light quarks in a fully analytical way. We determine a basis of master integrals satisfying canonical differential equations in $\mathrm{d}\log$ form, enhanced by subsequent rotations to remove unnecessary functions that do not appear in the analytic expressions of the amplitudes. We determine the integration constants by matching our expressions to the large mass expansion limit of the canonical integrals. We express the solution of differential equations in terms of Chen iterated integrals up to transcendental weight six over logarithmic kernels with algebraic arguments, and further decompose them by employing a basis of uniform weight functions. By deriving differential equations for such basis, we provide numerical results as well as routines for optimised numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Addressing $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions within $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the viability of $f(Q)$ gravity as an alternative framework to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions in cosmology. Focusing on three representative $f(Q)$ models, we perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis using a combination of cosmological observations, including cosmic chronometers, Type Ia supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, baryon acoustic oscillations, and redshift-space distortions. Our results demonstrate that most of these models can yield higher values of $H_0$ than those predicted by $\Lambda$CDM, offering a partial alleviation of the tension. In addition, one model satisfies the condition $G_{\mathrm{eff}} &lt; G$ and predicts $S_8$ values consistent with weak lensing observations, making it a promising candidate for addressing the $S_8$ tension. However, these improvements are accompanied by mild internal inconsistencies between different subsets of data, which limit the overall statistical preference relative to $\Lambda$CDM. Despite this, $f(Q)$ gravity remains a promising and flexible framework for late-time cosmology, and our results motivate further exploration of extended or hybrid models that may reconcile all observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Roughening and dynamics of an electric flux string in a (2+1)D lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the roughening transition in the pure $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory in (2+1) dimensions. Using numerical simulations with matrix product states, we explore the static and dynamical properties of an electric flux string between two static charges as the coupling is varied and approaches the deconfinement phase transition from the confined phase. Within the roughening region, we obtain the universal L\"uscher correction to the confining potential and observe the expected restoration of rotational symmetry. Our simulations of the out-of-equilibrium evolution of a string reveal that the growth of the entanglement entropy of the state and the string width exhibit qualitatively different behavior in the roughening region compared to the deeply confined one. In particular, we find that the rate of entropy growth is consistent with an effective description of the string excitations by a bosonic model in the roughening phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superfluid dark matter model offers an elegant solution to reconcile discrepancies between the predictions of the cold dark matter paradigm and observations on galactic scales. In this scenario, dark matter is composed of ultralight bosons with self-interactions that can undergo a superfluid phase transition in galactic environments. In this review, we explore the theoretical foundations of dark matter superfluidity, detailing the conditions required for the formation and stability of superfluid cores of astrophysical size. We examine the phenomenological consequences for galactic dynamics, including the impact on galaxy mergers, the formation of vortices, the behavior near supermassive black holes, modifications to dynamical friction, and the emergence of long-range interactions. By synthesizing theoretical developments with observational constraints, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of dark matter superfluidity as a viable extension of the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for Magnetars Producing Giant Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the straight flux rope in the model of giant flares on magnetars (Meng et al. 2014) was replaced with a curved one and the equilibrium behavior of the flux rope was investigated. Two footpoints of the flux rope are anchored to the spherical surface of magnetar. The forces acting on the flux rope include magnetic tension, magnetic pressure, curvature force, gravity. The equilibrium in the flux rope, so as in the global configuration, is achieved as these forces offset each other. Changes in the background environment drive the configuration to evolve through a set of equilibria in a quasi-static fashion until the critical point is reached and the loss of equilibrium in the configuration occurs, invoking a giant flare. We establish a criterion to identify magnetars capable of producing giant flares. Among the four forces, the curvature force as well as the magnetic compression tend to expel the flue rope outward. In a given magnetic configuration, the curvature force and magnetic compression are proportional to the square of the current intensity of the flux rope, which is determined by the frozen-flux condition and background magnetic field strength. We find that only when $\eta = G M m / ({{{R^4}{B_0}^2}})&lt; 0.48 $ is satisfied, the system reaches a critical point and potentially undergoes catastrophe. Here, $G, M, m, R$, and $B_{0}$ are the gravitational constant, the mass of neutron star, the mass of flux rope, the radius of neutron star, and the surface magnetic field strength of neutron star, respectively. The physical meaning of this criterion is that when $\eta \propto m / B_{0}^{2}$ is small enough, the curvature force and magnetic pressure can be sufficiently large to overcome gravitational confinement. This criterion establishes a basis for identifying magnetars capable of producing giant flares.</description>

      <title>Critical slowing down of black hole phase transition and kinetic crossover in supercritical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m-Anti-de Sitter (RNAdS) black holes in the extended phase space exhibit critical behavior analogous to the liquid-gas system, with critical exponents matching those of van der Waals-type phase transitions. However, the kinetics of these transitions near spinodal and critical points remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that both the autocorrelation time and the variance of trajectories increase significantly as the system approaches these special points, signaling critical slowing down. This behavior is driven by the flattening of the free energy landscape, as further confirmed by the lowest eigenvalue of the Fokker-Planck equation. Moreover, we uncover a clear dynamical crossover separating gas-like and liquid-like regimes in the supercritical region. This kinetic crossover defines the Widom line that closely matches the thermodynamic one obtained from the maxima of the isobaric heat capacity. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the kinetics of RNAdS black holes in the vicinity of spinodal and critical points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zippel algorithm performs a rational reconstruction of multivariate polynomials and aims specifically at the sparse case. It is applied in different fields of science, lately becoming an important step in Feynman integral reduction in elementary particle physics. In some cases with multiple variables it might become a bottleneck for the whole evaluation so that different optimizations are required. In this paper we describe how we ported the classical Zippel algorithm together with its balanced version for rational functions to graphical processor units and perform its evaluation on several GPUs.</description>

      <title>Complex wave functions, CPT and quantum field theory for classical generalized Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models.
  We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$).
  A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions.
  Two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions.
  Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables.
  For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations.
  These automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution.
  PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions.
  For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify and optimize the predictability of local observables in bipartite quantum systems by employing the Bayes risk and the inference variance, two measures rooted in statistical learning theory. Specifically, we minimized these quantities when the prediction is improved by an additional quantum system, providing analytical expressions for arbitrary two-qubit states, and showcasing a connection with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. Then, we embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, yielding asymptotically higher secure-key rates than standard BB84 under realistic noise. We applied these results to Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and spin correlation in top-antitop quark pairs from high-energy collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of light and heavy mesons in the framework of a model with nonlocal interaction. We start from the Bethe-Salpeter equation, choosing the interaction kernel in a nonlocal form with the Gaussian meson vertex function. We fix the model parameters using electromagnetic and leptonic decay constants. Within this model, we consider the neutral pion transition form factor ${F}_{\pi\gamma }$and apply the model to the transition form factors of heavy pseudoscalar mesons $\eta_c$ and $\eta_b$. Finally, we reproduce the radiative decays of the $\rho$-meson and heavy quarkonia.</description>

      <title>Covariant diffusion and drift of the stochastic GW background with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the covariant diffusion and drift of massless particles on the light cone within the context of quantum gravity phenomenology. Unlike modified dispersion relations that violate Lorentz invariance and grow with frequency, this model introduces a stochastic correction to the massless geodesic equation while preserving Lorentz invariance, and is dominant at lower frequencies due to the larger spacetime support of long-wavelength modes. The effect is phenomenologically described by just two diffusion and drift parameters, $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, whose values are already constrained by measurements of the CMB blackbody spectrum. We show that a direct measurement and characterization of a gravitational wave (GW) background frequency spectrum can improve bounds on these diffusion and drift parameters by over 12 orders of magnitude compared to those from the CMB. In particular, we find that detecting a GW background sourced by realistic models of first-order phase transitions or primordial black holes (PBH) with LISA can constrain the parameters down to a value of $\kappa_1,\,\kappa_2\lesssim 10^{-56}\,\text{kg}\,\text{m}^2\text{s}^{-3}$.</description>

Abstract: In a project with Gordon Semenoff on 1+1 dimensional QCD many years ago (when he was my postdoc advisor), we stumbled over a method to solve Calogero-Moser-Sutherland models using gauge theories. Since then, these models have reappeared in different forms in many of my research projects. In this contribution, I describe a recent such project where a second quantization of the elliptic Calogero-Sutherland model led us to a new soliton equation and a non-relativistic variant of the Coleman correspondence.

      <title>The Quintom theory of dark energy after DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations from DESI DR2 are challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm by suggesting that the equation-of-state parameter of dark energy evolves across $w = -1$, a phenomenon known as the Quintom scenario. Inspired by this development, we present a staged review of Quintom cosmology including its theoretical foundations, observational supports, and implications as well as possible extensions. We first trace the historical progression from Einstein's static cosmological constant to modern dynamical dark energy, summarizing recent cosmological constraints that favor an evolving $w(z)$ along time. A key focus is the theoretical no-go theorem for dark energy showing that no single canonical field or perfect fluid model can smoothly cross the $w = -1$ boundary. We then survey viable Quintom constructions, including two-field models, single-scalar fields with higher derivatives, modified gravity frameworks, and an effective field theory approach that unifies these mechanisms. Possible interactions of Quintom fields with ordinary matter and the potential roles in yielding non-singular universe solutions are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete Lagrangian describing axion interactions with pseudoscalar and (axial-)vector mesons within the three light-flavor quark framework. This formulation incorporates both the standard chiral Lagrangian and the full Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term. By including instanton effects associated with the anomalous $U(1)_A$ symmetry, we demonstrate that physical observables remain invariant under arbitrary chiral phase rotations of the quark fields. This comprehensive Lagrangian provides a robust and consistent framework for exploring axion phenomenology through its interactions with mesons and gauge bosons. As a demonstration, we compute the decay widths of GeV-scale axions into various mesonic final states for several benchmark axion models.</description>

      <title>Novel methodology to obtain transonic solutions for dissipative flows around compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions around compact objects is reported here. A unified methodology to obtain accretion as well as wind solutions around these objects has been presented. Flows around compact objects are dissipative, and the conservation equations are therefore stiff. In such conditions, obtaining of sonic point(s) and hence, the transonic solution is not trivial. The conserved equations of motion fail to integrate in the presence of realistic viscosity, thereby making it difficult to obtain a global solution. This inhibits one from getting an actual picture of an astrophysical flow. The current work addresses this long-standing issue of obtaining solutions for both accretion and wind. The methodology developed utilises the inner boundary conditions and takes recourse to implicit-explicit (ImEx) integration schemes, to obtain general global transonic accretion and wind solutions. This is the first time such an attempt has been made. Current work considers the different cooling processes like bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and their inverse-Comptonizations, which are found to affect the thermodynamics of the flow. This methodology could successfully generate all topologies of global solutions, multiple sonic point regime, as well as shocks. A broad parameter space study has been done in this work. In an upcoming part II of the paper, a detailed discussion on the spectra and luminosity of the accretion and wind solutions has been presented.</description>

Abstract: The eigenvalues of the Laplace-Beltrami operator and the integrals of products of eigenfunctions and holomorphic $s$-differentials satisfy certain consistency conditions on closed hyperbolic surfaces. These consistency conditions can be derived by using spectral decompositions to write quadruple overlap integrals in terms of triple overlap integrals in different ways. We show how to efficiently construct these consistency conditions and use them to derive upper bounds on eigenvalues, following the approach of the conformal bootstrap. As an example of such a bootstrap bound, we find a numerical upper bound on the spectral gap of closed orientable hyperbolic surfaces that is nearly saturated by the Bolza surface.</description>

Abstract: The two-dimensional causal dynamical triangulations ($2$d CDT) is a lattice model of quantum geometry. In $2$d CDT, one can deal with the quantum effects analytically and explore the physics through the continuum limit.

      <description>arXiv:2405.21057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regge poles connect the analytic structure of scattering amplitudes, analytically continued in spin, to the high-energy limit in momentum space. Dual models are expected to have only Regge poles, and string theory suggests there should be an infinite number of them. In this study, we investigate the number of Regge trajectories these models may have. We prove, based solely on crossing symmetry and unitarity, that meromorphic amplitudes, with or without subtractions, cannot produce a reggeizing amplitude if they contain any finite number of Regge trajectories. We argue that this should exclude the existence of such amplitudes altogether. Additionally, we develop and apply a linear programming dual bootstrap method to exclude these amplitudes directly in momentum space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study scattering amplitudes in massless non-abelian gauge theory where all outgoing gluons have positive helicity. It has been argued recently by Costello that for a particular fermion representation (8 fundamentals plus one antisymmetric-tensor representation in $SU(N)$) the one-loop amplitudes vanish identically. We show that this vanishing leads to previously-observed identities among one-loop color-ordered partial amplitudes. We then turn to two loops, where Costello has computed the all-plus amplitudes for this theory, as rational functions of the kinematics for any number of gluons using the celestial chiral algebra (CCA) bootstrap. We show that in dimensional regularization, these two-loop amplitudes are not rational, and they are not even finite as $\epsilon\to0$. However, the finite remainder for four gluons agrees with the formula by Costello. In addition, we provide a mass regulator for the infrared-divergent loop integrals; with this regulator, the CCA bootstrap formula is recovered exactly. Finally, we use the CCA bootstrap to compute the double-trace terms in the theory at two loops for an arbitrary number of gluons.</description>

Abstract: We define a relational notion of a subsystem in theories of matrix quantum mechanics and show how the corresponding entanglement entropy can be given as a minimisation, exhibiting many similarities to the Ryu-Takayanagi formula. Our construction brings together the physics of entanglement edge modes, noncommutative geometry and quantum internal reference frames, to define a subsystem whose reduced state is (approximately) an incoherent sum of density matrices, corresponding to distinct spatial subregions. We show that in states where geometry emerges from semiclassical matrices, this sum is dominated by the subregion with minimal boundary area. As in the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, it is the computation of the entanglement that determines the subregion. We find that coarse-graining is essential in our microscopic derivation, in order to control the proliferation of highly curved and disconnected non-geometric subregions in the sum.</description>

      <title>Quantum Inhomogeneous Field Theory: Unruh-Like Effects and Bubble Wall Friction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a free scalar field in a specific (1+1)-dimensional curved spacetime. By introducing an algebraic state that is locally Hadamard, we derive the renormalized Wightman function and explicitly calculate the covariantly conserved quantum energy-momentum tensor up to a relevant order. From this result, we show that the Hadamard renormalization scheme, which has been effective in traditional quantum field theory in curved spacetime, is also applicable in the quantum inhomogeneous field theory. As applications of this framework, we show the existence of an Unruh-like effect for an observer slightly out of the right asymptotic region, as well as a quantum frictional effect on the bubble wall expansion during the electroweak phase transition in the early universe. Consequently, this study validates the consistency of our method for constructing meaningful physical quantities in quantum inhomogeneous field theory.</description>

      <title>Multi-invariants and Bulk Replica Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the question of replica symmetry in the bulk for multi-partite entanglement measures in the vacuum state of two dimensional holographic CFTs. We first define a class of multi-partite local unitary invariants, multi-invariants, with a given replica symmetry that acts freely and transitively on the replicas. We look for a subclass of measures such that the dual bulk geometry also preserves replica symmetry. We obtain the most general solution to this problem if we require the bulk to preserve replica symmetry for general configurations of the regions. Orbifolding the bulk solution with the replica symmetry gives us a bulk geometry with a network of conical singularities. Our approach makes it clear that there are infinitely many infinitely large families of multi-invariants such that each family evaluates identically on the holographic state. Geometrically, these are equalities involving volumes of handlebodies, possibly of different genus, at particular points in the moduli space. In certain cases, we check our bulk computation with an explicit calculation in CFT. Finally we comment on the generalization to higher dimension.</description>

Abstract: We propose a numerical method to estimate one-point functions and the free-energy density of conformal field theories at finite temperature by solving the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger condition for the two-point functions of identical scalars. We apply the method for the critical O(N) model for N = 1,2,3 in 3 $\leq$ d $\leq$ 4. We find agreement with known results from Monte Carlo simulations and previous results for the 3d Ising model, and we provide new predictions for N = 2,3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00369v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $N \times N$ Hermitian one-matrix model modified by the double-trace interaction. It is known that the coupling for the double-trace interaction can control the weight for the microscopic wormholes if interpreting the matrix model as the lattice model of random surface; tuning the coupling to its critical value, the effect of wormholes become substantial to change the critical behavior of the pure $2$D quantum gravity, which is characterized by a certain positive value of the string susceptibility. In the large-$N$ limit, we calculate the continuum limit of the disk amplitude in which the wormhole effects are important. The resulting continuum disk amplitude is the same as that of the pure $2$D quantum gravity. We also introduce the renormalized coupling for the double-trace interaction, and show that the newly introduced renormalized coupling can alter the renormalized bulk cosmological constant effectively.</description>

Abstract: Four-point gluon and graviton correlators in celestial holography are famously non-analytic, having distributional support. In this work, we propose an alternative graviton correlator that is analytic and displays several desirable properties. We compute the four-point correlator involving one graviton shadow operator and three graviton primary operators from the celestial four-point graviton amplitudes at tree-level. We perform the conformal block decomposition for the shadow correlator in the compatible channel. For the case when the shadow operator is conformally soft, we compute the single-valued completion of the shadow correlator and perform the conformal block decomposition of the single-valued shadow correlator in all channels. We find an integral representation of the single-valued shadow correlator, which allows us to invert the shadow transform to find the single-valued celestial graviton amplitude. We study various properties of the single-valued celestial graviton amplitude. Interestingly, it exhibits a double copy structure in relation to its counterpart gluon amplitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT correspondence, a topological symmetry operator of the boundary CFT is dual to a dynamical brane in the gravitational bulk. Said differently, this predicts a dynamical brane for every global symmetry of the boundary CFT. We analyze this correspondence for continuous symmetries which arise from a consistent truncation of isometries on the "internal" factor $X$ of $\text{AdS}\times X$. In the extra-dimensional geometry, these branes are associated with various metric singularities and do not arise from wrapped D-branes. Boosts relate configurations interpreted as topological symmetry operators and heavy defects in the CFT. From the perspective of the AdS factor, with gravity and bulk gauge fields, these are codimension two Gukov-Witten-like vortex configurations which are the gravity duals of 0-form symmetry operators. These effective branes come with an asymptotic tension and size which is also fully fixed by bulk dynamics. We use this higher-dimensional perspective to determine properties of the worldvolume theory for these branes. We also discuss how these considerations generalize to more general QFTs engineered via string theory which need not possess a semi-classical gravity dual.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric orbifold CFTs contain twist operators that can join and split copies of the CFT. In this paper, we study the effects of four twist-2 operators on two copies of a single free boson. A recent study analyzed their effects on the vacuum, finding a nontrivial left-right mixing that arises from the fact that the covering surface is a torus, while the effects of one or two twist-2 operators do not produce such mixing. Here, we extend this analysis to excited states and find a similar left-right mixing. Furthermore, we explore the continuum, or high-energy, limit and show that the left-right mixing becomes negligible in this limit.</description>

      <title>A new framework for classical double copies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double copy relates gauge and gravitational theories, with widespread application to quantum scattering amplitudes and classical perturbative results. It also connects exact classical solutions of abelian gauge and gravitational theories in a small number of specific examples, known as classical double copies. These have a number of special properties, such as being algebraically special, and it remains an open question examples exist for algebraically general spacetimes or with nontrivial dynamics. Here we provide a novel framework for understanding classical double copies at the level of the metric, both organizing the known examples and exploring their properties under a new lens. Utilizing Killing vectors as natural gauge fields on a spacetime, we propose a procedure for generating new classical double copies. As a proof of concept, we provide a flat space single copy for the Kasner metric, an algebraically general spacetime. This example is also a double copy at the level of its curvature, and provides the first type I Weyl double copy on flat spacetime, confirming expectations from perturbation theory. This provides a promising avenue for extending exact double copies to a broader class of general, physically relevant spacetimes.</description>

      <title>On world-sheet S-matrix of NSR string in static gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As was shown in arXiv:1203.1054, expanding the Nambu action near the "long string" vacuum in the static gauge one finds that the one-loop 2 to 2 scattering amplitude of the $D-2=24$ transverse 2d fluctuations $X^i$ is given by a pure phase expression consistent with underlying integrability. Similar computation in the Green-Schwarz superstring was carried out in arXiv:2404.09658. Here we consider the case of the NSR string starting with its manifestly 2d covariant action given by $D$ scalar multiplets coupled to 2d supergravity. Eliminating the zweibein and gravitino fields is non-trivial, and a Nambu-like formulation of the spinning string involving only scalar coordinates and their 2d fermionic partners has not previously been available. We show how the auxiliary fields can be eliminated in static gauge after a specific choice of superconformal gauge for the fermions, while keeping the transverse fields $X^i$ and $\psi^i$ off-shell. The resulting one-loop S-matrix for $X^i$ is found, as expected, to be the same as in the GS superstring case. We also discuss similar actions for the heterotic string and a $T\bar T$ deformation of free 2d scalar multiplet.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of dark energy during the matter-dominated era through spontaneous cosmological scalarization
  in the scalar-Ricci-Gauss-Bonnet model.Our model aligns with the conjecture that the speed of gravitational waves at low
  redshifts is nearly equal to the speed of light, implying that the Gauss-Bonnet invariant does not directly contribute to late-time
  acceleration and suggesting that scalarization begins in the radiation-dominated era. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling stabilizes the quintessence
  field at an initial fixed point with negligible dark energy density during the radiation era. As the Universe expands, the Ricci coupling induces a tachyonic transition in the quintessence field, driving the evolution of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum gravity has long remained elusive from an observational standpoint. Developing effective cosmological models motivated by the fundamental aspects of quantum gravity is crucial for bridging theory with observations. One key aspect is the granularity of spacetime, which suggests that free particles would deviate from classical geodesics by following a covariant Brownian motion. This notion is further supported by swerves models in causal set theory, a discrete approach to quantum gravity. At an effective level, such deviations are described by a stochastic correction to the geodesic equation. We show that the form of this correction is strictly restricted by covariance and the mass-shell condition. Under minimal coupling to curvature, the resulting covariant Brownian motion is unique. The process is equivalently described by a covariant diffusion equation for the distribution of massive particles in their relativistic phase space. When applied to dark matter particles, covariant Brownian motion results in spontaneous warming at late times, suppressing the matter power spectrum at small scales in a time-dependent manner. Using bounds on the diffusion rate from CMB and growth history measurements of $f\sigma_8$, we show that the model offers a resolution to the $S_8$ tension. Future studies on the model's behavior at non-linear cosmological scales will provide further constraints and, therefore, critical tests for the viability of stochastic dark matter.</description>

Abstract: Scrambling unitary dynamics in a quantum system transmutes local quantum information into a non-local web of correlations which manifests itself in a complex spatio-temporal pattern of entanglement. In such a context, we show there can exist three distinct dynamical phases characterised by qualitatively different forms of quantum correlations between two disjoint subsystems of the system. Transitions between these phases are driven by the relative sizes of the subsystems and the degree scrambling that the dynamics effects. Besides a phase which has no quantum correlations as manifested by vanishing entanglement between the parts and a phase which has non-trivial quantum correlations quantified by a finite entanglement monotone, we reveal a new phase transition within the entangled phase which separates phases wherein the quantum correlations are invisible or visible to measurements on one of the subsystems. This is encoded in the qualitatively different properties of the ensemble of states on one of the subsystems conditioned on the various measurement outcomes on the other subsystem. This provides a new characterisation of entanglement phases in terms of their response to measurements instead of the more ubiquitous measurement-induced entanglement transitions. Our results have implications for the kind of tasks that can be performed using measurement feedback within the framework of quantum interactive dynamics.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Probes of Non-Standard Thermal Histories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves propagate almost unimpeded from the moment they are generated to the present epoch. Nevertheless, they are subject to convolution with a non-trivial transfer function. Within the standard thermal history, shifts in the temperature-redshift relation combine with damping effects by free streaming neutrinos to non-trivially process different wavelengths during radiation domination, with subsequently negligible effects at later times. Presuming a nearly scale invariant primordial spectrum, one obtains a characteristic late time spectrum, deviations from which would indicate departures from the standard thermal history. Given the paucity of probes of the early universe physics before nucleosynthesis, it is useful to classify how deviations from the standard thermal history of the early universe can be constrained from observations of the late time stochastic background. The late time spectral density has a plateau at high frequencies that can in principle be significantly enhanced or suppressed relative to the standard thermal history depending on the equation of state of the epoch intervening reheating and the terminal phase of radiation domination, imprinting additional features from bursts of entropy production, and additional damping at intermediate scales via anisotropic stress production. In this paper, we survey phenomenologically motivated scenarios of early matter domination, kination, and late time decaying particles as representative non-standard thermal histories, elaborate on their late time stochastic background, and discuss constraints on different model scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles can couple to Standard Model gluons, electroweak gauge bosons, and massive fermions. A future multi-TeV muon collider provides a favorable environment to probe axion-like particles through multiple production channels, including vector boson fusion via electroweak gauge boson couplings and the top-associated production mediated by direct fermionic couplings. Motivated by the quality issue of the QCD axion, we focus on axion-like particles with masses and decay constants around the TeV scale. We explore how different axion-like particle couplings shape its production and decay modes, revealing a rich and intricate phenomenological landscape.</description>

Abstract: Boson stars are hypothetical compact objects derived from solutions of a self-gravitating complex scalar field. In this study, we extend the traditional models by generalizing the kinetic term of the scalar field to that of a nonlinear sigma model. Concretely, we obtain spinning boson star solutions for a family of models parametrized by the curvature of their two-dimensional target manifold, as well as for various self-interaction potentials. We derive the global properties and multipolar structure of these solutions as a function of both the curvature of the target space and the strength of self-interactions. Our results suggest that a nonzero curvature in the target manifold can have a significant impact on the structure of the solutions, allowing for a range of notably different masses and degrees of compactness. However, we find that the relations between different multipoles are consistent with those for the standard complex scalar stars, and hence the universality of such relations is extended to curved target spaces.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.</description>
