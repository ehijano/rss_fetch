      <title>Decomposition of Symmetrical Classes of Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study central configurations when the set of positions is symmetric. We use a theorem from representation theory of finite groups to explore the symmetry properties of equations for central configurations. This approach simplifies equations for central configurations by considering arbitrary numbers of bodies, symmetry groups, and dimensions. We discuss how to use this theorem to obtain a more refined decomposition of the equations than that given before. The decomposition presented here uses the symmetry-adapted basis method. As an application, we give a complete description of the existence and which masses are possible for central configurations of two nested regular tetrahedrons, two nested regular octahedrons, and two nested regular cubes. To do this, we employ some methods of rational parameterizations and isolation of zeros of multivariate polynomials. The decomposition obtained allows symbolic calculations to be used to study the expressions. This way, we summarize previous discussions and extend them by completing the analysis on the cube case, for both the inverse and direct problems.</description>

      <title>Multicycle dynamics and high-codimension bifurcations in SIRS epidemic models with cubic psychological saturated incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates bifurcation dynamics in an SIRS epidemic model with cubic saturated incidence, extending the quadratic saturation framework established by Lu, Huang, Ruan, and Yu (Journal of Differential Equations, 267, 2019). We rigorously prove the existence of codimension-three Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations and degenerate Hopf bifurcations, demonstrating, for the first time in epidemiological modeling, the coexistence of three limit cycles. By innovatively applying singularity theory, we characterize the topology of the bifurcation set through the local unfolding of singularities and the identification of nondegenerate singularities for fronts. Our results reveal that cubic nonlinearities induce significantly richer dynamical structures than quadratic models under both monotonic and nonmonotonic saturation. Numerical simulations verify three limit cycles in monotonic parameter regimes and two limit cycles in nonmonotonic regimes. This work advances existing bifurcation research by incorporating higher-order interactions and comprehensive singularity analysis, thereby providing a mathematical foundation for decoding complex transmission mechanisms that are critical to the design of public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Temperature-Humidity Coupling Dynamics of Soybean Pod Borer Population and Assessing the Predictive Performance of the PCM-NN Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Against the backdrop of global climate change and agricultural globalization, soybean production is increasingly threatened by pest outbreaks, with Leguminivora glycinivorella (commonly known as the soybean pod borer) being a major pest species. This pest is widely distributed, particularly in northeastern China, the country's primary soybean-producing region, where its outbreaks have significantly affected both yield and quality. Although statistical and mechanistic models have been applied to pest forecasting, existing approaches often fail to effectively integrate climatic factors with pest dynamics and lack sufficient expressive power. To address these limitations, this study proposes a novel pest prediction method based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). Specifically, we formulate a logistic-type ordinary differential equation (ODE) that incorporates microclimate factors, temperature, humidity, and time, to describe the temporal dynamics of the soybean pod borer population. This ODE model is embedded into the PINN framework to develop the Pest Correlation Model Neural Network (PCM-NN), which is used to jointly infer the microclimate-driven parameter function alpha(T, H, t) and fit the pest population dynamics. We evaluate PCM-NN using daily monitoring data of soybean pod borer collected in Changchun, Jilin Province, from July to September during 2020-2023. Experimental results demonstrate that PCM-NN preserves biological interpretability while exhibiting strong nonlinear representational capacity, offering a feasible pathway for pest modeling and forecasting under multi-factor climatic conditions. This approach provides valuable support for agricultural pest monitoring, prevention, and control strategies.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-independent model reductions of chemical reaction networks based on geometric singular perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quasi-steady-state approximation (QSSA) is a standard technique for reducing the complexity of chemical reaction networks (CRNs). The validity of any QSSA-based model is restricted to specific parameter regimes, which often overlap, meaning multiple different reduced models can be simultaneously valid. This ambiguity complicates unnecessarily the analysis, as selecting the appropriate reduction is not always straightforward.
  Here, we employ a more powerful alternative: coordinate-independent geometric singular perturbation theory (ci-GSPT) accompanied by the parametrization method. A key advantage of this framework is its ability to derive reduced models independent of a clear timescale separation in the variables which, in turn, means less-restricted parameter regimes. We demonstrate our approach on two benchmark systems. For the Michaelis-Menten (MM) reaction, we derive a unique model reduction for normally hyperbolic and attracting critical manifolds of a specific parameter configuration. We systematically explore parameter configurations across three orders of magnitude: asymptotically large, small, and `order one'. Hence, we provide distinct model reductions for: (i) 14 relevant parameter configurations of the irreversible reaction scheme and (ii) 25 for the reversible reaction scheme (other parameter configurations where there are trivial reductions or degeneracies in critical manifolds, are discussed briefly). For the more complex Kim-Forger model, we provide a new reduction without the need of a coordinate transformation showcasing the method's applicability to larger systems.</description>

      <title>Floquet stability of periodically stationary pulses in a short-pulse fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantitative modeling and design of modern short-pulse fiber lasers cannot be performed with averaged models because of large variations in the pulse parameters within each round trip. Instead, lumped models obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser are required. Since the optical pulses in lumped models are periodic, their linear stability is investigated using the monodromy operator, which is the linearization of the roundtrip operator about the pulse. A gradient-based optimization method is developed to discover periodic pulses. The computation of the gradient of the objective function involves numerical computation of the action of both the round trip operator and the adjoint of the monodromy operator. A novel Fourier split-step method is introduced to compute solutions of the linearization of the nonlinear, nonlocal, stiff equation that models optical propagation in the fiber amplifier. This method is derived by linearizing the two solution operators in a split-step method for the nonlinear equation. The spectrum of the monodromy operator consists of the essential spectrum, for which there is an analytical formula, and the eigenvalues. There is a multiplicity two eigenvalue at $\lambda=1$, which is due to phase and translation invariance. The remaining eigenvalues are determined from a matrix discretization of the monodromy operator. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the numerical methods, show examples of periodically stationary pulses, their spectra and eigenfunctions, and discuss their stability.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous linearization and centralizers of parabolic self-maps I: zero hyperbolic step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi:\mathbb D \to \mathbb D$ be a parabolic self-map of the unit disc $\mathbb D$ having zero hyperbolic step. We study holomorphic self-maps of $\mathbb D$ commuting with $\varphi$. In particular, we answer a question from Gentili and Vlacci (1994) by proving that $\psi\in\mathsf{Hol(\mathbb D,\mathbb D)}$ commutes with $\varphi$ if and only if the two self-maps have the same Denjoy-Wolff point and $\psi$ is a pseudo-iterate of $\varphi$ in the sense of Cowen. Moreover, we show that the centralizer of $\varphi$, i.e. the semigroup $\mathcal Z_\forall(\varphi):=\{\psi:\psi\circ\varphi=\varphi\circ\psi\}$ is commutative. We also prove that if $\varphi$ is univalent, then all elements of $\mathcal Z_\forall(\varphi)$ are univalent as well, and if $\varphi$ is not univalent, then the identity map is an isolated point of $\mathcal Z_\forall(\varphi)$. The main tool is the machinery of simultaneous linearization, which we develop using holomorphic models for iteration of non-elliptic self-maps originating in works of Cowen and Pommerenke.</description>

      <title>A nonstandard finite difference scheme for an SEIQR epidemiological PDE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02928v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence of Liouvillan solutions in the Hess-Sretensky case of the problem of motion of a gyrostat with a fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1890 W. Hess found the new special case of integrability of the Euler - Poisson equations of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point. In 1963 L.N. Sretensky proved that the special case of integrability, similar to the Hess case, also exists in the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat - a heavy rigid body with a fixed point, which contains a rotating homogeneous rotor. Further numerous generalizations of the classical Hess case were proposed, which take place during the motion of a heavy rigid body and a gyrostat with a fixed point in various force fields.
  The first studies that provided a qualitative description of the motion of a heavy rigid body in the integrable Hess case were published almost immediately after this case was found. In 1892 P.A. Nekrasov proved, that the solution of the problem of motion of a heavy rigid body with a fixed point in the Hess case is reduced to the integration the second order linear homogeneous differential equation with variable coefficients. A similar result regarding the problem of the motion of a heavy gyrostat in the Hess - Sretensky case was presented by Sretensky.
  In this paper we present the derivation of the corresponding second order linear differential equation and reduce the coefficients of this equation to the form of rational functions. Then, using the Kovacic algorithm we study the problem of the existence of liouvillian solutions of the corresponding second order linear differential equation. We obtain the conditions for the parameters of the problem, under which the liouvillian solutions of the corresponding linear differential equation exist. Under these conditions equations of motion of a heavy gyrostat with a fixed point in the Hess - Sretensky case can be integrated in quadratures.</description>

      <title>Iterates of post-critically finite polynomials of the form $\boldsymbol{x^d+c}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fix a prime number $d$. The post-critically finite polynomials of the form $f_{d,c} = x^d+c\in \mathbb{C}[x]$ play a fundamental role in polynomial dynamics. While many results are known in the complex dynamical setting, much less is understood about the arithmetic properties of these polynomials. In this paper, we describe the factorization of the iterates of post-critically finite polynomials $f_{d,c}$ over their fields of definition. As a consequence, we prove new cases of a conjecture of Andrews and Petsche on abelian arboreal Galois representations.</description>

      <title>A dimensional mass transference principle from balls to open sets and applications to dynamical Diophantine approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass transference principle of Beresnevich and Velani is a powerful mechanism for determining the Hausdorff dimension/measure of $\limsup$ sets that arise naturally in Diophantine approximation. However, in the setting of dynamical Diophantine approximation, this principle often fails to apply effectively, as the radii of the balls defining the dynamical $\limsup$ sets generally depend on the orbit of the point $x$ itself.
  In this paper, we develop a dimensional mass transference principle that enables us to recover and extend classical results on shrinking target problems, particularly for the $\beta$-transformation and the Gauss map. Moreover, our result shows that the corresponding $\limsup$ sets have large intersection properties. A potentially interesting feature of our method is that, in many cases, shrinking target problems are closely related to finding an appropriate Gibbs measure, which may reveal new aspects of the link between thermodynamic formalism and dynamical Diophantine approximation.</description>

      <title>On the Fourier transform of random Bernoulli convolutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate random Bernoulli convolutions, namely, probability measures given by the infinite convolution
  \[
  \mu_\omega = \mathop{\circledast}_{k=1}^{\infty} \left( \frac{\delta_0 + \delta_{\lambda_1 \lambda_2 \ldots \lambda_{k-1} \lambda_k}}{2} \right),
  \] where $\omega=(\lambda_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables each following the uniform distribution on some fixed interval. We study the regularity of these measures and prove that when $\exp\mathbb{E}\left( \log \lambda_1\right)&gt;\frac{2}{\pi}, $ the Fourier transform $\widehat{\mu}_\omega$ is an $L^{1}$ function almost surely. This in turn implies that the corresponding random self-similar set supporting $\mu_{\omega}$ has non-empty interior almost surely. This improves upon a previous bound due to Peres, Simon and Solomyak. Furthermore, under no assumptions on the value of $\exp \mathbb{E}(\log \lambda_1), $ we prove that $\widehat \mu_\omega$ will decay to zero at a polynomial rate almost surely.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the global dynamics of Halley's method applied to complex polynomials. Specifically, we analyze the structure and connectivity of the Julia set of this method. The convergence behavior, symmetry properties, and topological features of the corresponding Fatou and Julia sets are studied for various classes of polynomials, including unicritical, cubic, and quartic polynomials with non-trivial symmetry groups. In particular, we prove that the Halley's method $H_p$ is convergent, its Julia set is connected, the immediate basins are unbounded and the symmetry group of it coincides with that of the polynomial whenever $p$ belongs to one of the above classes. We further extend our results to a broader class of polynomials. It is shown that the immediate basin of the Halley's method $H_p$ corresponding to a root of $p$ can be bounded. We also make some remarks on the dynamics of the Halley's method applied to a cubic polynomial in general.</description>

      <title>Liouville property for groups and conformal dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14545v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal dimension is a fundamental invariant of metric spaces, particularly suited to the study of self-similar spaces, such as spaces with an expanding self-covering (e.g. Julia sets of complex rational functions). The dynamics of these systems are encoded by the associated iterated monodromy groups, which are examples of contracting self-similar groups. Their amenability is a well-known open question. We show that if $G$ is an iterated monodromy group, and if the (Alfhors-regular) conformal dimension of the underlying space is strictly less than 2, then every symmetric random walk with finite second moment on $G$ has the Liouville property. As a corollary, every such group is amenable. This criterion applies to all examples of contracting groups previously known to be amenable, and to many new ones. In particular, it implies that for every sub-hyperbolic complex rational function $f$ whose Julia set is not the whole sphere, the iterated monodromy group of $f$ is amenable.</description>

Abstract: Our main result is that chaos in dimension $n+1$ is a one-dimensional geometrical object embedded in a geometrical object of dimension $n$ which corresponds to a $n$ dimensional object which is either singular or non-singular. Our main result is then that this chaos occurs in the first case as either on an isolated or non-isolated singularity. In the first case this chaos is either boundary chaos or spherical chaos which is what happens also in the non-singular case. In the case of an isolated singular geometry one has chaos which can either be boundary, spherical or tubular chaos. We furthermore prove that the prime numbers display quantum behaviour.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of determining self-sustained oscillations in discrete-time linear time-invariant relay feedback systems. Concretely, we are interested in predicting when such a system admits unimodal oscillations, i.e., when the output has a single-peaked period. Under the assumption that the linear system is stable and has an impulse response that is strictly monotonically decreasing on its infinite support, we take a novel approach in using the framework of total positivity to address our main question. It is shown that unimodal self-oscillations can only exist if the number of positive and negative elements in a period coincides. Based on this result, we derive conditions for the existence of such oscillations, determine bounds on their periods, and address the question of uniqueness.</description>
