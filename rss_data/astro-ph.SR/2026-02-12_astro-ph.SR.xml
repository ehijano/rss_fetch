      <title>A method for constructing the joint mass function of binary stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) describes the distribution of stellar masses in a population of newly born stars and is amongst the most fundamental concepts in astrophysics. It is not only the direct result of the star formation process but it also explains the evolution of galaxies' luminosities, metal yields, star-formation efficiencies, and supernova production rates. Because most stars exist in binary systems, however, a full statistical account of stellar mass requires not the IMF but rather the joint distribution of a binary population's primary- and secondary-star masses. This joint distribution must respect the IMF of the stars from which the population has been assembled as well as the distribution of mass ratios that results from the assembly mechanism. Despite its importance, this joint distribution is known only in the case of random pairing. Here we present a method for constructing it in the general case. We also illustrate the use of our method by recovering the known result for random pairing and by finding the previously unknown result for uniform pairing.</description>

      <title>Modern tidal interaction models for rapid binary population synthesis: I. Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an updated prescription of contemporary tidal dissipation theory adapted for rapid binary population synthesis. Our simplified expressions encode the dependence of tidal dissipation on stellar structure, stratification, and tidal forcing frequency, while remaining computationally efficient. We implement these prescriptions in the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS, and demonstrate the self-consistent coupling of tides with stellar evolution and binary properties such as orbital periods, spins, and eccentricities for several representative binary systems. When compared with commonly used tidal prescriptions, our equilibrium tidal dissipation efficiencies can be stronger by 1-2 orders of magnitude for low mass main sequence and giant type stars, and dynamical tides can be stronger by 1-7 orders of magnitude due to the explicit dependence on internal stellar structure and the presence of inertial wave dissipation. Despite our simplistic approach, our models agree with detailed stellar simulations to within an order of magnitude across tidal dissipation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Unstable Mass Transfer in Interacting Binaries and Its Imprint on the Population of Luminous Red Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common-envelope (CE) phase occurs when a star engulfs its companion and is widely considered the primary channel for producing Luminous Red Novae (LRNe). In this study, we combine binary-population synthesis with stellar-evolution calculations to systematically estimate the mass, velocity, and launching radius of ejecta produced during coalescence across a range of binary configurations. Our aim is to quantify how unstable mass-transfer dynamics in binaries at various evolutionary stages shape CE outcomes, enabling a predictive framework for modeling the LRN luminosity function. We find a bimodal distribution of plateau luminosities with significant implications for binary mass stability criteria that can be tested with forthcoming LSST observations. This bimodality emerges from differing mass-ejection outcomes during common-envelope interactions, which can lead either to stellar mergers, often accompanied by tidal disruption of the companion, or to successful envelope ejection. Although our predicted plateau luminosities and timescales broadly match existing observations, the models underpredict the number of LRNe with long-duration plateaus ($t_p \gtrsim 100\, \text{d}$) by about a third. We propose that these long-duration events arise from highly extended progenitors whose envelopes are ejected over multiple orbits (i.e., non-impulsively), producing relatively faint, long-lived transients. By constraining ejecta properties and incorporating pre-outburst progenitor imaging, we show how our models can clarify the physical processes that drive unstable mass transfer in these events. Finally, we argue that common-envelope interactions involving white-dwarf accretors can yield exotic outcomes, including red giants containing embedded white dwarfs that resemble Thorne-\.{Z}ytk\'ow objects (T\.ZOs), along with calcium-rich supernovae that preserve hydrogen envelopes.</description>

      <title>Linking Solar Magnetism, Extreme Solar Particle Events and Stellar Superflares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic field of the Sun drives a wide range of eruptive phenomena, from small-scale nanoflares to large flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs). While direct observations of solar activity cover only the past few decades, indirect evidence indicates that the Sun can occasionally produce events orders of magnitude stronger than any recorded ones in the modern era. Two complementary lines of evidence exist. First, extreme solar particle events (ESPEs) have been inferred from prominent spikes in cosmogenic isotope concentrations preserved in precisely dated natural archives such as tree rings and ice cores over the past 15 millennia. Second, high-precision space-borne photometry has revealed superflares on thousands of stars similar to the Sun. Whether these solar and stellar extremes are physically related remains an open question. We summarise the present state of understanding and discuss physical mechanisms that may link them. Although superflares and ESPEs are both extremely energetic manifestations of magnetic energy storage and release, their relationship does not appear to be one-to-one. Their occurrence and energetics likely depend on how magnetic flux and topology govern the partitioning of released energy between radiation, mass ejection, and particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Solar Wind Heating Near the Sun: A Radial Evolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the plasma state in the near-Sun environment is essential to constrain the mechanisms that heat and accelerate the solar wind. In this study, we use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations from Encounters 1 through 24 to investigate the radial evolution of solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties in this region. Using intervals with high field-of-view ($&gt;85\%$) coverage, we derive the radial profiles of magnetic field strength ($|B|$), proton density ($N$), bulk speed ($V$), total proton temperature ($T$), parallel ($T_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($T_\perp$) temperatures, temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$), plasma beta ($\beta$), Alfv\'{e}n Mach number ($M_A$), and magnetic field fluctuations ($\delta B/B$) for sub and super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions. In super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions, power-law of $|B|$, $N$, $V$, and $T$ as a function of heliocentric distance are broadly consistent with previous \textit{Helios} results at $&gt;0.3$ AU. The radial evolution of the components of the temperature tensor reveals distinct behavior: $T_\perp$ decreases monotonically with distance, whereas $T_\parallel$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend -- decreasing in the sub-Alfv\'{e}nic region, increasing just beyond the Alfv\'{e}n surface. We interpret the increase in $T_\parallel$ as a proxy for proton beam occurrence. We further examine the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations, finding decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction. These fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>Evidence that SOL2012-06-03 Late Phase $\gamma$ Rays are Produced by $&gt;$300 MeV Protons from CME-Shock Acceleration of Suprathermals from the Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent paper on SOL2012-06-03 reported the detection for the first time of two distinct phases of $&gt;$100 MeV $\gamma$-radiation indicating separate acceleration processes. But such two-phase emission has been seen before and was first observed in SOL1982-06-03. The second phase is known as Late Phase Gamma-Ray Emission (LPGRE) and was cataloged for $&gt;$40 solar eruptions, including SOL2012-06-03. Here we provide evidence that the second SOL2012-06-03 $\pi$-decay peak is the onset of LPGRE that lasted for $&gt;$8 min. Its delay from the impulsive X-ray peak is consistent with the time it would take flare-produced suprathermal protons to overtake the expanding CME and be accelerated by its shock. The high accelerated ion-to-electron ratio in SOL2012-06-03 and other LPGRE events is consistent with the ratio observed in gradual SEP events produced by shocks and is inconsistent with ratios typically found in impulsive flares and solar energetic particle events produced by reconnection.</description>

      <title>Re-visiting the Canis Major star-forming region with Gaia data release 3 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The Canis Major (CMa) star-forming region, a remote molecular cloud complex within the recently discovered Radcliffe Wave, remains under-explored in the literature. Aims: We revisit the stellar census in the CMa region, characterizing its stellar population, kinematics, and age using recent astrometric and photometric data from the third data release of the Gaia space mission (Gaia DR3). Methods: We conducted a membership analysis of Gaia DR3 sources across a 16 deg$^2$ field encompassing the youngest subgroups in CMa. This new stellar census, combined with spectroscopic observations, allowed us to investigate the structure, kinematics, and age of this region. Results: We identified 1531 objects as members of the CMa region, confirming 401 previously known members and introducing 1130 new candidate members. These objects have magnitudes ranging from 10 to 18 mag in the G band from Gaia DR3. We identified two subgroups of CMa stars in our sample labelled as Cluster A and Cluster B. They are located at roughly the same distance ($d_{A} = 1150^{+79}_{-88}$ pc and $d_{B} = 1183^{+103}_{-108}$ pc) and exhibit similar space motions that can be derived thanks to the precise radial velocities obtained in this study. The subgroups have a mean isochronal age of about 2-3 Myr. However, based on infrared photometry we show that Cluster A has a higher fraction of disc-bearing stars suggesting that it could be somewhat younger than Cluster B. Conclusions: Our analysis provides new insights into the stellar population of the Canis Major region, by identifying new members, characterizing their kinematics, and assessing their evolutionary stages. Future studies incorporating additional data from upcoming Gaia data releases, multi-wavelength and high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be essential to further advance our understanding of the history of star formation in this region.</description>

      <title>Searching for radio emission from stellar wind-magnetosphere interaction or co-rotation breakdown in brown dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the improvements in radio interferometry sensitivity, the quest for coherent radio emission from exoplanets and ultra-cool dwarfs, which is indicative of their magnetic fields, has gained significant momentum in recent years. We investigated the relatively unexplored possibility of radio emission from wide-orbit brown dwarf companions, which may radiate through rapid rotation, as in isolated ultra-cool dwarfs, or via interactions between their extended magnetospheres and the host star's wind. We analysed $\sim 60$ hours of Upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array data for a set of well-characterized systems previously unobserved at 0.3-2 GHz. The targets include companions orbiting the G-type stars HD 26161 and BD-004475, the K-type HD 153557A and $\nu$ Oph, and the M dwarfs GJ 3626 and 2MJ01225093-2439505. No detections were obtained with 3$\sigma$ upper limits down to $\sim 25\,\mu$Jy/beam in Stokes V in the best cases. The light-curve analysis also revealed no evidence of short ($\gtrsim$ minutes), intense ($\gtrsim$ mJy) radio bursts. The upper limits provide tentative constraints on model parameters. However, the effects of model uncertainties, limited observational coverage, and intrinsic variability or beaming of the emission must be considered. The improvement in sensitivity of the next-generation radio interferometers will likely allow to go below the expected flux range over a much larger range of free parameters.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Magnetohydrodynamic Simulation of the Initiation of a Coronal Mass Ejection with Multiple Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are the primary drivers of adverse space-weather events, yet their initiation and onset prediction remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the magnetic topology and physical processes in real solar source regions. Here, based on fully observational-data-driven magnetohydrodynamic simulation, we successfully reproduce the initiation of a CME originating from the super active region AR 13663, with only a one-minute time lag between the flare peak in observations and the velocity peak of the rising flux rope in the simulation. Moreover, the eruptive structure exhibits a multi-stage kinematic evolution: an initial slow acceleration, a plateau at a nearly stationary height, and a subsequent impulsive acceleration. These stages correspond to torus instability, the downward tension force exerted by the overlying toroidal field, and fast magnetic reconnection, respectively. Our results highlight the inherently multistage nature of CME initiation in real events. In configurations with strong overlying toroidal fields, the downward toroidal-field-induced tension force can suppress the rise of the flux rope and produce a plateau phase at a nearly stable height, even when torus instability occurs. In contrast, the subsequent fast magnetic reconnection beneath the flux rope can drive the impulsive eruption more effectively. The close agreement between the observed and simulated peak times over one minute demonstrates the strong potential of our data-driven model for predicting CME onset.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in the High expansion-velocity C-rich evolved star AFGL2233. Isotopic ratios, peculiarities and evolutionary status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High expansion velocity carbon stars (HVCs) are a rare class of evolved stars whose circumstellar envelopes (CSEs) combine C-rich chemistry with unusually high expansion velocities typical of O-rich massive evolved stars. AFGL2233 has been proposed as a high-mass evolved object that exhausted hot-bottom burning. Studying its chemistry is essential to understand the nature and evolution of these objects. We characterize the chemical composition and isotopic ratios of the CSE of AFGL2233 and investigate chemical peculiarities, including the presence of N- and O-bearing species in a C-rich environment. We carried out a complete line survey at 3 mm and 1 mm using the IRAM 30m telescope, complemented by Herschel/HIFI FIR observations and interferometric maps of SiO, C2H, and HCN. Molecular emission was analyzed using rotational diagrams and radiative transfer modeling under the LVG approximation. Column densities and fractional abundances were derived for more than 30 molecular species, including isotopologues, and compared with other evolved stars. The Gaia DR3 distance of 1.236 kpc implies a luminosity of ~2 Lsun, consistent with an initial mass of 4.5-9 Msun. The molecular inventory confirms C-rich chemistry but reveals unusually high abundances of NH3, H2O, and SiN. The isotopic ratios vary among species, with 12C/13C ranging from 7 to 55. The C2H/C4H ratio is abnormally high compared with C-rich AGB stars. The presence of SiN and high NH3 may indicate N-enrichment or the influence of a companion. AFGL2233 is likely a high-mass AGB or super-AGB star with a complex evolutionary history involving nucleosynthesis, shocks, and possible binary interaction.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating thermal instability in a uniform plasma: an extended analysis of instability domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal instability plays a crucial role in the dynamics of astrophysical plasmas. Building upon the foundational work of Field (1965) and the subsequent analysis by Waters and Proga (2019), this study revisits the characteristics of thermal instability in a uniform, non-magnetic medium. Our primary aim is to reevaluate and expand the understanding of instability domains, focusing on the classification and characteristics of thermal and acoustic modes in the presence of heating, radiative cooling, and thermal conduction. Except for Spitzers expression for parallel thermal conductivity, the heating and cooling processes are unspecified. Additionally, we investigate the existence of isobaric and isochoric thermal modes across the extreme limits of very short and very long wavelengths, as well as at intermediate wavelengths. We perform an in-depth analysis of the dispersion relation for an infinite, uniform hydrodynamic medium, as initially derived by Field (1965). This approach enables the generation of growth-rate and dispersion diagrams, providing insight into the behaviour of thermal instability across different wavelength ranges. With the inclusion of thermal conduction, our study refines the classification of the seven instability regions previously outlined by Waters and Proga (2019). Our findings confirm that their classification holds when the Field length is smaller than or comparable to the thermal wavelength. For larger Field lengths, a simplified classification becomes impractical. Furthermore, we discuss the potential implications of the catastrophic cooling instability (Waters and Stricklan 2025) in the context of cool coronal rain formation. Our work not only validates certain classifications, but also proposes new insights into complex instability behaviours, thereby enhancing the theoretical framework established by Field and others.</description>

      <title>A search for new symbiotic stars in the Milky Way: Using machine learning techniques applied to photometric databases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars (SySts) are interacting binaries composed of a red giant transferring material to a hot compact star, typically a white dwarf. Although only about 300 systems are confirmed, the Galactic population is estimated at 1.2 x 10^3 - 1.5 x 10^4, indicating that most remain undiscovered. We identify new SySts using a machine-learning approach that combines Gaia DR3, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, parallaxes, and the pseudo-equivalent width of H alpha. A Random Forest model was trained on 166 confirmed S-type SySts and 1600 non-symbiotic stars, applying SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. The model achieved an F1-score of 89% for the symbiotic class. Applied to 2.5 x 10^6 color-selected sources, it identified 990 candidates with probabilities more than 70%. We further refined the sample using physically motivated cuts on effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and SkyMapper photometry, yielding 12 high-confidence candidates. These objects show cool temperatures, low surface gravities, near-solar metallicity, H alpha emission, moderate-to-high luminosities, and UV excess consistent with S-type SySts. Validation on recently confirmed systems recovered 92.3%, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of our method.</description>

      <title>Observing solar vortices with existing and future instrumentation. Solar Physics International Network for Swirls (SPINS) white paper (Helio)</title>

Abstract: Solar vortices are fundamental components of solar atmospheric dynamics, serving as natural laboratories for magnetic field twisting, energy concentration and transport, wave guidance, and plasma coupling across atmospheric layers. Numerical and observational studies show that solar vortices are intimately connected to key physical processes including magnetic reconnection, atmospheric heating, turbulence, and wave generation. This white paper, prepared for the UK Space Frontiers 2035 call, outline five high-priority scientific questions addressing vortex generation mechanisms, cross-layer coupling, magnetic restructuring, collective wave-guidance structures, and their role in triggering explosive events and modulating the solar wind. Key observations and capabilities required to make significant advancements over the coming decade are identified. The UK solar physics community has established world-leading expertise in vortex dynamics, combining strengths in high-resolution observations, MHD turbulence theory, numerical modelling, and space instrumentation. UK researchers have made foundational contributions to Solar Orbiter, delivered critical systems for DKIST, and maintain active involvement in MUSE and SOLAR-C EUVST missions. Our technical approach centres on developing next-generation instrumentation: a multi-band, space-qualified system employing four tunable Fabry-P\'erot Interferometers providing diffraction-limited, high-cadence spectropolarimetric coverage from the deep photosphere to the low corona. This capability will be validated through a staged mission architecture beginning with balloon-borne demonstrators. Continuing this effort over the coming decade is vital to maintain UK leadership in this field and achieve the goals of roadmap for solar system research.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods for Stellar Collisions. I. Predicting Outcomes of SPH Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar collisions can occur frequently in dense cluster environments, and play a crucial role in producing exotic phenomena from blue stragglers in globular clusters to high-energy transients in galactic nuclei. Successive collisions and mergers of massive stars could also lead to the formation of massive black holes, serving as seeds for supermassive black hole in the early universe. While analytic fitting formulae exist for predicting collision outcomes, they do not generalize across different energy scales or stellar evolutionary phases. Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations are often used to compute the outcomes of stellar collisions, but, even at low resolution, their computational cost makes running on-the-fly calculations during an $N$-body simulation quite challenging. Here we present a new grid of $27,720$ SPH calculations of main-sequence star collisions, spanning a wide range of masses, ages, relative velocities, and impact parameters. Using this grid, we train machine learning models to predict both collision outcomes (merger vs disruption, or flyby) and final remnant masses. We compare the performance of nearest neighbors, support vector machines, and neural networks, achieving classification balanced accuracy of $98.4\%$, and regression relative errors as low as $0.11\%$ and $0.15\%$ for the final stars $1$ and $2$, respectively. We make our trained models publicly available as part of the package collAIder, enabling rapid predictions of stellar collision outcomes in $N$-body models of dense star cluster dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the second set of discoveries from Keck Observations in the INfrared of Taurus and $\rho$ Oph Exoplanets And Ultracool dwarfs (KOINTREAU), an adaptive optics survey of young stars in the Taurus and $\rho$ Oph star-forming regions using Keck/NIRC2 in conjunction with the Keck infrared pyramid wavefront sensor. We have discovered two faint comoving companions to young stars ISO-Oph 96 and 2MASS J16262785-2625152. The companion to ISO-Oph 96, KOINTREAU-3b, is at a projected separation of 340 au (2.49"). Using our NIRC2 photometry and evolutionary models, and assuming that the companion has the same extinction as its host star, we infer that KOINTREAU-3b has a mass of $3.4\pm0.7$ M$_{\rm Jup}$. The companion to 2MASS J16262785-2625152, KOINTREAU-4b, has a projected separation of 180 au (1.25") and could have a mass of either $11.5^{+1.2}_{-1.6}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$ or $15.3^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ M$_{\rm Jup}$, depending on whether the host star is a member of $\rho$ Oph or Upper Sco.</description>

      <title>Carbon from Interstellar Clouds to Habitable Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon is an essential element for a habitable world. Inner (r &lt; 3 au) disk planetary carbon compositions are strongly influenced by supply and survival of carbonaceous solids. Here we trace the journey of carbon from the interstellar medium to the processes leading to planet formation. The review highlights the following central aspects:
  -Organics forming in evolved star envelopes are supplemented by aromatic molecules forming in the dense ISM to represent the seeds of (hydro)carbon supply through pervasive pebble drift to rocky planets and sub-Neptune cores.
  -Within the protoplanetary disk the sharp gradient in the C/Si content of Solar System bodies and mineral geochemistry outlines a tale of carbon loss from pebbles to within planetesimals and planets, and from planetary atmospheres.
  -Within two planet formation paradigms (pebble and planetesimal accretion) a range of planetary carbon content is possible that is strongly influenced by early (&lt; 0.5 Myr) formation of a pressure bump that titrates drift.
  Overall, it is unlikely that the carbon architecture of our Solar System applies to all systems. In the absence of giant planets, carbon-rich rocky worlds and sub-Neptunes may be common. We outline observations that support their presence and discuss habitability of terrestrial worlds.</description>

      <title>Shocks, compressible perturbations, and intermittency in the very local interstellar medium: Voyager 1 and 2 observations and numerical modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Voyager spacecraft (V1 and V2) provide unique in situ measurements of perturbations propagating beyond the heliopause through the very local interstellar medium (VLISM), including the shocks and pressure fronts whose origin is debated. In particular, a jump in magnetic field strength, observed by V1 in 2020.4 at 149.3 au from the Sun, was followed by a distinct "hump" and persistently strong magnetic field, both requiring theoretical explanation. This paper offers an interpretation of those observations using a self-consistent, MHD model of the solar wind - LISM interaction driven by the OMNI and interplanetary scintillation data combined with a turbulence analysis of Voyager data. Our simulations convincingly demonstrate that global, solar-cycle-driven compressions, on hitting the heliopause, can reproduce those puzzling V1 observations. They appear to be associated with solar cycle 24, whereas similar interstellar magnetic field structures can occur once per cycle. The turbulence analysis reveals time-dependent magnetic compressibility that persists up to 165 au at scales below 10 days. Turbulence intermittency at scales below 1 hour is mostly confined to specific intervals, possibly associated with a broad foreshock region. The apparent disappearance of intermittency since 2022 reflects the turbulence weakening rather than a fundamental change in VLISM properties. We predict that V1 will record relatively strong magnetic field strengths until $\sim$2030, followed by weaker, infrequent perturbations. At V2, we expect multiple solar-driven compressions before 2026, followed by a major event induced by solar cycle 25 around 2030. New Horizons is expected to cross the termination shock at 80$\pm$ au in 2031.</description>

      <title>A 682-second X-ray Periodicity in CH Cygni: Evidence for a Magnetic White Dwarf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.10511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symbiotic stars are interacting binaries consisting of a red giant and typically a white dwarf, important as potential Type Ia supernova progenitors. Despite theoretical predictions that white dwarfs in symbiotic systems should often be magnetic, direct evidence has been elusive. We report the discovery of a $682.5 \pm 7$ s periodicity in the XMM-Newton X-ray light curve that we interpret as the spin period of the WD in CH Cygni. This detection provides strong evidence for a magnetic white dwarf in CH Cygni, making it only the second WD symbiotic star with confirmed X-ray pulsations after R Aquarii. Our discovery supports the magnetic propeller model previously proposed for CH Cygni's jet activity and state transitions.</description>

      <title>From Common Envelope Evolution to Luminous Red Novae I: A One-dimensional Radiation Hydrodynamic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14173v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The acceleration and unbinding of the common envelope during the plunge-in phase are governed by complex physical processes that often manifest observationally as luminous red novae. We investigate the dynamics of this phase using one-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations evolved with the code {\tt Guangqi}. We perform a parameter survey to quantify the impact of key physical conditions on the unbound mass fraction, $\eta$, and the resulting light curves. Our survey spans a range of radiation-to-gas internal energy ratios ($\mathcal{E}/e_{\text{g}}\in[0.2,3.2]$), ratios of total envelope energy to gravitational binding energy ($\zeta\in[0.54,2.87]$), and mass injection rates ($\dot{M}\in[2.5,10]M_{\odot}/\rm{yr}$), while covering both subsonic and supersonic expansion regimes ($v_{\rm ej}/v_{\rm esc}\in[0.3,0.6]$). We demonstrate that: (1) radiation pressure becomes the dominant driver of mass ejection in the high-opacity, high-luminosity region immediately below the recombination front; (2) $\eta$ exhibits a nonlinear dependence on $\zeta$, which is modulated by the mass injection rate and gravitational potential; and (3) the recombination of atomic to molecular hydrogen ($\ce{H}\to\ce{H2}$) releases latent heat that sustains a secondary plateau in the late-time light curve. These findings are substantiated by detailed error analysis and convergence testing presented in the Appendices.</description>

      <title>The Spontaneous Genesis of Solar Prominence Structures Driven by Supergranulation in Three-Dimensional Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar prominences usually have a horizontally elongated body with many feet extending to the solar surface, resembling a multi-arch bridge with many bridge piers. The basic mechanism by which solar prominences acquire these common structures during their evolution, however, remains an unresolved question. For the first time, our three-dimensional magneto-frictional simulation, driven by supergranular motions, self-consistently replicates the commonly observed multi-arch bridge morphology and its characteristic structures of solar quiescent prominences in a magnetic flux rope. In comparison with traditional views, our simulations demonstrate that the spine, feet, and voids (bubbles) are inherent prominence structures spontaneously forming as the flux rope evolves to a mature state. The voids mainly consist of legs of sheared magnetic loops caused by unbalanced supergranular flows, and prominence feet settle at the bottom of helical field lines piled up from the photosphere to the spine. Similarities between the simulated prominences and observed real prominences by the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer, the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, and NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory suggest the high validity of our model. This work corroborates the pivotal role of photospheric supergranulation as a helicity injection source in the formation and shaping of quiescent prominence structures within the solar atmosphere, thereby paving a new avenue for future investigations into their fine dynamics and stability.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of starspot structure and differential rotation of Kepler-411</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starspots and their movements on stellar surfaces enable investigating the mechanisms of stellar magnetic activity. Information on the spot distribution and differential rotation provide important constraints for the behaviour of stellar magnetic dynamos. We analyse the Kepler photometry of Kepler-411, a known exoplanet host, to determine the distribution and properties of star spots on the stellar surface with two independent and complementary methods: modelling the photometric effect of rotation of spots on the stellar surface and mapping of spots by transiting planets. By constructing a spot model accounting for geometry, differential rotation and spot evolution, we model the spots of the stellar surface giving rise to the observed brightness variations. We also search for evidence for occultations of starspots in high-cadence photometry. Our spot models reproduce the observed photometric variations well and we are able to obtain information on the distribution and movement of spots on the stellar surface. We do not obtain evidence for differential rotation -- the rotational profile is consistent with rigid-body rotation with a period of 10.52$\pm$0.34 days. We detect three occultations of spots by planet c. The positions of these spots coincide well with the positions of larger spot structures identified by our modelling of the rotational modulation of the light curve.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the earliest stage of star and planet formation requires detailed observations to address the connection and interplay between the accretion, outflow and disk evolution. We present results from the observations of the low luminosity ($L_\mathrm{bol}\sim~0.2~L_\odot$) and mass (M$_*\sim$\,0.15~M$_\odot$) Class~0 protostar IRAS 16253$-$2429, conducted as part of the \textit{eDisk} ALMA large program and the JWST cycle-1 GO program \textit{IPA}. Observations reveal a wide hourglass-shaped continuum cavity traced in scattered light (at $\leq$~5~$\mu$m), with a brighter, extended northern side. We detect 15 pure rotational H$_2$ transitions (E$_\mathrm{up}$:~1015--21411~K), revealing a wide-angle molecular outflow. {The outflow width (as traced in H$_2$~0-0~S(11)) at the protostellar location measures $\leq$35 au, slightly larger than the dust and Keplerian disk diameters ($\sim$30 au) but wider than the 20--23~au jet width in [Fe II].} {The opening angle narrows from 40--35\arcdeg{} for the low-J H$_2$ lines (up to S(5)) and the cold gas component (ALMA $^{12}$CO) to $\sim$28--19\arcdeg{} for the high-J H$_2$ lines (S(7)--S(11)).} Position-velocity diagrams of H$_2$ reveal higher velocities for higher E$_{up}$, ranging from ~12.5 km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(1) and S(2) to ~28.5 km~s$^{-1}$ for H$_2$~0-0~S(5)~and~S(7) with respect to the mean flow velocity. The nested excitation and velocity structure of the collimated jet and wide angle wind suggest a magnetohydrodynamic wind as a likely launching mechanism, similar to the findings in other protostars and Class II sources. The lower velocity mm CO may be gas from the infalling envelope accelerated outwards by the wide angle wind along the cavity walls.</description>

      <title>A semi-coherent search for optical pulsations from Scorpius X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emission of continuous gravitational waves (CWs) possibly explains why pulsars spinning with a period shorter than a millisecond have not been observed so far. Neutron stars accreting mass at the highest rates are the most promising targets for a search for CWs, because a strong emission of gravitational waves is required to balance the torque exerted by mass accretion onto the neutron star. Detecting coherent pulsations in the electromagnetic emission maximizes the search sensitivity, but has so far not been successful for most of the brightest accreting neutron stars. Here, we present the first search for pulsations in the optical band from the brightest accreting neutron star known, Sco X-1. To this end, we tailored semi-coherent search strategies to data obtained over four years, for a total of $\sim$$56$ ks, by the SiFAP2 fast photometer mounted at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). These searches are especially suited to analysing long observations of systems for which only limited knowledge on the orbital parameters is available, and involve joining coherent analyses on shorter segments without connecting the spin phase between them. The large count rates afforded by an optical telescope and the efficiency of the search strategy employed allowed us to set an upper limit of $9 \times 10^{-5}$ to the pulsed amplitude, which is lower by a factor of four with respect to previous searches in the X-ray band. We also show that the application of semi-coherent searches to SiFAP2 observations of the first detected optical millisecond pulsar, PSR J1023+0038, could have preceded its detection in the radio band. These results highlight the role played by high-time-resolution optical observations in performing deep searches of quickly rotating pulsars.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole growth from stellar binary encounters</title>

Abstract: The growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a central problem in astrophysics, with current observations providing only limited constraints on the underlying mechanisms. One possible growth channel is stellar accretion via the Hills mechanism, wherein a SMBH tidally breaks up a passing binary star, capturing and eventually accreting a member of the binary. We adopt a framework based on kinematics to predict capture rates from parameters that include the central number density of stars, the stellar velocity dispersion, the binary fraction, and black hole mass. We then estimate the growth of SMBHs across a range of galactic environments. In a data set of 91 galaxies of various types and masses, we identify two candidates with SMBHs for which stellar accretion may be a driver of growth. Closer to home, a recent analysis of observed hypervelocity stars from the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) implicates binary star interactions with a massive black hole. Every hypervelocity star produced in this way leaves a bound partner that may be accreted, providing an active growth channel for the LMC's black hole.</description>

      <title>The stability of propagating plane inertial waves in rotating fluids</title>

Abstract: Inertial waves transport energy and momentum in rotating fluids and are a major contributor to mixing and tidal dissipation in Earth's oceans, gaseous planets, and stellar interiors. However, their stability and breakdown mechanisms are not fully understood. We examine the linear stability and nonlinear breakdown of finite-amplitude propagating plane inertial waves using Floquet theory and direct numerical simulations. The Floquet analysis generalizes previous studies as it is valid for arbitrary perturbation wavelengths and primary wave amplitudes. We find that the wavenumber orientation of the most unstable perturbations depends strongly on the wave frequency and weakly on the wave amplitude. The most unstable perturbations have wavelengths that are small relative to the primary wave wavelength for low wave amplitudes, but become comparable for large wave amplitudes. We then use direct numerical simulations to follow the nonlinear breakdown of the wave and examine how the wave energy is either dissipated in a forward cascade or accumulated into long-lived geostrophic modes. Simulations reveal that the conversion efficiency into geostrophic modes increases with increasing wave amplitude, as expected for pumping of geostrophic modes by nearly-resonant triadic interactions. We also find that the conversion efficiency increases with decreasing primary wave frequency, which may be due to the more efficient coupling of quasi-2D waves to geostrophic modes. These results on the stability and breakdown of single plane inertial waves provides additional foundation for understanding the role of inertial waves in rotating turbulence, transport properties of inertial wave beams, and inertial wave propagation in more complex environments such as those with magnetic fields or shear flows.</description>

      <title>Accretion Rate Changes Detected in a Polluted White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter reports statistically significant changes in the equivalent widths of MgII and CaII lines in the dusty and polluted white dwarf WD 0106-328, based on six epochs of spectroscopy using the VLT and Keck spanning 25 yr. Furthermore, the ratio of these two equivalent widths may also vary, with a 7% probability of being constant. Between 2000 and 2025, both Mg and Ca have experienced decreases in accretion rates, of approximately 20 and 60%, respectively, but with individual variation during the interim. These metal abundance decreases are the first empirical corroboration of diffusion theory in white dwarfs, which predict sinking timescales on the order of days for this star. However, the persistent atmospheric metals require a more gradual, circumstellar process, where one possibility is viscous spreading in an ionized disk of metals, consistent with $\alpha\approx0.1$ within that formalism. The combination of optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy with the Hubble Space Telescope detects all the major rock-forming elements (O, Mg, Si, Fe), and demonstrates that Fe dominates the accreted material by mass, and that it is delivered mostly as pure metal from within a differentiated parent body. This inference is consistent with the possibility that chemically-segregated accretion may result from a combination of planetary assembly, fragmentation, disk evolution, and be observed on relatively short timescales.</description>
