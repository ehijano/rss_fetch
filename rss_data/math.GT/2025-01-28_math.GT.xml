      <title>Quantum enhancement polynomials associated with the canonical two-element tricbracket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum enhancement polynomials are invariants for oriented links, defined in association with an algebraic structure called a tribracket. In this paper, we focus on the particular case of the canonical two-element tribracket. We prove that, in that case, the quantum enhancement polynomials can be recovered by five specific polynomials, which we refer to as the universal quantum enhancement polynomials. After presenting several notable properties of these polynomials, we show that they are strictly stronger than the Jones polynomial. Furthermore, we provide computational results for links with up to 10 crossings.</description>

      <title>On winding numbers of almost embeddings of $K_4$ in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K_4$ be the complete graph on four vertices. Let $f$ be a continuous map of $K_4$ to the plane such that $f$-images of non-adjacent edges are disjoint. For any vertex $v \in K_4$ take the winding number of the $f$-image of the cycle $K_4 - v$ around $f(v)$. It is known that the sum of these four integers is odd. We construct examples showing that this is the only relation between these four numbers.</description>

      <title>Ma-Qiu index, presentation distance, and local moves in knot theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ma-Qiu index of a group is the minimum number of normal generators of the commutator subgroup. We show that the Ma-Qiu index gives a lower bound of the presentation distance of two groups, the minimum number of relator replacements to change one group to the other. Since many local moves in knot theory induce relator replacements in knot groups, this shows that the Ma-Qiu index of knot groups gives a lower bound of the Gordian distance based on various local moves. In particular, this gives a unified and simple proof of the Nakanishi index bounds of various unknotting numbers, including virtual or welded knot cases.</description>

      <title>Dax invariant for closed embedded surfaces and the mapping class group of $\Sigma\times S^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M=\Sigma\times S^2$ where $\Sigma$ is a closed oriented surface of positive genus. Let $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ be the smooth mapping class group of $M$, and let $\operatorname{MCG}_0(M)$ denote the subgroup of $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ consisting of elements homotopic to the identity. We show that there exists a surjection from $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ to $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ such that its restriction to $\operatorname{MCG}_0(M)$ is also of infinite rank. As a result, every subgroup of $\operatorname{MCG}(M)$ that contains $\operatorname{MCG}_0(M)$ is infinitely generated. The proof is based on a generalization of the Dax invariant to embedded \emph{closed} surfaces. Using the generalized Dax invariant, we also show that there exist infinitely many embedded closed surfaces in $M$ that have a common geometrically dual sphere, are homotopic to each other, but are mutually non-isotopic to each other. Since $\pi_1(M)$ has no 2-torsion, this answers a question of Gabai.</description>

      <title>Bipartite expansion beyond biparticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently suggested bipartite analysis extends the Kauffman planar decomposition to arbitrary $N$, i.e. extends it from the Jones polynomial to the HOMFLY polynomial. This provides a generic and straightforward non-perturbative calculus in an arbitrary Chern--Simons theory. Technically, this approach is restricted to knots and links which possess bipartite realizations, i.e. can be entirely glued from antiparallel lock (two-vertex) tangles rather than single-vertex $R$-matrices. However, we demonstrate that the resulting positive decomposition (PD), i.e. the representation of the fundamental HOMFLY polynomials as positive integer polynomials of the three parameters $\phi$, $\bar\phi$ and $D$, exists for arbitrary knots, not only bipartite ones. This poses new questions about the true significance of bipartite expansion, which appears to make sense far beyond its original scope, and its generalizations to higher representations. We have provided two explanations for the existence of the PD for non-bipartite knots. An interesting option is to resolve a particular bipartite vertex in a not-fully-bipartite diagram and reduce the HOMFLY polynomial to a linear combination of those for smaller diagrams. If the resulting diagrams correspond to bipartite links, this option provides a PD even to an initially non-bipartite knot. Another possibility for a non-bipartite knot is to have a bipartite clone with the same HOMFLY polynomial providing this PD. We also suggest a promising criterium for the existence of a bipartite realization behind a given PD, which is based on the study of the precursor Jones polynomials.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration of square-tiled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a combinatorial reconfiguration problem on a subclass of quadrangulations of surfaces called square-tiled surfaces. Our elementary move is a shear in a cylinder that corresponds to a well-chosen sequence of diagonal flips that preserves the square-tiled properties. We conjecture that the connected components of this reconfiguration problem are in bijection with the connected components of the moduli space of quadratic differentials. We prove that the conjecture holds in the so-called hyperelliptic components of Abelian square-tiled surfaces. More precisely, we show that any two such square-tiled surfaces of genus $g$ can be connected by $O(g)$ powers of cylinder shears.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Thistlethwaite--Tsvietkova Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thurston's equations determine the hyperbolic structure of a 3-manifold with a triangulation. In work by Thistlethwaite and Tsvietkova, an alternative method was developed for link complements in $S^3$ depending on the link diagram, where a set of labels are associated to the vertices and edges of the link diagram, and one attempts to solve a set of equations on the labels. Under certain conditions, there exists a solution to these equations that corresponds to the complete hyperbolic structure, but in general it is difficult to determine which one it is. We generalize this method to 3-manifolds with a polyhedral decomposition, and show that solutions to the equations correspond to $PSL(2,\mathbb{C})$-representations of the fundamental group, and that the solution with the largest volume corresponds to the complete hyperbolic structure. We also consider different classes of complements of links, in particular links in the thickened torus and fully augmented links. For the latter, we establish a correspondence between solutions satisfying some criteria and circle packings realizing the region graph associated to the fully augmented link.</description>

      <title>The Goeritz groups of $(1,1)$-decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A $(g, n)$-decomposition of a link $L$ in a closed orientable $3$-manifold $M$ is a decomposition of $M$ by a closed orientable surface of genus $g$ into two handebodies each intersecting the link $L$ in $n$ trivial arcs. The Goeritz group of that decomposition is then defined to be the group of isotopy classes of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of the pair $(M, L)$ that preserve the decomposition. We compute the Goeritz groups of all $(1,1)$-decompositions.</description>

      <title>Geometric classification of total stability spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.00092v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a geometric model for the root category $\mathcal{D}^b(Q)/[2]$ of any Dynkin diagram $Q$, which is an $h_Q$-gon $\mathbf{V}_Q$ with cores, where $h_Q$ is the Coxeter number and $\mathcal{D}^b(Q)$ is the bounded derived category associated to $Q$. As an application, we classify all spaces $\mathrm{ToSt}\mathcal{D}$ of total stability conditions on triangulated categories $\mathcal{D}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ must be of the form $\mathcal{D}^b(Q)$. More precisely, we prove that $\mathrm{ToSt}\mathcal{D}^b(Q)/[2]$ is isomorphic to a suitable moduli space of stable $h_Q$-gons of type $Q$.
  In particular, an $h_Q$-gon $\mathbf{V}$ of type $D_n$ is a (centrally) symmetric doubly punctured $2(n-1)$-gon. $\mathbf{V}$ is stable if it is convex and the punctures are inside the level-$(n-2)$ diagonal-gon. Another interesting case is $E_6$, where the (stable) $h_Q$-gon (dodecagon) can be realized as a pair of planar tiling pattern.</description>

      <title>Ergodic dichotomy for subspace flows in higher rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the ergodicity of a one-parameter diagonalizable subgroup of a connected semisimple real algebraic group $G$ acting on a homogeneous space or, more generally, a homogeneous-like space, equipped with a Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan type measure. These flow spaces are associated with Anosov subgroups of $G$, or more generally, with transverse subgroups of $G$.
  We obtain an ergodicity criterion similar to the Hopf-Tsuji-Sullivan dichotomy for the ergodicity of the geodesic flow on hyperbolic manifolds. In addition, we extend this criterion to the action of any connected diagonal subgroup of arbitrary dimension. Our criterion provides a codimension dichotomy on the ergodicity of a connected diagonalizable subgroup for general Anosov subgroups. This generalizes an earlier work by Burger-Landesberg-Lee-Oh for Borel Anosov subgroups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address Gromov's band width inequality and Rosenberg's $S^1$-stability conjecture for simply connected smooth four manifolds. Both results are known to be false in dimension 4 due to counterexamples based on Seiberg-Witten invariants. Nevertheless we show that both of these results hold upon considering simply connected smooth four manifolds up to homeomorphism. We also obtain a related result for non-simply connected smooth four manifolds.</description>
