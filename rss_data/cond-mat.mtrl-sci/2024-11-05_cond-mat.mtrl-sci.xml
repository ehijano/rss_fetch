      <title>Computational investigation of formation enthalpies and phase stability for rare earth oxyphosphates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare earth phosphates have garnered significant interest due to their versatile properties, including high chemical stability, thermal resistance, luminescence, and the ability to adopt various crystalline structures. Density functional theory (DFT)-based ab initio methods have become essential tools for complementing experimental studies. In this paper, we performed DFT calculations on rare earth (RE; here considered as lanthanides + Y) oxyphosphates to examine their formation enthalpies and phase stability. The calculations were conducted using the GGA-PBE and r2SCAN exchange-correlation functionals. Our results indicate that both functionals predict similar phase stabilities for REPO4 and RE3PO7. However, the r2SCAN functional provides significantly more accurate formation enthalpies for the monazite and xenotime REPO4, aligning closely with experimental data. Furthermore, the inclusion of lattice vibrational entropy enhances the free energy predictions, leading to improved agreement with experimental observations on phase stability.</description>

      <title>Cr/p-HgCdTe (x = 0.28, 1.0) contact resistance and I-V characteristics in the LTLM configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific contact resistance $\rho_c$ of Cr/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te and Cr/p-CdTe/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te heterointerfaces, which were formed by deposition of Cr films at room temperatures on the surfaces of semiconductors, was studied by the Linear Transmission Line Model (LTLM) method. It was observed linear or close to linear behavior of current-voltage (I-V) characteristics at temperatures T = 77 and 300 K. It was assumed that relatively large specific contact resistance $\rho_c$ perhaps is mainly connected with the formation of Cr-oxides and the elements diffusion into Cr layers from the semiconductors under consideration. No intermediate dielectric layer, separating Cr from Hg0.72Cd0.28Te or CdTe layers was observed. It was accepted that the MIGS (metal-induced gap states) model in the semiconductor can be considered to describe the mechanism of current transport through the Cr/p-CdTe/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te and Cd/p-Hg$_{0.72}$Cd$_{0.28}$Te interfaces (Schottky barriers - SBs). The linear or almost linear I-V-characteristics in the LTLM configuration observed can be explained by taking into account the series resistance of bulk semiconductor substrate and low resistance of large area SBs.</description>

      <title>Optical Band Engineering of Monolayer WSe2 in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense electromagnetic fields can result in dramatic changes in the electronic properties of solids. These changes are commonly studied using optical probes of the modified electronic structure. Here we use optical-scanning tunneling microscopy (optical-STM) equipped with near-field continuous wave (CW) laser excitation to directly measure the electronic structure of light-dressed states in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductor, WSe2. We find that the effective tunneling gap and tunneling density of states are strongly influenced by the intensity of the electromagnetic field when the applied field is resonant with the bandgap of the semiconductor. Our findings indicate that CW laser excitation can be used to generate light-dressed electronic states of quantum materials when confined strongly to the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Defect engineering-induced Seebeck coefficient and carrier concentration decoupling in CuI by noble gas ion implantation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Copper(I) iodide, CuI, is the leading $p$-type non-toxic and earth-abundant semiconducting material for transparent electronics and thermoelectric generators. Defects play a crucial role in determining the carrier concentration, scattering process, and therefore thermoelectric performance of a material. A result of defect engineering, the power factor of thin film CuI was increased from $332\pm32$ {\mu}Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ to $578\pm58$ {\mu}Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ after implantation with noble gas ions (Ne, Ar, Xe). The increased power factor is due to a decoupling of the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity identified through a changing scattering mechanism. Ion implantation causes the abundant production of Frenkel pairs, which were found to suppress compensating donors in CuI, and which scenario was also supported by density functional theory calculations. The compensating donor suppression led to a significantly improved Hall carrier concentration, increasing from $6.5\times10^{19}\pm0.1\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$ to $11.5\times10^{19}\pm0.4\times10^{19}$ cm$^{-3}$. This work provides an important step forward in the development of CuI as a transparent conducting material for electronics and thermoelectric generators by introducing beneficial point defects with ion implantation.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence End-to-End Workflow for Transmission Electron Microscopy: From Data Analysis Automation to Materials Knowledge Unveiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a groundbreaking analytical workflow designed for the holistic characterisation, modelling and physical simulation of device heterostructures. Our innovative workflow autonomously, comprehensively and locally characterises the crystallographic information and 3D orientation of the crystal phases, the elemental composition, and the strain maps of devices from (scanning) transmission electron microscopy data. It converts a manual characterisation process that traditionally takes days into an automatic routine completed in minutes. This is achieved through a physics-guided artificial intelligence model that combines unsupervised and supervised machine learning in a modular way to provide a representative 3D description of the devices, materials structures, or samples under analysis. To culminate the process, we integrate the extracted knowledge to automate the generation of both 3D finite element and atomic models of millions of atoms acting as digital twins, enabling simulations that yield essential physical and chemical insights crucial for understanding the device's behaviour in practical applications. We prove this end-to-end workflow with a state-of-the-art materials platform based on SiGe planar heterostructures for hosting coherent and scalable spin qubits. Our workflow connects representative digital twins of the experimental devices with their theoretical properties to reveal the true impact that every atom in the structure has on their electronic properties, and eventually, into their functional quantum performance. Notably, the versatility of our workflow is demonstrated through its successful application to a wide array of materials systems, device configurations and sample morphologies.</description>

      <title>Nucleation of fracture: The first-octant evidence against classical variational phase-field models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a companion work to [1], this Note presents a series of simple formulae and explicit results that illustrate and highlight why classical variational phase-field models cannot possibly predict fracture nucleation in elastic brittle materials. The focus is on ``tension-dominated'' problems where all principal stresses are non-negative, that is, problems taking place entirely within the first octant in the space of principal stresses.</description>

      <title>Towards Nanoscale and Element-Specific Lattice Temperature Measurements using Core-Loss Electron Energy-Loss Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring nanoscale local temperatures, particularly in vertically integrated and multi-component systems, remains challenging. Spectroscopic techniques like X-ray absorption and core-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) are sensitive to lattice temperature, but understanding thermal effects is nontrivial. This work explores the potential for nanoscale and element-specific core-loss thermometry by comparing the Si L2,3 edge's temperature-dependent redshift against plasmon energy expansion thermometry (PEET) in a scanning TEM. Using density functional theory (DFT), time-dependent DFT, and the Bethe-Salpeter equation, we ab initio model both the Si L2,3 and plasmon redshift. We find that the core-loss redshift is due to bandgap reduction from electron-phonon renormalization. Our results indicate that despite lower core-loss signal intensity and thus accuracy compared to PEET, core-loss thermometry still has important advantages. Specifically, we show that the Varshni equation easily interprets the core-loss redshift, which avoids plasmon spectral convolution for PEET in complex materials. We also find that core-loss thermometry is more accurate than PEET at modeling thermal lattice expansion unless the temperature-dependent effective mass and dielectric constant are known. Furthermore, core-loss thermometry has the potential to measure nanoscale heating in multi-component materials and stacked interfaces with elemental specificity at length scales smaller than the plasmon's wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Microwave power and chamber pressure studies for single-crystalline diamond film growth using microwave plasma CVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A smooth diamond film, characterized by exceptional thermal conductivity, chemical stability, and optical properties, is highly suitable for a wide range of advanced applications. However, achieving uniform film quality presents a significant challenge for the CVD method due to non-uniformities in microwave distribution, electric fields, and the densities of reactive radicals during deposition processes involving $CH_4$ and $H_2$ precursors. Here, we systematically investigate the effects of microwave power and chamber pressure on surface roughness, crystalline quality, and the uniformity of diamond films. These findings provide valuable insights into the production of atomically smooth, high-quality diamond films with enhanced uniformity. By optimizing deposition parameters, we achieved a root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of 2 nm, comparable to high-pressure, high-temperature (HPHT) diamond substrates. Moreover, these conditions facilitated the formation of a pure single-crystal diamond phase, confirmed by the absence of contamination peaks in the Raman spectra</description>

      <title>New applications of Bayesian optimization based on element mapping to design high-capacity NASICON-type cathode of sodium-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries are emerging as promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries due to the abundance of sodium resources. Na3V2(PO4)2F3 (NVPF), a cathode material for sodium ion batteries, is attracting attention from its rate capability and high working voltage, but its low discharge capacity is one of the challenges. In this work, we aim to design a high-capacity NASICON-type cathode of sodium-ion battery by discovering element combinations that can stabilize the sodium excess phase in NVPFs. For the efficient discovery of element combinations, we propose a Bayesian optimization-based algorithm for chemical composition discovery. Specifically, we propose an element mapping technique to solve the limitation of Bayesian optimization in discovering chemical composition. By constructing a chemical space applicable to Bayesian optimization through element mapping and optimizing the constructed chemical space, we found optimal binary element combinations. This work not only offers insights into designing high-capacity cathodes, but also demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in data-driven materials design.</description>

      <title>Room temperature ferromagnetism induced by high valence cation V$^{+5}$/V$^{+4}$ substitution in SrFeO$_{3-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structural and magnetic effects of non-magnetic vanadium (V) doping in helimagnetic SrFeO$_{3-\delta}$ (SFO) are investigated, focusing on up to 3% substitution at the Fe site. Structural analysis from X-ray diffraction (XRD) and Raman spectroscopy, supported by phonon mode calculations, reveals that pure SFO exists as a mixed tetragonal-orthorhombic phase, while V-doped samples exhibit an emerging cubic phase alongside tetragonal symmetry. Magnetic hysteresis (M-H) loops show notable ferromagnetic behavior within the antiferromagnetic matrix, persisting even at room temperature. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements indicate a Neel temperature (TN ) shift from 70K to 55K, along with increased magnetization differences in field-cooled (FC) and zero field-cooled (ZFC) data, reflecting heightened magnetic frustration due to competing FM/AFM exchange interactions. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses reveal a rise in Fe$^{3+}$ and V$^{5+}$ states, affecting oxygen vacancy distributions and corresponding structural shifts seen in XRD and Raman results. The multivalent Fe$^{3+}$/Fe$^{4+}$ and V$^{4+}$/V$^{5+}$ states enhance double-exchange (DE) and super-exchange (SE) interactions (Fe$^{3+}$-O-Fe$^{4+}$ and Fe$^{3+}$-O-V$^{5+}$), promoting ferromagnetism. Frequency-dependent magnetization studies display a subtle susceptibility peak shift, indicating spin-glass-like behavior in V-doped samples.</description>

      <title>Combining graph deep learning and London dispersion interatomic potentials: A case study on pnictogen chalcohalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning interatomic potential models based on graph neural network architectures have the potential to make atomistic materials modeling widely accessible due to their computational efficiency, scalability, and broad applicability. The training datasets for many such models are derived from density-functional theory calculations, typically using a semilocal exchange-correlation functional. As a result, long-range interactions such as London dispersion are often missing in these models. We investigate whether this missing component can be addressed by combining a graph deep learning potential with semiempirical dispersion models. We assess this combination by deriving the equations of state for layered pnictogen chalcohalides BiTeBr and BiTeI and performing crystal structure optimizations for a broader set of V-VI-VII compounds with various stoichiometries, many of which possess van der Waals gaps. We characterize the optimized crystal structures by calculating their X-ray diffraction patterns and radial distribution function histograms, which are also used to compute Earth mover's distances to quantify the dissimilarity between the optimized and corresponding experimental structures. We find that dispersion-corrected graph deep learning potentials generally (though not universally) provide a more realistic description of these compounds due to the inclusion of van der Waals attractions. In particular, their use results in systematic improvements in predicting not only the van der Waals gap but also the layer thickness in layered V-VI-VII compounds. Our results demonstrate that the combined potentials studied here, derived from a straightforward approach that neither requires fine-tuning the training nor refitting the potential parameters, can significantly improve the description of layered polar crystals.</description>

      <title>Revisit Many-body Interaction Heat Current and Thermal Conductivity Calculation in Moment Tensor Potential/LAMMPS Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of heat current operator for systems for non-pairwise additive interactions and its impact on related lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{L}$) via molecular dynamics simulation (MD) are ambiguous and controversial when migrating from conventional empirical potential models to machine learning potential (MLP) models. Empirical model descriptions are often limited to three- to four-body interaction while a sophisticated representation of the many-body physics could be resembled in MLPs. Herein, we study and compare the significance of many-body interaction to the heat current computation in one of the most popular MLP models, the Moment Tensor Potential (MTP). Non-equilibrium MD simulations and equilibrium MD simulations among four different materials, $PbTe$, amorphous $Sc_{0.2}Sb_{2}Te_{3}$, graphene, and $BAs$, were performed. We found inconsistency between the simulation thermostat and its implemented heat current operator in our non-equilibrium MD results which violate law of energy conservation and suggest a need for revision. We revisit the virial stress tensor expression within the calculator and identified the lack of a generalised many-body heat current description in it. We uncover the influence of the modified heat current formula that could alter the $\kappa_{L}$ results 29% to 64% using the equilibrium MD computational approach. Our work demonstrates the importance of a many-body description during thermal analysis in MD simulations when MLPs are in concern. This work sheds light on a better understanding of the relationship between interatomic interaction and its heat transport mechanism.</description>

      <title>Efficient moment tensor machine-learning interatomic potential for accurate description of defects in Ni-Al Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining the efficiency of semi-empirical potentials with the accuracy of quantum mechanical methods, machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have significantly advanced atomistic modeling in computational materials science and chemistry. This necessitates the continual development of MLIP models with improved accuracy and efficiency, which enable long-time scale molecular dynamics simulations to unveil the intricate underlying mechanisms that would otherwise remain elusive. Among various existing MLIP models, the moment tensor potential (MTP) model employs a highly descriptive rotationally-covariant moment tensor to describe the local atomic environment, enabling the use of even linear regression for model fitting. Although the current MTP model has achieved state-of-the-art efficiency for similar accuracy, there is still room for optimizing the contraction process of moment tensors. In this work, we propose an effective genetic algorithm based optimization scheme that can significantly reduce the number of independent moment tensor components and intermediate tensor components. This leads to a speedup of nearly one order of magnitude in efficiency and also improved accuracy compared to the traditional MTP model for intricate basis sets. We have applied our improved MTP model to predicting the energetic and dynamical properties of various point and planar defects in Ni-Al alloys, showing overall good performances and in general outperforming the semi-empirical potentials. This work paves the way for fast and accurate atomistic modeling of complex systems and provides a useful tool for modeling defects in Ni-Al alloys.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectric nematics: Materials with high permittivity or low resistivity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two models have recently been proposed for a description of dielectric spectroscopy measurements of ferroelectric nematics (NF) in thin planar capacitors. The polarization-external capacitance Goldstone reorientation mode (PCG model) considers the NF layer between the electrodes as an effective low resistivity material, the resistivity being inversely proportional to the square of polarisation magnitude. The high-{\epsilon} model considers the NF material as having a huge permittivity due to the ease of polarisation rotation. In this paper we study implications of both models and show, why both models describe majority of the observed dielectric spectroscopy results equally well. We point out differences among the models predictions and explain why some observations can be explained only by the high-{\epsilon} model. The major difference between the models is that the high-{\epsilon} model predicts that the increase in the cell thickness can lead to an increase in the frequency range within which capacitors filled with NF material can be used for energy storage while within the PCG model this frequency range reduces with increasing capacitor thickness. Within both models a crucial parameter which determines the behaviour of the capacitors filled with a NF material is parasitic resistance, primarily due to the electrode resistance. We present measurements of electrode resistance and find that in ITO cells it is of the order of few hundred ohms.</description>

      <title>Probing trade-off between critical size and velocity in cold-spray: An atomistic simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detailed mechanism of bonding in the cold spray process has remained elusive for both experimental and theoretical parties. Adiabatic shear instability and hydrodynamic plasticity models have been so far the most popular explanations. Here, using molecular dynamics simulation, we investigate their validity at the nanoscale. The present study has potential application for the fabrication of ultra-thin layers for the electronics industry. For this aim, we considered Ti nanoparticles of different diameters and Si substrates of different orientations. It is shown that very high spray velocities are required for a jet to be observed at the nanoscale. We propose a method for thermostating the substrate that enables utilizing high spray velocities. For the first time, we demonstrate an oscillatory behavior in both the normal and radial stress components within the substrate that can propagate into the particle. We have shown that neither the adiabatic shear instability model nor the hydrodynamic plasticity model can be ignored at the nanoscale. Besides, the formation of a low-resistance titanium silicide proper for electronic application is illustrated.</description>

      <title>Pyridyl-functionalized tripod molecules on Au(111): Interplay between H-bonding and metal coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-assembly of pyridyl-functionalized triazine (T4PT) was studied on Au(111) using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) under ultra-high vacuum conditions combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. In particular, we investigated the effect of temperature on the intermolecular interactions within the assemblies. STM measurements revealed that T4PT molecules form a well-ordered, close-packed structure, with the molecules adopting a planar conformation parallel to the Au surface for coverages $\leq1$ monolayer upon room temperature deposition. The intermolecular interactions stabilizing the self-assembled arrangement is based on a combination of hydrogen bonding and weak van der Waals forces. Upon post-deposition annealing, the assemblies are additionally stabilized by metal-ligand bonding between the pyridyl ligands and native Au adatoms. Further post-deposition annealing at temperatures above $200^{\circ}$C led to the breaking of the N-Au bonds with the molecular assemblies transforming into a second close-packed hydrogen bonded structure. For temperatures exceeding $230^{\circ}$C, few covalently linked dimers formed, most likely as a result of CH-bond activation. We rationalize the kinetically-driven structure formation by unveiling the interaction strengths of the bonding motifs using DFT and compare the molecular conformation to the structurally similar pyridyl-functionalized benzene (T4PB).</description>

      <title>Intrinsic breakdown strength: theoretical derivation and first-principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic breakdown strength (F_bd), as the theoretical upper limit of electric field strength that a material can sustain, plays important roles in determining dielectric and safety performance. The well accepted concept is that a larger band gap (E_g) often leads to a larger intrinsic breakdown strength. In this work, we analytically derive a simplified model of F_bd, showing a linear relationship between F_bd and the maximum electron density of states (DOS_max) within the energy range spanning from the conduction band minimum (CBM) to CBM+E_g. Using the Wannier interpolation technique to reduce the cost of calculating the F_bd for various three- and two-dimensional materials, we find that the calculated F_bd did not show any simple relationship with band gap, but it behaves linearly with the DOS_max, consistent with our theoretical derivation. Our work shows that the DOS_max is more fundamental than the band gap value in determining the F_bd, thus providing useful physical insights into the intrinsic dielectric breakdown strength and opening directions for improving high-power devices. The dimensional effects on F_bd has also been revealed that monolayers tend to have larger F_bd due to reduced screening effects.</description>

      <title>Conjugate-dual clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of clusters with high symmetrical geometry, such as C60 fullerene, always attract lots of interest because of their diverse nature. However, most of such interesting cluster were sporadically discovered, is there any systematic method to explore all possible high symmetrical clusters? Herein, we propose an idea to systematically construct high symmetrical structures based on novel conjugate-dual (co-dual) concept. A co-dual structure would be constructed by conjugately combining one high symmetrical polyhedron and its corresponding dual. In such co-dual structures, the symmetry of the original polyhedron could be kept or even promoted in some special cases. This provides a way to explore high symmetrical polyhedra and leads to a new cluster family, co-dual clusters. In this paper, we have systematically studied the spherical co-dual clusters with one- or two-element shells, and found a series of stable cage-like and core-shell clusters. The co-dual structures would be a new treasure box for hunting novel clusters.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Interface Effects in Composite Dielectrics: Insights into Charge Trapping Regulation through Multiscale Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of modern energy applications drives an urgent need to enhance the dielectric strength of energy storage dielectrics for higher power density. Interface design is a promising strategy to regulate the crucial charge transport process determining dielectric strength. However, the targeted exploitation of interface effects on charge transport is limited due to a lack of fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms involving elementary electronic processes and details of the intricate interplay of characteristics of molecular building blocks and the interfacial morphology -- details that cannot fully be resolved with experimental methods. Here we employ a multiscale modeling approach linking the quantum properties of the charge carriers with nano- and mesoscale structural details of complex interfaces. Applied to a prototypical application-proven cellulose-oil composite with interfaces formed between oil, disordered, and crystalline cellulose regions, this approach demonstrates that charges are trapped in the disordered region. Specifically, it unveils this trapping as a synergistic effect of two transport-regulating interface mechanisms: back-transfer to the oil region is suppressed by energetic factors, while forward-transfer to the crystalline cellulose is suppressed by low electronic coupling. The insight into the molecular origins of interface effects via dual-interface regulation offers new development paths for advanced energy materials.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in KNbO3: symmetry analysis and first principles calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group theoretical aspects of the three temperature-dependent and temperature-reversible experimentally observed phase transitions in the KNbO3 crystal (cubic-tetragonal, tetragonal-orthorhombic, orthorhombic-rhombohedral) in the framework of the group-subgroup relationship tree have been discussed. The ab initio DFT-HSE06 LCAO calculations of the electron and phonon properties, with optimisation of lattice parameters and atomic coordinates for all experimentally observed KNbO3 phases, are used for better understanding of the details of these phase transitions. Good agreement with the experimental data was found for the structural properties. Ab initio calculations of the phonon dispersion curves confirmed the existence of a stable phase only for the rhombohedral structure found experimentally for the lowest temperature of 263 K. For the remaining three higher temperature phases, imaginary frequencies appear, implying a nonstability of these phases. The only the cubic-tetragonal phase transition has been found to be symmetry allowed. The tetragonal-orthorhombic and orthorhombic-rhombohedral phases are not related to the group-subgroup relationship. An explanation is proposed based also on the results of ab initio calculations of the structure of the monoclinic phase, which we have chosen as a virtual one for the tetragonal-orthorhombic transition in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Integrating Graph Neural Networks and Many-Body Expansion Theory for Potential Energy Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rational design of next-generation functional materials relied on quantitative predictions of their electronic structures beyond single building blocks. First-principles quantum mechanical (QM) modeling became infeasible as the size of a material grew beyond hundreds of atoms. In this study, we developed a new computational tool integrating fragment-based graph neural networks (FBGNN) into the fragment-based many-body expansion (MBE) theory, referred to as FBGNN-MBE, and demonstrated its capacity to reproduce full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (FD-PES) for hierarchic chemical systems with manageable accuracy, complexity, and interpretability. In particular, we divided the entire system into basic building blocks (fragments), evaluated their single-fragment energies using a first-principles QM model and attacked many-fragment interactions using the structure-property relationships trained by FBGNNs. Our development of FBGNN-MBE demonstrated the potential of a new framework integrating deep learning models into fragment-based QM methods, and marked a significant step towards computationally aided design of large functional materials.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Microstructural Evolution in All-Solid-State Micro-Batteries through in situ Electrochemical TEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-solid-state batteries hold great promise for electric vehicle applications due to their enhanced safety and higher energy density. However, further performance optimization requires a deeper understanding of their degradation mechanisms, particularly at the nanoscale. This study investigates the real-time degradation processes of an oxide-based all-solid-state micro-battery, using focused ion beam lamellae composed of LAGP as the solid electrolyte, LiFePO4 (LFP) composite as the positive electrode, and LiVPO4 (LVP) composite as the negative electrode. In situ electrochemical transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed critical degradation phenomena, including the formation of cracks along grain boundaries in the solid electrolyte due to lithium diffusion and mechanical stress. Additionally, the shrinkage of solid electrolyte particles and the formation of amorphous phases were observed. These findings highlight the importance of grain boundary dynamics and amorphization in the performance of solid electrolytes and provide insights into degradation mechanisms that can inform the design of more durable all-solid-state batteries.</description>

      <title>Density Functional Theory Study of Surface Stability and Phase Diagram of Orthorhombic CsPbI3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CsPbI3 has been recognized as a promising candidate for optoelectronic device applications. To further improve the efficiency of the devices, it is imperative to better understand the surface properties of CsPbI3, which affect charge carrier transport and defect formation properties. In this study, we perform density functional theory calculations to explore the stability of the (001), (110), and (100) surfaces of orthorhombic CsPbI3, considering different stoichiometries and surface reconstructions. Our results show that, under the chemical potentials confined by the thermodynamically stable region of bulk CsPbI3, the CsI-terminated surfaces of (001) and (110) and the stoichiometric surface of (100) are stable. Among these three surfaces, the CsI-terminated (110) surface has the lowest surface energy and no mid-gap states, which benefits the transport properties of the material.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of diffusion processes at Al(Si)/Si(111) interphase boundaries obtained by vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics and parallel-replica dynamics simulations are applied to investigate the atomic structures and diffusion processes at {\text{Al}\{111\}}\parallel{\text{Si}}\{111\} interphase boundaries constructed by simulated vapor deposition of Al(Si) alloy on Si(111) substrates. Different orientation relationships and interface structures are obtained for different pre-deposition Si (111) surface reconstructions. Diffusion of both Al and Si atoms at the interfaces is calculated and compared with diffusion along grain boundaries, triple junctions, contact lines, and threading dislocations in the Al-Si system. It is found that {\text{Al}\{111\}}\parallel{\text{Si}}\{111\} interphase boundaries exhibit the lowest diffusivity among these structures and are closest to the lattice diffusivity. In most cases (except for the Si substrate), Si atoms are more mobile than Al atoms. The diffusion processes are typically mediated by Al vacancies and Si interstitial atoms migrating by either direct or indirect interstitial mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pt-based electrocatalysts are the primary choice for fuel cells due to their superior oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. To enhance ORR performance and durability, extensive studies have investigated transition metal alloying, doping, and shape control to optimize the three key governing factors for ORR: geometry, local chemistry, and strain of their surface and subsurface. However, systematic optimization remains incomplete, as it requires an atomic-scale understanding of these factors and their dynamics over potential cycling, as well as their relationship to ORR activity. Here, we implement neural network-assisted atomic electron tomography to measure the 3D atomic structural dynamics and their effects on the functional degradation of PtNi alloy catalysts. Our results reveal that PtNi catalysts undergo shape changes, surface alloying, and strain relaxation during cycling, which can be effectively mitigated by Ga doping. By combining geometry, local chemistry, and strain analysis, we calculated the changes in ORR activity over thousands of cycles and observed that Ga doping leads to higher initial activity and greater stability. These findings offer a pathway to understanding 3D atomic structural dynamics and their relation to ORR activity during cycling, paving the way for the systematic design of durable, high-efficiency nanocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Single-layer spin-orbit-torque magnetization switching due to spin Berry curvature generated by minute spontaneous atomic displacement in a Weyl oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin Berry curvature characterizes the band topology as the spin counterpart of Berry curvature and is crucial in generating novel spintronics functionalities. By breaking the crystalline inversion symmetry, the spin Berry curvature is expected to be significantly enhanced; this enhancement will increase the intrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials and, thus, the spin-orbit torques (SOTs). However, this intriguing approach has not been applied to devices; generally, the extrinsic spin Hall effect in ferromagnet/heavy-metal bilayer is used for SOT magnetization switching. Here, SOT-induced partial magnetization switching is demonstrated in a single layer of a single-crystalline Weyl oxide SrRuO3 (SRO) with a small current density of ~3.1{\times}10^6 A cm-2. Detailed analysis of the crystal structure in the seemingly perfect periodic lattice of the SRO film reveals barely discernible oxygen octahedral rotations with angles of ~5{\deg} near the interface with a substrate. Tight-binding calculations indicate that a large spin Hall conductivity is induced around small gaps generated at band crossings by the synergy of inherent spin-orbit coupling and band inversion due to the rotations, causing magnetization reversal. Our results indicate that a minute atomic displacement in single-crystal films can induce strong intrinsic SOTs that are useful for spin-orbitronics devices.</description>

      <title>Imprinting electrically switchable scalar spin chirality by anisotropic strain in a Kagome antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Applying strain to epitaxial thin films has proven to be an effective approach for controlling material properties, paving the way for "materials by design". In this study, we explore this concept in the context of topological Kagome antiferromagnets, which can exhibit a range of exotic magnetic states. One such material, Mn$_{3}$Sn, features a non-collinear yet coplanar inverse triangular spin order that lacks scalar spin chirality. By applying anisotropic strain to reduce the point group symmetry of the Kagome triangles from $C_{3v}$ to $C_{1}$, and utilizing the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in epitaxial Mn$_{3}$Sn heterostructures, we achieve a canting of the manganese spins out of the Kagome plane. This newly induced magnetic state introduces a finite scalar spin chirality and results in a significant Berry phase in momentum space. Consequently, a large anomalous Hall effect emerges in the Kagome plane at room temperature, which can be fully controlled by charge current, enabling the realization of multiple-stable antiferromagnetic memory states.</description>

      <title>Deriving mobility-lifetime products in halide perovskite films from spectrally- and time-resolved photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites are semiconductor materials with attractive properties for photovoltaic and other optoelectronic applications. However, determining crucial electronic material parameters, such as charge-carrier mobility and lifetime, is plagued by a wide range of reported values and inconsistencies caused by interpreting and reporting data originating from different measurement techniques. In this paper, we propose a method for the simultaneous determination of mobility and lifetime using only one technique: transient photoluminescence spectroscopy. By measuring and simulating the decay of the photoluminescence intensity and the redshift of the photoluminescence peak as a function of time after the laser pulse, we extract the mobility, lifetime, and diffusion length of halide perovskite films. With a voltage-dependent steady-state photoluminescence measurement on a cell, we relate the diffusion length to the external voltage and quantify its value at the maximum power point.</description>

      <title>Ion generation by photoionization and photofield tunneling of electrons during atom probe tomography of thermally grown chromia with deep UV laser light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaporation mechanisms during laser-assisted field evaporation of thermally grown chromia is investigated with the newest generation of commercial atom probe tomography instrument, equipped with a deep-UV laser (257.5 nm, 4.8 eV photon energy). By holding the voltage constant, the electrostatic field is kept constant, and the evolution of detection rate is recorded. The detection rate is measured as a function of laser pulse energy for chromia and the metallic alloy Ni-20Cr, where the expected thermal evaporation is observed. Furthermore, the detection rate as a function of electrostatic field is measured for chromia and follows the well-known Fowler-Nordheim type equation. The observation suggests that photoionization and photofield electron tunneling are the rate-limiting steps during evaporation of chromia with deep-UV laser light. The work function and bandgap of the material are discussed, and the evaporation behavior is put into context to existing observations.</description>

      <title>Quench switching of Mn2As</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that epitaxial thin film antiferromagnet Mn2As exhibits the quench-switching effect, which was previously reported only in crystallographically similar antiferromagnetic CuMnAs thin films. Quench switching in Mn2As shows stronger increase in resistivity, reaching hundreds of percent at 5K, and significantly longer retention time of the metastable high-resistive state before relaxation towards the low-resistive uniform magnetic state. Qualitatively, Mn2As and CuMnAs show analogous parametric dependence of the magnitude and relaxation of the quench-switching signal. Quantitatively, relaxation dynamics in both materials show direct proportionality to the N\'eel temperature. This confirms that the quench switching has magnetic origin in both materials. The presented results suggest that the antiferromagnets crystalizing in the Cu2Sb structure are well suited for exploring and exploiting the intriguing physics of highly non-uniform magnetic states associated with the quench switching.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties of metamorphic GaSbBi films on GaAs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the electronic, structural, and optical properties of epitaxial GaSbBi films with varying Bi-concentration (up to 7%Bi) grown on semi-insulating GaAs(100) substrates. The 1 $\mu$m thick GaSbBi epilayers exhibit fully relaxed narrow X-ray diffraction peaks and smooth surface morphology comparable to that of high-quality GaSb epilayers on GaAs. Low temperature photoluminescence spectra exhibit band gap shrinkage consistent with Bi alloying. Electrical Hall measurements indicate reduction of hole concentration and no change in the hole mobilities with increasing Bi content for the nominally undoped GaSbBi alloy. The residual hole concentration reduces from $10^{18} cm^{-3}$ level for a reference GaSb sample, to low $10^{17} cm^{-3}$ level with increasing Bi content. Hole mobility values of around $300 cm^{2}/Vs$ are observed independent of the Bi content. These dependencies are attributed to the Bi surfactant effect and Bi-induced defect formation.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ correlated calculations without finite basis-set error: Numerically precise all-electron RPA correlation energies for diatomic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wavefunction-based $\textit{ab-initio}$ quantum mechanical calculations, achieving absolute convergence with respect to the one-electron basis set is a long-standing challenge. In this work, using the random phase approximation (RPA) electron correlation energy as an example, we show how to compute the basis-error-free RPA correlation energy for diatomic molecules by iteratively solving the Sternheimer equations for first-order wave functions in the prolate spheroidal coordinate system. Our approach provides RPA correlation energies across the periodic table to any desired precision; in practice, the convergence of the absolute RPA energies to the meV-level accuracy can be readily attained. Our method thus provides unprecedented reference numbers that can be used to assess the reliability of the commonly used computational procedures in quantum chemistry, such as the counterpoise correction to the basis set superposition errors, the frozen-core approximation, and the complete-basis-set extrapolation scheme. Such reference results can also be used to guide the development of more efficient correlation-consistent basis sets. The numerical techniques developed in the present work also have direct implications for the development of basis error-free schemes for the GW method or the \textit{ab initio} quantum chemistry methods such as MP2.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Charge Donor-Acceptor Interaction in CsPbBr3 Perovskite Nanocrystals through Ligand Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface ligands in colloidal metal halide perovskites influence not only their intrinsic optoelectronic properties but also their interaction with other materials and molecules. We explore donor-acceptor interactions of CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals with TiO2 nanoparticles and nanotubes by replacing long-chain oleylamine ligands with short-chain butylamines. Through post-synthesis ligand exchange, we functionalize the nanocrystals with butylamine ligands while maintaining their intrinsic properties. In solution, butylamine-capped nanocrystals exhibit reduced photoluminescence intensity with increasing TiO2 concentration but without any change in photoluminescence lifetime. Intriguingly, the Stern-Volmer plot depicts different slopes at low and high TiO2 concentrations, suggesting mixed static and sphere-of-action quenching interactions. Oleylamine-capped nanocrystals in solution, on the other hand, show no interaction with TiO2, as indicated by consistent photoluminescence intensities and lifetimes before and after TiO2 addition. In films, both types exhibit decreased photoluminescence lifetime with TiO2, indicating enhanced donor-acceptor interactions, which are discussed in terms of trap state modification and electron transfer. TiO2 nanotubes enhance nonradiative recombination more in butylamine-capped CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocrystals, emphasizing the role of ligand chain length.</description>

      <title>Colloidal quasi-2D Methylammonium Lead Bromide Perovskite Nanostructures with Tunable Shape and High Chemical Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control over the lateral dimensions of colloidal nanostructures is a complex task which requires a deep understanding of the formation mechanism and reactivity in the corresponding systems. As a result, it provides a well-founded insight to the physical and chemical properties of these materials. In this work, we demonstrate the preparation of quasi-2D methylammonium lead bromide nanostripes and discuss the influence of some specific parameters on the morphology and stability of this material. The variation in the amount of the main ligand dodecylamine gives a large range of structures beginning with 3D brick-like particles at low concentrations, nanostripes at elevated and ultimately nanosheets at large concentrations. The amount of the co-ligand trioctylphosphine can alter the width of the nanostripe shape to a certain degree. The thickness can be adjusted by the amount of the second precursor methylammonium bromide. Additionally, insights are given for the suggested formation mechanism of these anisotropic structures as well as for stability against moisture at ambient conditions in comparison with differently synthesized nanosheet samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion plays a key role in microstructure evolution at multicomponent alloys: diffusion controls the kinetics of phase transformations and alloy homogenization. This study aims at developing computationally efficient approaches to estimate the solute diffusion coefficients in two-component systems. We consider silicon as the solute example because it is highly used in industrial steels. We demonstrate that the silicon jump frequency may be calculated with the bond potential instead of the more computationally expensive machine learning potential in Fe-Si and Fe-Cr-Si alloys. We show that the silicon jump frequency can be estimated from thermodynamic simulations for the bond potential without kinetic simulations. The silicon correlation factor slightly depends on silicon concentration and can be approximately estimated by the analytical nine-frequency model.</description>

      <title>The anti-distortive polaron : an alternative mechanism for lattice-mediated charge trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarons can naturally form in materials from the interaction of extra charge carriers with the atomic lattice. Ubiquitous, they are central to various topics and phenomena such as high-T$_c$ superconductivity, electrochromism, photovoltaics, photocatalysis or ion batteries. However, polaron formation remains poorly understood and mostly relies on few historical models such as Landau-Pekar, Fr\"olich, Holstein or Jahn-Teller polarons. Here, from advanced first-principles calculations, we show that the formation of intriguing medium-size polarons in WO$_3$ does not fit with traditional models but instead arises from the undoing of distortive atomic motions inherent to the pristine phase, which lowers the bandgap through dynamical covalency effects. We so introduce the innovative concept of {\it anti-distortive} polaron and rationalize it from a quantum-dot model. We demonstrate that anti-distortive polarons are generic to different families of compounds and clarify how this new concept opens concrete perspectives for a better control of the polaronic state and related properties.</description>

      <title>Defects in graphite engineered by ion implantation for the self-assembly of gold nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Defect engineering in two-dimensional (2D) materials is essential for advancing applications such as gas sensing, single-atom catalysis, and guided nanoparticle self-assembly, enabling the creation of materials with tailored functionalities. This study investigates ion implantation effects on highly ordered pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surfaces, using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations to identify distinct defect structures. High-energy heavy ions cause inelastic scattering, increasing surface damage, while gold atoms deposited onto defect sites preferentially form atomic clusters. Through focused ion beam techniques, spatially distributed defects were engineered, guiding the self-assembly of nanoparticles. This research highlights the precision of ion irradiation for modifying HOPG surfaces, with significant implications for catalysis, nanotechnology, and the development of functional materials with controlled nanoscale properties.</description>

      <title>Reproducible Monolayer MoS2 Devices Free of Resist Contamination by Gold Mask Lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin MoS2 is a promising material for field-effect transistors (FETs) and electronic devices. However, traditional photolithographic processes introduce surface contamination to 2D materials, leading to poor electrical contacts when metals are deposited. In this work, we present a novel fabrication method using gold as a mask for patterning and etching, which protects 2D materials from contamination in the metal contact region. This technique enabled the fabrication of monolayer MoS2 transistors with clean gold contacts. Additionally, we achieved MoS2 devices with Ohmic contacts, mass-produced traditional lithography and gold mask lithography devices (100 of each), with the latter having a much higher current statistical variance than the former, which demonstrated the effectiveness of this method for contamination-free 2D transistors and potential applications in integrated circuits</description>

      <title>SPEA -- an analytical thermodynamic model for defect phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analytical thermodynamic model for describing defect phase transformations, which we term the statistical phase evaluation approach (SPEA). The SPEA model assumes a Boltzmann distribution of finite size phase fractions and calculates their statistical average. To benchmark the performance of the model, we apply it to construct binary surface phase diagrams of metal alloys. Two alloy systems are considered: a Mg surface with Ca substitutions and a Ni surface with Nb substitutions. To construct a firm basis against which the performance of the analytical model can be leveled, we first perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations coupled with cluster expansion of density functional theory dataset. We then demonstrate the SPEA model to reproduce the MC results accurately. Specifically, it correctly predicts the surface order-disorder transitions as well as the coexistence of the 1/3 ordered phase and the disordered phase. Finally, we compare the SPEA method to the sublattice model commonly used in the CALPHAD approach to describe ordered and random solution phases and their transitions. The proposed SPEA model provides a highly efficient approach for modeling defect phase transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembled molecular monolayer doping remains as a research focus for its nature of being conformal, nondestructive, and self-limiting. Herein, we demonstrate a sulfur monolayer doping in GaAs, facilitated by (NH4)2Sx solution. The Van der Pauw technique, secondary-ion mass spectroscopy, and low-temperature Hall effect measurements show that the sulfur dopants concentration and electron activation rate are 4*10^20 cm-3 and 77.6%, respectively. The donor energy level of sulfur-doped GaAs is located 68 meV below the conduction band. Based on this process, a p-n junction was successfully fabricated on highly doped p-type GaAs substrate.</description>

      <title>Exploring x-ray irradiation conditions for triggering ultrafast diamond graphitization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intense femtosecond x-ray pulses produced by an x-ray free-electron laser can trigger irreversible structural transitions in crystalline solids. For instance, irradiation of diamond can lead to graphitization and, at higher deposited doses, to amorphization. Our Monte Carlo simulations of irradiated diamond under realistic experimental conditions demonstrate that triggering graphitization or other phase transitions with hard x-ray photons can be challenging due to the ballistic escape of photoelectrons out of the beam focus. Decisive parameter here is the photoelectron range in proportion to the focal beam size. For future experiments on x-ray-induced transitions, such dedicated simulations of ballistic transport preceding the beamtime will be necessary. They can predict experimental conditions under which the desired distribution of the absorbed x-ray dose in the irradiated solid can be achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore elemental Si, Ge and Sn free-standing slabs in diamond, clathrate and other competing structures and evaluate their stability by comparing Kohn-Sham total energies at the same atoms/area coverage $\rho$. We find that within 3-6 ML range (in units of diamond monolayer), the surface energy stabilizes clathrates against the bulk-stable diamond structure or other competitors, for all three elements. At~1.3-1.6 ML coverages, Si and Ge stable layers are adatomic decorations of the puckered honeycomb lattice, forming a dumbbell--decorated pattern with rectangular unit cell. Analogical Sn layer is unstable to a web-like net of interconnected Sn$_9$ clusters. The zoo of stable thin-layer non-diamond structures is completed by a Sn metallic bilayer at 2.3 ML coverage.</description>

Abstract: We compute from density functional theory calculations the dynamical magnetic effective charges of the Jahn-Teller ground state of KCoF$_3$ and we unexpectedly obtain the largest up-to-date values reported in real materials (close to 200$\times 10^{-2}\mu_{\text{B}}/\text{\r{A}}$). We determine that those large values are due to both spin and orbital contributions, as expected from the presence of unquenched Co-d orbital magnetic moment, even though we show that the Co dynamical magnetic effective charges values are surprisingly zero by symmetry. Hence, we conclude that even if KCoF$_3$ is not multiferroic, it is antimagnetoelectric with a compensating but large individual magnetic sublattice magnetoelectric response of 210 ps/m per spin-channel. Our study shows that the dynamical magnetic effective charges might be an important property of magnetic materials beyond the magnetoelectric ones.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Determining Ground State Energy of Protocatechuic Acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising hybrid algorithm, utilizing both quantum and classical computers to obtain the ground state energy of molecules. In this context, this study applies VQE to investigate the ground state of protocatechuic acid, analyzing its performance with various Ans\"atze and active spaces. Subsequently, all VQE results were compared to those obtained with the Hartree-Fock (HF) method. The results demonstrate that Ans\"atze, like unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) and variations of Hardware-Efficient, generally achieve accuracy close to that of HF. Furthermore, the increase in active space has led to the models becoming more difficult to converge to values with a greater distance from the correct energy. In summary, the findings of this study reinforce the use of VQE as a powerful tool for analyzing molecular ground state energies. Finally, the results underscore the critical importance of Ansatz selection and active space size in VQE performance, providing valuable insights into its potential and limitations.</description>

      <title>Half-Metallicity in Triangulene-based Superatomic Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) magnets has opened up new possibilities for miniaturizing spintronic devices to the monolayer limit. 2D half-metals, capable of conducting fully spin-polarized currents when spin-orbit coupling is minimal, provide a key advantage in improving device performance. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out to discover 2D half-metals, yet their realization remains elusive. Here we report the bottom-up synthesis of superatomic graphene and the demonstration of its half-metallic properties. The produced graphene half-metal is fabricated through an on-surface synthetic approach with phosphorus-doped triangulene as its building block. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements reveal its metallic band structures and identify its ferromagnetism through magnon excitation under varying magnetic fields. Density functional theory simulations accurately capture its half-metallic characteristics, uncovering the origin of spin-polarized bands from the p$_x,_y$-like orbital of superatomic graphene. Our work demonstrates intrinsic 2D carbon magnetism, paving the way for harnessing its advantages in spintronics.</description>

      <title>Scaling theory of charge transport and thermoelectric response in disordered 2D electron systems: From weak to strong localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new theoretical scheme for charge transport and thermoelectric response in two-dimensional disordered systems exhibiting crossover from weak localization (WL) to strong localization (SL). The scheme is based on the scaling theory for Anderson localization combined with the Kubo-Luttinger theory. Key aspects of the scheme include introducing a unified $\beta$ function that seamlessly connects the WL and SL regimes, as well as describing the temperature ($T$) dependence of the conductance from high to low $T$ regions on the basis of the dephasing length. We found that the Seebeck coefficient, $S$, behaves as $S\propto T$ in the WL limit and as $S\propto T^{1-p}$ ($p &lt; 1$) in the SL limit, both with possible logarithmic corrections. The scheme is applied to analyze experimental data for thin films of the p-type organic semiconductor poly[2,5-bis(3-alkylthiophen-2-yl)thieno(3,2-b)thiophene] (PBTTT).</description>

Abstract: For photon-spin conversion, the Ge hole system in a strained GeSi/Ge quantum well with a diamond structure has attracted significant attention because of the potential for a high-performance spin qubit and optical transitions ranging in telecom bands. We calculated the electron g-factor for strained Ge, analyzing its dependence on both the growth directions ([100], [110], and [111]) and the Ge content of the SiGe substrate using an 8-band model. Our results indicate that the absolute values of the electron g-factor decrease with decreasing Ge content, ranging from approximately -3.0 to -1.4 for all growth directions.</description>

      <title>Controlled Delivery of Reactive Oxygen Species by Functionalized Catalytic Plasma Coatings for Antimicrobial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasing complications due to bacterial and viral infections require novel antimicrobial approaches. One emerging strategy is that based on catalysts able to selectively deliver reactive oxygen species (ROS) without leaching of other substances. In particular, metal oxide thin films activated by daylight can produce ROS by simply catalyzing oxygen and water molecules. This study examines plasma technology, combining deposition and oxidation processes, as well as plasma polymerization, to obtain functionalized AgOx-doped titanium oxide (TiOx) catalytic materials. The high-energy conditions in the reactive, ionized gas enable the intrinsic formation of a large number of reactive sites at defects and interfaces between the metal oxide nanostructures. Furthermore, plasma functionalization with nanoporous SiOx films (up to 100 nm thick) allows to precisely control the ROS delivery as well as unravel ROS formation mechanism at the metal oxide interface. Combining fluorescence spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance, the controlled delivery of superoxide anion and singlet oxygen has been tuned based on the thickness of the nanoporous functional layer. ROS delivery by functionalized catalytic plasma coating has been related to excellent antimicrobial activity against E. coli bacteria as well as murine hepatitis virus, while avoiding cytotoxic and sensitization effects.</description>

      <title>The Mechanical Behavior of Macroscale Single-crystal Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive microscale studies, the macroscopic mechanical properties of monolayer graphene remain underexplored. Here, we report the Young's modulus ($E$ = 1.11 $\pm$ 0.04 TPa), tensile strength (${\sigma}$ = 27.40 $\pm$ 4.36 GPa), and failure strain (${\epsilon}_f$ = 6.01 $\pm$ 0.92 %) of centimeter-scale single-crystal monolayer graphene (SCG) 'dog bone' samples with edges aligned along the zigzag (zz) direction, supported by an ultra-thin polymer (polycarbonate) film. For samples with edges along the armchair (ac) direction, we obtain $E$ = 1.01 $\pm$ 0.10 TPa, ${\sigma}$ = 20.21 $\pm$ 3.22 GPa, ${\epsilon}_f$ = 3.69 $\pm$ 0.38 %, and for chiral samples whose edges were between zz and ac, we obtain $E$= 0.75 $\pm$ 0.12 TPa, ${\sigma}$ = 23.56 $\pm$ 3.42 GPa, and ${\epsilon}_f$ = 4.53 $\pm$ 0.40 %. The SCG is grown on single crystal Cu(111) foils by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We used a home-built 'float-on-water' (FOW) tensile testing system for tensile loading measurements that also enabled in situ crack observation. The quantized fracture mechanics (QFM) analysis predicts an edge defect size from several to tens of nanometers based on chirality and notch angle. Through Weibull analysis and given that the fatal defects are confined on the edges of macroscale samples, we projected strength ranging from 13.67 to 18.43 GPa for an A4-size SCG according to their chirality. The exceptional mechanical performance of macroscale single crystal graphene (SCG) paves the way for its widespread use in a very wide variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Spin migration in density functional theory: energy, potential and density perspectives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin is a fundamental property of any many-electron system. The ability of density functional theory to accurately predict the physical properties of a system, while varying its spin, is crucial for describing magnetic materials and high-spin molecules, spin flip, magnetization and demagnetization processes. Within density functional theory, when using various exchange-correlation approximations, the exact dependence of the energy on the spin often deviates from the exact constant or piecewise-linear behavior, which is directly related to the problem of strong (static) correlation and challenges the description of molecular dissociation. In this paper, we study the behavior of the energy, the frontier Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals, the KS potentials and the electron density, with respect to fractional spin, in different atomic systems. We analyze five standard exchange-correlation functionals and find three main scenarios of deviation from the expected exact results. We clearly recognize a jump in the frontier orbital energies upon spin variation in the exact exchange and in hybrid functionals, and the related plateau in the corresponding KS potential. Our results are instrumental for the assessment of the quality of existing approximations from a new perspective and for the development of advanced functionals with sensitivity to magnetic properties.</description>

      <title>Phosphorene Junctions as a Platform for Spin-Selective Quantum Dots in Next-Generation Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of vacancies on spin-resolved electronic properties of quantum dots (QDs) in phosphorene-based junctions, are investigated numerically. Regardless of the crystal orientation, a phosphorene nanoribbon (PNR) containing a monovacancy is found to exhibit a topological quasi-flat band that emerges within the band gap. The electronic properties of QDs, including spatial confinement and energy level distribution, can be strongly tuned by controlling the topological structure of the QDs and by applying electric fields. Additionally, these QDs exhibit remarkable spin-selective properties under a ferromagnetic exchange field, enabling the manipulation of QD features. This opens up the potential for novel applications such as quantum computing, magnetic sensing, spin-based light emission.</description>

      <title>Wiedermann-Franz Law and Thermoelectric Inequalities: Effective ZT and Single-leg Efficiency Overestimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermoelectric inequality in thermoelectric conversion between the material figure of merit (ZT) and the module effective ZT using the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation combining with the Wiedermann-Franz law. In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT values of the P- and N-legs. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT is less than approximately one-third of the leg's ZT. This reduction results from the need for an external wire to complete the circuit, introducing additional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis shows that, although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the system efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg material efficiency. Our findings explain the single-leg efficiency overestimation and highlight the importance of optimizing the P-N leg-pair module structure. They also underscore the need for thermoelectric leg-compatibility, particularly with respect to Seebeck coefficients.</description>

      <title>Is the Harris criterion valid in the case of geometric disorders?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Harris criterion imposes a constraint on the critical behavior of a system upon introduction of new disorder, based on its dimension $d$ and localization length exponent $\nu$. It states that the new disorder can be relevant only if $d \nu &lt; 2$. We analyze the applicability of the Harris criterion to the network disorder formulated in the paper [I. A. Gruzberg, A. Kl\"umper, W. Nuding, and A. Sedrakyan, Phys. Rev. B 95, 125414 (2017)] and show that the fluctuations of the geometry are relevant despite $d \nu&gt; 2$, implying that Harris criterion should be modified. We have observed that the fluctuations of the critical point in different quenched configurations of disordered network blocks is of order $L^0$, i.e.~it does not depend on block size $L$ in contrast to the expectation based on the Harris criterion that they should decrease as $L^{-d/2}$ according to the central limit theorem. Since $L^0 &gt; (x-x_c)$ is always satisfied near the critical point, the mentioned network disorder is relevant and the critical indices of the system can be changed. We have also shown that our disordered network is fundamentally different from Voronoi-Delaunay and dynamically triangulated random lattices: the probability of higher connectivity in our network decreases in a power law as opposed to an exponential, indicating that we are dealing with a ``scale free" network, such as the Internet, protein-protein interactions, etc.</description>

      <title>Capping layer dependent anti-correlation between magnetic damping and spin-orbital to charge conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic Gilbert damping and spin-orbital to charge interconversion phenomenon play vital role in controlling the modern spintronics device performances. Though the ferromagnets (FMs) and heavy metals (HMs) are considered to be the key components of the future spin-orbit torque magnetic random access memory (SOT-MRAM) devices, recently the integration of lighter materials with low intrinsic spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in spintronics devices has proven to be noteworthy. Here we demonstrate the efficient control of magnetization dynamics of $\beta$-W/CoFeB bilayer when capped by low SOC organic and inorganic layers. The C$_{60}$ capping layer (CL) significantly enhances the magnetization relaxation process compared to the CuO$_x$ in $\beta$-W/CoFeB/CL heterostructures, while the static magnetic properties remain in-different irrespective of the nature of CL. Interestingly, the spin-orbital to charge conversion phenomenon is found to be enhanced for $\beta$-W/CoFeB/CuO$_x$ stacking compared to the $\beta$-W/CoFeB/C$_{60}$ heterostructure, signifying the anti-correlation between the magnetic damping and spin-orbital to charge conversion. The results are interpreted by the interfacial phenomena, like the orbital Rashba effect, two-magnon scattering, and interfacial spin memory loss. Our detailed experimental investigations shed light on the importance of low SOC materials in effectively tuning the magnetization dynamics for the development of future power efficient spintronics devices.</description>

      <title>Bright dipolar excitons in twisted black phosphorus homostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bright dipolar excitons, which contain electrical dipoles and have high oscillator strength, are an ideal platform for studying correlated quantum phenomena. They usually rely on carrier tunneling between two quantum wells or two layers to hybridize with nondipolar excitons to gain oscillator strength. In this work, we uncovered a new type of bright infrared dipolar exciton by stacking 90{\deg}-twisted black phosphorus (BP) structures. These excitons, inherent to the reconstructed band structure, exhibit high oscillator strength. Most importantly, they inherit the linear polarization from BP, which allows light polarization to be used to select the dipole direction. Moreover, the dipole moment and resonance energy can be widely tuned by the thickness of the BP. Our results demonstrate a useful platform for exploring tunable correlated dipolar excitons.</description>

      <title>Casimir-Polder interaction between an atom and a Chern insulator: topological signature and long-range repulsion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Casimir-Polder interaction between a two-level atomic system and a Chern insulator for both the resonant and nonresonant channels. For a right circularly polarized excited atomic state near a Chern insulator with a negative Chern number $C$, the resonant Casimir-Polder force can be monotonically repulsive over a large range of separations. In the presence of the same Chern insulator, a right circularly polarized metastable atomic state is expected to experience a repulsive nonresonant Casimir-Polder force over a certain range of atom-surface separations in the far-field region. At still greater separations, the nonresonant Casimir-Polder force is expected to become attractive and exhibit a topological signature, being proportional to $(C\alpha)^2/(1+(C\alpha)^2)$, where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant.</description>

      <title>Hafnia-based Phase-Change Ferroelectric Steep-Switching FETs on a 2-D MoS$_2$ platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric field-effect transistors integrated on 2D semiconducting platforms are extremely relevant for low power electronics. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel phase-change ferroelectric field effect transistor (PCFE-FET) for steep switching applications. Our gate stack is engineered as a ferroelectric Lanthanum doped hafnium oxide (LHO) proximity coupled with Mott insulator Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) and is integrated onto a 2D MoS$_2$ channel. The interplay of partial polarization switching in the ferroelectric LHO layer and reversible field-tunable metal-insulator transition (MIT) in Ti$_x$O$_{2x-1}$(N$_y$) layer concomitantly triggers polar to non-polar phase transition in the LHO layer between 200 and 220 K. This results in distinctive step-like features in the channel current during DC measurements, and random current fluctuations in high-speed measurements with slim anticlockwise hysteresis. Our devices show subthreshold slopes as steep as 25 mV/dec at 210 K, breaking the Boltzmann limit. Our gate stack is also potentially tunable for operation at temperatures of interest, presenting innovative gate stack engineering approaches for low-power computing solutions.</description>

      <title>Competing charge density wave phases in YNiC2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.</description>

      <title>High-Speed Graphene-based Sub-Terahertz Receivers enabling Wireless Communications for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the telecommunications field has experienced an unparalleled proliferation of wireless data traffic. Innovative solutions are imperative to circumvent the inherent limitations of the current technology, in particular in terms of capacity. Carrier frequencies in the sub-terahertz (sub-THz) range (~0.2-0.3 THz) can deliver increased capacity and low attenuation for short-range wireless applications. Here, we demonstrate a direct, passive and compact sub-THz receiver based on graphene, which outperforms state-of-the-art sub-THz receivers. These graphene-based receivers offer a cost-effective, CMOS-compatible, small-footprint solution that can fulfill the size, weight, and power consumption (SWaP) requirements of 6G technologies. We exploit a sub-THz cavity, comprising an antenna and a back mirror, placed in the vicinity of the graphene channel to overcome the low inherent absorption in graphene and the mismatch between the areas of the photoactive region and the incident radiation, which becomes extreme in the sub-THz range. The graphene receivers achieve a multigigabit per second data rate with a maximum distance of ~3 m from the transmitter, a setup-limited 3 dB bandwidth of 40 GHz, and a high responsivity of 0.16 A/W, enabling applications such as chip-to-chip communication and close proximity device-to-device communication.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks Based Deep Learning for Predicting Structural and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a deep learning approach to predicting structural and electronic properties of materials using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Leveraging data from the Materials Project database, we construct graph representations of crystal structures and employ GNNs to predict multiple properties simultaneously. All crystal structures are from the Materials Project database, with a total of 158,874 structures used. Our model achieves high predictive accuracy across various properties, as indicated by \( R^2 \) values: 0.96 for density, 0.97 for formation energy, 0.54 for energy above hull, 0.47 for structural stability (is\_S), 0.76 for band gap, 0.86 for valence band maximum, 0.78 for conduction band minimum, and 0.82 for Fermi energy. These results demonstrate the potential of GNNs in materials science, offering a powerful tool for rapid screening and discovery of materials with desired properties.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast all-optical generation of pure spin and valley currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure currents comprise the flow of a two state quantum freedom -- for example the electron spin -- in the absence of charge flow. Radically different from the charge currents that underpin present day electronics, in two dimensional materials possessing additional two state freedoms such as valley index they offer profound possibilities for miniaturization and energy efficiency in a next generation spin- and valley- tronics. Here we demonstrate a robust multi-pump light wave protocol capable of generating both pure spin and valley currents on femtosecond times. The generation time is determined by the 2d material gap, with the creation of pure spin current in WSe2 at 40 fs and pure valley current in bilayer graphene at ~200 fs. Our all-optical approach demands no special material design, requiring only a gapped valley active material, and is thus applicable to a wide range of 2d materials.</description>

      <title>Creation and control of valley currents in graphene by few cycle light pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Well established for the visible spectrum gaps of the transition metal dichalcogenide family, valleytronics - the control of valley charge and current by light - is comparatively unexplored for the THz gaps that characterize graphene and topological insulators. Here we show that few cycle pulses of THz light can create and control a 100% valley polarized current in graphene, with light wave control over the current magnitude and direction. The latter is equal to an emergent pulse property of few cycle circularly polarized pulses, the "global" carrier envelope phase. Our findings both highlight the richness of few cycle light pulses in control over quantum matter, and provide a route towards a "THz valleytronics" in meV gapped systems.</description>

      <title>Polyvalent Machine-Learned Potential for Cobalt: from Bulk to Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the development and applications of a quadratic Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (q-SNAP) for ferromagnetic cobalt. Trained on Density Functional Theory calculations using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (DFT-PBE) functional, this machine-learned potential enables simulations of large systems over extended time scales across a wide range of temperatures and pressures at near DFT accuracy. It is validated by closely reproducing the phonon dispersions of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) and face-centered cubic (fcc) Co, surface energies, and the relative stability of nanoparticles of various shapes. An important feature of this novel potential is its numerical stability in long molecular dynamics simulations. This robustness is exploited to compute the heat capacity of nanoparticles containing up to 9201 atoms, showing convergence to less than 2 J.K-1.mol-1 after 100 ns. Computations of the melting temperature of nanoparticles as a function of their size revealed a convergence to the bulk limit in excellent agreement with the experimental value. Thus, the new, highly accurate machine-learned potential for Co opens exciting opportunities for further applications such as the dynamics of nanoparticles in catalytic reactions.</description>

      <title>Tuning THz magnons in a mixed van-der-Waals antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alloying stands out as a pivotal technological method employed across various compounds, be they metallic, magnetic, or semiconducting, serving to fine-tune their properties to meet specific requirements. Ternary semiconductors represent a prominent example of such alloys. They offer fine-tuning of electronic bands, the band gap in particular, thus granting the technology of semiconductor heterostructures devices, key elements in current electronics and optoelectronics. In the realm of magnetically ordered systems, akin to electronic bands in solids, spin waves exhibit characteristic dispersion relations, featuring sizeable magnon gaps in many antiferromagnets. The engineering of the magnon gap constitutes a relevant direction in current research on antiferromagnets, aiming to leverage their distinct properties for THz technologies, spintronics, or magnonics. In this study, we showcase the tunability of the magnon gap across the THz spectral range within an alloy comprising representative semiconducting van-der-Waals antiferromagnets FePS$_3$ and NiPS$_3$. These constituents share identical in-plane crystal structures, magnetic unit cells and the direction of the magnetic anisotropy, but differ in the amplitude and sign of the latter. Altogether these attributes result in the wide tunability of the magnon gap in the Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$PS$_3$ alloy in which the magnetic order is imposed by stronger, perpendicular anisotropy of iron.</description>

      <title>Stress Predictions in Polycrystal Plasticity using Graph Neural Networks with Subgraph Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polycrystal plasticity in metals is characterized by nonlinear behavior and strain hardening, making numerical models computationally intensive. We employ Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to surrogate polycrystal plasticity with complex geometries from Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations. We present a novel message-passing GNN that encodes nodal strain and edge distances between FEM mesh cells, aggregates them to obtain embeddings, and combines the decoded embeddings with the nodal strains to predict stress tensors on graph nodes. We demonstrate training GNN based on subgraphs generated from FEM mesh-graphs, in which the mesh cells are converted to nodes and edges are created between adjacent cells. The GNN is trained on 80\% of the graphs and tested on the rest (90 graphs in total). We apply the trained GNN to periodic polycrystals and learn the stress-strain maps based on crystal plasticity theory. The GNN is accurately trained based on FEM graphs, in which the $R^2$ for both training and testing sets are 0.993. The proposed GNN plasticity constitutive model speeds up more than 150 times compared with the benchmark FEM method on randomly selected test polycrystals. We also apply the trained GNN to 30 unseen FEM simulations and the GNN generalizes well with an overall $R^2$ of 0.992. Analysis of the von Mises stress distributions in polycrystals shows that the GNN model accurately learns the stress distribution with low error. By comparing the error distribution across training, testing, and unseen datasets, one deduces that the proposed model does not overfit and generalizes well beyond the training data. This work outlooks surrogating computationally intensive crystal plasticity simulations using graph data.</description>

      <title>Smallest [5,6]fullerene as building blocks for 2D networks with superior stability and enhanced photocatalytic performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The assembly of molecules to form covalent networks can create varied lattice structures with distinct physical and chemical properties from conventional atomic lattices. Using the smallest stable [5,6]fullerene units as building blocks, various 2D C$_{24}$ networks can be formed with superior stability and strength compared to the recently synthesised monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. Monolayer C$_{24}$ harnesses the properties of both carbon crystals and fullerene molecules, such as stable chemical bonds, suitable band gaps and large surface area, facilitating photocatalytic water splitting. The electronic band gaps of C$_{24}$ are comparable to TiO$_2$, providing appropriate band edges with sufficient external potential for overall water splitting over the acidic and neutral pH range. Upon photoexcitation, strong solar absorption enabled by strongly bound bright excitons can generate carriers effectively, while the type-II band alignment between C$_{24}$ and other 2D monolayers can separate electrons and holes in individual layers simultaneously. Additionally, the number of surface active sites of C$_{24}$ monolayers are three times more than that of their C$_{60}$ counterparts in a much wider pH range, providing spontaneous reaction pathways for hydrogen evolution reaction. Our work provides insights into materials design using tunable building blocks of fullerene units with tailored functions for energy generation, conversion and storage.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we review the models and their parameters to describe the relative permittivity, bandgap, impact ionization, mobility, charge carrier recombination/effective masses and incomplete dopand ionization of 4H silicon carbide in computer simulations. We aim to lower the entrance barrier for newcomers and provide a critical evaluation of the status quo to identify shortcomings and guide future research. The review reveals a rich set of often diverging values in literature based on a variety of calculation and measurement methods. Although research for all the selected parameters is still active, we show that sometimes old values or those determined for other kinds of silicon carbide are commonly used.</description>

      <title>Terahertz electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of the electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals induced by an intense single-cycle terahertz pulse. The effect reveals itself as a transient change of the polarization state of a femtosecond laser pulse reflected from the crystal that is exposed to the terahertz electric field. The corresponding experimental signal is apparently instantaneous with respect to the field and contains a linear (Pockels) and a quadratic (Kerr) components of comparable magnitude. The latter does not depend on the crystal orientation, while the former demonstrates three-fold rotational symmetry in agreement with the trigonal symmetry of the crystal surface. The electro-optic effect vanishes upon phase transition to the non-topological metal state induced by indium doping and also can be quenched by a femtosecond pre-pulse. We associate this effect with surface Dirac electronic states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and discuss its possible mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Effect of antisite disorder on the magnetic and transport properties of a quaternary Heusler alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin gapless semiconductors based Heusler alloys are the special class of materials due to their unique band structure, high spin polarization and high Curie temperature. These materials exhibit a distinct electronic structure: a nonzero band gap in one spin channel while the other spin channel remains gapless, making them highly suitable for tunable spintronics. In this study, a comprehensive analysis of structural, magnetic, thermoelectric, and transport properties of the quaternary Heusler alloy CoFeMnSn is conducted. X-ray diffraction and Neutron diffraction analyses confirm a well ordered structure with partial antisite disorder between Co, Fe and Mn, Sn atoms. Magnetic studies show that the material exhibits room-temperature ferromagnetism, with a Curie temperature of around 660 K. Notably, we observe an anomalous Hall effect linked to intrinsic mechanisms driven by Berry curvature, underscoring the intricate relationship between structural disorder and electronic behavior. Transport measurements also highlight the impact of antisite disorder on the systems, with resistivity decreasing as temperature increases. These insights position CoFeMnSn as a promising material for future spintronic devices and advanced technological applications.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-biased molecular dynamics for learning uniformly accurate interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficiently creating a concise but comprehensive data set for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) is an under-explored problem. Active learning, which uses biased or unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) to generate candidate pools, aims to address this objective. Existing biased and unbiased MD-simulation methods, however, are prone to miss either rare events or extrapolative regions -- areas of the configurational space where unreliable predictions are made. This work demonstrates that MD, when biased by the MLIP's energy uncertainty, simultaneously captures extrapolative regions and rare events, which is crucial for developing uniformly accurate MLIPs. Furthermore, exploiting automatic differentiation, we enhance bias-forces-driven MD with the concept of bias stress. We employ calibrated gradient-based uncertainties to yield MLIPs with similar or, sometimes, better accuracy than ensemble-based methods at a lower computational cost. Finally, we apply uncertainty-biased MD to alanine dipeptide and MIL-53(Al), generating MLIPs that represent both configurational spaces more accurately than models trained with conventional MD.</description>

      <title>Stability of correlated insulating states in molecular conductors from first-principles calculation</title>

Abstract: Electronic properties of molecular conductors exhibiting antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin order and charge order (CO) owing to electron correlation are studied using first-principles density functional theory calculations. We investigate two systems, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott insulator $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$ with an AFM ground state, and several members of quasi-one-dimensional (TMTTF)$_2$$X$ showing CO. The stabilities of the AFM and CO states are compared between the use of a standard exchange-correlation functional based on the generalized gradient approximation and that of a range-separated hybrid functional; we find that the latter describes these states better. For $\beta^\prime$-(BEDT-TTF)$_{2}$ICl$_{2}$, the AFM order is much stabilized with a wider band gap. For (TMTTF)$_2$$X$, only by using the hybrid functional, the AFM insulating state is realized and the CO states coexisting with AFM order are stable under structural optimization, whose stability among different \textit{X} shows the tendency consistent with experiments.</description>

      <title>Super-luminal Synthetic Motion with a Space-Time Optical Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of light with superluminally moving matter entails unconventional phenomena, from Fresnel drag to Hawking radiation and to light amplification. While relativity makes these effects inaccessible using objects in motion, synthetic motion - enabled via space-time modulated internal degrees of freedom - is free from these constraints. Here we observe synthetic velocity of a reflectivity modulation travelling on an Indium-Tin-Oxide (ITO) interface, generated by ultrafast laser illumination at multiple positions and times. The interaction of the moving reflectivity modulation with a probe light beam acts as a non-separable spatio-temporal transformation that diffracts the light, changing its frequency and momentum content. The recorded frequency-momentum diffraction pattern is defined by the velocity of the diffracted probe wave relative to the modulation. Our experiments open a path towards mimicking relativistic mechanics and developing programmable spatio-temporal transformations of light.</description>

      <title>Microheterogeneity and Single-Molecule Mixture Science: An Introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14485</link>

Abstract: Microheterogeneity, as a fundamental natural property, is widely presented in a range of microscopic systems such as polymer systems, biomacromolecular systems, and nanosystems, however, the construction of molecular systems of this form has not yet been realized at the level of organic molecules with well-defined structural compositions. Inspired by the "chemical space" concept, I recently reported a study of the single molecule mixture state, In this preprint, a detailed discussion of microheterogeneity and the concept of "single-molecule mixture" has been provided.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature valley-selective emission in Si-MoSe2 heterostructures enabled by high-quality-factor chiroptical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09806</link>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) possess valley pseudospin, allowing photon spin to be coupled to electron spin and enabling initialization and readout of both classical and quantum information. Rapid valley-dephasing processes have impeded the development of scalable, high-performance valleytronic devices operating at room temperature. Here we demonstrate that a chiral resonant metasurface can enable room-temperature valley-selective emission, even with linearly polarized excitation. This platform provides circular eigen-polarization states with a high quality factor (Q-factor) and strong chiral near-field enhancement, resulting in unitary emission circular dichroism (i.e. single-handed circularly polarized emission). Our fabricated Si chiral metasurfaces exhibit chiral electromagnetic modes with Q-factors up to 450 at visible wavelengths, spectrally tuned to the exciton energy of MoSe2 monolayers. Using spatially- and spectrally-resolved mapping from temperatures of 100 K to 294 K, we demonstrate degrees of circular polarization (DOP) reaching a record high of 0.5 at room temperature. Reciprocal space mapping of the exciton emission reveals the chiral q-BIC localizes valley-selective emission in the vicinity of the photonic gamma-point. Photon-spin and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements show that the high DOP can be attributed to the significantly increased chiroptical local density of states provided by the metasurface, which enhances valley-specific radiative transition rates by a factor of approximately 13, with lifetimes as short as 189 ps. Our work could facilitate the development of compact chiral classical and quantum light sources and the creation of molecular chiral polaritons for quantum enantioselective synthesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical structure factors of Warm Dense Matter from Time-Dependent Orbital-Free and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculations of the inelastic part of the dynamical structure factor (DSF) for warm dense matter (WDM) using Time-Dependent Orbital-Free Density Functional Theory (TD-OF-DFT) and Mixed-Stochastic-Deterministic (mixed) Kohn Sham TD-DFT (KS TD-DFT). WDM is an intermediate phase of matter found in planetary cores and laser-driven experiments, where the accurate calculation of the DSF is critical for interpreting X-ray Thomson scattering (XRTS) measurements. Traditional TD-DFT methods, while highly accurate, are computationally expensive, motivating the exploration of TD-OF-DFT and mixed TD-KS-DFT as more efficient alternatives. We applied these methods to experimentally measured WDM systems, including solid-density aluminum and beryllium, compressed beryllium, and carbon-hydrogen mixtures. Our results show that TD-OF-DFT requires a dynamical kinetic energy potential in order to qualitatively capture the plasmon response. Additionally, it struggles with capturing bound electron contributions and accurately modeling plasmon dynamics without the inclusion of a dynamic kinetic energy potential. In contrast, mixed TD-KS-DFT offers greater accuracy in distinguishing bound and free electron effects, aligning well with experimental data, though at a higher computational cost. This study highlights the trade-offs between computational efficiency and accuracy, demonstrating that TD-OF-DFT remains a valuable tool for rapid scans of parameter space, while mixed TD-KS-DFT should be preferred for high-fidelity simulations. Our findings provide insight into the future development of DFT methods for WDM and suggest potential improvements for TD-OF-DFT.</description>
