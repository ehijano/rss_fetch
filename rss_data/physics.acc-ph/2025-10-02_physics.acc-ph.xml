      <title>An electro-optical bunch profile monitor for FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Future Circular Lepton Collider (FCC-ee) presents challenges for a longitudinal bunch profile monitor due to its wide range of bunch lengths and charge densities across its four distinct operational modes. For commissioning, monitoring the top-up injection, and energy calibration, the FCC-ee requires non-destructive, single-shot measurements of the bunch length and profile. This contribution proposes an in-vacuum electro-optical (EO) longitudinal bunch profile monitor for single-shot measurements at high repetition rates, building on the successful EO monitor at the Karlsruhe Research Accelerator (KARA) at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. A novel single-pass conceptual design for the in-vacuum holder of the electro-optical crystal is presented, utilizing prisms instead of a mirror to guide the laser through the crystal, which additionally allows measurements of the long bunches foreseen for FCC-ee operation mode at the Z-pole energy. A first prototype has been constructed and tested at the in-air test stand of the CERN Linear Electron Accelerator for Research (CLEAR). Results from the prototype tests are presented, demonstrating the proof of principle for the single-pass prism-based EO monitor design for FCC-ee.</description>

      <title>Accurate Modelling of Intrabeam Scattering and its Impact on Photoinjectors for Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrabeam scattering (IBS) is a fundamental effect that can limit the performance of high-brightness electron machines, yet it has so far been neglected in standard modelling of RF photoinjectors. Recent measurements at SwissFEL reveal that the slice energy spread (SES) in the injector is significantly underestimated by conventional tracking codes. In this work, we present a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation model that accurately predicts the IBS-induced SES growth in the photoinjector of an X-ray free-electron laser. The simulations are benchmarked against SES measurements at the SwissFEL as well as theoretically supported by a new analytical model. The results demonstrate that IBS-induced SES growth occurs throughout the injector, most prominently in the electron source, and must be taken into account when assessing photoinjector performance. We further show that while the 5D brightness is largely conserved, the 6D brightness undergoes notable degradation with propagation, underscoring the need to include IBS in the accurate design and optimization of photoinjectors.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Niobium Coaxial Cavity with $\sim0.1\,$second Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the internal quality factor of a three-dimensional niobium quarter-wave coaxial cavity, with mid-temperature annealing, exhibiting $Q_{\rm int} \gtrsim 3\times10^9$ at the single-photon level below 20\,mK, which corresponds to an internal photon lifetime of $\tau_{\rm int}\sim90\,\mathrm{ms}$. Moreover, $Q_{\rm int}$ of the mid-temperature annealed cavities remains almost unchanged even after several cooldown cycles and air exposure. These results suggest that stable low-loss niobium oxides might be formed by mid-temperature annealing on the surface of three-dimensional niobium cavity. This surface treatment could be applicable to the fabrication of 2D superconducting circuits and help improve the lifetime of Nb-based superconducting qubits.</description>
