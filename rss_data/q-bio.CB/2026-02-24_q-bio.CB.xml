      <title>A mathematical model for the role of macrophage chemotactic emigration in the early atherosclerotic plaque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atherosclerotic plaques are fatty, cellular lesions that form in artery walls. The early plaque contains monocyte-derived macrophages, which are recruited to consume locally bound lipid deposits. Plaque progression is characterised by an imbalance in the rates of cell entry and exit from the plaque, which can occur if macrophages die in situ rather than leave by emigration. The mechanisms that regulate macrophage emigration are not well understood, but there is evidence that a chemotactic response can guide macrophages out of the plaque towards the artery wall lymphatics.
  In this paper, we develop a novel spatial model of the early plaque to study the implications of macrophage chemotactic emigration. Using mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, we investigate how the properties of the chemotactic response contribute to the spatial characteristics and lipid burden of the model plaque. Calculations of macrophage transit times are found to provide a reliable indicator of long-term plaque lipid burden, and also highlight the potential rate-limiting effect of the internal elastic lamina (IEL) on chemotactic emigration. When macrophage emigration is rate-limited by the IEL, we observe non-monotonic cell and lipid profiles that are associated with macrophage accumulation deep in the plaque. The model further predicts that when the chemoattractant penetrates only a short distance into the plaque, the proportion of emigrating macrophages may increase relative to that for a longer-range signal. The theoretical observations in this study can potentially be used to identify evidence of macrophage emigration in data from real atherosclerotic plaques.</description>

      <title>Geometric Limits of Mitotic Pressure Under Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells often divide under mechanical confinement, where surrounding structures restrict shape changes during cytokinesis. Although forces generated during confined division have been measured experimentally, it remains unclear how confinement geometry and mechanics determine the transmitted force. Here we develop a minimal mechanical theory of cell division under confinement. Modeling the cell as an incompressible volume bounded by an interface with effective isotropic tension, we show that confinement restricts the set of mechanically admissible furrow shapes. As the furrow radius decreases, it reaches it reaches a confinement-induced minimum. Beyond this point, further ingression does not alter the interface shape, and both pressure and axial force saturate. We analyze force and pressure in rigid, soft, and strong three-dimensional confinement and demonstrate that a single geometric mechanism underlies these distinct cases. After rescaling force and length by the appropriate geometric scale, cells of different size and surface tension collapse onto a single universal curve. The relevant length scale is the cell size for rigid and soft confinement, and the confinement size in fully enclosing three-dimensional confinement. In soft confinement, environmental stiffness and spindle-generated axial forces determine the operating force and pressure, while the geometric constraint fixes the maximal attainable levels. In summary, our results show that mitotic force transmission and mitotic pressure during cytokinesis are bounded by confinement geometry, with material properties and active forces selecting the operating point within these geometry-imposed limits.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale modeling of Snail-mediated response to hypoxia in tumor progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tumor cell migration within the microenvironment is a crucial aspect for cancer progression and, in this context, hypoxia has a significant role. An inadequate oxygen supply acts as an environmental stressor inducing migratory bias and phenotypic changes. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale mathematical model to analyze the pivotal role of Snail protein expression in the cellular responses to hypoxia. Starting from the description of single-cell dynamics driven by the Snail protein, we construct the corresponding kinetic transport equation that describes the evolution of the cell distribution. Subsequently, we employ proper scaling arguments to formally derive the equations for the statistical moments of the cell distribution, which govern the macroscopic tumor dynamics. Numerical simulations of the model are performed in various scenarios with biological relevance to provide insights into the role of the multiple tactic terms, the impact of Snail expression on cell proliferation, and the emergence of hypoxia-induced migration patterns. Moreover, quantitative comparison with experimental data shows the model's reliability in measuring the impact of Snail transcription on cell migratory potential. Through our findings, we shed light on the potential of our mathematical framework in advancing the understanding of the biological mechanisms driving tumor progression.</description>

      <title>A kinetic derivation of spatial distributed models for tumor-immune system interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical kinetic framework to investigate interactions between tumor cells and the immune system, focusing on the spatial dynamics of tumor progression and immune responses. We develop two kinetic models: one describes a conservative scenario where immune cells switch between active and passive states without proliferation, while the other incorporates immune cell proliferation and apoptosis. By considering specific assumptions about the microscopic processes, we derive macroscopic systems featuring linear diffusion, nonlinear cross-diffusion, and nonlinear self-diffusion. Our analysis provides insights into equilibrium configurations and stability, revealing clear correspondences among the macroscopic models derived from the same kinetic framework. Using dynamical systems theory, we examine the stability of equilibrium states and conduct numerical simulations to validate our findings. These results highlight the significance of spatial interactions in tumor-immune dynamics, paving the way for a structured exploration of therapeutic strategies and further investigations into immune responses in various pathological contexts.</description>

      <title>Go-or-Grow Models in Biology: a Monster on a Leash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Go-or-grow approaches represent a specific class of mathematical models used to describe populations where individuals either migrate or reproduce, but not both simultaneously. These models have a wide range of applications in biology and medicine, chiefly among those the modeling of brain cancer spread. The analysis of go-or-grow models has inspired new mathematics, and it is the purpose of this review to highlight interesting and challenging mathematical properties of reaction--diffusion models of the go-or-grow type. We provide a detailed review of biological and medical applications before focusing on key results concerning solution existence and uniqueness, pattern formation, critical domain size problems, and traveling waves. We present new general results related to the critical domain size and traveling wave problems, and we connect these findings to the existing literature. Moreover, we demonstrate the high level of instability inherent in go-or-grow models. We argue that there is currently no accurate numerical solver for these models, and emphasize that special care must be taken when dealing with the "monster on a leash".</description>
