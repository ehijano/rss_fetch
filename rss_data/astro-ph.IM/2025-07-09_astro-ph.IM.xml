      <title>SKYSURF-10: A Novel Method for Measuring Integrated Galaxy Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the drizzling pipeline and contents of the drizzled database for Hubble Space Telescope Cycle 27-29 Archival Legacy project "SKYSURF," the largest archival project ever approved for Hubble. SKYSURF aims to investigate the extragalactic background light (EBL) using all 143,914 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR images that have been taken by Hubble since its launch in 2002. SKYSURF has produced 38,027 single-visit mosaics and 7,893 multi-visit mosaics across 28 ACSWFC, WFC3UVIS, and WFC3IR filters using non-standard drizzling methods, which include preserving the lowest sky-level of each visit/group in the drizzled products, applying wider apertures for cosmic ray rejection, correcting effects caused by charge transfer efficiency (CTE) degradation, and removing potential light gradients from input images via sky-map subtraction. We generate source catalogs for all drizzled products with Source Extractor and provide updated star-galaxy separation parameters and integrated galaxy light (IGL) estimates for 25 of the 28 SKYSURF filters (wavelength range 0.2-1.7 microns) using a novel IGL fitting method made possible by the vast SKYSURF dataset. We discuss the data processing and data analysis challenges encountered, detail our solutions, and offer suggestions that may facilitate future large-scale IGL investigations with Webb, SPHEREx, and Roman.</description>

      <title>On the computational feasibility of Bayesian end-to-end analysis of LiteBIRD simulations within Cosmoglobe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the computational feasibility of end-to-end Bayesian analysis of the JAXA-led LiteBIRD experiment by analysing simulated time ordered data (TOD) for a subset of detectors through the Cosmoglobe and Commander3 framework. The data volume for the simulated TOD is 1.55 TB, or 470 GB after Huffman compression. From this we estimate a total data volume of 238 TB for the full three year mission, or 70 TB after Huffman compression. We further estimate the running time for one Gibbs sample, from TOD to cosmological parameters, to be approximately 3000 CPU hours. The current simulations are based on an ideal instrument model, only including correlated 1/f noise. Future work will consider realistic systematics with full end-to-end error propagation. We conclude that these requirements are well within capabilities of future high-performance computing systems.</description>

      <title>PRATUSH experiment concept and design overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PRATUSH -- Probing ReionizATion of the Universe using Signal from Hydrogen -- is a proposed cosmology experiment to detect the global red-shifted 21-cm signal from the Cosmic Dawn and Epoch of Reionization (CD/EoR). PRATUSH orbiting the Moon will seek to precisely measure the low-frequency radio sky-spectrum over 40 to 200 MHz. The scientific observations would be made in the radio-quiet region when in the farside of the Moon, and the data would be transmitted back to Earth when in the near-side. PRATUSH was proposed to the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) during a call for proposals in the announcement of opportunity for science payloads in 2018. PRATUSH is in the pre-project studies phase. Here we present a mission concept and baseline design of the proposed payload optimized to operate over the Cosmic Dawn signal band of 55 - 110 MHz. Starting with a description of the fundamental design principles followed, we discuss the PRATUSH baseline design and sensitivity. We further enumerate the challenges that are common to most PRATUSH like experiments, which have been proposed to seek a detection of the CD/EoR signal in orbit in the lunar farside. Due to the highly sensitive nature of the measurement, PRATUSH is designed to operate as a solo experiment with a dedicated spacecraft. Our simulations, assuming a mission lifetime of two years, estimate that PRATUSH would have the sensitivity required to detect the CD signal predicted by the standard models with varying degrees of confidence.A concept model of PRATUSH is under development, which is expected to lead to the engineering model followed by flight model subject to mission approval.</description>

      <title>An SBC-based controller and processor for the laboratory model of PRATUSH Digital Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probing ReionizATion of the Universe using Signal from Hydrogen (PRATUSH) is a proposed space-based radiometer that aims to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm signal from Cosmic Dawn - a crucial phase in the cosmic evolution of the Universe. PRATUSH will operate in the frequency range of 55-110 MHz. PRATUSH will conduct observations in low earth orbit in its first phase, followed by lunar orbit in the second phase. Digital correlation spectrometer is an integral subsystem of PRATUSH radiometer, enabling phase switching, digitization and generation of sky spectrum. The digital correlation spectrometer for PRATUSH laboratory model features 10-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and a Virtex-6 Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). A Raspberry Pi 4 Model B-based single-board computer (SBC) serves as the master controller, real-time processor and data recorder, to minimize the power, mass and volume requirement of the laboratory model. This paper presents the implementation of the PRATUSH laboratory model digital receiver, challenges arising from the use of an SBC in place of a conventional computer, and demonstrates the performance of the spectrometer when integrated with the PRATUSH laboratory model analog receiver.</description>

      <title>What ZTF Saw Where Rubin Looked: Anomaly Hunting in DR23</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the SNAD VIII Workshop, during which we conducted the first systematic anomaly search in the ZTF fields also observed by LSSTComCam during Rubin Scientific Pipeline commissioning. Using the PineForest active anomaly detection algorithm, we analysed four selected fields (two galactic and two extragalactic) and visually inspected 400 candidates. As a result, we discovered six previously uncatalogued variable stars, including RS~CVn, BY Draconis, ellipsoidal, and solar-type variables, and refined classifications and periods for six known objects. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the SNAD anomaly detection pipeline and provide a preview of the discovery potential in the upcoming LSST data.</description>

      <title>Causal Foundation Models: Disentangling Physics from Instrument Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models for structured time series data must contend with a fundamental challenge: observations often conflate the true underlying physical phenomena with systematic distortions introduced by measurement instruments. This entanglement limits model generalization, especially in heterogeneous or multi-instrument settings. We present a causally-motivated foundation model that explicitly disentangles physical and instrumental factors using a dual-encoder architecture trained with structured contrastive learning. Leveraging naturally occurring observational triplets (i.e., where the same target is measured under varying conditions, and distinct targets are measured under shared conditions) our model learns separate latent representations for the underlying physical signal and instrument effects. Evaluated on simulated astronomical time series designed to resemble the complexity of variable stars observed by missions like NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), our method significantly outperforms traditional single-latent space foundation models on downstream prediction tasks, particularly in low-data regimes. These results demonstrate that our model supports key capabilities of foundation models, including few-shot generalization and efficient adaptation, and highlight the importance of encoding causal structure into representation learning for structured data.</description>

      <title>Explaining ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3 &lt; z &lt; 5$ in the context of their environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The swift assembly of the earliest galaxies poses a significant challenge to our understanding of galaxy formation. Ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshifts ($3 &lt; z &lt; 5$) currently present one of the most pressing problems for theoretical modeling, since very few mechanisms can be invoked to explain how such galaxies formed so early in the history of the Universe. Here, we exploit the fact that these galaxies all reside within significant overdensities to explain their masses. To this end, we construct and release a modified version of the Extreme Value Statistics (EVS) code which takes into account galaxy environment by incorporating clustering in the calculation. With this new version of EVS, we find that ultra-massive quiescent galaxies at $3&lt;z&lt;5$ do not present as serious a tension with simple models of galaxy formation when the analysis of a given galaxy is conditioned on its environment.</description>

      <title>The Effects of Cuboid Particle Scattering on Reflected Light Phase Curves: Insights from Laboratory Data and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the optical properties of exoplanet cloud particles is a top priority. Many cloud condensates form as nonspherical particles and their optical properties can be very different from those of spheres. In this study, we focus on KCl particles, which likely form as cuboids in warm (T=500-1000K) exoplanet atmospheres. We compare the phase functions (at 532 nm wavelength) of KCl particles computed with Mie theory, the two-term Henyey-Greenstein (TTHG) approximation, laboratory data, and the discrete dipole approximation (DDA). Mie theory assumes scattering from spheres, while TTHG functions are used to approximate cloud scattering in two-stream radiative transfer models like PICASO. Laboratory measurements and DDA allow for a robust understanding of scattering from cuboid and deformed cuboid particle shapes. We input these phase functions into PICASO using cloud distributions from the cloud model Virga, to determine how different phase functions can impact the reflected-light intensities of the benchmark sub-Neptune, GJ 1214b. Simulated reflected light phase curves of GJ1214b produced using the TTHG, laboratory, and DDA phase curves differ by less than 3ppm. Our findings suggest that TTHG phase functions may be useful for approximating the scattering intensity of certain cuboid and irregular particle shapes. Future work should expand upon the wavelengths and particles considered to better determine when scattering approximations, like TTHG, may be useful in lieu of more accurate, but time-consuming laboratory measurements and/or nonspherical scattering theory.</description>

      <title>Analytical description of the radio Cherenkov cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio emissions from extensive air showers (EAS) provide a valuable tool for detecting ultra-high-energy (UHE) astroparticles. In this context, several radio arrays focus on detecting highly inclined EAS, as this enables the observation of Earth-skimming UHE neutrinos, in addition to cosmic rays and gamma rays. The reconstruction of such inclined events relies heavily on a thorough understanding of the radio features observed on the ground, with the Cherenkov cone being one of the most prominent. In this study, we demonstrate that the Cherenkov cone can be accurately described for inclined air showers using basic propagation principles. Furthermore, we have developed an analytical model that computes the expected opening angles of the cone and reproduces the asymmetry effects observed in simulations. The high accuracy of these computations can enhance current reconstruction methods and pave the way for the development of new ones.</description>

      <title>A New Search Pipeline for Short Gamma Ray Bursts in Fermi/GBM Data -- A 50% Increase in the Number of Detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the development and the results of a new search pipeline for short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) in the publicly available data from the Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on board the Fermi satellite. This pipeline uses rigorous statistical methods that are designed to maximize the information extracted from the Fermi/GBM detectors. Our approach differs substantially from existing search efforts in several aspects: The pipeline includes the construction of template banks, Poisson matched filtering, background estimation, background misestimation correction, automatic routines to filter contaminants, statistical estimation of the signal location and a quantitative estimator of the signal probability to be of a cosmological, terrestrial, or solar origin. Our analysis also includes operating the pipeline on "time-slided" copies of the data, which allows exact significance assessment and $p_{\text{astro}}$ computation, akin to the state-of-the-art gravitational waves (GW) data analysis pipelines. Depending on the spectral properties of the bursts, our pipeline achieves a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement by a factor of 2 to 15 over the onboard GBM triggering algorithm. This enhancement increases the detectable volume for sGRBs and results in an approximate 50% increase in sGRB detections in the 2014 GBM dataset. As a further consequence of the sensitivity increase, we detect hundreds of soft gamma-ray flares of galactic origin. This improved sensitivity enhances the chances of detecting fainter, off-axis GRBs that would likely fall below the standard triggering thresholds. Applying this pipeline to the full GBM archive is expected to expand further the joint sGRB-GW detection volume.</description>

      <title>Progress of the GRANDProto300 Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRANDProto300 (hereafter referred to as GP300) is a pioneering prototype array of the GRAND experiment. It consists of 300 radio antennas and will cover an area of 200 km$^2$ in a radio-quiet region of western China. Serving as a test bench for the GRAND experiment, GRANDProto300 aims to achieve autonomous radio detection and reconstruction of highly inclined air showers. It is designed to detect ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in the energy range of $10^{16.5}$-$10^{18}$ eV at a rate comparable to that of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Over the past two years, significant improvements have been made to both the hardware and firmware of GP300. Currently, 65 antenna units have been deployed at the site by June 2025. We present the current status of detector commissioning, including updates on hardware, calibration results such as GPS timing and antenna positioning. Additionally, we discuss the solar radio bursts associated with solar flares, the galactic radio emissions detected, and preliminary cosmic ray surveys.</description>

      <title>Development of Bayesian methods for the characterization of galaxy star formation histories through stellar population synthesis models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This project establishes parameters to characterize galaxy Star Formation History (SFH) beyond mean stellar age. We use ages at which fixed star fractions form to characterize SFH duration. We define Deltaage_n = (age_10 - age_90)/age_50 for SFH extension, where age_10, age_90, age_50 correspond to ages when 10%, 90%, and 50% of stars formed. Probability distributions for observed galaxies use robust Bayesian statistics comparing observed and model spectral features. We create composite stellar population (CSP) libraries using SEDlibrary software, implementing varied SFH, metallicity, and dust properties. We compare spectra using ten features: five spectral indices (D4000n, [Hdelta+Hgamma], Hbeta, [Mg_2Fe], [MgFe]') and five SDSS ugriz photometric fluxes. First, we focus on limiting Deltaage_n distinguishing extended from negligible SFH duration, Deltaage_n,min (time resolution). Using idealized CSP library of 5 million dust-free, burst-free models with fixed metallicities from subsolar to supersolar, Deltaage_n,min marks where spectral features depend on SFH duration. We find roughly flat log(Deltaage_n,min) around -0.3 dex over 4 magnitude orders in age. Deltaage_n,min decreases with higher SNR up to SNR=100, beyond which no improvement occurs. Second, we create mock datasets by perturbing 12,500 library models with realistic errors, testing retrieval capability for characteristic ages and SFH duration using realistic 500,000-model CSP library with up to 6 starbursts, dust, and variable metallicity. We constrain SFH duration log(Deltaage_n) within +-0.3 dex for most samples. For populations with strong Balmer absorption and mean age &lt;10^9 yr, uncertainty exceeds 0.5 dex due to SFH degeneracies. These parameters will apply to current and upcoming deep spectroscopic galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Observation of Broadband In-ice Radiation from Impacting High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice radiofrequency emission from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array trigger of the Askaryan Radio Array, we detect 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency pulses originating from below the ice surface. Considering only the arrival angles and timing properties, this rate is inconsistent with an a-posteriori background expectation for thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of 3.5$\,\sigma$, which rises to 5.1$\,\sigma$ when additionally considering impulsivity. The observed event geometry, event rate, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern independently favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source.</description>

      <title>IceCat-2: Updated IceCube Event Catalog of Alert Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present preliminary results for IceCat-2, the second public catalog of IceCube Alert Tracks, which plans to build and improve upon the first release, IceCat-1. The initial catalog, last updated in October 2023, included all real-time alerts issued since 2016, as well as events observed by IceCube since the start of full-detector data collection in 2011 that would have triggered an alert if the program had been in place at that time. IceCat-2 plans to expand on this by incorporating all additional alerts since IceCat-1, and reprocessing all events with significantly improved reconstruction algorithms. A key advancement in IceCat-2 will come from an updated reconstruction technique introduced by the IceCube Collaboration in September 2024. This approach substantially enhances the angular resolution of muon track alerts, while also improving statistical coverage. With respect to IceCat-1, the 50%(90%) angular uncertainty on track alerts is expected to be reduced by a factor of approximately 5(4). These refined reconstructions will allow us to revisit possible correlations between past alerts and sources in gamma-ray and X-ray catalogs. The enhanced precision may uncover new astrophysical associations with known astrophysical sources, offering deeper insight into potential cosmic ray accelerators.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Method for Constraining the Capability of the Habitable Worlds Observatory to Understand Ozone Onset Time in Earth Analogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere 2.3 billion years ago, which on exoplanets is expected to be most detectable via the UV ozone feature at $\sim$0.25 $\mu$m, is often regarded as a sign of the emergence of photosynthetic life. On exoplanets, we may similarly expect life to oxygenate the atmosphere, but with a characteristic distribution of emergence times. In this paper, we test our ability to recover various "true" emergence time distributions as a function of 1) stellar age uncertainty and 2) number of Earth analogs in the sample. The absolute uncertainties that we recover, for diverse underlying distributions, are mostly independent of the true underlying distribution parameters, and are more dependent on sample size than stellar age uncertainty. For a sample size of 30 Earth analogs, and an HWO architecture sensitive to ozone at 1% of the current atmospheric level on Earth, we find that no ozone detections across the entire sample would place a 10$\sigma$ limit on the mean time of ozone emergence, regardless of stellar age uncertainty.</description>

      <title>GalaxyGenius: Mock galaxy image generator for various telescopes from hydrodynamical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce GalaxyGenius, a Python package designed to produce synthetic galaxy images tailored to different telescopes based on hydrodynamical simulations. Its implementation will support and advance research on galaxies in the era of large-scale sky surveys. The package comprises three main modules: data preprocessing, ideal data cube generation, and mock observation. Specifically, the preprocessing module extracts necessary properties of star and gas particles for a selected subhalo from hydrodynamical simulations and creates the execution file for the following radiative transfer procedure. Subsequently, building on the above information, the ideal data cube generation module executes a widely used radiative transfer project, specifically the SKIRT, to perform the SED assignment for each particle and the radiative transfer procedure to produce an IFU-like ideal data cube. Lastly, the mock observation module takes the ideal data cube and applies the throughputs of aiming telescopes, while also incorporating the relevant instrumental effects, point spread functions (PSFs), and background noise to generate the required mock observational images of galaxies. To showcase the outcomes of GalaxyGenius, we created a series of mock images of galaxies based on the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE simulations for both space and ground-based surveys, spanning ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR) wavelength coverage, including CSST, Euclid, HST, JWST, Roman, and HSC. GalaxyGenius offers a flexible framework to generate mock galaxy images with customizable recipes. These generated images can serve as valuable references for verifying and validating new approaches in astronomical research. They can also serve as training sets for relevant studies using deep learning in cases where real observational data are insufficient.</description>

      <title>A demonstration of the effect of fringe-rate filtering in the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array delay power spectrum pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio interferometers targeting the 21cm brightness temperature fluctuations at high redshift are subject to systematic effects that operate over a range of different timescales. These can be isolated by designing appropriate Fourier filters that operate in fringe-rate (FR) space, the Fourier pair of local sidereal time (LST). Applications of FR filtering include separating effects that are correlated with the rotating sky vs. those relative to the ground, down-weighting emission in the primary beam sidelobes, and suppressing noise. FR filtering causes the noise contributions to the visibility data to become correlated in time however, making interpretation of subsequent averaging and error estimation steps more subtle. In this paper, we describe fringe rate filters that are implemented using discrete prolate spheroidal sequences, and designed for two different purposes -- beam sidelobe/horizon suppression (the `mainlobe' filter), and ground-locked systematics removal (the `notch' filter). We apply these to simulated data, and study how their properties affect visibilities and power spectra generated from the simulations. Included is an introduction to fringe-rate filtering and a demonstration of fringe-rate filters applied to simple situations to aid understanding.</description>

      <title>Signal-to-noise Ratio Analytic Formulae of the Inspiral Binary Black Holes in TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19401v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes are one of the important sources for the TianQin gravitational wave project. Our research has revealed that, for TianQin, the signal-to-noise ratio of inspiral binary black holes can be computed analytically. This finding is expected to greatly simplify the estimation of detection capabilities for binary black holes. In this paper, we demonstrated the signal-to-noise ratio relationships from stellar-mass black holes to massive black holes. With the all-sky average condition, the signal-to-noise ratio for most binary black hole signals can be determined with a relative error of $\lesssim10\%$, with notable deviations only for chirp masses near $1000~M_\odot$. In contrast, the signal-to-noise ratio without the average includes an additional term, which we refer to as the response factor. Although this term is not easily calculated analytically, we provide a straightforward estimation method with an error margin of $1\sigma$ within 2\%.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB temperature power spectrum, and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables bidirectional mapping between parameters and acoustic peak features. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves an accuracy of $0.03\%$over $\ell \leq 2510$, while PolyCAMB-peak also reaches sub-percent accuracy and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>A COMPASS to Model Comparison and Simulation-Based Inference in Galactic Chemical Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present COMPASS, a novel simulation-based inference framework that combines score-based diffusion models with transformer architectures to jointly perform parameter estimation and Bayesian model comparison across competing Galactic Chemical Evolution (GCE) models. COMPASS handles high-dimensional, incomplete, and variable-size stellar abundance datasets. Applied to high-precision elemental abundance measurements, COMPASS evaluates 40 combinations of nucleosynthetic yield tables. The model strongly favours Asymptotic Giant Branch yields from NuGrid and core-collapse SN yields used in the IllustrisTNG simulation, achieving near-unity cumulative posterior probability. Using the preferred model, we infer a steep high-mass IMF slope and an elevated Supernova Ia normalization, consistent with prior solar neighbourhood studies but now derived from fully amortized Bayesian inference. Our results demonstrate that modern SBI methods can robustly constrain uncertain physics in astrophysical simulators and enable principled model selection when analysing complex, simulation-based data.</description>
