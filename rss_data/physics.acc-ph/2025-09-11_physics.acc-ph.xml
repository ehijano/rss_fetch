      <title>Dynamic control of laser driven electron acceleration in a photonic structure using programmable optical pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in optical techniques has made precision control of the phase profile in optical pulses common and accessible in scientific laboratories. Carefully shaping the field profile of a laser pulse can be used to master the dynamics of electrons traveling in photonic accelerating structures such as the ones obtained by precisely aligning two dielectric gratings. Here we show that by applying a liquid-crystal-mask to program the phase and amplitude of an infrared laser pulse in combination with a pulse front tilt scheme, it is possible to implement dynamic control on a laser accelerator. This results in a nearly limitless live tuning capability of the accelerator beam dynamics, allowing the demonstration software-based correction of structure and optical front imperfections, implementation of transverse focusing schemes, control of the energy and charge of the output beam, and ultimately optimization of the interaction length, leading to measured energy gains of up to 0.55 MeV.</description>

      <title>Slice Emittance Preservation and Focus Control in a Passive Plasma Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong, symmetrically focusing plasma lenses are promising for accommodating the small beams associated with plasma-based accelerators and collider final foci. However, while focusing with active and passive plasma lenses has been experimentally demonstrated, compatibility with high-brightness beams relevant for applications has not. In this Letter, we show experimentally that passive plasma lenses can preserve free-electron-laser-quality slice emittance while focusing two orders of magnitude more strongly than quadrupole magnets, and that the focal parameters can be controlled.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Photon-Driven Subcritical Reactor Concept Powered by Synchrotron Radiation Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the conceptual design of a Photon Driven Reactor (PDR), an innovative subcritical reactor designed for energy generation driven by a synchrotron radiation. The PDR concept overcomes key technological challenges of conventional accelerator-driven systems, particularly the target's structural durability and its thermal management, by employing synchrotron photons directly interacting with fissile material to induce photonuclear reactions. Computational analyses involved criticality and fixed-source simulation using MCNPx and SERPENT Monte Carlo codes, providing robust evaluation of the neutron production, moderation, and multiplication mechanisms. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the system's capability to achieve a positive net energy gain, specifically assessing the thermal power output agains the electrical power absorbed from the grid. Furthermore, the adoption of spent nuclear fuel for the subcritical reactor core loading has been investigated, highlighting the sustainability and environmental benefits of the proposed PDR design. The proposed system is able to exploit a modularity feature. For each large synchrotron, up to fifty beam lines may be operated simultaneously, each delivering photons to an independent subcritical reactor core. With a photon flux on the order of $8.8 \times 10^{17}$ photons per second in each beamline, the results indicate that each individual reactor can achieve a thermal output up to 8 MW, while requiring about 435-660 kW of electrical input from the grid, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of energy amplification in the PDR.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing of electron beams using solid-state spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scattering experiments with energetic particles, such as free electrons, have been historically used to reveal the quantum structure of matter. However, realizing coherent interactions between free-electron beams and solid-state quantum systems has remained out of reach, owing to their intrinsically weak coupling. Realizing such coherent control would open up opportunities for hybrid quantum platforms combining free electrons and solid-state qubits for coincident quantum information processing and nanoscale sensing. Here, we present a framework that employs negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers (NV-) in diamond as quantum sensors of a bunched electron beam. We develop a Lindblad master equation description of the magnetic free-electron--qubit interactions and identify spin relaxometry as a sensitive probe of the interaction. Experimentally, we integrate a confocal fluorescence microscopy setup into a microwave-bunched electron beam line. We monitor charge-state dynamics and assess their impact on key sensing performance metrics (such as spin readout contrast), defining safe operating parameters for quantum sensing experiments. By performing $T_1$ relaxometry under controlled electron beam exposure, we establish an upper bound on the free-electron--spin coupling strength. Our results establish NV- centers as quantitative probes of free electrons, providing a metrological benchmark for free-electron--qubit coupling under realistic conditions, and chart a route toward solid-state quantum control with electron beams.</description>
