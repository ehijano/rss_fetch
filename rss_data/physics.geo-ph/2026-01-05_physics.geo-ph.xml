      <title>Mapping Supraglacial Water as a Window into Surge Hydrology: Linking Surface Water, Drainage Efficiency, and Surge Dynamics on Negribreen, Svalbard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of Negribreen Glacier System, a polythermal glacier in Svalbard, during its ongoing surge and investigate the role of supraglacial (surface) water as both an indicator of ice-dynamic processes and a driver of surge evolution. We identify three distinct surge phases: the initial acceleration phase, mature phase, and return to quiescence. Comparing the quiescent supraglacial hydrological state to each of the surge phases, we observe a sudden increase in hydrological connectivity between the glacier surface and base during initial acceleration, followed by a gradual return to quiescent water extent. In the mature surge phase, emergent water-filled crevasses coincide with regions of compressive forcing and extensive deformation, follow local accelerations, and preceded smaller, secondary accelerations. Additionaly, rapid drainage of surface ponds is observed in the mature surge. A data-fusion approach, using Maxar WorldView(c) imagery, ICESat-2 altimetry, and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar, is taken to create a time series of supraglacial water maps, water volumes, surface velocity changes, and spatial ice surface roughness. These observations provide a qualitative (process understanding) and quantitative (water time series) basis for supraglacial water sources as a driver and indicator of surge activity for Arctic glaciers.</description>

      <title>Artificial intelligence and downscaling global climate model future projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical review of artificial intelligence and deep machine learning (AI/ML) applied to downscaling of global climate model simulations provides some words of caution, based on past experiences and well-established principles. Recent papers tend to ignore more subtle successes with statistics and mathematical based downscaling, and there are examples of inappropriate evaluation strategies and incomplete accounts of the scientific progress when it comes to climate downscaling. An incomplete description state-of-the-art and a dogmatic approach to evaluation may give a deceiving impression that AI/ML is superior to more statistics and mathematics based methods.</description>

      <title>Carbon mineralization in CO2-seawater-basalt systems: Reactive transport dynamics and vesicular pore architecture controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon mineralization in basaltic rocks may offer rapid, permanent \ce{CO2} storage, yet fundamental controls on reactive transport and precipitation patterns remain poorly understood. This study integrates flow-through experiments at 80\degree C using \ce{CO2}-acidified seawater with geochemical simulation and multi-scale pore imaging to elucidate mineralization dynamics in basaltic glass. Results reveal that carbonate precipitation is nucleation-controlled and stochastic rather than growth-controlled and deterministic, with isolated accumulations forming randomly despite continuous supersaturation. Residence time exerts primary control: reducing flow rate from 0.05 to 0.005\,mL/min proved necessary for visible precipitation. Post-experiment analyses identified calcium carbonate and smectite phases. Multi-scale characterization of three basalt facies revealed that connected porosity fractions (1.3--32\%) differ significantly from total porosity (18--42\%), demonstrating that network topology controls permeability. Micro-CT analysis revealed that pore coordination numbers in basalts (modal = 2) were notably lower than those in reservoir sandstones, creating serial flow paths that are vulnerable to catastrophic permeability loss from modest precipitation. Precipitation-induced clogging scenarios were proposed, where distributed small precipitates cause more severe permeability degradation than large accumulations. The use of seawater complicates geochemistry and reduces mineralization efficiency compared to freshwater. Findings emphasize the need for probabilistic reactive transport modeling frameworks and realistic pore topologies, which are fundamentally different from conventional CCS operations.</description>

      <title>Self-assembled versus biological pattern formation in geology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Both abiotic self-organization and biological mechanisms have been put forward as the origin of a number of geological patterns. It is important to comprehend the formation mechanisms of such structures both to understand geological self-organization and in order to differentiate them from biological patterns -- fossils and bio-influenced structures -- seen in geological systems. Being able to distinguish the traces of biological activity from geological self-organization is fundamental both for understanding the origin of life on Earth and for the search for life beyond Earth.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization for re-analysis and calibration of extreme sea state events simulated with a spectral third-generation wave model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate hindcasting of extreme sea state events is essential for coastal engineering, risk assessment, and climate studies. However, the reliability of numerical wave models remains limited by uncertainties in physical parameterizations and model inputs. This study presents a novel calibration framework based on Bayesian Optimization (BO), leveraging the Tree structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to efficiently estimate uncertain sink term parameters, specifically bottom friction dissipation, depth induced breaking, and wave dissipation from strong opposing currents, in the ANEMOC-3 hindcast wave model. The proposed method enables joint optimization of continuous parameters and discrete model structures, significantly reducing discrepancies between model outputs and observations. Applied to a one month period encompassing multiple intense storm events along the French Atlantic coast, the calibrated model demonstrates improved agreement with buoy measurements, achieving lower bias, RMSE, and scatter index relative to the default sea$-$state solver configuration. The results highlight the potential of BO to automate and enhance wave model calibration, offering a scalable and flexible approach applicable to a wide range of geophysical modeling problems. Future extensions include multi-objective optimization, uncertainty quantification, and integration of additional observational datasets.</description>

      <title>Ultracold Quantum Gravimeters: An Introduction for Geophysicists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims at providing an accessible introduction to ultracold quantum gravimeters tailored for geophysicists. We do not focus here on geophysical applications, as these are already well known to geophysicists, but rather provide a pedagogical exposition of the quantum-mechanical concepts needed to understand the operation of quantum gravimeters. We present a review of gravimeters based on two- and three-level atomic systems, focusing on the fundamental mechanisms of atomic interferometry. The functioning of Mach-Zehnder interferometers is discussed through the action of $\pi/2$ and $\pi$ pulses, showing how the resulting phase shift encodes gravitational acceleration. The effect of noise is briefly discussed.</description>
