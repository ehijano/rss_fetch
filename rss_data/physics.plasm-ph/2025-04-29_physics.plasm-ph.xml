      <title>Ion Mix Can Invert Centrifugal Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In centrifugal plasma traps, electric fields naturally arise in the direction parallel to the magnetic field in order to ensure quasineutrality. These electric fields are sensitive to the particular mix of ion species present. Changing the composition of the plasma can mix or demix different ion species, improve confinement of certain ions, and can even expel certain species from the trap altogether. This makes it possible to generate an ``inverted centrifugal" end-plug with very promising properties.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear interaction between Langmuir and Weibel turbulence in a beam-plasma system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To analyze the joint development of two-stream and filamentation kinetic instabilities in a plasma with a particle beam, a quasilinear approach has been developed that accounts for the integral nonlinear interaction of modes arising from the variation of the spatially averaged velocity distribution function of the particles. On this basis, a numerical study has been carried out within the initial two-dimensional problem for a range of characteristic parameters of the plasma and the beam, focusing on the evolution of Langmuir (two-stream) and Weibel (filamentation) turbulence spectra. It has been established that the evolving Weibel-type magnetic turbulence can significantly reshape the region of the velocity distribution that is resonant with Langmuir waves, thereby strongly influencing the formation and particularly the damping of Langmuir turbulence. In turn, the Langmuir-type quasi-electrostatic turbulence can lead to substantial isotropization of the particle velocity distribution, thus altering the growth rates, evolution, and saturation levels of the Weibel turbulence modes.</description>

      <title>Laser focusing equivalence behavior of mass-limited targets in laser particle acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of 200 MeV class protons by irradiating a 25 J laser pulse onto a water target using three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation is shown. Two types of targets -- foil and disk -- are evaluated and compared. Disks, which are mass-limited targets, produce ions with higher energy than those produced by foils. This enhancement is attributed to laser focusing equivalent effects in mass-limited targets during the acceleration process. In addition, the disk diameter that generates the maximum energy protons is theoretically derived, which shows good agreement with the simulation result.</description>

      <title>Explosive growth of large-scale magnetic fluctuations due to particle scattering on developed small-scale Weibel turbulence in magnetoactive plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical theory of non-linear generation of large-scale magnetic turbulence in anisotropic magnetoactive plasma in the quasilinear approximation without taking into account the direct non-linear interaction of individual harmonics is constructed. It is shown that anomalous collisions of particles due to scattering on small-scale fluctuations of the developed Weibel turbulence lead to instability of long-wave harmonics, which are stable in the linear approximation. The non-linear growth of such harmonics at a given anisotropy of the particle velocity distribution, consistent with the dynamics of short-wave perturbations at the saturation stage and possible anisotropic particle injection, occurs in the superexponential regime and corresponds to an explosive-type instability. The growth law of the large-scale magnetic field is found analytically and the critical time of explosive instability is estimated.</description>

      <title>The effect of ion rotational flow on Hall thruster azimuthal instability via two dimensional PIC simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous experimental studies have found that the neutral gas rotational flow in the opposite direction of electron Hall drift can lead to better experimental results comparing to the same direction. In Hall thrusters, the core factor influencing operational states is the electron cross field transport, where the azimuthal instability serves as a key mechanism. The rotational flow of neutral gas may affect instability by altering initial azimuthal velocity of ions, which has not been investigated before. Therefore, to study the effects of ion rotational flow of varying magnitudes and directions on azimuthal instability, simulations are conducted in this work based on two benchmark particle-in-cell (PIC) cases: the azimuthal-axial and the azimuthal-radial. The results indicate that the ion rotational flow velocity can potentially complicate the coupling characteristics of the electron cyclotron drifting instability and the modified two stream instability, particularly when a reverse rotational flow velocity is added. In general, both co-directional and reverse ion rotational flow have been observed to inhibit azimuthal instability, which results in a decrease in axial electron mobility. A 1% addition of the ion rotational flow (compared to the electron drift) would result in a 10% change of the electron mobility due to varied azimuthal instability, and the decrease in electron mobility of the reverse ion rotational flow is greater than that of co-directional. In addition, detailed spectral analyses are carried out to study the relation between ECDI, MTSI, and resonant wave-wave interactions.</description>

      <title>Quasi-monoenergetic Deuteron Acceleration via Boosted Coulomb Explosion by Reflected Picosecond Laser Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation of quasi-monoenergetic ions by intense laser is one of long-standing goals in laser-plasma physics. However, existing laser-driven ion acceleration schemes often produce broad energy spectra and limited control over ion species. Here we propose the acceleration mechanism, boosted Coulomb explosion, initiated by a standing wave, which is formed in a pre-expanded plasma by the interference between a continuously incoming main laser pulse and the pulse reflected by a solid target, where the pre-expanded plasma is formed from a thin layer on the solid target by a relatively strong pre-pulse. This mechanism produces a persistent Coulomb field on the target front side with field strengths on the order of TV/m for picoseconds. We experimentally demonstrate generation of quasi-monoenergetic deuterons up to 50 MeV using an in-situ D$_2$O-deposited target. Our results show that the peak energy can be tuned by the laser pulse duration.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Power Absorption in CCRF Discharges: Transition from Symmetric to Asymmetric Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work builds upon previous studies of nonlinear dynamics in low-pressure capacitively coupled radio-frequency discharges, focusing on the electron power absorption mechanism in discharges with various geometric asymmetries. We present a comprehensive investigation using a fully kinetic electrostatic 1d3v Particle-in-Cell/Monte Carlo collision simulation in spherical geometry. By systematically varying the inner electrode radius and the electrode gap distance, we analyze the influence of geometric asymmetry on key plasma properties, including electron density, power absorption, electron dynamics, and current characteristics. A central focus is placed on the cumulative power density as a diagnostic for energy deposition. In strongly asymmetric configurations, the cumulative electron power density exhibits distinct stepwise increases during sheath expansion, corresponding to the acceleration of successive electron beams. These nonlinear signatures are directly linked to the excitation of plasma series resonance and enhanced beam-driven power absorption. In contrast, more symmetric configurations display smoother, more symmetric cumulative power evolution, indicating balanced energy transfer at both sheaths and reduced nonlinearities. Time- and space-resolved diagnostics of cumulative power, current waveforms, and densities of energetic electrons reveal the critical role of asymmetry in shaping electron confinement and beam-driven power absorption. These findings demonstrate that the discharge geometry is actually an important design parameter which needs to taken into account during the design and construction phase of a reactor as it directly influences the plasma behavior with respect to energy deposition.</description>

      <title>HIPED: Machine Learning Framework for Spherical Tokamak Pedestal Prediction and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Machine Learning framework, HIPED (HeIght and width Predictor for Edge Dynamics), for predicting and optimizing pedestal and core performance in spherical tokamak plasmas. Trained on pedestal and core datasets from the third MAST-U campaign, HIPED provides accurate estimates of pedestal height and width. The results reveal notable differences compared with conventional aspect-ratio studies; for instance, a simple power-law relation between pedestal width and height has very low accuracy. Instead, additional parameters such as normalized plasma pressure, elongation, and Greenwald fraction significantly improve accuracy. HIPED can also be trained only on `control room parameters' to inform experimentalists of which controllable parameters to adjust for improving core-integrated performance. The framework further includes a multi-objective optimization scheme that helps guide experimental planning and optimization. We find Pareto-optimal discharges with respect to various features, including distance from edge-localized modes and normalized plasma pressure, track their parameter trajectories over time, and identify the control room parameters required for these Pareto-optimal discharges. This provides a framework for systematically optimizing core and edge performance according to different experimental priorities.</description>

      <title>Interaction of Laguerre-Gaussian laser pulses with borane targets of different hydrogen-boron ratio</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of high-intensity Laguerre Gaussian laser pulses with hydrogen-boron compounds targets using 3D particle-in-cell simulations. The ratio of hydrogen to boron is varied throughout different simulation runs as a proxy model for various borane molecules that can be synthesized. We show that the strength of the axial magnetic fields generated via the Inverse Faraday effect depends on the specific ratio of target components, making boranes and the option to tune their composition of interest for proton-boron fusion.</description>

      <title>PaRO-DeepONet: a particle-informed reduced-order deep operator network for Poisson solver in PIC simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations are widely used for modeling plasma kinetics by tracking discrete particle dynamics. However, their computational cost remains prohibitively high, due to the need to simulate large numbers of particles to mitigate statistical noise and the inefficiency in handling complex geometries. To address these challenges, we propose PaRO-DeepONet, a particle-informed reduced-order surrogate framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) with Deep Operator Network (DeepONet). By performing manifold sampling of particle evolution in PIC simulations and constructing snapshot matrices from various particle states, PaRO-DeepONet applies POD projection to extract latent charge density features that are shared across similar plasma scenarios. These reduced features are fed into the branch network of DeepONet, enabling efficient mapping from charge distributions to electrostatic potential fields. We validate PaRO-DeepONet on four representative benchmark cases. The model consistently achieves relative L2 errors below 3.5%, with the best case reaching as low as 0.82%. Notably, although the charge deposition becomes highly discrete due to particle sparsity, PaRO-DeepONet still reconstructs smooth and continuous potential fields, demonstrating strong robustness to sparse inputs and excellent generalization beyond traditional grid-based solvers. In terms of computational performance, PaRO-DeepONet reduces total PIC simulation time by 68%-85% and cuts the Poisson solver runtime by up to 99.6%. By significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high accuracy, this work establishes machine learning-based operator surrogates as a promising new paradigm for next-generation kinetic plasma simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moment-Field Interactions, A Universal Mechanism for Particle Energization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a pivotal mechanisms in the energization and heating of cosmic plasmas, yet the exact process of energy transfer during these events remain elusive. Traditional models, which focus on acoustic and magnetohydrodynamic waves and micro/nano-flares, fall short of explaining the extreme heating of the solar corona and the origins of the supersonic solar wind. In this study, we provide compelling observational evidence from Wind spacecraft data supporting the Raghav effect, a mechanism where interactions between the magnetic moments of charged particles and dynamic magnetic fields result in abrupt kinetic energy changes. Our analysis demonstrates that the observed proton plasma heating is consistent with theoretical predictions, establishing the Raghav effect as a universal mechanism for particle energization. This discovery offers a unified framework for understanding energy dynamics across a wide range of astrophysical magnetised plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Collision parameters needed to measure polarisation-dependent nonlinear pair creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair creation by a $\gamma$ ray in a high-intensity electromagnetic field (the nonlinear Breit-Wheeler process) is sensitive to the $\gamma$-ray polarisation. Here we study the stability required in order to measure this polarisation dependence in a head-on collision between a high-power linearly polarised laser and a relativistic electron beam, where the $\gamma$-rays produced via nonlinear Compton scattering are highly polarised. We find that the laser strength parameter $a_0$ has to be known to within a few per cent, and that the alignment of the laser and electron beam cannot fluctuate by more than half the spot size, in order to attribute the reduction in positron yield to polarisation effects. These collision parameters are difficult to achieve, but may be realised in future precision experiments that focus on beam stability.</description>

      <title>Effective resistivity for magnetohydrodynamic simulation of collisionless magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.12756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electron inertia term and the off-diagonal electron pressure terms are well-known for the frozen-in condition breakdown in collisionless magnetic reconnection, which are naturally kinetic and difficult to be employed in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. After considering the shortcomings of MHD and Hall MHD in neglecting the important electron dynamics such as the inertia and the nongyrotropic pressure, the kinetic characteristics of electrons and ions in the diffusion region are studied and an effective resistivity model involving dynamics of charged particles is proposed [Z. W. Ma et al. 2018 Sci. Rep. 8 10521]. The amplitude of the effective resistivity is mainly determined by electrons in most realistic situations with large ion-electron mass ratios. In this work, the effective resistivity model for collisionless magnetic reconnection without the guide field is successfully applied in the 2.5D MHD and Hall MHD simulations, which remarkably improves the simulation results compared with traditional MHD models. For the MHD case, the effective resistivity significantly increased the reconnection rate to the reasonable value of ~0.1$B_0v_A$. For the Hall MHD case with effective resistivity, the peak reconnection rate is ~0.25$B_0v_A$, the major structures of the reconnecting field and the current sheet agree well with the particle-in-cell (PIC) and hybrid simulations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven reduced modeling of streamer discharges in air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for simulating filamentary electric discharges, in which channels are represented as conducting cylindrical segments. The framework requires a model that predicts the position, radius, and line conductivity of channels at a next time step. Using this information, the electric conductivity on a numerical mesh is updated, and the new electric potential is computed by solving a variable-coefficient Poisson equation. A parallel field solver with support for adaptive mesh refinement is used, and the framework provides a Python interface for easy experimentation. We demonstrate how the framework can be used to simulate positive streamer discharges in air. First, a dataset of 1000 axisymmetric positive streamer simulations is generated, in which the applied voltage and the electrode geometry are varied. Fit expressions for the streamer radius, velocity, and line conductivity are derived from this dataset, taking as input the size of the high-field region ahead of the streamers. We then construct a reduced model for positive streamers in air, which includes a stochastic branching model. The reduced model compares well with the axisymmetric simulations from the dataset, while allowing spatial and temporal step sizes that are several orders of magnitude larger. 3D simulations with the reduced model resemble experimentally observed discharge morphologies. The model runs efficiently, with 3D simulations with 20+ streamers taking 4--8 minutes on a desktop computer.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Fusion in D-${}^{3}$He Plasmas With Spin-Polarized Fuel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-polarized fuel (SPF) is recognized for enhancing fusion reactivity, but it could provide other advantages particularly relevant to advanced fusion fuels. In this work, we calculate how SPF in D-${}^3$He plasmas affects not only D-${}^3$He fusion reactions but D-D fusion and subsequent secondary reactions. By incorporating multiple effects, we show how, under optimistic assumptions, the fusion power relative to unpolarized D-${}^3$He fusion power could increase by more than a factor of three by polarizing the deuterium and helium-3. Such an increase may improve the feasibility of fusion concepts using D-${}^3$He fuel. We perform a case study with a hypothetical pulsed magneto-inertial fusion device using polarized D-${}^3$He fuel, showing how the net electric power could increase by almost an order of magnitude. We also consider the potential of SPF to provide a path to fully aneutronic fusion. This work is a new look at how SPF could improve the feasibility of fusion concepts using advanced fuels.</description>

      <title>On Acceleration of Highest-Energy Cosmic Rays in a Novel Scenario of Magnetar Transients</title>

Abstract: Transient phenomena in magnetars have been considered as possible acceleration sites of ultrahigh-energy cosmic-rays (CRs), whose energy reaches ~200 EeV, such as the Amaterasu particle. However, the process of CR acceleration and the trigger mechanism of magnetar transients remains unclear. A recently suggested scenario for the activity predicts that the magnetar's rotation axis suddenly flips due to the `Dzhanibekov effect,' resulting in a sudden rise of the Euler force. The material in the outer layer plastically flows due to the force and finally fractures in this scenario. We study the possibilities of ion acceleration along with this scenario. If the degenerate electrons burst open from the fractured region like a balloon burst, the pair plasma formation can be ignited inside the crust. We find that such pair plasma can emit photons similar to the observed bursts from magnetars. We also find that the electron stream at the beginning of the burst phenomenon possibly induces a strong electric field for a moment, resulting in the acceleration of ~1 ZeV ion within a timescale of ~1 ps. The nuclear spallation reactions limit this timescale, and therefore, high-energy CR `neutrons' from the parenteral nuclei become proper observational predictions of this scenario: their arrival time and direction will be correlated with the bursting photon emissions of the host magnetars. The nuclear spallation of ~ZeV nuclei is preferred to explain $\gtrsim$10 PeV neutrino events observed by IceCube and KM3Net.</description>

      <title>A Tetrad-First Approach to Robust Numerical Algorithms in General Relativity</title>

Abstract: General relativistic Riemann solvers are typically complex, fragile and unwieldy, at least in comparison to their special relativistic counterparts. In this paper, we present a new high-resolution shock-capturing algorithm on curved spacetimes that employs a local coordinate transformation at each inter-cell boundary, transforming all primitive and conservative variables into a locally flat spacetime coordinate basis (i.e., the tetrad basis), generalizing previous approaches developed for relativistic hydrodynamics. This algorithm enables one to employ a purely special relativistic Riemann solver, combined with an appropriate post-hoc flux correction step, irrespective of the geometry of the underlying Lorentzian manifold. We perform a systematic validation of the algorithm using the Gkeyll simulation framework for both general relativistic electromagnetism and general relativistic hydrodynamics, highlighting the algorithm's superior convergence and stability properties in each case when compared against standard analytical solutions for black hole magnetosphere and ultra-relativistic black hole accretion problems. However, as an illustration of the generality and practicality of the algorithm, we also apply it to more astrophysically realistic magnetosphere and fluid accretion problems in the limit of high black hole spin, for which standard general relativistic Riemann solvers are often too unstable to produce useful solutions.</description>

      <title>Radiation Reaction effects on Coherent Emission in Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14550</link>

Abstract: Relativistic magnetized shocks are natural sources of coherent radiation, representing a promising framework for fast radio bursts (FRBs). This study explores how the radiation reaction (RR) effect, triggered by high-energy photon emissions during shock radiation, significantly alters particle dynamics and coherent radiation properties. Using kinetic particle simulations, we demonstrate that RR severely suppresses electron energies from shock acceleration, resulting in multiple coherent gyration cycles at the shock front. It amplifies the intensity of coherent radiation and boosts energy efficiency by several fold, as compared to the single gyration cycle in standard model of Relativistic magnetized shocks. We further find that the coherent radiation spectrum from RR-mediated shocks characterized by upshift peak frequency, broaden bandwidth, and peak spectral morphology. The results support the magnetized shock as a viable source of FRBs, by providing explanation for the bimodal energy distribution observed in repeating FRB 20121102A and the statistically positive correlation of luminosity and bandwidth between repeating and one-off FRBs in the CHIME/FRB catalog.</description>
