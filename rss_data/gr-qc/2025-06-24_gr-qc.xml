      <title>Durgapal-Fuloria Bose-Einstein condensate stars within $ f(R,T) $ gravity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript studies the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) stars in the light of $ f(R,T) $ gravity here with Durgapal-Fuloria (DP) metric ansatz. The function under this study features as $ f(R,T) = R + 2\eta T $, where $ \eta $ represents the coupling constant. With the help of it, we have formulated a stellar model describing the isotropic matter here within. Our analysis covers energy conditions, equation of state (EoS) parameter and gradients of the energy-momentum tensor components for a valid BEC stellar framework within $ f(R,T) $ gravitational theory with satisfactory results. The model's stability has been validated via multiple stability criteria viz., the velocity of sound, study of adiabetic index and surface redshift where all are found to be lying within the acceptable range for our stellar model. Thus in all the cases we have found our model to be stable and realistic. From the graphical representations the impact of the coupling constant and the parameter of the DP metric potential are clearly visible. Thus we can state that with all the above-mentioned features we have introduced new stellar solutions for BEC stars with enhanced precise results in this modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Operator Ordering in the Relativistic Quantization and its Thermodynamic Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a covariant canonical quantization for a particle in curved spacetime that tracks operator-ordering ambiguities. Parameterizing spatial and temporal ordering, we derive a Hermitian Hamiltonian with leading quantum-relativistic corrections. In a uniformly accelerated frame, we show the semiclassical heat-capacity approximation misses these effects and then develop a perturbative quantum treatment using Airy-function modes to obtain analytical first- and second-order energy shifts. Including these shifts in the partition function yields nontrivial, ordering-dependent specific-heat corrections. Numerical studies for electrons in extreme electric fields and ultra-light particles in strong gravitational fields demonstrate that these corrections become significant at intermediate temperatures. Enforcing the Tolman-Ehrenfest relation for spatial temperature variation further modulates the heat-capacity profile. Our results suggest that precision calorimetry in laser-acceleration or analogue gravity setups could probe quantum-ordering effects in relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Scattering and absorption of massless scalar waves by a ModMax black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ModMax electrodynamics is a remarkable example of nonlinear electrodynamics that preserves both conformal and duality invariance. When coupled to General Relativity, the resulting black hole solutions introduce a tunable nonlinearity parameter that effectively screens the electromagnetic charge. We study the scattering and absorption of massless scalar waves by a ModMax black hole by applying the partial waves method. We also compute some well-known analytical approximations for the scattering and absorption cross sections and contrast them with the full numerical solution. Our results adequately reproduce those of Maxwell electrodynamics in the appropriate limit and illustrate the effect of the charge screening in ModMax electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Relative Peak Times of Gravitational Wave Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is essential for extracting their rich physics. A key detail for understanding the physics of mergers is predicting the precise time when the amplitude of the gravitational wave strain peaks, which can differ significantly among the different harmonic modes. We propose two semi-analytical methods to predict these differences using the same three inputs from Numerical Relativity (NR): the remnant mass and spin and the instantaneous frequency of each mode at its peak amplitude. The first method uses the frequency evolution predicted by the Backwards-One-Body model, while the second models the motion of an equatorial timelike geodesic in the remnant black hole spacetime. We compare our models to the SXS waveform catalog for quasi-circular, non-precessing systems and find excellent agreement for $l = |m|$ modes up to $l=8$, with mean and median differences from NR below 1$M$ in nearly all cases across the parameter space. We compare our results to the differences predicted by leading Effective-One-Body and NR surrogate waveform models and find that in cases corresponding to the largest timing differences, our models can provide significant increases in accuracy.</description>

      <title>Particle dynamics and optical appearance of charged spherically symmetric black holes in bumblebee gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the particle dynamics, shadow, and optical appearance of charged black holes (BHs) in bumblebee gravity. Firstly, we find that the Lorentz-violation parameter l and charge parameter Q have opposite effects on the peak of the effective potential by analyzing timelike geodesics, and the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) decreases as the BH parameters l and Q increase. We also explore the behaviors of particle energy, angular momentum, and Keplerian frequency. Secondly, for null geodesics, both the photon sphere radius and the shadow radius decrease with increasing l and Q, and are consistently smaller than those of the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole (RNBH) and Schwarzschild-like BH. And based on observational data reported by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration, we constrain the parameters l and Q by using the shadow radius data of Sgr A*. Thirdly, we explore the observation characteristics of charged BHs under three thin disk accretion models. The results show that, compared to RNBH, the increase of l leads to a greater thickness of the photon rings and lensed rings. However, due to their extremely narrow ranges, the contributions are small, and the observed intensities are mainly contributed by the direct emissions. Moreover, when the parameter l is fixed, the peaks of the observed intensities of rings decrease with increasing Q for the same emission model, and it is always lower than the corresponding value for Schwarzschild-like BH. These findings contribute to distinguishing bumblebee charged black holes (BCBHs) from other types of BHs based on their optical appearance.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Spectroscopy with Conditional Variational Autoencoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a unique opportunity to test general relativity in the strong-field regime, enabling the extraction of key physical parameters from observational data. Traditional likelihood-based inference methods, while robust, become computationally expensive in high-dimensional parameter spaces, such as when incorporating multiple ringdown modes or beyond Kerr deviations. In this paper, we explore the implementation of a conditional variational autoencoder-based machine-learning framework for accelerated ringdown parameter estimation. As a first application, we use the neural network to infer the remnant properties of a final black hole under the Kerr hypothesis. We demonstrate the performance of this algorithm with simulated ringdown waveforms consistent with advanced LIGO sensitivity and compare with Bayesian analysis results. We further extend the framework beyond the Kerr paradigm by incorporating deviations predicted in braneworld gravity.</description>

      <title>Correspondence between 3BF and Einstein-Cartan formulations of quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a correspondence between the quantized constrained 3BF theory and the quantized Einstein-Cartan theory with contact spin-spin interaction, both of which describe the Standard Model coupled to Einstein-Cartan gravitational field. First we introduce the expectation values of observables using the path integral formalism for both theories, and then by integrating out some configuration space variables in the quantum 3BF theory we obtain the definition of the corresponding observable in the quantum Einstein-Cartan theory with contact interaction. Finally, we discuss the differences in the predictions of the two theories on the example of the 4-volume density of spacetime, and on the example of gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Dark matter admixed relativistic stars: Structural properties and tidal Love numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of bosonic, self-interacting dark matter on structural properties and tidal deformabilities of compact stars. As far as the gravitational theory is concerned, we assume Einstein's gravity in four dimensions with a vanishing cosmological constant. Regarding matter content, we consider a state-of-matter to a linear form of equation-of-state (EoS), while for dark matter we assume a quartic scalar potential, which implies a certain non-linear EoS obtained long time ago. Adopting the two-fluid formalism we integrate the structure equations as well as the Riccati equation for the metric even perturbations imposing appropriate initial conditions at the center of the stars and matching conditions at their surface. We compute the stellar mass and radius, factor of compactness and dimensionless deformability varying several free parameters of the model studied here. Tidal deformability and the corresponding tidal Love number determine the imprint of the underlying EoS within the signals emitted during binary coalescences, and it is expected to be altered due to the presence of dark matter inside the objects. We find that in all cases considered here, the dimensionless deformability of the canonical stellar mass remains lower than the upper bound, $\Lambda_{1.4} &lt; 800$. We also look at the stability of these stars based on the Harrison-Zeldovich-Novikov criterion under various conditions. It is observed that the presence of dark matter implies significantly lower highest stellar mass, and also smaller and more compact stars for a given stellar mass.</description>

      <title>Four-function generalization and separable structures of the Plebanski spacetime with sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine a four-function generalization of the Plebanski spacetime, depending on three arbitrary functions of the radial coordinate, and one function on the angular coordinate. For the generalized Plebanski spacetime, we analyze the separability of the Hamilton--Jacobi equations, and the trajectories of charged test particles are derived from the motion constants. The Klein-Gordon equation separability is established and the Killing horizons are presented as well. Then we introduce a conformal factor to the Plebanski metric and discuss the conditions that preserve the separability. Finally we show a possible stress--energy tensor that may be the source of some of the generalized metrics.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing scale-dependent Planck stars from renormalization group improved Schwarzschild black holes by Gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs), consisting of a stellar-mass black hole orbiting a supermassive black hole, are among the primary targets for future space-based gravitational wave detectors. By analyzing the emitted gravitational wave signals, we can probe the nature of compact objects in the strong-field region. To achieve this, we examine the effects of gravitational radiation. In this work, we base our calculations on the general relativistic Schwarzschild background and calculate the energy and angular momentum fluxes of gravitational waves. We perform a theoretical analysis of the equations of motion and the orbital evolution equations for EMRIs. The gravitational waveforms generated by the different periodic orbits of timelike test particles around scale-dependent Planck stars or renormalization group improved Schwarzschild black holes are investigated using both time-domain and frequency-domain methods. The time-domain method employs the ``analytic kludge" (AK) approach, while the frequency-domain method utilizes the discrete Fourier transform. We calculate the characteristic strain of the corresponding gravitational waves and compare them with the sensitivity curves of both ground-based and space-based detectors. These gravitational wave sensitivity curves can be experimentally tested for both spacetimes considered. Additionally, we use two approximate methods--the large eccentricity (EL) method and the small eccentricity (ES) method--to study the orbital evolution of EMRIs and compare the results with equatorial orbits derived from geodesic equations. Our findings will contribute to a deeper understanding of the nature of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Resolving space-time singularities in spherically symmetric black holes: geodesic completeness, curvature scalars, and tidal forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of black holes in the Universe is nowadays established on the grounds of a blench of astrophysical observations, most notably those of gravitational waves from binary mergers and the imaging of supermassive objects at the heart of M87 and Milky Way galaxies. However, this success of Einstein's General Relativity~(GR) to connect theory of black holes with observations is also the source of its doom, since Penrose's theorem proves that, under physically sensible conditions, the development of a space-time singularity (as defined by the existence of a focal point for some geodesic paths in finite affine time) within black holes as described by GR is unavoidable. In this work, we thoroughly study how to resolve space-time singularities in spherically symmetric black holes. To do it so we find the conditions on the metric functions required for the restoration of geodesic completeness without any regards to the specific theory of the gravitational and matter fields supporting the amended metric. Our discussion considers both the usual trivial radial coordinate case and the bouncing radial function case and arrives to two mechanisms for this restoration: either the focal point is displaced to infinite affine distance or a bounce prevents the focusing of geodesics. Several explicit examples of well known (in)complete space-times are given. Furthermore, we consider the connection of geodesic (in)completeness with another criterion frequently used in the literature to monitor singular space-times: the blow up of (some sets of) curvature scalars and the infinite tidal forces they could bring with them, and discuss the conditions required for the harmlessness upon physical observers according to each criterion.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired wormholes from String T-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic non-perturbative features of string-theoretic corrections, particularly those arising from T-duality, have been shown to naturally introduce an effective ultraviolet (UV) cutoff into the gravitational framework. This cutoff, often referred to as the zero-point length in the context of path integral duality, acts as a fundamental minimal length scale that regulates short-distance divergences. Using the established correspondence between T-duality and path integral duality, it has been shown that the static Newtonian potential becomes regularized at small distances. Building upon this regular behavior, we proceed to construct self-consistent, spherically symmetric, and electrically neutral wormhole solutions, which remain free of curvature singularities and embodies the effects of this duality-induced UV completion. We explore wormhole configurations with the aim of minimizing violations of the null energy condition (NEC). In fact, solutions with a constant redshift function or specific shape functions generally exhibit NEC violations throughout the entire spacetime. To address this, we explore two distinct thin shell constructions: (i) wormholes formed by matching an interior wormhole geometry to an exterior Schwarzschild vacuum spacetime, thereby confining exotic matter to a localized region; and (ii) standard thin-shell wormholes generated by gluing two identical black hole spacetimes across a timelike hypersurface situated outside their event horizons. In both cases, the NEC violations are minimised and restricted to a finite region, improving the physical plausibility and traversability of the resulting configurations.</description>

      <title>Static Spherical Vacuum Solution to Bumblebee Gravity with Time-like VEVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17957v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The static spherical vacuum solution in a bumblebee gravity model where the bumblebee field \(B_\mu\) has a time-like vacuum expectation value \(b_\mu\) is studied. We show that in general curved space-time solutions are not allowed and only the Minkowski space-time exists. However, it is surprising that non-trivial solutions can be obtained so long as a unique condition for the vacuum expectation \(b^2\equiv -b^\mu b_\mu=2/\kappa\), where \(\kappa=8\pi G\), is satisfied. We argue that naturally these solutions are not stable since quantum corrections would invalidate the likely numerical coincidence, unless there are some unknown fine-tuning mechanisms preventing any deviation from this condition. Nevertheless, some properties of these novel but peculiar solutions are discussed, and we show that the extremal Reissner-Nordstr{\"o}m solution is a limit of one of our solutions.</description>

      <title>Investigating QED Effects on the Thin Accretion Disk Properties Around Rotating Euler-Heisenberg Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Einstein Euler Heisenberg (EEH) black hole model represents an extension of classical black hole solutions in general relativity by incorporating quantum electrodynamic (QED) corrections. These corrections are introduced through the inclusion of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian, which accounts for the nonlinear effects of QED in the presence of strong electromagnetic fields. This study investigates the observational properties of a thin accretion disk surrounding the electrically charged rotating EEH black hole. By exploring the influence of the spin parameter and charge on key dynamical quantities such as the energy, angular momentum, angular velocity, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of a test particle it becomes possible to analyze the radiative flux, temperature distribution, and differential luminosity of the thin accretion disk in the spacetime of the charged rotating EEH black hole. The results are compared to those of Kerr and Kerr Newman black holes in General relativity, revealing that QED corrections are found to increase the ISCO radius. Specifically, for a fixed electric charge, an increasing spin parameter leads to a larger ISCO radius compared to the standard Kerr black holes as a result of additional electromagnetic corrections introduced by the Euler Heisenberg theory. Conversely, when the spin parameter is held constant, an increase in the electric charge reduces the ISCO radius. Additionally, thin accretion disks around charged EEH rotating black holes exhibit higher temperatures and greater efficiency when the spin parameter is fixed and the electric charge is increased.</description>

Abstract: We consider non-linear electrodynamics (NED) minimally coupled to general relativity. We derive novel electrically charged, spherically symmetric, black-hole solutions having, for some set of parameters, all their NED fields (the electric field and the square of the electromagnetic field) regular for all values of the radial coordinate. For another set of parameters, the NED fields and the Kretschmann scalar are regular as the radial coordinate runs from one spatial infinity to another spatial infinity without the metric being a wormhole. We obtain solutions that have two distinct or the same asymptotic behaviors (two spatial infinities) with equal or unequal ADM masses and solutions with always one horizon whatever the ratio of the electric charge to mass. We comment on some regularity theorems and generalize them to multi-valued NED Lagrangians. The derived regular solutions do not violate the Weak Energy Condition.</description>

      <title>Asymptotia of Kerr-de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exterior geometries of physical black holes are believed to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter spacetime at late times. A characteristic feature of that vacuum Einstein solution is the presence of a hidden symmetry generated by a closed conformal Killing--Yano tensor. Using this symmetry and modern conformal geometry technology, we find necessary conditions for generic solutions to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter metric. Further, we constrain the admissible form of the geometric free data on the conformal infinity giving rise to this family of spacetimes and constrain it in terms of the stress-energy tensor.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors of charged black holes with axion hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the greybody factor of charged hairy black holes (BHs) that arise due to the presence of an axion coupled to the electromagnetic field. Specifically, we consider spin-0 and spin-1 test particles propagating in the background of BHs with axion hair, where the spacetime geometry is modified compared to that of the Reissner-Nordstrom (RN) BH. In contrast to the RN solution, with a given total BH charge, the effective potential for test particles depends on the ratio of electric to magnetic charges. In other words, charged BHs with axion hair breaks the electric-magnetic duality present in the RN solution. We compute the transmission coefficient of test particles plunging into the charged hairy BH and find that the deviation from the RN solution is particularly evident for higher multipole moments. Precise measurements of greybody factors can thus serve as probes for the possible existence of axions coupled to the electromagnetic field, as well as potential signatures of magnetic monopoles.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave Background from Extragalactic Double White Dwarfs for LISA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the contribution of extragalactic DWD to the astrophysical SGWB could be detectable in the mHz regime by LISA. Conversely, the presence of this SGWB could hamper the detection of cosmological SGWB, which are one of the key targets of GW astronomy. We aim to confirm the spectrum of the extragalactic DWD SGWB and estimate its detectability with LISA under different assumptions. We also aim at understanding the main uncertainties in the spectrum and estimate if the signal could be anisotropic. We use population synthesis code COSMIC with several assumptions on binary evolution and initial conditions. We incorporate a specific treatment to account for the mass transfer and tidal torques after DWDs formation. Our study is in global agreement with previous studies, although we find a lower contribution at high frequencies, due to a different treatment of mass transfer in stellar binaries. We find that the uncertainties in the amplitude are dominated by the SFR model, and to a lesser degree by the binary evolution model. The inclusion of tidal effects and mass transfer episodes in DWDs can change the amplitude of the estimated SGWB up to a factor 3 at the highest frequencies. For all the models, we find that this SGWB could be potentially observable by LISA after 4 years. Under the hypothesis of an homogeneous Universe beyond 200Mpc, anisotropies associated to the astrophysical population of DWDs will likely not be detectable. We provide fits of this SGWB under different assumptions to be used by the community. We demonstrate variability in SGWB predictions, emphasizing uncertainties due to different astrophysical assumptions. We highlight the importance of determining the position of the knee in the SGWB spectrum, as it provides insights on mass transfer models. The prediction of this SGWB is of critical importance for LISA in the context of observing other SGWB.</description>

      <title>From Barthel Randers Kropina Geometries to the Accelerating Universe: A Brief Review of Recent Advances in Finslerian Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent developments in cosmological models based on Finsler geometry and extensions of general relativity within this framework. Finsler geometry generalizes Riemannian geometry by allowing the metric tensor to depend on position and an additional internal degree of freedom, typically represented by a vector field at each point of the spacetime manifold. We explore whether Finsler-type geometries can describe gravitational interaction and cosmological dynamics. In particular, we examine the Barthel connection and $(\alpha, \beta)$ geometries, where $\alpha$ is a Riemannian metric and $\beta$ is a one-form. For a specific construction of $\beta$, the Barthel connection coincides with the Levi-Civita connection of the associated Riemann metric. We review gravitational field and cosmological evolution in three geometries: Barthel-Randers ($F = \alpha + \beta$), Barthel-Kropina ($F = \alpha^2 \beta$), and the conformally transformed Barthel-Kropina geometry. After presenting the mathematical foundations of Finslerian-type modified gravity theories, we derive generalized Friedmann equations in these geometries assuming a Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker type metric. We also present the matter-energy balance equations, interpreting them from the perspective of thermodynamics with particle creation. The cosmological properties of Barthel-Randers and Barthel-Kropina models are explored in detail. The additional geometric terms in these models can be interpreted as an effective dark energy component, generating an effective cosmological constant. Several cosmological solutions are compared with observational data (Cosmic Chronometers, Type Ia Supernovae, Baryon Acoustic Oscillations) using MCMC analysis. A comparison with the $\Lambda$CDM model shows that Finslerian models fit observational data well, suggesting they offer a viable alternative to general relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most recent data release from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) reveals a larger value of the scalar spectral tilt $n_s$, ruling out a broad class of inflationary attractors. In this paper, we consider inflationary models including the power law potential, the hilltop model, the polynomial $\alpha$-attractor and exponential $\alpha-$attractor, with non-minimally derivative coupling in the high friction limit, and show how the models can fit ACT data. We also derive constraints on the model parameters using the latest ACT data.</description>

      <title>Observable signatures of Black Holes with Hernquist Dark Matter Halo having a cloud of strings: From Geodesics to Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of a novel black hole (BH) spacetime: a Schwarzschild BH embedded in a Hernquist-type dark matter halo (HDMH) and surrounded by a cloud of cosmic strings (CSs) -- collectively termed the Schwarzschild-HDMH with CS (SHDMHCS) configuration. By analyzing the spacetime geometry, we explore how key parameters -- the core radius and halo density of the dark matter, along with the string tension -- affect the geodesic motion of both massless and massive particles. Our results reveal that the combined influence of HDMH and CSs modifies the effective potentials for null and timelike geodesics, leading to distinct dynamical behavior compared to standard Schwarzschild geometry. We perform a perturbative analysis for scalar (spin-0), electromagnetic (spin-1), and Dirac (spin-1/2) fields, deriving the associated effective potentials and showing how both the dark halo and CSs alter field propagation and potential barriers. The shadow of the BH is studied in detail: we derive analytical expressions for photon sphere and shadow radii, finding that CSs tend to enlarge the shadow, while HDMH properties tend to shrink it. The combined effects of these parameters significantly influence the shadow's shape and size, producing potentially observable signatures. Our results establish that the SHDMHCS configuration yields distinct observational imprints detectable by present and forthcoming astrophysical instruments. This framework provides new tools for probing exotic matter distributions via gravitational wave observations, orbital dynamics, and high-resolution black hole imaging, offering a pathway to distinguish such configurations from simpler BH models in realistic environments.</description>

      <title>A numerical approach to particle creation in accelerating toy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of black holes by the gravitational collapse of stars is known to spontaneously excite particle pairs out of the quantum vacuum. For the canonical vacuum state at past null infinity, the expected number of particles received at future null infinity can be obtained in full closed form at sufficiently late times. However, for intermediate times, or for more complicated astrophysical processes (e.g. binary black hole mergers), the problem is technically challenging and has not yet been resolved. We develop here a numerical approach to study scattering problems of massless quantum fields in asymptotically flat spacetimes, based on the hyperboloidal slice method used in numerical relativity and perturbation theory. This promising approach can reach both past and future null infinities, and therefore it has the potential to address the Hawking scattering problem more rigorously than evolution on the usual Cauchy slices. We test this approach with some dynamical toy models in Minkowski using effective potentials that mimic the effects of gravity, and compute the spectrum of particles received at future null infinity. We finally discuss future prospects for applying this framework in more relevant gravitational scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quasibound states of massive charged scalars around dilaton black holes in $2+1$ dimensions: Exact frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate massive charged scalar perturbations in the background of three-dimensional dilaton black holes with a cosmological constant. We demonstrate that the wave equations governing the dynamics of these perturbations are exactly solvable, with the radial part expressible in terms of confluent Heun functions. The quasibound state frequencies are computed analytically, and we examine their dependence on the scalar field's mass and charge, as well as on the black hole's mass and electric charge. Our analysis also underscores the crucial role played by the cosmological constant in shaping the behavior of these perturbations. This specific black hole metric arises as a solution to the low-energy effective action of string theory in $2+1$ dimensions, and it holds potential for experimental realization in analog gravity systems due to the similarity between its surface gravity and that of acoustic analogs. Moreover, the analytic tractability of this system offers a valuable testing ground for exploring aspects of black hole spectroscopy, stability, and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. The exact solvability facilitates deeper insights into the interplay between geometry and matter fields in lower-dimensional gravity, where quantum gravitational effects can be more pronounced. Such studies not only enrich our understanding of dilaton gravity and its string-theoretic implications but also pave the way for potential applications in simulating black hole phenomena in laboratory settings using analog models.</description>

      <title>Local d'Alembertian for causal sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causal set theory is an intrinsically nonlocal approach to quantum gravity, inheriting its nonlocality from Lorentzian nonlocality. This nonlocality causes problems in defining differential operators -- such as the d'Alembert operator, a cornerstone of any relativistic field theory -- within the causal set framework. It has been proposed that d'Alembertians in causal sets must themselves be nonlocal to respect causal set nonlocality. However, we show that such nonlocal d'Alembertians do not converge to the standard continuum d'Alembertian for some basic fields. To address this problem, we introduce a local d'Alembert operator for causal sets and demonstrate its convergence to its continuum counterpart for arbitrary fields in Minkowski spacetimes. Our construction leverages recent developments in measuring both timelike and spacelike distances in causal sets using only their intrinsic structure. This approach thus reconciles locality with Lorentz invariance, and paves a way toward defining converging discrete approximations to locality-based differential operators even in theories that are inherently nonlocal.</description>

      <title>Identifying multiple images of gravitational-wave sources lensed by elliptical lensing potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real astrophysical lenses typically lack axisymmetry, necessitating the study of gravitational-wave (GW) lensing by elliptical mass distributions to accurately assess detectability and waveform interpretation. We investigate strong lensing using the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model, which produces two or four images depending on the source's position relative to lens caustics. Employing a quasi-geometrical optics framework, we determine that the geometrical-optics approximation holds reliably for lens masses above approximately $10^5 \, M_\odot$ at GW frequencies relevant for ground-based detectors $(\sim 10^2 \,\text{Hz})$, though wave-optics effects become significant for lower masses or sources near caustics. Our waveform mismatch analysis demonstrates that the use of three-image templates significantly improves our ability to distinguish source signals, reducing mismatches from $O(10^{-1})$ to $O(10^{-2})$, typically by factors between 1.5 and 5 compared to the standard two-image template model. At lens masses above $10^7 \, M_\odot$, diffraction effects become negligible for ground-based detectors, resulting in an additional mismatch reduction by a factor of approximately three. These findings highlight the critical need for multi-image templates in GW searches to enhance detection efficiency and accuracy.</description>

      <title>The gravitational wave echoes from the black hole with three-form fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study of massless three-form black hole, where the three-form fields are higher $p$-form gauge fields with $p=3$. These give rise to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (Sch-dS)-like solution through an effective cosmological constant represented by $a_1$. We analyze this solution under gravitational perturbations and find that it exhibits a single-peak potential. For this case, no echoes are produced. Furthermore, we consider the massive case of the three-form fields by introducing a Stueckelberg field to restore gauge invariance and to investigate its effect on GWs at late times. In this case, the potential exhibits a double-peak structure, with the modified potential appearing beside the gravitational perturbation potential. We also examine the impact of the relevant parameters as well as the influence of the parameter $c_0$, which arises from the equation of motion of the Stueckelberg field. For a large value of $a_1$, the two peaks of the potentials are close together, while $c_0$ affects the amplitude and decay rate of the time-domain waveform, resulting in no echoes. For small values of $a_1$, the peaks of the potentials are widely separated and $c_0$ influences both the phase and the amplitude of the echoes. In addition, the quasinormal frequencies of the black hole are also calculated using both the WKB and Prony methods. As results, these provide a potential avenue for testing deviations from GR and probing possible signatures of quantum gravity through future GWs observations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate $g$-mode oscillations in dark matter admixed neutron stars employing a relativistic mean field model to describe hadronic matter and a model for self-interacting fermionic dark matter motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. Following the construction of such admixed configurations, we derive the equilibrium and adiabatic speeds of sound therein, leading to a computation of the star's $g$-mode spectrum in the Cowling approximation. In particular, we explore the effect of dark matter self-interaction, the nucleon effective mass and dark matter fraction on the principal $g$-mode frequency, and its first overtone. We show that the effect on $g$-mode frequency depends predominantly on the dark matter fraction, and demonstrate an equation of state-independent constraint for the latter. Prospects of identifying the presence of dark matter in neutron stars using $g$-mode are discussed.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in a holographic superfluid model with non-linear terms beyond the probe limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the holographic s-wave superfluid model with 4th and 6th power self-interaction terms $\lambda |\psi|^4$ and $\tau |\psi|^6$ with considering the full back-reaction of the matter fields on the metric in the 3+1 dimensional bulk. The self-interaction terms are good at controlling the condensate to realize various phase transitions, such as the zeroth-order, first-order, and second-order phase transitions within the single condensate s-wave superfluid model. Therefore, in this work, we are able to investigate the influence of the back-reaction strength on the various phase transitions, including the zeroth and first order phase transitions. In addition, we confirm that the influence of the 4th and 6th power terms on the superfluid phase transition in the case of finite back-reaction are qualitative the same as in the probe limit, thus present universality. We also plot the special value $\lambda_s$ of the parameter $\lambda$ at different back-reaction strength, below which the condensate grows to an opposite direction and is important in controlling the order of the superfluid phase transitions. Comparing the influence of the back-reaction parameter and that of the higher-order nonlinear coefficients, we see that the back-reaction strength brings in both the effective couplings similar to the 4th power and 6th power terms.</description>

      <title>Towards relational foundations for spacetime quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rovelli's relational interpretation of quantum mechanics tells us that the description of a system in the formalism of quantum mechanics is not an absolute, but it is relative to the observer itself. The interpretation goes further and proposes a set of axioms. In standard non relational language, one of them states that an observer can only retrieve finite amount information from a system by means of measurement. Our contribution starts with the observation that quantum mechanics, i.e. quantum field theory (QFT) in dimension 1, radically differs from QFT in higher dimensions. In higher dimensions boundary data (or initial data) cannot be specified by means of finitely many measurements. This calls for a notion of measuring scale, which we provide. At a given measuring scale the observer has partial information about the system. Our notion of measuring scale generalizes the one implicitly used in Wilsonian QFT, where at each measuring scale there are effective theories, which may be corrected, and if the theory turns out to be renormalizable the mentioned corrections converge to determine a completely corrected (or renormalized) theory at the given measuring scale. The notion of a measuring scale is the cornerstone of Wilsonian QFT. This notion tells us that we are not describing a system from an absolute perspective. An effective theory at that scale describes the system with respect to the observer, which may retrieve information from the system by means of measurement in a specific way determined by our notion of measuring scale. We claim that a relational interpretation of quantum physics for spacetimes of dimension greater than 1 is Wilsonian.</description>

      <title>Time-frequency Imprints of Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals in Confusion Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting individual extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) is a major science goal of future space-based gravitational wave observatories such as Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and TianQin. However, matched-filtering can be challenging as waveform templates are required to be accurate over tens of thousands of orbits. We introduce the time-frequency spectrum as an alternative observable that can be exploited to reveal the chirping of EMRIs at the population level. We analytically calculate this spectrum and its correlators for parameterized populations of slowly chirping sources on quasi-circular orbits, assuming a simplified model of the antenna response for a proof of concept. We then exploit this observable to distinguish between Galactic white dwarf binaries and a possible EMRI population, and quantify the precision at which EMRI population parameters can be determined through a Fisher analysis. We explore several scenarios of EMRI populations and find that this new method may allow us to determine EMRI population parameters at an accuracy level of several percent. Since white dwarf binaries have much longer chirping timescales than the EMRIs do, EMRI population properties can still be determined even if their stochastic gravitational wave background has a power spectrum two orders of magnitude weaker than that of the Galactic white dwarf binaries.</description>

      <title>The MORRIS Experiment: Magnetic Levitation as a New Probe of Non-Newtonian Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MORRIS (Magnetic Oscillatory Resonator for Rare-Interaction Studies) and propose the first tabletop search for non-Newtonian gravity due to a Yukawa-like fifth force using a magnetically levitated particle. Our experiment comprises a levitated sub-millimeter magnet in a superconducting trap that is driven by a time-periodic source. Featuring short-, medium-, and long-term stages, MORRIS will admit increasing sensitivities to the force coupling strength $\alpha$, optimally probing screening lengths of $\lambda \sim 1\,\mathrm{mm}$. Our short-term setup provides a proof-of-principle study, with our medium- and long-term stages respectively constraining $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-4}$ and $\alpha \lesssim 10^{-5}$, leading over existing bounds. Our projections are readily recastable to concrete models predicting the existence of fifth forces, and our statistical analysis is generally applicable to well-characterized sinusoidal driving forces. By leveraging ultralow dissipation and heavy test masses, MORRIS opens a new window onto tests of small-scale gravity and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Identifying Long Radio Transients with Accompanying X-Ray Emission as Disk-Jet Precessing Black Holes: The Case of ASKAP J1832-0911</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims: In this work we investigate whether the 2 min bursts every 44 min from ASKAP J1832-0911 can be explained by Lense-Thirring precession of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) accretion disk launching a Blandford-Znajek jet, as an alternative to magnetar or white-dwarf models. Methods: We derive the Lense-Thirring period $ P_{\rm LT}=\frac{\pi G M}{a c^3}r^3 $ and solve $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min for black-hole mass M and dimensionless radius $r=R/R_g$. We estimate the equipartition field B at r, compute the Blandford-Znajek power $P_{\rm BZ}$, and the power expected from a gap at the black hole magnetosphere, and compare the resulting jet luminosity to the observed radio and X-ray fluxes at $D\approx4.5$ kpc. We also evaluate expected high-frequency variability and the angular size for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations. Results: For $a\sim0.3\!-\!0.9$, an IMBH with $M\sim10^3\!-\!10^5\,M_\odot$ yields $r\sim10\!-\!40\,R_g$ and $P_{\rm LT}=44$ min. Equipartition gives $B\sim10^5$ G at r, leading to $P_{\rm BZ}\sim10^{35\!-\!39}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$. With radiative efficiency $\epsilon_j\sim10^{-2}\!-\!10^{-1}$, the predicted $L_{\rm jet}\sim10^{34\!-\!36}$ erg ${\rm s^{-1}}$ matches the observed $F_X\sim10^{-12}$ erg ${\rm cm^{-2}}$ ${\rm s^{-1}}$ and radio flux, variability on $\lesssim100$ s could be a smoking gun of this model. Conclusions:The IMBH precessing-jet model simultaneously explains the periodicity, energetics, and duty cycle of ASKAP J1832-0911. Only high-time-resolution X-ray timing (to check $\sim$s pulsations) and multi-frequency radio polarimetry can definitively distinguish it from magnetar or white-dwarf scenarios.</description>

      <title>Consistent Initial Conditions for Early Modified Gravity in Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise initial conditions (ICs) are crucial for accurate computation in cosmological perturbation theory. We derive the consistent ICs for Horndeski theory in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach, assuming constant EFT functions at early times. We implement the ICs into the public Boltzmann code \texttt{EFTCAMB}, and demonstrate that the expected early-time behavior of perturbations and Weyl potential can be obtained with theory-consistent MG ICs. We identify significant deviations when comparing Cosmic Microwave Background angular power spectra in MG models obtained with consistent MG ICs versus inconsistent GR ICs. Our findings underline the importance of using accurate, theory-consistent MG ICs to ensure robust cosmological constraints on early MG models.</description>

      <title>Standardizing a larger, higher-quality, homogeneous sample of reverberation-mapped H$\beta$ active galactic nuclei using the broad-line region radius-luminosity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a high-quality, homogeneous sample of 157 H$\beta$ reverberation-mapped active galactic nuclei (RM AGNs) spanning redshifts $0.00308 \leq z \leq 0.8429$, which is approximately 3.8 times larger than the previously available high-quality homogeneous sample. Using the broad-line region radius$-$luminosity relation ($R-L$), which involves the broad H$\beta$ line time delay and the monochromatic luminosity at 5100\,\AA\,, we show that the sample is standardizable by using six spatially flat and nonflat cosmological models. The inferred cosmological model parameters are consistent within 2$\sigma$ uncertainties with those from better established baryon acoustic oscillation and Hubble parameter measurements, with the exception of two nonflat models that are ruled out by other data. The $R-L$ relation slope is found to be flatter ($\gamma=0.428 \pm 0.025$ in the flat $\Lambda$CDM model) than the slope expected from a simple photoionization model as well as the slope found previously for the smaller homogeneous sample. In addition, we find a mild dependence of H$\beta$ $R-L$ relation parameters as well as its intrinsic scatter on the Eddington ratio by comparing the $R-L$ relations for low- and high-accreting equal-sized subsamples. A future analysis of a larger homogeneous sample containing a broader range of luminosities and Eddington ratios is necessary to confirm the standardizability of H$\beta$ AGNs.</description>

      <title>An array of bulk-acoustic-wave sensors as a high-frequency antenna for gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their simplest form, bulk acoustic wave (BAW) devices consist of a piezoelectric crystal between two electrodes that transduce the material's vibrations into electrical signals. They are adopted in frequency control and metrology, with well-established standards at frequencies of 5~MHz and above. Their use as a resonant-mass strain antenna for high-frequency gravitational waves has been recently proposed (Goryachev and Tobar, 2014). The estimated power spectral density sensitivity at the resonant frequencies is of the order of $10^{-21}\, \textrm{strain}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$. In this paper, after introducing the science opportunity and potential of gravitational wave detection with BAWs, we describe the two-stage BAUSCIA project plan to build a multimode antenna based on commercial BAWs, followed by an optimized array of custom BAWs. We show that commercially available BAWs already provide sensitivity comparable to current experiments around 10~MHz. Finally, we outline options for optimization of custom devices to improve sensitivity in an unexplored region, probe multiple frequencies between 0.1 and 10 MHz, and target specific signals, such as post-merger emission from neutron stars or emission from various dark matter candidates.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Waves as Complementary Probe of Dark Matter Indirect Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel cosmological probe of dark matter (DM) through inflationary primordial gravitational wave (GW) measurements highlighting its complementarity with traditional indirect detection. In scenarios like early matter domination (EMD), the thermal DM relic is diluted and then replenished via non-thermal production, leaving characteristic imprints on the primordial GW spectrum, inducing frequency-dependent suppressions in the GW amplitudes. By analysing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and employing Fisher forecast, we show that upcoming GW experiments have good potential to probe the DM parameter space involving its mass and annihilation cross-section. We show, for instance, LISA will be sensitive to DM mass range $[2\times 10^2-10^5]$ GeV. Furthermore, we identify a significant overlap of the GW missions' sensitivity reaches with the projected reach of future indirect searches like CTA with gamma rays, ANTARES, KM3NeT with neutrinos. In those overlapping regions of interests, we forecast on the GW experiments to estimate the precision of measurements. We show, for instance, that DM mass of $10^5$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $10^{-24}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, and a mass of $10^4$ GeV with an annihilation cross-section of $2\times10^{-25}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$, lie within the projections of CTA. We find that whilst the former can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties, the latter can be probed by $\mu$-ARES with $\sim 7 \%$ uncertainties. Similarly, DM mass of $10^5$ GeV, with cross-section $10^{-23}~{\rm cm}^3{\rm /s}$ lies within the projection of ANTARES and KM3NeT, which can be probed by ET with $\sim 1\%$ uncertainties.</description>

Abstract: Recently, new superparticle models have been proposed in the $\mathcal{N}$-extended four and five-dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspaces, AdS$^{4|4\mathcal{N}}$ and AdS$^{5|8\mathcal{N}}$, making use of a unique quadratic deformation to the AdS supersymmetric interval. In this paper we extend these considerations to the three and two-dimensional cases, and propose new two-derivative models for superparticles propagating in these AdS superspaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stray light represents a significant noise source for gravitational wave detectors, requiring an accurate modeling and mitigation to preserve the experiment's sensitivity. In this article, we present an updated and improved analysis of the stray-light induced noise in the Einstein Telescope main arm. The results presented here supersede previous studies taking into account a number of improvements, including baffle clipping effects, new numerical calculations for computing diffraction contributions and the influence of baffle edge serrations. Results are presented for both triangular and L-shaped configurations for the experiment. Furthermore, in the case of the triangular configuration, we examine non-ideal optical cavity conditions, such as beam offsets and misalignments, and the presence of point absorbers in the mirrors, which can increase scattered light noise. This can be translated into future stringent constraints on the design and operating parameters of the interferometer, thus facilitating to achieve its sensitivity targets.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Horizons at the Edge of Effective Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What if supersymmetry is not something to be hidden, but something to be reached? We introduce the Supersymmetric Horizon Stabilization (SHS): a conceptually unified and analytically controlled framework for embedding metastable de Sitter vacua and trans-Planckian inflation within effective $\mathcal{N}=1$ supergravity. Built from a logarithmic K\"ahler potential modified by nilpotent constraints, SHS yields a framework that connects the early universe's inflationary phase, intermediate metastable acceleration, and a final supersymmetric fixed point.
  We classify all viable models by imposing four essential criteria: absence of ghosts, de Sitter metastability, smooth Minkowski transitions, and asymptotic supersymmetry. The resulting scalar dynamics exhibit exponential field-space profiles, $\tau(\varphi) \sim e^{-\Delta\varphi}$, reconciling trans-Planckian excursions with bounded moduli. This structure ensures finite geodesic distance, stabilizes the gravitino mass, and suppresses light towers -- evading both the Gravitino and Swampland Distance Conjectures. Meanwhile, the divergent Euclidean cost of reaching the supersymmetric endpoint realizes the AdS and Generalized Swampland Distance Conjectures, confirming that the infrared boundary lies at infinite dynamical distance despite controlled scalar evolution.
  From this behavior emerges the Supersymmetric Horizon Conjecture: that consistent gravitational EFTs may begin and end with supersymmetry -- both at the origin and the asymptotic edge of cosmic evolution -- not as a fine-tuned remnant, but as a geometric boundary condition. SHS also supports localized features that transiently enhance scalar fluctuations, enabling efficient production of primordial black holes with masses far exceeding those in conventional inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Inferring Neutron Star Nuclear Properties from Gravitational-Wave and Gamma-Ray Burst Observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of long gamma-ray bursts accompanied by kilonova emission prompted interest in understanding their progenitors. If these long-duration bursts arise from neutron star mergers, similar to short gamma-ray bursts, it raises the question of which physical properties govern burst duration. The mass of the merger stands out as a key factor, strongly influencing the lifetime of the merger remnant, which in turn determines the burst duration: lighter mergers that form long-lived remnants produce short bursts, whereas more massive mergers result in short-lived remnants that collapse into black holes, powering longer bursts. In this paper, we compare merger rates from gravitational-wave observations of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA with the rates of kilonova-associated long and short gamma-ray bursts, to identify a characteristic total neutron star mass that separates the two burst classes at $1.36^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ (median and 68\% confidence interval) times of the neutron star Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff mass. This result suggests that massive neutron stars could survive an extended period after merger. Our findings are robust against substantial observational uncertainties and model assumptions. Moreover, we uncover correlations among various characteristic masses tied to dense nuclear matter, introducing a novel and independent approach to constrain neutron star nuclear properties through separated and combined gravitational-wave and gamma-ray burst observations.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing ``final-parsec problem.'' Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Sign-Reversal: Non-Parametric Reconstruction of Interacting Dark Energy with DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A direct interaction between dark energy and dark matter provides a natural and important extension to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We perform a non-parametric reconstruction of the vacuum energy ($w=-1$) interacting with cold dark matter using the cosmological data from DESI DR2, Planck CMB, and three SNIa samples (PP, DESY5, and Union3). By discretizing the coupling function $\beta(z)$ into 20 redshift bins and assuming a Gaussian smoothness prior, we reconstruct $\beta(z)$ without assuming any specific parameterization. The mean reconstructed $\beta(z)$ changes sign during cosmic evolution, indicating an energy transfer from cold dark matter to dark energy at early times and a reverse flow at late times. At high redshifts, $\beta(z)$ shows a $\sim 2\sigma$ deviation from $\Lambda$CDM. At low redshifts, the results depend on the SNIa sample: CMB+DESI and CMB+DESI+PP yield $\beta(z)$ consistent with zero within $2\sigma$, while CMB+DESI+DESY5 and CMB+DESI+Union3 prefer negative $\beta$ at $\sim2\sigma$. Both $\chi^2$ tests and Bayesian analyses favor the $\beta(z)$ model, with CMB+DESI DR2+DESY5 showing the most significant support through the largest improvement in goodness of fit ($\Delta\chi^2_{\rm MAP}=-17.76$) and strongest Bayesian evidence ($\ln\mathcal{B} = 5.98 \pm 0.69$). Principal component analysis reveals that the data effectively constrain three additional degrees of freedom in the $\beta(z)$ model, accounting for most of the improvement in goodness of fit. Our results demonstrate that the dynamical dark energy preference in current data can be equally well explained by such a sign-reversal interacting dark energy, highlighting the need for future observations to break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Stationary gravitational modes on Kerr-anti-de Sitter spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that, for any continuous path of Kerr-adS black hole parameters crossing the Hawking-Reall threshold, for all azimuthal number $|m|$ sufficiently large, there exists black hole parameters on the path such that the Teukolsky equations with conformal boundary conditions admit a non-trivial regular stationary (\emph{i.e.} with frequency $\omega=m\omega_+$) mode solution. When $|m|$ goes to infinity, we show that these black hole parameters accumulate at the Hawking-Reall threshold. The major difficulty is that one cannot construct solutions to the system of Teukolsky equations using variational arguments as it is usually done for the classical wave equation. We introduce a new scheme of proof based on a shooting-type continuity argument and a high-frequency WKB approximation.</description>

      <title>Detecting Collective Excitations in Self-Gravitating Bose-Einstein Condensates via Faraday Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose Faraday waves as a probe for collective excitations in self-gravitating Bose-Einstein condensates (SGBECs), driven by periodic modulation of the $s$-wave scattering length. Linear stability analysis of the driven Gross-Pitaevskii-Newton equations reveals that parametric instability follows a Mathieu-like equation, with Faraday waves emerging resonantly when half the driving frequency matches the collective excitation frequency of the SGBEC. This framework yields a stability phase diagram demonstrating the coexistence and interplay between the intrinsic Jeans instability of self-gravitating systems and the unstable tongues of parametric resonance. The phase diagram shows that reducing the driving frequency fragments and narrows parametric resonance structures while expanding the Jeans-dominated regime. We further identify a thermal-gravity competition in the Faraday wavevector, manifested as a sharp transition when thermal energy balances mean-field interaction at low driving frequencies. We numerically simulate Faraday wave formation and dynamics within the SGBEC, including the effects of dissipation; simulations reveal that Faraday wave patterns exhibit high sensitivity to Jeans frequency, transitioning from parametric resonance to Jeans collapse as gravitational strength increases.</description>

      <title>Conformal and pure scale-invariant gravities in d dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider conformal and scale-invariant gravities in d dimensions, with a special focus on pure $R^2$ gravity in the scale-invariant case. In four dimensions, the structure of these theories is well known. However, in dimensions larger than four, the behavior of the modes is so far unclear. In this work, we explore this question, studying the theories in conformally flat spacetimes as well as anisotropic backgrounds. First, we consider the pure theory in d-dimensions. We show that this theory propagates no degrees of freedom for flat space-time. Otherwise, we find the theory in the corresponding Einstein frame and show that it propagates a scalar field and two tensor modes, that arise from Einstein's gravity. We then consider conformal gravity in d dimensions. We argue on the number of degrees of freedom for conformally flat space-times and show that for $d&gt;4$, there exists a frame in which this theory can be written as the Weyl-squared gravity with a cosmological constant, and also generalize this formulation to the $f\left(W^2\right)$ theories. Then, we consider the specific model of conformal gravity in five dimensions. We find the analytical and numerical solutions for the anisotropic Universe for this case, which admits super-Hubble and exponential expansions. Finally, we consider the perturbations around these solutions and study the number of the degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A field-level reaction for screened modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a field-level reaction framework to emulate the nonlinear effects of screened modified gravity on the cosmic web. This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a "pseudo" $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction ("reaction") to a pseudo$\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k &lt; 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k &lt; 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>State updates and useful qubits in relativistic quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge of consistently updating quantum states after selective measurements in a relativistic spacetime. Standard updates along the future lightcones preserve causality but break correlations between causally disconnected parties, whereas updates along the past lightcone either imply retrocausality or do not respect the causal propagation of information. We introduce a minimal extension of multipartite states to encode subsystem-specific contextual information. This "polyperspective" formalism ensures causally consistent covariant state updates, preserves multipartite correlations, and respects conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Assumptions of Randomness in Cosmology Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.03262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-compact symmetries cannot be fully broken by randomness since non-compact groups have no invariant probability distributions. In particular, this makes trickier the "Copernican" random choice of the place of the observer in infinite cosmology models.
  This problem may be circumvented with what topologists call pointed spaces. Then randomness will be used only in building (infinite) models around the pre-designated "observance point", that thus would not need to be randomly chosen.
  Additional complications come from the original randomness possibly being hidden. P. Gacs and A. Kucera proved that every sequence can be algorithmically generated from a random one. But Vladimir V'yugin discovered that randomized algorithms can with positive probability generate uncomputable sequences not algorithmically equivalent to any random ones.</description>

      <title>A gating-and-inpainting perspective on GW150914 ringdown overtone: understanding the data analysis systematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the recent debate on the evidence for an overtone in the black hole ringdown of GW150914 using an independent data-analysis pipeline. By gating and inpainting the data, we discard the contamination from earlier parts of the gravitational wave signal before ringdown. This enables parameter estimation to be conducted in the frequency domain, which is mathematically equivalent to the time domain method. We keep the settings as similar as possible to the previous studies by Cotesta et al. arXiv:2201.00822 and Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941 which yielded conflicting results on the Bayes factor of the overtone. Our aim is to understand how different data analysis systematics, including sampling rates, erroneous timestamps, and the frequency resolution of the noise power spectrum, would influence the statistical significance of an overtone. Our main results indicate the following: (i) a low-resolution estimation of the noise power spectrum tends to diminish the significance of overtones, (ii) adjusting the start time to a later digitized point reduces the significance of overtones, and (iii) overtone evidence varies with different sampling rates if the start time is too early, indicating that the overtone is a poor model, hence we propose a convergence test to verify the validity of an overtone model. With these issues addressed, we find the Bayes factors for the overtone to range from $10$ to $26$ in a range of times centered at the best-fit merger time of GW150914, which supports the existence of an overtone in agreement with the conclusions of Isi et al. arXiv:1905.00869 arXiv:2202.02941. These results are obtained by keeping the start time and sky location fixed, enabling a direct comparison with other work. Marginalizing over these parameters would lower the Bayes factor to 1 for the evidence of an overtone.</description>

      <title>Existence and absence of Killing horizons in static solutions with symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Without specifying a matter field nor imposing energy conditions, we study Killing horizons in $n(\ge 3)$-dimensional static solutions in general relativity with an $(n-2)$-dimensional Einstein base manifold. Assuming linear relations $p_{\rm r}\simeq\chi_{\rm r} \rho$ and $p_2\simeq\chi_{\rm t} \rho$ near a Killing horizon between the energy density $\rho$, radial pressure $p_{\rm r}$, and tangential pressure $p_2$ of the matter field, we prove that any non-vacuum solution satisfying $\chi_{\rm r}&lt;-1/3$ ($\chi_{\rm r}\ne -1$) or $\chi_{\rm r}&gt;0$ does not admit a horizon as it becomes a curvature singularity. For $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$, non-vacuum solutions admit Killing horizons, on which there exists a matter field only for $\chi_{\rm r}=-1$ and $-1/3$, which are of the Hawking-Ellis type~I and type~II, respectively. Differentiability of the metric on the horizon depends on the value of $\chi_{\rm r}$, and non-analytic extensions beyond the horizon are allowed for $\chi_{\rm r}\in[-1/3,0)$. In particular, solutions can be attached to the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini-type vacuum solution at the Killing horizon in at least a $C^{1,1}$ regular manner without a lightlike thin shell. We generalize some of those results in Lovelock gravity with a maximally symmetric base manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physical science, the concept of \emph{emergence} is often used to describe phenomena that occur at macroscopic scales but not at microscopic scales. The latter is usually referred to as a \emph{fundamental property} and the former as an \emph{emergent property}. In this paper, noncommutative geometry, often viewed as an offshoot of string theory, is the primary fundamental theory that gives rise to macroscopic wormholes and their properties, thereby becoming an emergent phenomenon. As a consequence of these considerations, we will reexamine the boundary conditions that characterize a Morris-Thorne wormhole. The result is a significant modification of the wormhole structure.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy Dark Matter Less-complex Wormhole Structures in Higher-Order Curvature Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter wormhole solutions coupled with anisotropic matter distribution are explored in higher-order curvature gravity. We derive the shape function for fuzzy wormholes and explore their possible stability. We study the embedding diagrams of the active gravitational mass associated with fuzzy dark matter wormholes by taking a certain shape function. Aiming to highlight the role of higher-order curvature gravity in the modeling of less complex fuzzy wormhole structures, we evaluate the complexity factor, the conservation equation, and null energy conditions. Our study reinforces more importance of uniformly distributed pressure effects throughout the less complex region than the emergence of energy density homogeneity in the stability of fuzzy wormholes. It is shown that the active gravitational mass of the fuzzy wormhole structures varies inversely with the radial distance, thereby suggesting the breaching of energy conditions at some arena of the Einasto index. Furthermore, it is revealed that stable fuzzy dark matter wormhole structures exist in nature in the surroundings of cold dark matter halos and galactic bulges. The important physics understood from our analysis is that in higher-order curvature gravity, feasible geometries of fuzzy dark matter wormholes exist naturally in the environments of different galactic haloes.</description>

Abstract: This review is an up-to-date account of the use of numerical relativity to study dynamical, strong-gravity environments in a cosmological context. First, we provide a gentle introduction into the use of numerical relativity in solving cosmological spacetimes, aimed at both cosmologists and numerical relativists. Second, we survey the present body of work, focusing on general relativistic simulations, organised according to the cosmological history -- from cosmogenesis, through the early hot Big Bang, to the late-time evolution of universe. We discuss the present state-of-the-art, and suggest directions in which future work can be fruitfully pursued.</description>

Abstract: This paper mainly aims to solve the Anti deSitter Black Holes (AdS BH) under the Barrow entropy under polytropic gas fluid, especially the Chaplygin Gas. First, we develop this last polytropic model in detail to then obtain the possible solutions and thermodynamic conditions on the Energy-Momentum and the Barrow Entropy for spacetimes of spatial dimension $D&gt;3$. Then, we focus on thermidynamic solutions and the different impacts on the Barrow entropy of the black hole, the temperature profile, the mass and the various physical quantities involved. Afterwards, we focus on the specific cases of the solutions of dimensions $D=4$ and $5$ in order to concretely test the models, especially from the point of view of the thermodynamic topology. Finally, we generalize everything by elaborating and testing the stability of the models to arrive at the thermal geometry of the AdS BH.</description>

In a recent proposal, Bekenstein's black hole area quantization is connected to a discrete absorption spectrum for black holes in the context of gravitational radiation. Consequently, for incoming radiation at the black hole horizon, not all frequencies are absorbed, raising the possibility that the unabsorbed radiation is reflected, producing an echo-like signal closely following the binary coalescence waveform. In this work, we further develop this proposal by introducing a robust, phenomenologically motivated model for black hole reflectivity. Using this model, we calculate the resulting echoes for an ensemble of Numerical Relativity waveforms and examine their detectability with the LISA space-based interferometer. Our analysis demonstrates promising detection prospects and shows that, upon detection, LISA provides a direct probe of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. In addition, we find that the information extractable from LISA data offers valuable constraints on a wide range of quantum gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Black hole solutions in the revised Deser-Woodard nonlocal theory of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the revised Deser-Woodard model of nonlocal gravity by reformulating the related field equations within a suitable tetrad frame. This transformation significantly simplifies the treatment of the ensuing differential problem while preserving the characteristics of the original gravitational theory. We then focus on static and spherically symmetric spacetimes in vacuum. Hence, we demonstrate that the gravitational theory under study admits a class of black hole solutions characterized by an inverse power-law correction to the Schwarzschild $g_{tt}$ metric function and a first-order perturbation of the $g_{rr}$ Schwarzschild component. Then, through a stepwise methodology, we analytically solve the full dynamics of the theory, finally leading to the reconstruction of the nonlocal distortion function, within which the new black hole solutions arise. Furthermore, we analyze the geometric properties of the obtained solutions and quantify the deviations from the Schwarzschild prediction. This work provides new insights into compact object configurations and advances our understanding of nonlocal gravity theories in the strong-field regime at astrophysical scales.</description>

      <title>Computation of the semiclassical outflux emerging from a collapsing spherical null shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a minimally coupled, massless quantum scalar field $\hat{\Phi}$ propagating in the background geometry of a four-dimensional black hole formed by the collapse of a spherical thin null shell, with a Minkowski interior and a Schwarzschild exterior. The field is taken in the natural ``in'' vacuum state, namely, the quantum state in which no excitations arrive from past null infinity. Within the semiclassical framework, we analyze the vacuum polarization $\left\langle\hat{\Phi}^{2}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ and the energy outflux density $\left\langle \hat{T}_{uu}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ (where $u$ is the standard null Eddington coordinate) just outside the shell. Using the point-splitting method, we derive closed-form analytical expressions for both these semiclassical quantities. In particular, our result for $\left\langle \hat{T}_{uu}\right\rangle _{\text{ren}}$ reveals that it vanishes like $(1-2M_{0}/r_{0})^{2}$ as the shell collapses toward the event horizon, where $M_{0}$ is the shell's mass and $r_{0}$ is the value of the area coordinate $r$ at the evaluation point. This confirms that, along a late-time outgoing null geodesic (i.e., one that emerges from the shell very close to the event horizon and propagates toward future null infinity), the outflux gradually evolves (from virtually zero) up to its final Hawking-radiation value while the geodesic traverses the strong-field region (rather than the Hawking-radiation outflux being emitted entirely from the collapsing shell, which would lead to significant backreaction effects).</description>

      <title>Residual test to search for microlensing signatures in strongly lensed gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave signal encounters a massive object, such as a galaxy or galaxy cluster, it undergoes strong gravitational lensing, producing multiple copies of the original signal. These strongly lensed signals exhibit identical waveform morphology in the frequency domain, allowing analysis without the need for complex lens models. However, stellar fields and dark matter substructures within the galactic lens introduce microlensing effects that alter individual signal morphologies. Identifying these microlensing signatures is computationally challenging within Bayesian frameworks. In this study, we propose a residual test to efficiently search for microlensing signatures by leveraging the fact that current Bayesian inference pipelines are optimized solely for the strong lensing hypothesis. Using cross-correlation techniques, we investigate the microlensing-induced deviations from the strong hypothesis, which are imprinted in the residuals. Most simulated signals from our realistic microlensing populations exhibit small mismatches between the microlensed and unlensed waveforms, but a fraction show significant deviations. We find that 28% (52%) and 34% (66%)of microlensed events with mismatch &gt; 0.03 and &gt; 0.1, respectively, can be discerned with O4 (O5) detector sensitivities, which demonstrates that high-mismatch events are more likely to be identified as microlensed. Including all events from a realistic population, 11% (21.5%) are identifiable with O4 (O5) sensitivity using our approach.</description>

Abstract: We show that ultra-massive spacetimes exist also in 2 + 1 dimensions with a positive cosmological constant {\Lambda} &gt; 0. They can be created through the collapse of a spherical null dust shell. The exterior of the shell is then a Mess spacetime, that is to say a locally de Sitter spacetime that cannot be obtained as a quotient of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Displacement Memory Effect from Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explain the recent results on the displacement memory effect (DME) of plane gravitational waves using supersymmetric quantum mechanics. This novel approach stems from that both the geodesic and the Schr\"odinger equations are Sturm-Liouville boundary value problems. Supersymmetry provides a unified framework for the P\"oschl-Teller and the Scarf profiles and yields the critical values of the associated wave amplitudes for DME in a natural way. Within our framework, we obtain a compact formula for DME in terms of the asymptotic values of the superpotential and the geodesics. In addition, this new technique enables us to build plane and gravitational waves with 2-transverse directions using superpartner potentials. Lastly, we study DME within a singular wave profile inspired by supersymmetric quantum mechanics, which demonstrates the broader applicability of our method.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Chern-Simons invariant in non-metricity gravity and axion cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a pseudo-scalar quantity, which is an analogue of the Chern-Simons invariant, in the framework of non-metricity gravity. By considering the coupling between the pseudo-scalar quantity and the axion, we give scenarios which may solve the problems of the axion misalignment, the $S_8$ problem, and the beginning of inflation. When the phase transition associated with the spontaneous breaking of the gauge symmetry of the electroweak theory or grand unified theories (GUTs) occurs, the pseudo-scalar quantity has a non-trivial value, which induces the misalignment of the axion field and axion particles are produced. If the gradient of the potential is small, the $S_8$ problem might be solved. We also propose a mechanism which induces inflation by the misalignment of the axion field generated by the phase transition of the GUTs.</description>

      <title>On a lower-dimensional Killing vector origin of irreducible Killing tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a spacetime foliated by co-dimension-2 hypersurfaces, we find the conditions under which lower-dimensional symmetries of a base space can be lifted up to irreducible Killing tensors of the full spacetime. In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes, where the irreducible Killing tensors arise from the underlying spherical symmetry of the base space. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Further examples of equal spinning Myers-Perry spacetimes and spacetimes built on planar and Taub-NUT base metrics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Dark Phases in Scalar Particles within the Schwarzschild-Kiselev-Letelier Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on the emergence of dark phases (dark energy imprints) in the radial wave function of scalar particles. We achieve this by presenting novel solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation in a spherically symmetric spacetime, encompassing a black hole, a quintessential fluid, and a cloud of strings. We determine the exact solution for the spacetime metric, analyze the admissible ranges for its physical parameters, and discuss the event horizon formation. Subsequently, we detail the solution of the Klein-Gordon equation and explore three distinct cases of dark phases, corresponding to the quintessence state parameter $\alpha_{Q}$ taking the values $0$, $1/2$, and $1$. Notably, the case where $\alpha_{Q} = 1$ holds particular significance due to current observational constraints on dark energy.</description>

      <title>Could Planck Star Remnants be Dark Matter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the end state of gravitational collapse under quantum gravity effects and propose that Planck Star Remnants (PSR), formed via nonsingular bounces, could serve as viable dark matter candidates. Within the framework of Loop Quantum Cosmology, we model the collapse of a homogeneous matter distribution and show that the classical singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce at the Planck density. By analytically matching the Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) interior to an exterior Schwarzschild spacetime using the Israel junction conditions, we demonstrate that the bounce remains causally hidden from external observers, avoiding any observable re-expansion. This naturally leads to the formation of stable, non-radiating PSR, whose radius coincides with the Schwarzschild radius when the black hole mass approaches the Planck mass as a result of Hawking evaporation. We suggest that such remnants may originate from evaporating primordial black holes in the early universe, and estimate the relic abundance needed for PSR to account for the observed dark matter density. We also discuss some crucial differences between PSR and previous proposals of Planck mass relics. The scenario is shown to be consistent with existing astrophysical and cosmological constraints, offering a unified framework connecting quantum gravitational collapse, and the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Butterfly in Spacetime: Inherent Instabilities in Stable Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper numerically studies if the stability of a stable black hole is robustness against the small perturbation on geometry near its event horizon. As a toy model, it encodes the such perturbation into deformations of Regge-Wheeler potential. It considers three different types of local deformations-the negative static bump potential, the stochastic potential and bump potential modulated by time function in low frequency limit. Our numerical results show that infinitesimal local deformations on Regge-Wheeler potential near the horizon can overturn stability of an arbitrarily strongly stable black hole, implying that late-time behavior of a stable black hole is extremely sensitive to geometry near horizon. Specially, certain deformations that stabilize systems in flat backgrounds can destabilize otherwise stable black holes. It also shows that horizon-induced redshift transforms near-horizon quantum fluctuations into classical-scale stochastic deformations capable of triggering instability, implying that even an isolated black hole cannot keep stable in extended timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09310v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate wormhole solutions and inflationary initial conditions in the coupled axion-inflaton/scalar field system within $F(R,T)$ gravity. Notably, the Euclidean action is reduced by approximately $10^5$ compared with the GR case. In Euclidean AdS spacetime, we construct Euclidean (semi-)wormhole geometries that naturally set inflationary initial conditions. To enhance the probability of sustained inflation and address the short inflation duration issue in the no-boundary proposal, we constrain $\lambda$ to $\lambda &lt; -\kappa$ by analyzing the properties of the Euclidean action. This constraint causes the probability weight $ P \propto e^{-S_E} $ to favor high-potential regions, achieving sufficient inflation while maintaining a nearly Gaussian perturbation spectrum. The results suggest that matter-geometry coupling in $F(R,T)$ gravity provides a novel mechanism for reconciling quantum cosmology with observational requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Propagation of fermions in spacetime requires a spin connection, which can be split into a universal gravitational part and a non-universal ``contorsion'' part. The latter is non-dynamical and can be eliminated from the theory, leaving an effective four-fermion interaction with unknown coupling constants. The generic form of the contorsion-fermion coupling, and thus the four-fermion interaction, breaks chiral symmetry. This interaction affects all fermions -- in particular neutrinos passing through matter will notice a contribution to their effective Hamiltonian, just like the MSW effect coming from weak interactions, but diagonal in the mass basis rather than the flavor basis. Then there is a possibility that this geometrical contribution is not negligible for neutrinos passing through normal matter, provided the coupling constants are not too small. We calculate the matter potential due to this interaction and thus write the conversion and survival probabilities including its effect. We plot conversion probabilities of $\nu_\mu$ to $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\tau$ for a baseline of 1300 km, as well as their dependence on the CP phase, with and without the geometrical interaction. We also plot the survival probability of reactor $\bar{\nu}_e$ for different baselines.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Proposal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the leading ideas for the beginning of the Universe is the Hartle-Hawking `No-Boundary Proposal.' Since the Cobordism Conjecture claims that any spacetime allows for a dynamical boundary, we suggest that one may equally well consider a `Boundary Proposal'. Specifically, the corresponding euclidean instanton is a sphere with two holes around north and south pole cut out. Analogously to the Hartle-Hawking proposal, the sphere is then cut in two at the equator and half of it is dropped. The equator is glued to an expanding Lorentzian de Sitter space, implementing a beginning of the Universe with a spacelike spherical boundary at its earliest moment. This process is in principle on equal footing with the one based on the no-boundary instanton. In fact, if the Linde-Vilenkin sign choice is used, this `Boundary' creation process may even dominate. An intriguing implication arises if tensionless end-of-the-world branes, as familiar from type-IIA or M-theory, are available: Analogously to the Boundary Proposal, one may then be able to create a compact, flat torus universe from nothing, without any exponential suppression or enhancement factors.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Tails from Soft Theorem: A Short Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If a set of massive objects collide in space and the fragments disperse, possibly forming black holes, then this process will emit gravitational waves. Computing the detailed gravitational wave-form associated with this process is a complicated problem, not only due to the non-linearity of gravity but also due to the fact that during the collision and subsequent fragmentation the objects could undergo complicated non-gravitational interactions. Nevertheless the classical soft graviton theorem determines the power law fall-off of the wave-form at late and early times, including logarithmic corrections, in terms of only the momenta of the incoming and outgoing objects without any reference to what transpired during the collision. In this short review I shall explain the results and very briefly outline the derivation of these results.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Vectors as sensitive tools for blind tests of CMB anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological data collected on a sphere, such as CMB anisotropies, are typically represented by the spherical harmonic coefficients, denoted as $a_{\ell m}$. The angular power spectrum, or $C_\ell$, serves as the fundamental estimator of the variance in this data. Alternatively, spherical data and their variance can also be characterized using Multipole Vectors (MVs) and the Fr\'echet variance. The vectors that minimize this variance, known as Fr\'echet Vectors (FVs), define the center of mass of points on a compact space, and are excellent indicators of statistical correlations between different multipoles. We demonstrate this using both simulations and real data. Through simulations, we show that FVs enable a blind detection and reconstruction of the location associated with a mock Cold Spot anomaly introduced in an otherwise isotropic sky. Applying these tools to the 2018 Planck maps, we implement several improvements on previous null tests of Gaussianity and statistical isotropy, down to arc-minute scales. Planck's MVs appear consistent with these hypotheses at scales $2 \leq\ell \leq 1500$ when the common mask is applied, whereas the same test using the FVs rejects them with significances between 5.3 and 8.2$\sigma$. The inclusion of anisotropic noise simulations render the FVs marginally consistent ($\geq 2\sigma$) with the null hypotheses at the same scales, but still rejects them at $3.5-3.7\sigma$ when we consider scales above $\ell=1500$, where the signal-to-noise is small. Limitations of the noise and/or foregrounds modeling may account for these deviations from the null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Hongmeng mission using the 21 cm global spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Exotic energy injections from dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking evaporation can alter the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm global spectrum. We assess the potential of the upcoming space project, the Hongmeng mission, to probe dark matter particles and PBHs using the 21 cm global spectrum. Under ideal conditions with 1000 hours of integration time and negligible foreground residuals, the Hongmeng project can reach sensitivities to dark matter annihilation cross sections and decay lifetimes to $\langle \sigma v \rangle \sim 10^{-28}\,\mathrm{cm^3\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim 10^{28}\,\mathrm{s}$, respectively, for dark matter particles with a mass of $10\,\mathrm{GeV}$. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances as low as $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the Hongmeng mission can improve current constraints on dark matter annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation by nearly two orders of magnitude. Moreover, the Hongmeng mission surpasses current limits on sub-GeV dark matter probing and enables the probing of Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,\mathrm{g}$, which remain undetectable through conventional cosmological means. Overall, the upcoming Hongmeng project holds great promise for advancing the investigation of both dark matter and PBHs, potentially deepening our understanding of the nature of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraining circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves with CMB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12517v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Circular polarization in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) offers a promising probe of the parity-violating physics of the early universe. In this paper, we propose a novel method to constrain the primordial circular polarization of high-frequency gravitational waves (GW) in the GHz range. An efficient conversion of gravitons to photons in a transverse cosmological magnetic field at the epoch of last scattering can generate excess chiral photons if the GW background is chiral in nature. This excess radiation distorts the CMB thermal black-body spectrum, which can be estimated by measuring the V-Stokes parameter in the CMB polarization. Using current upper limits on the angular power spectrum of circular polarization $C_l^{VV}$ from the CLASS, MIPOL, and SPIDER experiments, we obtain the most stringent constraints on the characteristic strain and circular polarization of the isotropic background of stochastic GWs at ${40\,\rm GHz}$ and ${150\,\rm GHz}$, respectively. Our work, therefore, provides an interesting possibility to constrain the circular polarization of high-frequency GWs using the V-mode polarization measurements of CMB.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Similarity in Higher-Order Classical Symplectic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many theories of physical interest, which admit a Hamiltonian description, exhibit symmetries under a particular class of non -strictly conformal transformation, known as dynamical similarities. The presence of such symmetries allows a reduction process to be carried out, eliminating a single degree of freedom from the system, which we associate with an overall scale. This process of `contact reduction' leads to theories of a frictional nature, in which the physically-observable quantities form an autonomous subsystem, that evolves in a predictable manner. We demonstrate that this procedure has a natural generalisation to theories of higher order; detailed examples are provided, and physical implications discussed.</description>

      <title>Absolute entropy and the observer's no-boundary state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the no-boundary proposal for closed universes with an observer. We argue that the observer's no-boundary state is the identity operator on the physical Hilbert space, i.e., the maximum entropy state and show this explicitly in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Geometrically, the no-boundary state is a bra-ket wormhole. Expectation values in the no-boundary state provide a trace for the observer's algebra, which allows one to define von Neumann entropy for observers in different universes as the relative entropy with respect to the no-boundary state. This result is consistent with all previously discussed cases of traces for invariantly defined regions.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of dark energy and late-time cosmic expansion using the Weighted Function Regression method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent data from multiple supernova catalogs and DESI, when combined with CMB, suggest a non-trivial evolution of dark energy (DE) at the $2.5-4\sigma$ CL. This evidence is typically quantified using the CPL parametrization of the DE equation-of-state parameter which corresponds to a first-order Taylor expansion around $a = 1$. However, this truncation is to some extent arbitrary and may bias our interpretation of the data, potentially leading us to mistake spurious features of the best-fit CPL model for genuine physical properties of DE. In this work, we apply the Weighted Function Regression (WFR) method to eliminate the subjectivity associated with the choice of truncation order. We assign Bayesian weights to the various orders and compute weighted posterior distributions of the quantities of interest. Using this model-agnostic approach, we reconstruct some of the most relevant background quantities, examining the robustness of our results against variations in the CMB and SNIa likelihoods. Furthermore, we extend our analysis by allowing for negative DE. Our results corroborate previous indications of dynamical DE, now confirmed for the first time using the WFR method. The combined analysis of CMB, BAO, and SNIa data favors a DE component that transitions from phantom to quintessence at redshift $z_{\rm cross}\sim 0.4$. The probability of phantom crossing lies between 96.21% and 99.97%, depending on the SNIa data set used, and hence a simple monotonic evolution of the DE density is excluded at the $\sim 2-4\sigma$ CL. Moreover, we find no significant evidence for a negative dark energy density below $z\sim 2.5-3$. Our reconstructions do not address the Hubble tension, yielding values of $H_0$ consistent with the Planck/$\Lambda$CDM range. If SH0ES measurements are not affected by systematic biases, the evidence for dynamical dark energy may need to be reassessed. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.</description>

      <title>Einstein causality of quantum measurements in the Tomonaga-Schwinger picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When quantum measurements are conducted over spacelike-separated regions of spacetime, a natural and commonly assumed physical postulate, called Einstein causality, asserts that they should commute. In this paper, we provide a generalisation to L\"uders' rule \`a la Aharonov-Albert in those globally hyperbolic spacetimes which allow unitarily equivalent Hilbert spaces to be defined along Cauchy hypersurfaces, thus relying on the existence of an interaction picture \`a la Tomonaga-Schwinger. We show that under this rule, selective quantum measurements satisfy a state-independent anyonic commutation relation over spacelike-separated (pre)compact regions. We highlight that this propagates to positive operator-valued measures (POVMs), where the commutation is necessarily bosonic. In the simplistic scenario where the measurements are assumed to be instantaneous, this implies quantum no-signalling for non-selective measurements. We then examine Sorkin's impossible measurements and show that immediate contradictions can be averted as long as collapse-inducing measurements are irreversible. We finish by discussing the possibility of extending such results beyond the interaction picture.</description>
