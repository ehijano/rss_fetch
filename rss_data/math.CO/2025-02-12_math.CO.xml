      <title>On the extreme complexity of certain nearly regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of a graph is the number of its labeled spanning trees. It is demonstrated that the seven known triangle-free strongly regular graphs, such as the Higman-Sims graph, are graphs of maximal complexity among all graphs of the same order and degree; their complements are shown to be of minimal complexity. A generalization to nearly regular graphs with two distinct eigevalues of the Laplacian is presented. Conjectures and applications of these results to biological problems on neuronal activity are described.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of lattices of nullity $k$ and containing $r$ comparable reducible elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2002 Thakare et al.\ counted non-isomorphic lattices on $n$ elements, having nullity up to two. In 2020 Bhavale and Waphare introduced the concept of RC-lattices as the class of all lattices in which all the reducible elements are comparable. In this paper, we enumerate all non-isomorphic RC-lattices on $n$ elements. For this purpose, firstly we enumerate all non-isomorphic RC-lattices on $n \geq 4$ elements, having nullity $k \geq 1$, and containing $2 \leq r \leq 2k$ reducible elements. Secondly we enumerate all non-isomorphic RC-lattices on $n \geq 4$ elements, having nullity $k \geq 1$. This work is in respect of Birkhoff's open problem of enumerating all finite lattices on $n$ elements.</description>

      <title>The Affine Tamari Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a fixed integer $n\geq 2$, we construct two new finite lattices that we call the cyclic Tamari lattice and the affine Tamari lattice. The cyclic Tamari lattice is a sublattice and a quotient lattice of the cyclic Dyer lattice, which is the infinite lattice of translation-invariant total orders under containment of inversion sets. The affine Tamari lattice is a quotient of the Dyer lattice, which in turn is a quotient of the cyclic Dyer lattice and is isomorphic to the collection of biclosed sets of the root system of type $\widetilde{A}_{n-1}$ under inclusion. We provide numerous combinatorial and algebraic descriptions of these lattices using translation-invariant total orders, translation-invariant binary in-ordered trees, noncrossing arc diagrams, torsion classes, triangulations, and translation-invariant noncrossing partitions. The cardinalities of the cyclic and affine Tamari lattices are the Catalan numbers of types $B_n$ and $D_n$, respectively. We show that these lattices are self-dual and semidistributive, and we describe their decompositions coming from the Fundamental Theorem of Finite Semidistributive Lattices. We also show that the rowmotion operators on these lattices have well-behaved orbit structures, which we describe via the cyclic sieving phenomenon. Our new combinatorial framework allows us to prove that the lengths of maximal green sequences for the completed path algebra of the oriented $n$-cycle are precisely the integers in the interval $[2n-1,\binom{n+1}{2}]$.</description>

      <title>Domination on Vertex-weighted Graphs Induce by a Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of domination in the context of colored graphs (where each color assigns a weight to the vertices of its class), termed up-color domination, where a vertex dominating another must be heavier than the other. That idea defines, on one hand, a new parameter measuring the size of minimal dominating sets satisfying specific constraints related to vertex colors. The paper proves that the optimization problem associated with that concept is an NP-complete problem, even for bipartite graphs with three colors. On the other hand, a weight-based variant, the up-color domination weight, is proposed, further establishing its computational hardness. The work also explores the relationship between up-color domination and classical domination and coloring concepts. Efficient algorithms for trees are developed that use their acyclic structure to achieve polynomial-time solutions.</description>

      <title>Total $k$-coalition: bounds, exact values and an application to double coalition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G=\big{(}V(G),E(G)\big{)}$ be a graph with minimum degree $k$. A subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a total $k$-dominating set if every vertex in $G$ has at least $k$ neighbors in $S$. Two disjoint sets $A,B\subset V(G)$ form a total $k$-coalition in $G$ if none of them is a total $k$-dominating set in $G$ but their union $A\cup B$ is a total $k$-dominating set. A vertex partition $\Omega=\{V_{1},\ldots,V_{|\Omega|}\}$ of $G$ is a total $k$-coalition partition if each set $V_{i}$ forms a total $k$-coalition with another set $V_{j}$. The total $k$-coalition number ${\rm TC}_{k}(G)$ of $G$ equals the maximum cardinality of a total $k$-coalition partition of $G$. In this paper, the above-mentioned concept are investigated from combinatorial points of view. Several sharp lower and upper bounds on ${\rm TC}_{k}(G)$ are proved, where the main emphasis is given on the invariant when $k=2$. As a consequence, the exact values of ${\rm TC}_2(G)$ when $G$ is a cubic graph or a $4$-regular graph are obtained. By using similar methods, an open question posed by Henning and Mojdeh regarding double coalition is answered. Moreover, ${\rm TC}_3(G)$ is determined when $G$ is a cubic graph.</description>

      <title>Vertex connectivity of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite graph and $\kappa(G)$ the vertex connectivity of $G$. A chordal graph $G$ is called chordal$^*$ if no vertex of $G$ is adjacent to all other vertices of $G$. Using the syzygy theory in commutative algebra, it is proved that every chordal$^*$ graph $G$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $\kappa(G) \leq (n - 1) - \lceil2\sqrt{n}-2\,\rceil$. Furthermore, given an integer $0 \leq \kappa \leq (n - 1) - \lceil2\sqrt{n}-2\,\rceil$, a chordal$^*$ graph $G$ on $n$ vertices satisfying $\kappa(G) = \kappa$ is constructed.</description>

      <title>Spanning trees of claw-free graphs with few leaves and branch vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a tree. A vertex of degree one is a \emph{leaf} of $T$ and a vertex of degree at least three is a \emph{branch vertex} of $T$. A graph is said to be claw-free if it does not contain $K_{1,3}$ as an induced subgraph. In this paper, we study the spanning trees with a bounded number of leaves and branch vertices of claw-free graphs. Applying the main results, we also give some improvements of previous results on the spanning tree with few branch vertices for the case of claw-free graphs.</description>

      <title>On the distance spectral gap and construction of D-equienergetic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D(G)$ denote the distance matrix of a connected graph $G$ with $n$ vertices. The distance spectral gap of a graph $G$ is defined as $\delta_{D^G} = \rho_1 - \rho_2$, where $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ represent the largest and second largest eigenvalues of $D(G)$, respectively. For a $k$-transmission regular graph $G$, the second smallest eigenvalue of the distance Laplacian matrix equals the distance spectral gap of $G$. In this article, we obtain some upper and lower bounds for the distance spectral gap of a graph in terms of the sum of squares of its distance eigenvalues. Additionally, we provide some bounds for the distance eigenvalues and distance energy of graphs. Furthermore, we construct new families of non $D$-cospectral $D$-equienergetic graphs with diameters of $3$ and $4$.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for a graph with minimum degree to be k-critical with respect to [1,b]-odd factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spanning subgraph $F$ of a graph $G$ is called a $[1,b]$-odd factor if $b\equiv1$ (mod 2) and $d_F(v)\in\{1,3,\ldots,b\}$ for every $v\in V(G)$. A graph $G$ of order $n\geq k+2$ is $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factor if for any $X\subseteq V(G)$ with $|X|=k$, $G-X$ has a $[1,b]$-odd factor. In this paper, we provide a size and spectral radius conditions for a graph with minimum degree to be $k$-critical with respect to $[1,b]$-odd factor, respectively.</description>

      <title>Some new results about Fibonacci p-cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fibonacci cube $\Gamma_n$ is the subgraph of the hypercube $Q_n$ induced by vertices with no consecutive $1$s. Recently Jianxin Wei and Yujun Yang introduced a one parameter generalization, Fibonacci $p$-cubes $\Gamma_n^p$, which are subgraphs of hypercubes induced by strings where there is at least $p$ consecutive $0$s between two $1$s. In this paper we first prove the expression conjectured by the authors for the cube polynomial of $\Gamma_n^p$. By a totally different method we then determine a generalization, the distance cube polynomial. We also complete the invariants investigated in the original paper by two new ones, the Mostar index $\mathit{Mo}(\Gamma_n^p)$ and the Irregularity $\irr(\Gamma_n^p)$.</description>

      <title>Cycles and paths through specified vertices in graphs with a given clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: B. Bollob\'{a}s and G. Brightwell and independently R. Shi proved the existence of a cycle through all vertices whose degrees at least $\frac{n}{2}$ in any $2$-connected graph of order $n$. Motivated by this result, we prove the existence of a cycle through all vertices whose degrees at least $n-\omega$ in any $2$-connected graph $G$ of order $n$ with clique number $\omega$ unless $G$ is a specific graph. Moreover, we show that for any pair of vertices whose degrees are at least $n-\omega+1$ in a graph $G$ of order $n$ with clique number $\omega$, there exists a path joining them which contains all vertices of degree at least $n-\omega+1$ unless $G$ belongs to certain graph classes. In doing so, we prove the existence of a $(u,v)$-path through all vertices whose degrees at least $\frac{n+1}{2}$ in any graph of order $n$, where $u,v$ are two distinct vertices of degree at least $\frac{n+1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Slit-Slide-Sew bijections for planar bipartite maps with prescribed degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a bijective proof for the planar case of Louf's counting formula on bipartite planar maps with prescribed face degree, that arises from the Toda hierarchy. We actually show that his formula hides two simpler formulas, both of which can be rewritten as equations on trees using duality and Schaeffer's bijection for eulerian maps. We prove them bijectively and show that the constructions we provide for trees can also be interpreted as "slit-slide-sew" operations on maps. As far as we know, this is the first bijection for a formula arising from an integrable hierarchy with infinitely many parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the transfer matrix technique using the $k$-matching vector is developed to compute the number of $k$-matchings in an arbitrary graph which can be constructed by successive amalgamations over sets of cardinality two. This widely extends known methods from the literature developed for computing the number of $k$-matchings in benzenoid chains, octagonal chains, cyclooctatetraene chains, and arbitrary cyclic chains. Two examples demonstrating how the present method can be applied are given, one of then being an elaborated chemical example.</description>

      <title>Hybrid spherical designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherical $t$-designs are finite point sets on the unit sphere that enable exact integration of polynomials of degree at most $t$ via equal-weight quadrature. This concept has recently been extended to spherical $t$-design curves by the use of normalized path integrals. However, explicit examples of such curves are rare.
  We construct new spherical $t$-design curves for small $t$ based on the edges of a distinct subclass of convex polytopes. We then introduce hybrid $t$-designs that combine points and curves for exact polynomial integration of higher degree. Our constructions are based on the vertices and edges of dual pairs of convex polytopes and polynomial invariants of their symmetry group. A notable result is a hybrid $t$-design for $t=19$.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Number of Bases in a Family of Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07768v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ that are bases is asymptotic to $\prod_{j=1}^{\infty}(1-2^{-j}) \approx 0.29$ as $d \to \infty$. It is natural to ask whether there exists a (large) subset $\mathcal{F}$ of $\mathbb{F}_2^d$ such that the proportion of $d$-element subsets of $\mathcal{F}$ that are bases is (asymptotically) greater than this number. As well as being a natural question in its own right, this would imply better lower bounds on the Tur\'an densities of certain hypercubes and `daisy' hypergraphs.
  We give a negative answer to the above question. More generally, we obtain an asymptotically sharp upper bound on the proportion of linearly independent $r$-element subsets of a (large) family of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$, for $r \leq d$. This bound follows from an exact result concerning the probability of obtaining a linearly independent sequence when we randomly sample $r$ elements with replacement from our family of vectors: we show that this probability, for any family of vectors, is at most what it is when the family is the whole space $\mathbb{F}_2^d \setminus \{0\}$. Our results also go through when $\mathbb{F}_2$ is replaced by $\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$.</description>

      <title>A forbidden subgraph study for cut problems on graphs permitting loops and multiedges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take the recently-introduced C123-framework, for the study of (simple) graph problems restricted to inputs specified by the omission of some finite set of subgraphs, to more general graph problems possibly involving self-loops and multiedges. We study specifically the problems Partially Reflexive Stable Cut and Multigraph Matching Cut in this connection. When one forbids a single (simple) subgraph, these problems exhibit the same complexity behaviour as C123-problems, but on finite sets of forbidden subgraphs, the classification appears more complex. While Multigraph Matching Cut and Multigraph d-Cut are C123-problems, already Partially Reflexive Stable Cut fails to be. This is witnessed by forbidding as subgraphs both $C_3$ and $H_1$. Indeed, the difference of behaviour occurs only around pendant subdivisions of nets and pendant subdivisions of $H_1$. We examine this area in close detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the significance of some interesting results by Barbara Rokowska about combinatorial constructions. Her interest in finite mathematics and number theory began with an embellishment and detailing of some work by Erdos. Rokowska and Schinzel then solved the problem posed by Paul Erdos concerning the existence of prime numbers of a certain kind. Her subsequent work highlighted the difficulty in constructing Steiner systems with certain properties and showed the importance of rigorous proof techniques in this area of mathematics. This is the first such summary of the main results obtained by Rokowska, her collaborators and PhD students.
  A biography of Barbara Rokowska has been added as an appendix.</description>

      <title>Limit distributions for cycles of random parking functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of cycles of uniformly random parking functions. Our results are multifold: we obtain an explicit formula for the number of parking functions with a prescribed number of cyclic points and show that the scaled number of cyclic points of a random parking function is asymptotically Rayleigh distributed; we establish the classical trio of limit theorems (law of large numbers, central limit theorem, large deviation principle) for the number of cycles in a random parking function; we also compute the asymptotic mean of the length of the $r$th longest cycle in a random parking function for all valid $r$. A variety of tools from probability theory and combinatorics are used in our investigation. Corresponding results for the class of prime parking functions are obtained.</description>

      <title>Vietoris-Rips complexes of torus grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of Vietoris--Rips complexes of finite grids on the torus. Let $T_{n,n}$ be the grid of $n\times n$ points on the flat torus $S^1\times S^1$, equipped with the $l^1$ metric. Let $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ be the Vietoris--Rips simplicial complex of this torus grid at scale $k\ge 0$. For $n\ge 7$ and small scales $2\le k\le \frac{n-1}{3}$, the complex $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is homotopy equivalent to the torus. For large scales $k\ge 2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$, the complex $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is a simplex and hence contractible. Interesting topology arises over intermediate scales $\frac{n-1}{3}&lt;k&lt;2\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. For example, we prove that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{2n,2n};2n-1)\cong S^{2n^2-1}$ for $n\ge 2$, that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{3n,3n};n)\simeq\vee^{6n^2-1}S^2$ for $n\ge 2$, and that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{3n-1,3n-1};n)\simeq \bigvee_{6n-3} S^2\vee \bigvee_{6n-2}S^3$ for $n\geq 3$. Based on homology computations, we conjecture that $\mathrm{VR}(T_{n,n};k)$ is homotopy equivalent to a $3$-sphere for a countable family of $(n,k)$ pairs, and we prove this for $(n,k)=(7,4)$.</description>

      <title>A proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture via the branching rule for $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Naito--Sagaki conjecture asserts that the branching rule for the restriction of finite-dimensional, irreducible polynomial representations of $GL_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ to $Sp_{2n}(\mathbb{C})$ amounts to the enumeration of certain ``rational paths'' satisfying specific conditions. This conjecture can be thought of as a non-Levi type analog of the Levi type branching rule, stated in terms of the path model due to Littelmann, and was proved combinatorially in 2018 by Schumann--Torres. In this paper, we give a new proof of the Naito--Sagaki conjecture independently of Schumann--Torres, using the branching rule based on the crystal basis theory for $\imath$quantum groups of type $\mathrm{AII}_{2n-1}$. Here, note that $\imath$quantum groups are certain coideal subalgebras of a quantized universal enveloping algebra obtained by $q$-deforming symmetric pairs, and also regarded as a generalization of quantized universal enveloping algebras; these were defined by Letzter in 1999, and since then their representation theory has become an active area of research. The main ingredients of our approach are certain combinatorial operations, such as promotion operators and Kashiwara operators, which are well-suited to the representation theory of complex semisimple Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Faster diameter computation in graphs of bounded Euler genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any fixed integer $k \geq 0$, there exists an algorithm that computes the diameter and the eccentricies of all vertices of an input unweighted, undirected $n$-vertex graph of Euler genus at most $k$ in time \[ \mathcal{O}_k(n^{2-\frac{1}{25}}). \] Furthermore, for the more general class of graphs that can be constructed by clique-sums from graphs that are of Euler genus at most $k$ after deletion of at most $k$ vertices, we show an algorithm for the same task that achieves the running time bound \[ \mathcal{O}_k(n^{2-\frac{1}{356}} \log^{6k} n). \] Up to today, the only known subquadratic algorithms for computing the diameter in those graph classes are that of [Ducoffe, Habib, Viennot; SICOMP 2022], [Le, Wulff-Nilsen; SODA 2024], and [Duraj, Konieczny, Pot\k{e}pa; ESA 2024]. These algorithms work in the more general setting of $K_h$-minor-free graphs, but the running time bound is $\mathcal{O}_h(n^{2-c_h})$ for some constant $c_h &gt; 0$ depending on $h$. That is, our savings in the exponent, as compared to the naive quadratic algorithm, are independent of the parameter $k$. The main technical ingredient of our work is an improved bound on the number of distance profiles, as defined in [Le, Wulff-Nilsen; SODA 2024], in graphs of bounded Euler genus.</description>

      <title>Classifying Tractable Instances of the Generalized Cable-Trench Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12853v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ rooted at a vertex $r$ and weight functions, $\gamma, \tau: E(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, the generalized cable-trench problem (CTP) is to find a single spanning tree that simultaneously minimizes the sum of the total edge cost with respect to $\tau$ and the single-source shortest paths cost with respect to $\gamma$. Although this problem is provably $NP$-complete in the general case, we examine certain tractable instances involving various graph constructions of trees and cycles, along with quantities associated to edges and vertices that arise out of these constructions. We show that given a graph in which all cycles are edge disjoint, there exists a fast method to determine a cable-trench solution. Further, we examine properties of graphs which contribute to the general intractability of the CTP and present some open questions in this direction.</description>

Abstract: Pipedreams are combinatorial objects that compute Grothendieck polynomials. We introduce a new combinatorial object that naturally recast the pipedream formula. From this, we obtain the first direct combinatorial formula for the top degree components of Grothendieck polynomials, also known as the Castelnuovo-Mumford polynomials. We also prove the inverse fireworks case of a conjecture of M\'esz\'aros, Setiabrata, and St. Dizier on the support of Grothendieck polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stanley and Grinberg introduced the symmetric function associated to digraphs, called the Redei-Berge symmetric function. In [8] is shown that this symmetric function arises from a suitable structure of combinatorial Hopf algebra on digraphs. In this paper, we introduce two new combinatorial Hopf algebras of posets and permutations and define corresponding Redei-Berge functions for them. By using both theories, of symmetric functions and of combinatorial Hopf algebras, we prove many properties of the Redei-Berge function. These include some forms of deletion-contraction property, which make it similar to the chromatic symmetric function. We also find some invariants of digraphs that are detected by the Redei-Berge function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assume two finite families $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$ of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$ have the property that $A\cap B\ne \emptyset$ for every $A \in \mathcal A$ and $B\in \mathcal B$. Is there a constant $\gamma &gt;0$ (independent of $\mathcal A$ and $\mathcal B$) such that there is a line intersecting $\gamma|\mathcal A|$ sets in $\mathcal A$ or $\gamma|\mathcal B|$ sets in $\mathcal B$? This is an intriguing Helly-type question from a paper by Mart\'{i}nez, Roldan and Rubin. We confirm this in the special case when all sets in $\mathcal A$ lie in parallel planes and all sets in $\mathcal B$ lie in parallel planes; in fact, all sets from one of the two families has a line transversal.</description>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Gy\'arf\'as conjectured in 1994 that every graph with minimum degree at least 3 has a cycle of length a power of 2. In 2022, Gao and Shan (Graphs and Combinatorics) proved that the conjecture is true for $P_8$-free graphs, i.e., graphs without any induced copies of a path on 8 vertices. In 2024, Hu and Shen (Discrete Mathematics) improved this result by proving that the conjecture is true for $P_{10}$ -free graphs. With the aid of a computer search, we improve this further by proving that the conjecture is true for $P_{13}$ -free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks with piecewise linear activation functions, such as rectified linear units (ReLU) or maxout, are among the most fundamental models in modern machine learning. We make a step towards proving lower bounds on the size of such neural networks by linking their representative capabilities to the notion of the extension complexity $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ of a polytope $P$. This is a well-studied quantity in combinatorial optimization and polyhedral geometry describing the number of inequalities needed to model $P$ as a linear program. We show that $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any monotone or input-convex neural network that solves the linear optimization problem over $P$. This implies exponential lower bounds on such neural networks for a variety of problems, including the polynomially solvable maximum weight matching problem.
  In an attempt to prove similar bounds also for general neural networks, we introduce the notion of virtual extension complexity $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, which generalizes $\mathrm{xc}(P)$ and describes the number of inequalities needed to represent the linear optimization problem over $P$ as a difference of two linear programs. We prove that $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$ is a lower bound on the size of any neural network that optimizes over $P$. While it remains an open question to derive useful lower bounds on $\mathrm{vxc}(P)$, we argue that this quantity deserves to be studied independently from neural networks by proving that one can efficiently optimize over a polytope $P$ using a small virtual extended formulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05540v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the theory of species, differential as well as integral operators are known to arise in a natural way. In this paper, we shall prove that they precisely fit together in the algebraic framework of integro-differential rings, which are themselves an abstraction of classical calculus (incorporating its Fundamental Theorem). The results comprise (set) species as well as linear species. Localization of (set) species leads to the more general structure of modified integro-differential rings, previously employed in the algebraic treatment of Volterra integral equations. Furthermore, the ring homomorphism from species to power series via taking generating series is shown to be a (modified) integro-differential ring homomorphism. As an application, a topology and further algebraic operations are imported to virtual species from the general theory of integro-differential rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan et al. proved congruences for the number of hooks of fixed even length among the set of self-conjugate partitions of an integer $n$, therefore answering positively a conjecture raised by Ballantine et al.. In this paper, we show how these congruences can be immediately derived and generalized from an addition theorem for self-conjugate partitions proved by the second author. We also recall how the addition theorem proved before by Han and Ji can be used to derive similar congruences for the whole set of partitions, which are originally due to Bessenrodt, and Bacher and Manivel. Finally, we extend such congruences to the set of $z$-asymmetric partitions defined by Ayyer and Kumari, by proving an addition-multiplication theorem for these partitions. Among other things, this contains as special cases the congruences for the number of hook lengths for the self-conjugate and the so-called doubled distinct partitions.</description>

      <title>Vector TSP: A Traveling Salesperson Problem with Racetrack-like Acceleration Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.03666v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new version of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, called \VectorTSP, where the traveler is subject to discrete acceleration constraints, as defined in the paper-and-pencil game Racetrack (also known as Vector Racer). In this model, the degrees of freedom at a certain point in time depends on the current velocity, and the speed is not limited.
  The paper introduces this problem and initiates its study, discussing also the main differences with existing versions of TSP. Not surprisingly, the problem turns out to be NP-hard. A key feature of \VectorTSP is that it deals with acceleration in a discrete, combinatorial way, making the problem more amenable to algorithmic investigation. The problem involves two layers of trajectory planning: (1) the order in which cities are visited, and (2) the physical trajectory realizing such a visit, both interacting with each other. This interaction is formalized as an interactive protocol between a high-level tour algorithm and a trajectory oracle, the former calling the latter repeatedly. We present an exact implementation of the trajectory oracle, adapting the A* algorithm for paths over multiple checkpoints whose ordering is \emph{given} (this algorithm being possibly of independent interest). To motivate the problem further, we perform experiments showing that the naive approach consisting of solving the instance as an \EuclideanTSP first, then optimizing the trajectory of the resulting tour, is typically suboptimal and outperformed by simple (but dedicated) heuristics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider maximum rooted tree extension counts in random graphs, i.e., we consider M_n = \max_v X_v where X_v counts the number of copies of a given tree in G_{n,p} rooted at vertex v. We determine the asymptotics of M_n when the random graph is not too sparse, specifically when the edge probability p=p(n) satisfies p(1-p)n \gg \log n. The problem is more difficult in the sparser regime 1 \ll pn \ll \log n, where we determine the asymptotics of M_n for specific classes of trees. Interestingly, here our large deviation type optimization arguments reveal that the behavior of M_n changes as we vary p=p(n), due to different mechanisms that can make the maximum large.</description>

Abstract: We give a new, constructive uniqueness theorem for tensor decomposition. It applies to order 3 tensors of format $n \times n \times p$ and can prove uniqueness of decomposition for generic tensors up to rank $r=4n/3$ as soon as $p \geq 4$. One major advantage over Kruskal's uniqueness theorem is that our theorem has an algorithmic proof, and the resulting algorithm is efficient. Like the uniqueness theorem, it applies in the range $n \leq r \leq 4n/3$. As a result, we obtain the first efficient algorithm for overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of order 3.
  For instance, prior to this work it was not known how to efficiently decompose generic tensors of format $n \times n \times n$ and rank $r=1.01n$ (or rank $r \leq (1+\epsilon) n$, for some constant $\epsilon &gt;0$). Efficient overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of format $n \times n \times 3$ remains an open problem.
  Our results are based on the method of commuting extensions pioneered by Strassen for the proof of his $3n/2$ lower bound on tensor rank and border rank. In particular, we rely on an algorithm for the computation of commuting extensions recently proposed in a companion paper, and on the classical diagonalization-based "Jennrich algorithm" for undercomplete tensor decomposition.
  This is an updated version of a paper presented at SODA 2025. As a new result, we answer a question from that paper by giving a NP-hardness result for the computation of commuting extensions. The proof relies on a recent construction by Shitov. After the paper appearing in the SODA proceedings was written, another algorithm for the overcomplete decomposition of generic tensors of order~3 was proposed by Kothari, Moitra and Wein.</description>

      <title>What makes math problems hard for reinforcement learning: a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a long-standing conjecture from combinatorial group theory, we explore, from multiple perspectives, the challenges of finding rare instances carrying disproportionately high rewards. Based on lessons learned in the context defined by the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic enhancements and a topological hardness measure with implications for a broad class of search problems. As part of our study, we also address several open mathematical questions. Notably, we demonstrate the length reducibility of all but two presentations in the Akbulut-Kirby series (1981), and resolve various potential counterexamples in the Miller-Schupp series (1991), including three infinite subfamilies.</description>

      <title>Sparse induced subgraphs in $P_7$-free graphs of bounded clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many natural computational problems, including e.g. Max Weight Independent Set, Feedback Vertex Set, or Vertex Planarization, can be unified under an umbrella of finding the largest sparse induced subgraph, that satisfies some property definable in CMSO$_2$ logic.
  It is believed that each problem expressible with this formalism can be solved in polynomial time in graphs that exclude a fixed path as an induced subgraph.
  This belief is supported by the existence of a quasipolynomial-time algorithm by Gartland, Lokshtanov, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [STOC 2021], and a recent polynomial-time algorithm for $P_6$-free graphs by Chudnovsky, McCarty, Pilipczuk, Pilipczuk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [SODA 2024].
  In this work we extend polynomial-time tractability of all such problems to $P_7$-free graphs of bounded clique number.</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a natural partition function on a finite version of this model, and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition and correlation functions. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in various applications, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>
