      <title>The Alon-Tarsi Number of Cartesian product and Corona product of Hypercube Graph and Special Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{Alon-Tarsi number} of a graph $G$ is the smallest $k$ so that there exists an orientation $D$ of $G$ with max outdegree $k-1$ satisfying the number of even Eulerian subgraphs different from the number of odd Eulerian subgraphs. In this paper, the Alon-Tarsi number of the $n$-cube is obtained according to its special properties, we obtain the Alon-Tarsi number of Cartesian product of some special bipartite graphs, and get the Alon-Tarsi number of Corona product of graphs. As corollaries, we get the Alon-Tarsi number of Cartesian product and Corona product of hypercube graph and special graphs.</description>

      <title>A short proof of Tuza's conjecture for weak saturation in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ and a positive integer $n$, the weak saturation number $\mathrm{wsat}(n,H)$ is the minimum number of edges in an $r$-uniform hypergraph $F$ on $n$ vertices such that the missing edges in $F$ can be added, one at a time, so that each added edge creates a copy of $H$. Shapira and Tyomkyn (Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 2023) proved Tuza's conjecture on asymptotic behaviour of $\mathrm{wsat}(n, H)$. In this paper we provide a significantly shorter proof of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Mullineux map: $d$-balanced partitions and $d$-runner matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $1&lt;d&lt;e$ be two coprime integers and let $m_e$ denote the Mullineux map, which for $e$ prime describes tensor products of the irreducible modules of symmetric groups with the sign in characteristic $e$. We prove that if $\lambda$ is an $e$-regular partition such that $d$ divides the arm length of any rim hook of $\lambda$ of size divisible by $e$, then $m_e(\lambda)'$ is a partition such that the arm length of any of its rim hooks of size divisible by $e$ is congruent to $-1$ modulo $d$. We introduce a new parameter for partitions called the $d$-runner matrix and show that if $\lambda$ is as above, then the $d$-runner matrices of $\lambda$ and $m_e(\lambda)'$ agree. This determines $m_e(\lambda)'$ uniquely. We approach the whole problem combinatorially and take advantage of a new Abacus Mullineux Algorithm introduced in this paper. We also establish equivalent descriptions of the above partitions which provide an alternative version of the main result about the Mullineux map, which becomes particularly strong when $d=2$.</description>

      <title>The $h^*$-polynomials of type C hypersimplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ehrhart theory of hypersimplices of type C, as introduced by Lam and Postnikov for general crystallographic root systems. The $h^*$-polynomials of classical hypersimplices are known to relate to various Eulerian statistics on the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce a new statistic and partial order on signed permutations, which we use to derive explicit formulas for the $h^*$-polynomials of type C hypersimplices. Additionally, we explore connections with other statistics, including flag-excedances and circular descents, flag-descents, and Coxeter descents.</description>

      <title>Number of independent transversals in multipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An independent transversal in a multipartite graph is an independent set that intersects each part in exactly one vertex. We show that for every even integer $r\ge 2$, there exist $c_r&gt;0$ and $n_0$ such that every $r$-partite graph with parts of size $n\ge n_0$ and maximum degree at most $rn/(2r-2)-t$, where $t=o(n)$, contains at least $c_r t n^{r-1}$ independent transversals. This is best possible up to the value of $c_r$. Our result confirms a conjecture of Haxell and Szab\'o from 2006 and partially answers a question raised by Erd\H{o}s in 1972 and studied by Bollob\'as, Erd\H{o}s and Szemer\'edi in 1975. We also show that, given any integer $s\ge 2$ and even integer $r\ge 2$, there exist $c_{r,s}&gt;0$ and $n_0$ such that every $r$-partite graph with parts of size $n\ge n_0$ and maximum degree at most $rn/(2r-2)- c_{r, s} n^{1-1/s}$ contains an independent set with exactly $s$ vertices in each part. This is best possible up to the value of $c_{r, s}$ if a widely believed conjecture for the Zarankiewicz number holds. Our result partially answers a question raised by Di Braccio and Illingworth recently.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define Riordan type arrays and the Riordan semigroup and extend them to multiple settings. The multiple Riordan type arrays and the multiple Riordan semigroup are related to multiple Riordan arrays and the multiple Riordan group, which are discussed comprehensively and characterized by one $A$- and several $Z$-sequences. The application of Riordan type arrays in the construction of identities are discussed. The compressions of multiple Riordan arrays and multiple Riordan type arrays are given.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Programmatic Analysis of Fibonacci Word Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibonacci word is the archetype of the Sturmian word, and it is one of the most studied of combinatorics on words. We studied the properties of the Fibonacci word and found its density for limited value then by calculating the limit associated with the general relation of $\frac{F(n)}{F(n+1)}$. We also generated the density function through the integral relation of $\int_a^b f(x) dx $ where $D(n)=\int_a^b f(x) dx$ and $f(x) = e^{-x/\tau} g(x)$.
  we presented the first study of the density of the Fibonacci word, in addition to some analysis through programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that in planar pointsets determining many unit distances, these unit distances must span many directions. Specifically, we show that a set of $n$ points can determine only $o(n^{4/3})$ unit distances from a set of at most $O(n^{1/3})$ directions.</description>

      <title>The Flood Polynomial of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flood polynomial of a simple finite graph is a weight generating function that counts all flooding cascade sets of the graph. The flood polynomial is inspired by the water mechanics in the video game Minecraft. We give necessary conditions for two graphs to have the same flood polynomial. We then provide a formula for the flood polynomials of certain families of graphs. We will see that many flood polynomials can be expressed using a Fibonacci-like recurrence and in some cases are equal to Fibonacci or Lucas polynomials. We then provide general examples of pairs of distinct graphs with the same flood polynomial. In these examples, the flood polynomial will be expressed as the product of Fibonacci and Lucas polynomials.</description>

      <title>Word-Representability of Well-Partitioned Chordal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the word-representability of well-partitioned chordal graphs using split decomposition. We show that every component of the minimal split decomposition of a well-partitioned chordal graph is a split graph. Thus we have a characterization for word-representability of well-partitioned chordal graphs. As a consequence, we prove that the recognition of word-representability of well-partitioned chordal graphs can be done in polynomial time. Moreover, we prove that the representation number of a word-representable well-partitioned chordal graph is at most three. Further, we obtain a minimal forbidden induced subgraph characterization of circle graphs restricted to well-partitioned chordal graphs. Accordingly, we determine the class of word-representable well-partitioned chordal graphs having representation number exactly three.</description>

      <title>Some new Steiner designs $S(2,6,91)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Kramer-Mesner method for the construction of designs with a prescribed automorphism group $G$ has been proven effective many times. In the special case of Steiner designs, the task reduces to solving an exact cover problem, with the advantage that fast backtracking solvers like Donald Knuth's dancing links and dancing cells can be utilized. We find ways to encode the inherent symmetry of the problem space, induced by the action of the normalizer of $G$, into a single instance of the exact cover problem. This eliminates redundant computations of certain isomorphic search branches, while preventing the overhead caused by repeatedly restarting the solver.
  Our improved approach is applied to the parameters $S(2,6,91)$. Previously, only four such Steiner designs were known, all of which had been constructed as cyclic designs over four decades ago. We find $23$ new designs, each with a full automorphism group of order $84$. Moreover, we show that there are no other cyclic $S(2,6,91)$ designs apart from the already known four examples.</description>

      <title>Planar and Outerplanar Spectral Extremal Problems based on Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let SPEX$_\mathcal{P}(n,F)$ and SPEX$_\mathcal{OP}(n,F)$ denote the sets of graphs with the maximum spectral radius over all $n$-vertex $F$-free planar and outerplanar graphs, respectively. Define $tP_l$ as a linear forest of $t$ vertex-disjoint $l$-paths and $P_{t\cdot l}$ as a starlike tree with $t$ branches of length $l-1$. Building on the structural framework by Tait and Tobin [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2017] and the works of Fang, Lin and Shi [J. Graph Theory, 2024] on the planar spectral extremal graphs without vertex-disjoint cycles, this paper determines the extremal graphs in $\text{SPEX}_\mathcal{P}(n,tP_l)$ and $\text{SPEX}_\mathcal{OP}(n,tP_l)$ for sufficiently large $n$. When $t=1$, since $tP_l$ is a path of a specific length, our results adapt Nikiforov's findings [Linear Algebra Appl. 2010] under the (outer)planarity condition. When $l=2$, note that $tP_l$ consists of $t$ independent $K_2$, then as a corollary, we generalize the results of Wang, Huang and Lin [arXiv: 2402.16419] and Yin and Li [arXiv:2409.18598v2]. Moreover, motivated by results of Zhai and Liu [Adv. in Appl. Math, 2024], we consider the extremal problems for edge-disjoint paths and determine the extremal graphs in $\text{SPEX}_\mathcal{P}(n,P_{t\cdot l})$ and $\text{SPEX}_\mathcal{OP}(n,P_{t\cdot l})$ for sufficiently large $n$.</description>

      <title>Extremal graphs for the sum of the first two largest signless Laplacian eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $S_2(G)$ be the sum of the first two largest signless Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$, and $f(G)=e(G)+3-S_2(G)$. Very recently, Zhou, He and Shan proved that $K^+_{1,n-1}$ (the star graph with an additional edge) is the unique graph with minimum value of $f(G)$ among graphs on $n$ vertices. In this paper, we prove that $K^+_{1,e(G)-1}$ is the unique graph with minimum value of $f(G)$ among graphs with $e(G)$ edges.</description>

      <title>Graph Laplacians with Higher Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by discrete Laplacian differential operators with various accuracy orders in numerical analysis, we introduce new matrices attached to a simple graph that can be considered graph Laplacians with higher accuracy. In particular, we show that the number of graphs having cospectral mates with these matrices is significantly less than the ones with other known matrices. We also investigate their spectral properties and explicitly compute their eigenvalues and eigenvectors for some graphs. Along the line, we also prove the existence of a weighted signed graph with given Laplacian eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extending Sparks's theorem, we determine the cardinality of the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids of Boolean functions for certain pairs $(C_1,C_2)$ of clones of Boolean functions. Namely, when $C_1$ is a subclone (a proper subclone, resp.) of the clone of all linear (affine) functions and $C_2$ is a subclone of the clone generated by a semilattice operation and constants (a subclone of the clone of all $0$- or $1$-separating functions, resp.), then the lattice of $(C_1,C_2)$-clonoids is uncountable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a formula for computing the size of lower Bruhat intervals for elements in the dominant cone of an affine Weyl group of type $A$. This enumeration problem is reduced to counting lattice points in certain polyhedra. Our main tool is a decomposition -- or tiling -- of each interval into smaller, combinatorially tractable pieces, which we call paper boats. We also conjecture a generalization of this formula to all affine Weyl groups, restricted to elements in the lowest two-sided Kazhdan-Lusztig cell, which contains almost all of the elements.</description>

      <title>An Ore-type condition for hamiltonicity in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bipartite-hole-number of a graph $G$, denoted as $\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$, is the minimum number $k$ such that there exist positive integers $s$ and $t$ with $s+t=k+1$ with the property that for any two disjoint sets $A,B\subseteq V(G)$ with $|A|=s$ and $|B|=t$, there is an edge between $A$ and $B$. In this paper, based on Ore-type conditions, we show that if a graph $G$ is 2-connected and the degree sum of any two nonadjacent vertices in $G$ is at least $ 2\widetilde{\alpha}(G)$, then $G$ is hamiltonian. Furthermore, we prove that if $G$ is 3-connected and the degree sum of any two nonadjacent vertices in $G$ is at least $ 2\widetilde{\alpha}(G)+1$, then $G$ is hamiltonian-connected.</description>

      <title>Trisimplicial vertices in (fork, odd parachute)-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An {\em odd hole} in a graph is an induced subgraph which is a cycle of odd length at least five. An {\em odd parachute} is a graph obtained from an odd hole $H$ by adding a new edge $uv$ such that $x$ is adjacent to $u$ but not to $v$ for each $x\in V(H)$. A graph $G$ is perfectly divisible if for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B])&lt;\omega(H)$. A vertex of a graph is {\em trisimplicial} if its neighbourhood is the union of three cliques. In this paper, we prove that $\chi(G)\leq \binom{\omega(G)+1}{2}$ if $G$ is a (fork, odd parachute)-free graph by showing that $G$ contains a trisimplicial vertex when $G$ is nonperfectly divisible. This generalizes some results of Karthick, Kaufmann and Sivaraman [{\em Electron. J. Combin.} \textbf{29} (2022) \#P3.19], and Wu and Xu [{\em Discrete Math.} \textbf{347} (2024) 114121]. As a corollary, every nonperfectly divisible claw-free graph contains a trisimplicial vertex.</description>

      <title>Binary Weight Allocation for Multi-Objective Path Optimization: Efficient Earliest and Latest Path Discovery in Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes earliest and latest path algorithms based on binary weight allocation, assigning weights of 2(i-1) and 2(m-i) to the i-th arc in a network. While traditional shortest path algorithms optimize only distance, our approach leverages Binary-Addition-Tree ordering to efficiently identify lexicographically smallest and largest paths that establish connectivity. These paths partition the solution space into three regions: guaranteed disconnection, transitional connectivity, and guaranteed no simple paths. Our weight allocation enables implicit encoding of multiple objectives directly in binary representations, maintaining the O((|V|+|E|)log|V|) complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm while allowing simultaneous optimization of competing factors like reliability and cost. Experimental validation demonstrates significant computational time reduction compared to traditional multi-objective methods. Applications span telecommunications, transportation networks, and supply chain management, providing efficient tools for network planning and reliability analysis under multiple constraints.</description>

      <title>Balanced colorings of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform hypergraph $H = (V, E)$ is $r$-partite if there exists a partition of the vertex set into $r$ parts such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each part. We say an independent set in such a hypergraph is balanced if it contains an equal number of vertices from each partition. The balanced chromatic number of $H$ is the minimum value $q$ such that $H$ admits a proper $q$-coloring where each color class is a balanced independent set. In this note, we determine the asymptotic behavior of the balanced chromatic number for sparse $r$-uniform $r$-partite Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi hypergraphs. A key step in our proof is to show that any balanced colorable hypergraph of average degree $d$ admits a proper balanced coloring with $r(r-1)d + 1$ colors. This extends a result of Feige and Kogan on bipartite graphs to this more general setting.</description>

      <title>Enumeration on polyominoes determined by Catalan words avoiding $(\geq,\geq)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Catalan word of length $n$ that avoids the pattern $(\geq, \geq)$ is a sequence $w=w_1\cdots w_n$ with $w_1=0$ and $0\leq w_i\leq w_{i-1}+1$ for all $i$, while ensuring that no subsequence satisfies $w_i \geq w_{i+1}\geq w_{i+2}$ for $i=2,\ldots,n$. These words are enumerated by the $n$-th Motzkin number. From such a word, we associate a $n$-column Motzkin polyomino (called a $(\geq,\geq)$-polyomino), where the $i$-th column contains $w_i+1$ bottom-aligned cells. In this paper, we derive generating functions for $(\geq,\geq)$-polyominoes based on their length, area, semiperimeter, last symbol value, and number of interior points. We provide asymptotic analyses and closed-form expressions for the total area, total semiperimeter, sum of the last symbol values, and total number of interior points across all $(\geq,\geq)$-polyominoes of a given length. Finally, we express all these results as linear combinations of trinomial coefficients.</description>

      <title>The Minimum Eternal Vertex Cover Problem on a Subclass of Series-Parallel Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eternal vertex cover is the following two-player game between a defender and an attacker on a graph. Initially, the defender positions k guards on k vertices of the graph; the game then proceeds in turns between the defender and the attacker, with the attacker selecting an edge and the defender responding to the attack by moving some of the guards along the edges, including the attacked one. The defender wins a game on a graph G with k guards if they have a strategy such that, in every round of the game, the vertices occupied by the guards form a vertex cover of G, and the attacker wins otherwise. The eternal vertex cover number of a graph G is the smallest number k of guards allowing the defender to win and Eternal Vertex Cover is the problem of computing the eternal vertex cover number of the given graph.
  We study this problem when restricted to the well-known class of series-parallel graphs. In particular, we prove that Eternal Vertex Cover can be solved in linear time when restricted to melon graphs, a proper subclass of series-parallel graphs. Moreover, we also conjecture that this problem is NP-hard on series-parallel graphs.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo powers of $3$ for $6$-colored generalized Frobenius partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1984, Andrews introduced the family of partition functions $c\phi_k(n)$, the number of generalized Frobenius partitions of $n$ with $k$ colors. In 2016, Gu, Wang, and Xia proved some congruences about $c\phi_6(n)$ and gave a conjecture on congruences modulo powers of 3 for $c\phi_6(n)$. We solve the revised conjecture proposed by Gu, Wang, and Xia using a method similar to that of Banerjee and Smoot.</description>

      <title>Outerplanar and bounded treewidth support for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and construction of sparse supports for hypergraphs derived from subgraphs of a graph $G$. For a hypergraph $(X,\mathcal{H})$, a support $Q$ is a graph on $X$ s.t. $Q[H]$, the graph induced on vertices in $H$ is connected for every $H\in\mathcal{H}$.
  We consider \emph{primal}, \emph{dual}, and \emph{intersection} hypergraphs defined by subgraphs of a graph $G$ that are \emph{non-piercing}, (i.e., each subgraph is connected, their pairwise differences remain connected).
  If $G$ is outerplanar, we show that the primal, dual and intersection hypergraphs admit supports that are outerplanar. For a bounded treewidth graph $G$, we show that if the subgraphs are non-piercing, then there exist supports for the primal and dual hypergraphs of treewidth $O(2^{tw(G)})$ and $O(2^{4tw(G)})$ respectively, and a support of treewidth $2^{O(2^{tw(G)})}$ for the intersection hypergraph. We also show that for the primal and dual hypergraphs, the exponential blow-up of treewidth is sometimes essential.
  All our results are algorithmic and yield polynomial-time algorithms (when the treewidth is bounded). The existence and construction of sparse supports is a crucial step in the design and analysis of PTASs and/or sub-exponential time algorithms for several packing and covering problems.</description>

      <title>Wild generalised truncation of infinite matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For ${n \in \mathbb{N}}$, the $n$-truncation of a matroid $M$ of rank at least $n$ is the matroid whose bases are the $n$-element independent sets of $M$. One can extend this definition to negative integers by letting the $(-n)$-truncation be the matroid whose bases are all the sets that can be obtained by deleting $n$ elements of a base of $M$. If $M$ has infinite rank, then for distinct ${m,n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ the $m$-truncation and the $n$-truncation are distinct matroids.
  Inspired by the work of Bowler and Geschke on infinite uniform matroids, we provide a natural definition of generalised truncations that encompasses the notions mentioned above. We call a generalised truncation wild if it is not an $n$-truncation for any ${n \in \mathbb{Z}}$ and we prove that, under Martin's Axiom, any finitary matroid of infinite rank and size of less than continuum admits ${2^{2^{\aleph_0}}}$ wild generalised truncations.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $r$-uniform linear cycle of length $\ell$, denoted by $C^r_{\ell}$, is an $r$-graph with $\ell$ edges $e_1,e_2,\dots,e_{\ell}$ where $e_i=\{v_{(r-1)(i-1)},v_{(r-1)(i-1)+1},\dots,v_{(r-1)i}\}$ (here $v_0=v_{(r-1)\ell}$). For $0&lt;\delta&lt;1$ and $n$ sufficiently large, we show that every $n$-vertex $r$-graph $G$ with $n^{r-\delta}$ edges contains at least $n^{(r-1)(2\ell+1)-\delta(2\ell+1+\frac{4\ell-1}{(r-1)(2\ell+1)-3})-o(1)}$ copies of $C^r_{2\ell+1}$. Further, conditioning on the existence of dense high-girth hypergraphs, we show that there exists $n$-vertex $r$-graphs with $n^{r-\delta}$ edges and at most $n^{(r-1)(2\ell+1)-\delta(2\ell+1+\frac{1}{(r-1)\ell-1})+o(1)}$ copies of $C^r_{2\ell+1}$.</description>

      <title>On canonical sandpile actions of embedded graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sandpile group of a connected graph is a group whose cardinality is the number of spanning trees. The group is known to have a canonical simply transitive action on spanning trees if the graph is embedded into the plane. However, no canonical action on the spanning trees is known for the nonplanar case. We show that for any embedded Eulerian digraph, one can define a canonical simply transitive action of the sandpile group on compatible Eulerian tours (a set whose cardinality equals to the number of spanning arborescences). This enables us to give a new proof that the rotor-routing action of a ribbon graph is independent of the root if and only if the embedding is into the plane (originally proved by Chan, Church and Grochow).
  Recently, Merino, Moffatt and Noble defined a sandpile group variant (called Jacobian) for embedded graphs, whose cardinality is the number of quasi-trees. Baker, Ding and Kim showed that this group acts canonically on the quasitrees. We show that the Jacobian of an embedded graph is canonically isomorphic to the usual sandpile group of the medial digraph, and the action by Baker at al. agrees with the action of the sandpile group of the medial digraph on Eulerian tours (which fact is made possible by the existence of a canonical bijection between Eulerian tours of the medial digraph and quasi-trees due to Bouchet).</description>

We characterize all finite local rings that permit quantum fractional revival in their unitary Cayley graphs. Additionally, we present results for the case of finite commutative rings, as they can be expressed as products of finite local rings.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization Benchmark Library -- The Intractable Decathlon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through recent progress in hardware development, quantum computers have advanced to the point where benchmarking of (heuristic) quantum algorithms at scale is within reach. Particularly in combinatorial optimization -- where most algorithms are heuristics -- it is key to empirically analyze their performance on hardware and track progress towards quantum advantage. To this extent, we present ten optimization problem classes that are difficult for existing classical algorithms and can (mostly) be linked to practically-relevant applications, with the goal to enable systematic, fair, and comparable benchmarks for quantum optimization methods. Further, we introduce the Quantum Optimization Benchmark Library (QOBLIB) where the problem instances and solution track records can be found. The individual properties of the problem classes vary in terms of objective and variable type, coefficient ranges, and density. Crucially, they all become challenging for established classical methods already at system sizes ranging from less than 100 to, at most, an order of 100,000 decision variables, allowing to approach them with today's quantum computers. We reference the results from state-of-the-art solvers for instances from all problem classes and demonstrate exemplary baseline results obtained with quantum solvers for selected problems. The baseline results illustrate a standardized form to present benchmarking solutions, which has been designed to ensure comparability of the used methods, reproducibility of the respective results, and trackability of algorithmic and hardware improvements over time. We encourage the optimization community to explore the performance of available classical or quantum algorithms and hardware platforms with the benchmarking problem instances presented in this work toward demonstrating quantum advantage in optimization.</description>

      <title>Coxeter systems, left inversion sets, and higher dimensional cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $ (W,S)$ be a Coxeter system. We investigate the equation $ w(\Phi_{x}) = \Phi_{y}$ where $ w,x,y\in W$ and $ \Phi_{x}$, $\Phi_{y}$ denote the left inversion sets of $ x$ and $ y$. We then define a commutative square diagram called a Coxeter square which describes the relationship between 4 non-identity elements of the Coxeter group $ W$ and the equation $ w(\Phi_{x}) = \Phi_{y}$. Coxeter squares were first introduced by Dyer, Wang in \cite{dyer2011groupoids2} and \cite{dyer2019characterization}. Coxeter squares can be \textquotedblleft glued" together by compatible edges to form commutative diagrams in the shape of higher dimensional cubes called Coxeter $n$-cubes, which were first defined by Dyer in Example 12.5 of \cite{dyer2011groupoids2}. When $ |W| &lt; \infty$ and $ |S| = n$, we show that Coxeter $n$-cubes must exist within $ (W,S)$. We then prove results about Coxeter $n$-cubes in the $A_{n}$ Coxeter system. We establish an explicit bijection between Coxeter $n$-cubes (modulo orientation) in $ A_{n}$ and binary trees with $n+1$ leaves. We also show that an element $x$ of $ A_{n}$ appears as the edge of some Coxeter $n$-cube if and only if $ x$ is a bigrassmannian permutation.</description>

      <title>Refined algebraic domains with finite sets in the boundaries respecting differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in shapes of real algebraic curves in the plane and regions surrounded by them: they are named refined algebraic domains by the author.
  As characteristic finite sets, we consider points contained in two curves and the sets of singular points of the restrictions of the projections to the lines to the curves. As a new case, we respect differential geometry and consider inflection points and points of some double tangent lines of a single connected curve. We prove fundamental properties and investigate some examples.
  We have also previously considered the cases where the curves are straight lines, circles, or boundaries of ellipsoids for example. Such simple cases are trivial in our new consideration.</description>

      <title>Distinct Distances Between a Line and Strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new type of distinct distances result: a lower bound on the number of distances between points on a line and points on a two-dimensional strip. This can be seen as a generalization of the well-studied problems of distances between points on two lines or curves. Unlike these existing problems, this new variant only makes sense if the points satisfy an additional spacing condition.
  Our work can also be seen as an exploration of the proximity technique that was recently introduced by Solymosi and Zahl. This technique lies at the heart of our analysis.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Wilf's lower bound on clique number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an integer $k$, deciding whether a graph has a clique of size $k$ is an NP-complete problem. Wilf's inequality provides a spectral bound for the clique number of simple graphs. Wilf's inequality is stated as follows: $\frac{n}{n - \lambda_{1}} \leq \omega$, where $\lambda_1$ is the largest eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix $A(G)$, $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$, and $\omega$ is the clique number of $G$. Strengthening this bound, Elphick and Wocjan proposed a conjecture in 2018, which is stated as follows: $\frac{n}{n - \sqrt{s^{+}}} \leq \omega$, where $s^+ = \sum_{\lambda_{i} &gt; 0} \lambda_{i}^2$ and $\lambda_i$ are the eigenvalues of $A(G)$. In this paper, we have settled this conjecture for some classes of graphs, such as conference graphs, strongly regular graphs with $\lambda = \mu$ (i.e., $srg(n, d, \mu, \mu)$) and $n\geq 2d$, the line graph of $K_{n}$, the Cartesian product of strongly regular graphs, and Ramanujan graph with $n\geq 11d$.</description>

      <title>A general framework for quasi-isometries in symbolic dynamics beyond groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an algebraic structure which encodes a collection of countable graphs through a set of states, generators and relations. For these structures, which we call blueprints, we provide a general framework for symbolic dynamics under a partial monoid action, and for transferring invariants of their symbolic dynamics through quasi-isometries. In particular, we show that the undecidability of the domino problem, the existence of strongly aperiodic subshifts of finite type, and the existence of subshifts of finite type without computable points are all quasi-isometry invariants for finitely presented blueprints. As an application of this model, we show that a variant of the domino problem for geometric tilings of $\mathbb{R}^d$ is undecidable for $d \geq 2$ on any underlying tiling space with finite local complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we give a description of the structure of the normal subgroups of a Sylow $p$-subgroup $W_n$ of $\mathrm{Sym}(p^n)$, showing that they contain a term from the lower central series with bounded index. To this end, we explicitly determine the terms of the upper and the lower central series of $W_n$. We provide a similar description of these series in the Lie algebra associated to $W_n$, giving a new proof of the equality of their terms in both the group and the algebra contexts. Finally, we calculate the growth of the normalizer chain starting from an elementary abelian regular subgroup of $W_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $I,J$ be componentwise linear ideals in a polynomial ring $S$. We study necessary and sufficient conditions for $I+J$ to be componentwise linear. We provide a complete characterization when $\dim S=2$. As a consequence, any componentwise linear monomial ideal in $k[x,y]$ has linear quotients using generators in non-decreasing degrees. In any dimension, we show that under mild compatibility conditions, one can build a componentwise linear ideal from a given collection of componentwise linear monomial ideals using only sum and product with square-free monomials. We provide numerous examples to demonstrate the optimality of our results.</description>

      <title>Density of monochromatic infinite subgraphs II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.14277v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1967, Gerencs\'er and Gy\'arf\'as proved a result which is considered the starting point of graph-Ramsey theory: In every 2-coloring of $K_n$ there is a monochromatic path on $\lceil(2n+1)/3\rceil$ vertices, and this is best possible. There have since been hundreds of papers on graph-Ramsey theory with some of the most important results being motivated by a series of conjectures of Burr and Erd\H os regarding the Ramsey numbers of trees, graphs with bounded maximum degree, and graphs with bounded degeneracy.
  In 1993, Erd\H os and Galvin \cite{EG} began the investigation of a countably infinite analogue of the Gerencs\'er and Gy\'arf\'as result: What is the largest $d$ such that in every $2$-coloring of $K_\mathbb{N}$ there is a monochromatic infinite path with upper density at least $d$. Erd\H os and Galvin showed that $2/3\leq d\leq 8/9$, and after a series of recent improvements, it was finally shown that $d={(12+\sqrt{8})}/{17}$.
  This paper begins a systematic study of quantitative countably infinite graph-Ramsey theory, focusing on infinite analogues of the Burr-Erd\H{o}s conjectures. We obtain some results which are analogous to what is known in finite case, and other (unexpected) results which have no analogue in the finite case.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the cluster modular groups of affine and doubly extended typecluster algebras in a uniform way by introducing a new family of quivers. We use this uniformdescription to construct a natural finite quotient of the cluster complex of each affine anddoubly extended cluster algebra. Using this construction, we introduce the notion of affineand doubly extended generalized associahedra, and count their facets.</description>

Abstract: We obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the longest increasing/non-decreasing subsequences in a random uniform multiset permutation in which each element in {1,...,n} occurs k times, where k may depend on n. This generalizes the famous Ulam-Hammersley problem of the case k=1. The proof relies on poissonization and a connection with variants of the Hammersley-Aldous-Diaconis particle system.</description>

Abstract: An old problem in discrete geometry, originating with Kupitz, asks whether there is a fixed natural number $k$ such that every finite set of points in the plane has a line through at least two of its points where the number of points on either side of this line differ by at most $k$. We give a negative answer to a natural variant of this problem, showing that for every natural number $k$ there exists a finite set of points in the plane together with a pseudoline arrangement such that each pseudoline contains at least two points and there is a pseudoline through any pair of points where the number of points on either side of each pseudoline differ by at least $k$. Moreover, we may find such a configuration with at most $2^{2^{ck}}$ points, which, by a result of Pinchasi, is best possible up to the value of the constant $c$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11758v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite, simple, connected graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|V|=n$, we consider the associated graph Laplacian matrix $L = D - A$ with eigenvalues $0 = \lambda_1 &lt; \lambda_2 \leq \dots \leq \lambda_n$. One can also consider the same graph equipped with positive edge weights $w:E \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0}$ normalized to $\sum_{e \in E} w_e = |E|$ and the associated weighted Laplacian matrix $L_w$. We say that $G$ is conformally rigid if constant edge-weights maximize the second eigenvalue $\lambda_2(w)$ of $L_w$ over all $w$, and minimize $\lambda_n(w')$ of $L_{w'}$ over all $w'$, i.e., for all $w,w'$, $$ \lambda_2(w) \leq \lambda_2(1) \leq \lambda_n(1) \leq \lambda_n(w').$$ Conformal rigidity requires an extraordinary amount of symmetry in $G$. Every edge-transitive graph is conformally rigid. We prove that every distance-regular graph, and hence every strongly-regular graph, is conformally rigid. Certain special graph embeddings can be used to characterize conformal rigidity. Cayley graphs can be conformally rigid but need not be, we prove a sufficient criterion. We also find a small set of conformally rigid graphs that do not belong into any of the above categories; these include the Hoffman graph, the crossing number graph 6B and others. Conformal rigidity can be certified via semidefinite programming, we provide explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chow class of the closure of the torus orbit of a point in a Grassmannian only depends on the matroid associated to the point. The Chow class can be extended to a matroid invariant of arbitrary matroids. We call the coefficients appearing in the expansion of the Chow class in the Schubert basis the Schubert coefficients of the matroid. These Schubert coefficients are conjectured by Berget and Fink to be non-negative. We compute the Schubert coefficients of a disconnected matroid in terms of the Schubert coefficients of its connected components. And we compute the Schubert coefficients for all sparse paving matroids, and confirm their non-negativity.</description>

Abstract: The perfect matching complex of a simple graph $G$ is a simplicial complex having facets (maximal faces) as the perfect matchings of $G$. This article discusses the perfect matching complex of polygonal line tilings and the $\left(2 \times n\right)$-grid graph in particular. We use tools from discrete Morse theory to show that the perfect matching complex of any polygonal line tiling is either contractible or homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres. While proving our results, we also characterize all the matchings of $\left(2 \times n\right)$-grid graph that cannot be extended to form a perfect matching.</description>

Abstract: The reflections in a Coxeter group are defined as conjugates of a single generator, and thus admit palindromic expressions as products of generators. Our main result gives closed formulas providing a palindromic reduced expression for each reflection in any finite Weyl group. There exist algorithmic methods for determining such reduced expressions, but explicit formulas have not been recorded outside of well-known special cases.</description>

      <title>New bounds for the optimal density of covering single-insertion codes via the Tur\'an density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the density of any covering single-insertion code $C\subseteq X^r$ over the $n$-symbol alphabet $X$ cannot be smaller than $1/r+\delta_r$ for some positive real $\delta_r$ not depending on $n$. This improves the volume lower bound of $1/(r+1)$. On the other hand, we observe that, for all sufficiently large $r$, if $n$ tends to infinity then the asymptotic upper bound of $7/(r+1)$ due to Lenz et al (2021) can be improved to $4.911/(r+1)$.
  Both the lower and the upper bounds are achieved by relating the code density to the Tur\'an density from extremal combinatorics. For the last task, we use the analytic framework of measurable subsets of the real cube $[0,1]^r$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cardinality of the smallest set of lines of the finite projective spaces $\operatorname{PG}(n,q)$ such that every plane is incident with at least one line of the set. This is the first main open problem concerning the minimum size of $(s,t)$-blocking sets in $\operatorname{PG}(n,q)$, where we set $s=2$ and $t=1$. In $\operatorname{PG}(n,q)$, an $(s,t)$-blocking set refers to a set of $t$-spaces such that each $s$-space is incident with at least one chosen $t$-space. This is a notoriously difficult problem, as it is equivalent to determining the size of certain $q$-Tur\'an designs and $q$-covering designs. We present an improvement on the upper bounds of Etzion and of Metsch via a refined scheme for a recursive construction, which in fact enables improvement in the general case as well.</description>

      <title>Faces in girth-saturated graphs on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What is the maximum length ${\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \Sigma)$ of a facial cycle of an inclusion-maximal graph with girth at least $\ell$ embedded on a given surface $\Sigma$? If $\Sigma=\mathcal{P}$ is a plane, we show that $3\ell-11\leq {\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \mathcal{P})\leq 8\ell-13$. We also prove that ${\rm f}_{\rm max}(\ell, \Sigma)$ is bounded for any integer $\ell$ and any closed surface $\Sigma$. For a fixed $\ell$, the bound is polynomial in genus of $\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>$q$-deformation of chromatic polynomials and graphical arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first observe a mysterious similarity between the braid arrangement and the arrangement of all hyperplanes in a vector space over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$. These two arrangements are defined by the determinants of the Vandermonde and the Moore matrix, respectively. These two matrices are transformed to each other by replacing a natural number $n$ with $q^n$ ($q$-deformation).
  In this paper, we introduce the notion of ``$q$-deformation of graphical arrangements'' as certain subarrangements of the arrangement of all hyperplanes over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This new class of arrangements extends the relationship between the Vandermonde and Moore matrices to graphical arrangements. We show that many invariants of the ``$q$-deformation'' behave as ``$q$-deformation'' of invariants of the graphical arrangements. Such invariants include the characteristic (chromatic) polynomial, the Stirling number of the second kind, freeness, exponents, basis of logarithmic vector fields, etc.</description>

      <title>Large Induced Subgraphs of Bounded Degree in Outerplanar and Planar Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the following question. Let $\mathcal G$ be a family of planar graphs and let $k\geq 3$ be an integer. What is the largest value $f_k(n)$ such that every $n$-vertex graph in $\mathcal G$ has an induced subgraph with degree at most $k$ and with $f_k(n)$ vertices? Similar questions, in which one seeks a large induced forest, or a large induced linear forest, or a large induced $d$-degenerate graph, rather than a large induced graph of bounded degree, have been studied for decades and have given rise to some of the most fascinating and elusive conjectures in Graph Theory. We tackle our problem when $\mathcal G$ is the class of the outerplanar graphs or the class of the planar graphs. In both cases, we provide upper and lower bounds on the value of $f_k(n)$. For example, we prove that every $n$-vertex planar graph has an induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ and with $\frac{5n}{13}&gt;0.384n$ vertices, and that there exist $n$-vertex planar graphs whose largest induced subgraph with degree at most $3$ has $\frac{4n}{7}+O(1)&lt;0.572n+O(1)$ vertices.</description>

      <title>Young domination on Hamming rectangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the neighborhood growth dynamics on a Hamming rectangle $[0,m-1]\times[0,n-1]\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_+^2$, the decision to add a point is made by counting the currently occupied points on the horizontal and the vertical line through it, and checking whether the pair of counts lies outside a fixed Young diagram. After the initially occupied set is chosen, the synchronous rule is iterated. The Young domination number with a fixed latency $L$ is the smallest cardinality of an initial set that covers the rectangle by $L$ steps, for $L=0,1,\ldots$ We compute this number for some special cases, including $k$-domination for any $k$ when $m=n$, thereby proving a conjecture from 2009 due to Burchett, Lachniet, and Lane, and devise approximation algorithms in the general case. These results have implications in extremal graph theory, via an equivalence between the case $L = 1$ and bipartite Tur\'an numbers for families of double stars. Our approach is based on a variety of techniques including duality between Young diagrams, algebraic formulations, explicit constructions, and dynamic programming.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An overpartition is a partition such that the first occurrence (equivalently, the last occurrence) of a number may be overlined. In this article, we will investigate two contents of overpartitions. We first consider the $r$-chain minimal and maximal excludant sizes of an overpartition. Then, we introduce $L_k$-overpartitions and $F_k$-overpartitions, which are two types of separable overpartition classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the asymptotic behavior of weighted factorization lengths on numerical semigroups. Our approach is geometric as opposed to analytic, explains the presence of Curry-Schoenberg B-splines as limiting distributions, and provides explicit error bounds (no implied constants left unspecified). Along the way, we explicitly bound the difference between the vector partition function and the number of integer points in the variable polytope for a $2 \times k$ matrix.</description>

      <title>Deterministically approximating the volume of a Kostka polytope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polynomial-time deterministic approximation of volumes of polytopes, up to an approximation factor that grows at most sub-exponentially with the dimension, remains an open problem. Recent work on this question has focused on identifying interesting classes of polytopes for which such approximation algorithms can be obtained. In this paper, we focus on one such class of polytopes: the Kostka polytopes. The volumes of Kostka polytopes appear naturally in questions of random matrix theory, in the context of evaluating the probability density that a random Hermitian matrix with fixed spectrum $\lambda$ has a given diagonal $\mu$ (the so-called randomized Schur-Horn problem): the corresponding Kostka polytope is denoted $\mathrm{GT}(\lambda, \mu)$. We give a polynomial-time deterministic algorithm for approximating the volume of a ($\Omega(n^2)$ dimensional) Kostka polytope $\mathrm{GT}(\lambda, \mu)$ to within a multiplicative factor of $\exp(O(n\log n))$, when $\lambda$ is an integral partition with $n$ parts, with entries bounded above by a polynomial in $n$, and $\mu$ is an integer vector lying in the interior of the permutohedron (i.e., convex hull of all permutations) of $\lambda$. The algorithm thus gives asymptotically correct estimates of the log-volume of Kostka polytopes corresponding to such $(\lambda, \mu)$. Our approach is based on a partition function interpretation of a continuous analogue of Schur polynomials.</description>

      <title>A bijection for descent sets of permutations with only even and only odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that, when $n$ is even, the number of permutations of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ all of whose cycles have odd length equals the number of those all of whose cycles have even length. Adin, Heged\H{u}s and Roichman recently found a surprising refinement of this identity. They showed that, for any fixed set $J$, the equality still holds when restricting to permutations with descent set $J$ on one side, and permutations with ascent set $J$ on the other. Their proof uses generating functions for higher Lie characters, and it also yields a version for odd $n$.
  Here we give a bijective proof of their result. We first use known bijections, due to Gessel, Reutenauer and others, to restate the identity in terms of multisets of necklaces, which we interpret as words, and then describe a new weight-preserving bijection between words all of whose Lyndon factors have odd length and are distinct, and words all of whose Lyndon factors have even length. We also show that the corresponding equality about Lyndon factorizations has a short proof using generating functions.</description>

      <title>Descent generating polynomials for ($n-3$)- and ($n-4$)-stack-sortable (pattern-avoiding) permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find distribution of descents over $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations in terms of Eulerian polynomials. Our results generalize the enumeration results by Claesson, Dukes, and Steingr\'{\i}msson on $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations. Moreover, we find distribution of descents on $(n-2)$-, $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations that avoid any given pattern of length 3, which extends known results in the literature on distribution of descents over pattern-avoiding 1- and 2-stack-sortable permutations. Our distribution results also give enumeration of $(n-2)$-, $(n-3)$- and $(n-4)$-stack-sortable permutations avoiding any pattern of length 3. One of our conjectures links our work to stack-sorting with restricted stacks, and the other conjecture states that 213-avoiding permutations sortable with $t$ stacks are equinumerous with 321-avoiding permutations sortable with $t$ stacks for any $t$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a partition $\mu$ of $-2$, the stratum $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ parametrizes meromorphic differential one-forms on the Riemann sphere $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$ with~$n$ zeros and $p$ poles of orders prescribed by $\mu$. The isoresidual fibration is defined by assigning to each differential in $\mathcal{H}(\mu)$ its configuration of residues at the poles. In the case of differentials with $n=2$ zeros, generic isoresidual fibers are complex curves endowed with a canonical translation structure, which we describe extensively in this paper. Quantitative characteristics of the translation structure on isoresidual fiber curves, including the orders of the singularities and a period central charge encapsulating the linear dependence of periods on the underlying configuration of residues, provide rich discrete invariants for these fibers. We also determine the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves from intersection-theoretic computations, relying on the multi-scale compactification of strata of differentials. In particular, we describe a wall and chamber structure for the Euler characteristic of generic isoresidual fiber curves in terms of the partition $\mu$. Additionally, we classify the connected components of generic isoresidual fibers for strata in genus zero with an arbitrary number of zeros.</description>

      <title>On the module of derivations of a line arrangement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01624v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To each multiple point $p$ in a line arrangement $ \mathcal A$ in the complex projective plane we associate a local derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$. We show first that these derivations span the graded module of derivations $D_0( \mathcal A)$ in all degrees $\geq d -3$, where $d$ is the number of lines in $ \mathcal A$, see Theorem 1.4 and Theorem 1.6. Then, to each local derivation $\tilde D_p \in D_0( \mathcal A)$ we associate a polynomial $g_p$ which seems to play a key role in the characterization of the freeness of $ \mathcal A$, see Theorem 1.10, as well as in the study of the position of the multiple points of $ \mathcal A$ with respect to unions of lines, see Corollary 1.13 and Conjecture 1.14. Corollary 1.9 gives a result of an independent interest, namely a lower bound for the maximal exponent of a plane curve having a line as an irreducible component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grothendieck classes of melonic graphs satisfy a recursive relation and may be written as polynomials in the class of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{0,4}$ with nonnegative integer coefficients, conjectured to be log-concave. In this article, we investigate log-concavity and ultra-log-concavity for the Grothendieck class of banana graphs and the three families of polynomials involved in the recursive relation. We prove that all four are log-concave, establishing the specific case of banana graphs for the log-concavity conjecture. We additionally introduce the infinite family of clasped necklaces, melonic graphs obtained by replacing an edge of a $2$-banana with a string of $m$-bananas. Using the recursive relation, we explicitly compute the classes of clasped necklaces and prove that they too are log-concave.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A vector (compound) partition problem asks for a number of nonnegative integer solutions to a system of several linear Diophantine equations with integer nonnegative coefficients. J.J. Sylvester put forward an idea of reduction of vector partition to a sum of regular (scalar) partitions. For the simplest case of two equations with positive coefficients A. Cayley performed a reduction of the corresponding double partition to a sum of scalar partitions using an algorithm subject to a set of conditions on the coefficients. We suggested a modification of the original Cayley algorithm for the cases when these conditions are not satisfied. This result is extended to arbitrary number of the Diophantine equations to accomplish the Sylvester program of the vector partition reduction to a combination of scalar partitions.</description>
