      <title>On GKM fiber bundles and realizability with full flag fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate under which conditions an equivariant fiber bundle whose base, total space and fiber are GKM manifolds induces a fibration or fiber bundle of the corresponding GKM graphs. In particular, we give several counterexamples. Concerning the converse direction, i.e., the realization problem for fiber bundles of GKM graphs, we restrict to the setting of fiberwise signed GKM fiber bundles over $n$-gons whose fiber is the GKM graph of a full flag manifold. While it was known that any such bundle is realizable for a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-fiber, we observe that new phenomena occur in higher dimensions where realizability depends on the twist automorphism of the GKM fiber bundle. We classify possible twist isomorphsims and show that realizability can be decided in terms of our classification.</description>

      <title>Strong discrete Morse theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to develop a version of Forman's discrete Morse theory for simplicial complexes, based on internal strong collapses. Classical discrete Morse theory can be viewed as a generalization of Whitehead's collapses, where each Morse function on a simplicial complex $K$ defines a sequence of elementary internal collapses. This reduction guarantees the existence of a CW-complex that is homotopy equivalent to $K$, with cells corresponding to the critical simplices of the Morse function. However, this approach lacks an explicit combinatorial description of the attaching maps, which limits the reconstruction of the homotopy type of $K$. By restricting discrete Morse functions to those induced by total orders on the vertices, we develop a strong discrete Morse theory, generalizing the strong collapses introduced by Barmak and Minian. We show that, in this setting, the resulting reduced CW-complex is regular, enabling us to recover its homotopy type combinatorially. We also provide an algorithm to compute this reduction and apply it to obtain efficient structures for complexes in the library of triangulations by Benedetti and Lutz.</description>

      <title>On the functoriality of the space of equivariant smooth $h$-cobordisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14892v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an $(\infty,1)$-functor that takes each smooth $G$-manifold with corners $M$ to the space of equivariant smooth $h$-cobordisms ${\mathcal H}_{\mathrm{Diff}}(M)$. We also give a stable analogue ${\mathcal H}^{\mathcal U}_{\mathrm{Diff}}(M)$ where the manifolds are stabilized with respect to representation discs. The functor structure is subtle to construct, and relies on several new ideas. In the non-equivariant case $G=e$, our $(\infty,1)$-functor agrees with previous constructions of the smooth $h$-cobordism space as a functor to the homotopy category.</description>

      <title>Commutator subalgebra of the Lie algebra associated with a right-angled Coxeter group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the graded Lie algebra $L(RC_K)$ associated with the lower central series of a right-angled Coxeter group $RC_K$. We prove that its commutator subalgebra is a quotient of the polynomial ring over an auxiliary Lie subalgebra $N_K$ of the graph Lie algebra $L_K$, and conjecture that the quotient map is an isomorphism. The epimorphism is defined in terms of a new operation in the associated Lie algebra, which corresponds to the squaring and has an analogue in homotopy theory.</description>
