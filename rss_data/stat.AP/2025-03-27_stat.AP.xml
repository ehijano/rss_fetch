      <title>Statistical Inference on the Miss Distance Compared to Collision Probability for Conjunction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite conjunctions involving near misses of space objects are increasingly common, especially with the growth of satellite constellations and space debris. Accurate risk analysis for these events is essential to prevent collisions and manage space traffic. Traditional methods for assessing collision risk, such as calculating the so-called collision probability, are widely used but have limitations, including counterintuitive interpretations when uncertainty in the state vector is large. To address these limitations, we build on an alternative approach proposed by Elkantassi and Davison (2022) that uses a statistical model allowing inference on the miss distance between two objects in the presence of nuisance parameters. This model provides significance probabilities for a null hypothesis that assumes a small miss distance and allows the construction of confidence intervals, leading to another interpretation of collision risk.
  In this study, we compare this approach with the traditional use of pc across a large, NASA-provided dataset of real conjunctions, in order to evaluate its reliability and to refine the statistical framework to improve its suitability for operational decision-making. We also discuss constraints that could limit the practical use of such alternative approaches.</description>

      <title>Signed Rank Chart For Tied Observations: An Application of Deep Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shewhart Control Charts (SCC)s are constructed under the assumption of normality and are widely recognized in statistical quality control by numerous researchers. Problems arise when the distribution of process data does not conform to a typical Normal Distribution (ND) or when there is insufficient evidence to confirm that the data has approximately ND. Additionally, in some processes, Tied Observations (TO)s are present. The resolution of the measurement device used to assess a quality characteristic can lead to rounding errors, as well as TOs. In many cases, SCCs prove inadequate. In this paper, we address the challenges of non-normal observations and rounding errors by developing a Shewhart Signed-Rank Control Chart (SS-RCC) based on the Wilcoxon statistic. We define a random variable for TOs and another for Untied Observations (UO)s. Subsequently, we approximate their distributions using a Scaled-Normal Distribution (SND) and apply a Deep Learning (DL) model to estimate the scale parameters of the SND for the Control Chart (CC). In practice, we calculate the Average Run Length ($ARL$) for specific cases using Johnson-type distribution benchmarks to illustrate the effects of ties and shifts in manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>EASI Drugs in the Streets of Colombia: Modeling Heterogeneous and Endogenous Drug Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of illicit drug consumers to large-scale policy changes, such as legalization, is heavily mediated by their demand behavior. Since individual drug use is driven by many unobservable factors, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity is crucial for modeling demand and designing targeted public policies. This paper introduces a finite Gaussian mixture of Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand systems to estimate the joint demand for marijuana, cocaine, and basuco (cocaine residual or "crack") in Colombia, accounting for corner solutions and endogenous price variation. Our results highlight the importance of unobserved heterogeneity in identifying reliable price elasticities. The method reveals two regular consumer subpopulations: "safe" (recreational) and "addict" users, with the majority falling into the first group. For the "safe" group, whose estimates are precise and nationally representative, all three drugs exhibit unitary price elasticities, with cocaine being complementary to marijuana and basuco an inferior substitute to cocaine. Given the low production cost of marijuana in Colombia, legalization is likely to drive prices down significantly. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a 50% price decrease would result in a \$363 USD gain in utility-equivalent expenditure per representative consumer, \$120 million USD in government tax revenue, and a \$127 million USD revenue loss for drug dealers. Legalization, therefore, has the potential to reduce the incentive for drug-related criminal activity, the current largest source of violent crime in Colombia.</description>

      <title>A Principal Submanifold-based Approach for Clustering and Multiscale RNA Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA structure determination is essential for understanding its biological functions. However, the reconstruction process often faces challenges, such as atomic clashes, which can lead to inaccurate models. To address these challenges, we introduce the principal submanifold (PSM) approach for analyzing RNA data on a torus. This method provides an accurate, low-dimensional feature representation, overcoming the limitations of previous torus-based methods. By combining PSM with DBSCAN, we propose a novel clustering technique, the principal submanifold-based DBSCAN (PSM-DBSCAN). Our approach achieves superior clustering accuracy and increased robustness to noise. Additionally, we apply this new method for multiscale corrections, effectively resolving RNA backbone clashes at both microscopic and mesoscopic scales. Extensive simulations and comparative studies highlight the enhanced precision and scalability of our method, demonstrating significant improvements over existing approaches. The proposed methodology offers a robust foundation for correcting complex RNA structures and has broad implications for applications in structural biology and bioinformatics.</description>

      <title>Multi-time small-area estimation of oil and gas production capacities by Bayesian multilevel modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11167v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach for estimating well-level oil and gas production capacities across small geographic areas over multiple time periods. Focusing on a basin, which is a geologically and economically distinguishable drilling region, we model the production capacities of its wells grouped by area and time. Regularizing our inferences with priors, we model area-level and time-level variations as well as well-level variations, incorporating lateral length, water usage, and sand usage at each well. The Maidenhead Coordinate System is used to define uniform geographic areas, many of which contain only a small number of wells in a given time period. First, a Bayesian small-area model is built, using data from the Bakken region from February 2012 to June 2024. Then, the model is expanded to contain temporal dynamics in the production capacities. In addition to general time components, water and sand usage intensities are modeled in estimating production capabilities over time. We find the Bayesian multilevel modeling approach provides a flexible and robust framework for modeling and estimating oil and gas production capacities at area and time levels and for informing area-time predictions with uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Pedestrian crash causation analysis near bus stops: Insights from random parameters NB-Lindley models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pedestrian activity near bus stops is typically high, especially in urban areas with bus transit corridors. These locations are critical nodes in the urban network, where frequent interactions between pedestrians and vehicles occur. Consequently, pedestrian safety near bus stops has become a significant concern due to increasing crashes. However, research often needs more comprehensive analysis, specifically examining exposure (e.g., vehicle, pedestrian volumes) characteristics, roadway environment, and bus stop design features contributing to pedestrian-vehicle crashes. This study contributes by exploring influencing factors related to these crashes by the development of statistical models. Key factors identified include bus stop design, traffic conditions, passenger activity, and the roadway environment near bus stops in Fort Worth, Texas. The analysis incorporates data from 596 bus stop locations with non and crash history and integrates crash records from 2018 to 2022. The result demonstrates that the Random Parameters Negative Binomial-Lindley (RPNB-L) model provides a detailed understanding of factors influencing crash frequency. Significant factors associated with increased crash frequency include average annual daily traffic (AADT), bus passenger boarding activity, and the absence of safety features such as medians, crosswalks, and lighting. Additional factors, including school numbers and lower speed limits (e.g., 35 mph or less), were also linked to positively associated higher crash rates. Conversely, signalized intersections, far-side bus stops, locations in mixed-use areas, and sidewalk availability were found to be negatively associated with crash frequency. The study further applies the full Bayes (FB) based Potential for Safety Improvement (PSI) metric to identify high-risk stops and hazardous corridors, helping prioritize safety interventions.</description>

      <title>The myth of declining competitive balance in the UEFA Champions League group stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The degree of competitive balance is a crucial issue in the analysis of sports competitions. According to previous studies, competitive balance has significantly declined in the UEFA Champions League group stage over the recent decades. Our paper introduces six alternative indices in order to explore the robustness of these results. The ex ante measures are based on Elo ratings, while our ex post measures compare the group ranking to reasonable benchmarks. We find no evidence of any trend in the competitive balance of the UEFA Champions League group stage between the 2003/04 and 2023/24 seasons.</description>

      <title>Local linear smoothing for regression surfaces on the simplex using Dirichlet kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a local linear smoother for regression surfaces on the simplex. The estimator solves a least-squares regression problem weighted by a locally adaptive Dirichlet kernel, ensuring good boundary properties. Asymptotic results for the bias, variance, mean squared error, and mean integrated squared error are derived, generalizing the univariate results of Chen [Ann. Inst. Statist. Math., 54(2) (2002), pp. 312-323]. A simulation study shows that the proposed local linear estimator with Dirichlet kernel outperforms its only direct competitor in the literature, the Nadaraya-Watson estimator with Dirichlet kernel due to Bouzebda, Nezzal and Elhattab [AIMS Math., 9(9) (2024), pp. 26195-26282].</description>

      <title>Leveraging statistical models to improve pre-season forecasting and in-season management of a recreational fishery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective management of recreational fisheries requires accurate forecasting of future harvests and real-time monitoring of ongoing harvests. Traditional methods that rely on historical catch data to predict short-term harvests can be unreliable, particularly if changes in management regulations alter angler behavior. In contrast, statistical modeling approaches can provide faster, more flexible, and potentially more accurate predictions, enhancing management outcomes. In this study, we developed and tested models to improve predictions of Gulf of Mexico gag harvests for both pre-season planning and in-season monitoring. Our best-fitting model outperformed traditional methods (i.e., estimates derived from historical average harvest) for both cumulative pre-season projections and in-season monitoring. Notably, our modeling framework appeared to be more accurate in more recent, shorter seasons due to its ability to account for effort compression. A key advantage of our framework is its ability to explicitly quantify the probability of exceeding harvest quotas for any given season duration. This feature enables managers to evaluate trade-offs between season duration and conservation goals. This is especially critical for vulnerable, highly targeted stocks. Our findings also underscore the value of statistical models to complement and advance traditional fisheries management approaches.</description>
