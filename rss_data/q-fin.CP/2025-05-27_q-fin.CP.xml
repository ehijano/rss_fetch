      <title>Comparative analysis of financial data differentiation techniques using LSTM neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compare traditional approach of computing logarithmic returns with the fractional differencing method and its tempered extension as methods of data preparation before their usage in advanced machine learning models. Differencing parameters are estimated using multiple techniques. The empirical investigation is conducted on data from four major stock indices covering the most recent 10-year period. The set of explanatory variables is additionally extended with technical indicators. The effectiveness of the differencing methods is evaluated using both forecast error metrics and risk-adjusted return trading performance metrics. The findings suggest that fractional differentiation methods provide a suitable data transformation technique, improving the predictive model forecasting performance. Furthermore, the generated predictions appeared to be effective in constructing profitable trading strategies for both individual assets and a portfolio of stock indices. These results underline the importance of appropriate data transformation techniques in financial time series forecasting, supporting the application of memory-preserving techniques.</description>

      <title>Fast Learning in Quantitative Finance with Extreme Learning Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical factor in adopting machine learning for time-sensitive financial tasks is computational speed, including model training and inference. This paper demonstrates that a broad class of such problems, especially those previously addressed using deep neural networks, can be efficiently solved using single-layer neural networks without iterative gradient-based training. This is achieved through the extreme learning machine (ELM) framework. ELM utilizes a single-layer network with randomly initialized hidden nodes and output weights obtained via convex optimization, enabling rapid training and inference. We present various applications in both supervised and unsupervised learning settings, including option pricing, intraday return prediction, volatility surface fitting, and numerical solution of partial differential equations. Across these examples, ELM demonstrates notable improvements in computational efficiency while maintaining comparable accuracy and generalization compared to deep neural networks and classical machine learning methods. We also briefly discuss theoretical aspects of ELM implementation and its generalization capabilities.</description>
