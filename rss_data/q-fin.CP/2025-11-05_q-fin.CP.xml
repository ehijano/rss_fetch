      <title>BondBERT: What we learn when assigning sentiment in the bond market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bond markets respond differently to macroeconomic news compared to equity markets, yet most sentiment models, including FinBERT, are trained primarily on general financial or equity news data. This mismatch is important because bond prices often move in the opposite direction to economic optimism, making general or equity-based sentiment tools potentially misleading. In this paper, we introduce BondBERT, a transformer-based language model fine-tuned on bond-specific news. BondBERT can act as the perception and reasoning component of a financial decision-support agent, providing sentiment signals that integrate with forecasting models. It is a generalisable framework for adapting transformers to low-volatility, domain-inverse sentiment tasks by compiling and cleaning 30,000 UK bond market articles (2018--2025) for training, validation, and testing. We compare BondBERT's sentiment predictions against FinBERT, FinGPT, and Instruct-FinGPT using event-based correlation, up/down accuracy analyses, and LSTM forecasting across ten UK sovereign bonds. We find that BondBERT consistently produces positive correlations with bond returns, achieves higher alignment and forecasting accuracy than the three baseline models, with lower normalised RMSE and higher information coefficient. These results demonstrate that domain-specific sentiment adaptation better captures fixed income dynamics, bridging a gap between NLP advances and bond market analytics.</description>

      <title>Modeling Hawkish-Dovish Latent Beliefs in Multi-Agent Debate-Based LLMs for Monetary Policy Decision Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting central bank policy decisions, particularly those of the Federal Open Market Committee(FOMC) has become increasingly important amid heightened economic uncertainty. While prior studies have used monetary policy texts to predict rate changes, most rely on static classification models that overlook the deliberative nature of policymaking. This study proposes a novel framework that structurally imitates the FOMC's collective decision-making process by modeling multiple large language models(LLMs) as interacting agents. Each agent begins with a distinct initial belief and produces a prediction based on both qualitative policy texts and quantitative macroeconomic indicators. Through iterative rounds, agents revise their predictions by observing the outputs of others, simulating deliberation and consensus formation. To enhance interpretability, we introduce a latent variable representing each agent's underlying belief(e.g., hawkish or dovish), and we theoretically demonstrate how this belief mediates the perception of input information and interaction dynamics. Empirical results show that this debate-based approach significantly outperforms standard LLMs-based baselines in prediction accuracy. Furthermore, the explicit modeling of beliefs provides insights into how individual perspectives and social influence shape collective policy forecasts.</description>

      <title>Numerical valuation of European options under two-asset infinite-activity exponential L\'evy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical method for the valuation of European-style options under two-asset infinite-activity exponential L\'evy models. Our method extends the effective approach developed by Wang, Wan &amp; Forsyth (2007) for the 1-dimensional case to the 2-dimensional setting and is applicable for general L\'evy measures under mild assumptions. A tailored discretization of the non-local integral term is developed, which can be efficiently evaluated by means of the fast Fourier transform. For the temporal discretization, the semi-Lagrangian theta-method is employed in a convenient splitting fashion, where the diffusion term is treated implicitly and the integral term is handled explicitly by a fixed-point iteration. Numerical experiments for put-on-the-average options under Normal Tempered Stable dynamics reveal favourable second-order convergence of our method whenever the exponential L\'evy process has finite-variation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for solving Black-Scholes PDEs for high-dimensional option pricing in finance and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09241v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a quantum Monte Carlo algorithm to solve high-dimensional Black-Scholes PDEs with correlation for high-dimensional option pricing. The payoff function of the option is of general form and is only required to be continuous and piece-wise affine (CPWA), which covers most of the relevant payoff functions used in finance. We provide a rigorous error analysis and complexity analysis of our algorithm. In particular, we prove that the computational complexity of our algorithm is bounded polynomially in the space dimension $d$ of the PDE and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. Moreover, we show that for payoff functions which are bounded, our algorithm indeed has a speed-up compared to classical Monte Carlo methods. Furthermore, we provide numerical simulations in one and two dimensions using our developed package within the Qiskit framework tailored to price CPWA options with respect to the Black-Scholes model, as well as discuss the potential extension of the numerical simulations to arbitrary space dimension.</description>
