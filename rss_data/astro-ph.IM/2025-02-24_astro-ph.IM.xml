      <title>Reducing false positives in strong lens detection through effective augmentation and ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research studies the impact of high-quality training datasets on the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in detecting strong gravitational lenses. We stress the importance of data diversity and representativeness, demonstrating how variations in sample populations influence CNN performance. In addition to the quality of training data, our results highlight the effectiveness of various techniques, such as data augmentation and ensemble learning, in reducing false positives while maintaining model completeness at an acceptable level. This enhances the robustness of gravitational lens detection models and advancing capabilities in this field. Our experiments, employing variations of DenseNet and EfficientNet, achieved a best false positive rate (FP rate) of $10^{-4}$, while successfully identifying over 88 per cent of genuine gravitational lenses in the test dataset. This represents an 11-fold reduction in the FP rate compared to the original training dataset. Notably, this substantial enhancement in the FP rate is accompanied by only a 2.3 per cent decrease in the number of true positive samples. Validated on the KiDS dataset, our findings offer insights applicable to ongoing missions, like Euclid.</description>

      <title>ODS: A self-reporting system for radio telescopes to coexist with adaptive satellite constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations bring broadband internet and cellular service to the most remote locations on the planet. Unfortunately, many of these locations also host some of the world's best optical and radio astronomy (RA) observatories. With the number of LEO satellites expected to increase by an order of magnitude in the upcoming decade, satellite downlink radio frequency interference (RFI) is a growing concern in protected radio-quiet areas like the United States National Radio Quiet Zone. When these satellites transmit in the spectrum near protected RA bands, undesired out-of-band emission can leak into these protected bands and impact scientific observations. In this paper, we present a self-reporting system - Operational Data Sharing (ODS) - which enables mutual awareness by publishing radio telescopes' operational information to a protected database that is available to satellite operators through a representational state transfer application programming interface (REST API). Satellite operators can use the ODS data to adapt their downlink tasking algorithms in real time to avoid overwhelming sensitive RA facilities, particularly, through the novel Telescope Boresight Avoidance (TBA) technique. Preliminary results from recent experiments between the NRAO and the SpaceX Starlink teams demonstrate the effectiveness of the ODS and TBA in reducing downlink RFI in the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array's observations in the 1990-1995 MHz and 10.7-12.7 GHz bands. This automated ODS system is beginning to be implemented by other RA facilities and could be utilized by other satellite operators in the near future.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Black Hole Mass Estimation in Type-2 AGNs: Classical vs. Quantum Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the case of Type-2 AGNs, estimating the mass of the black hole is challenging. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires considerable insight into the mass of black holes. This work compared different classical and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms for black hole mass estimation, wherein the classical algorithms are Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression, Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Lasso Regression, Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Bayesian Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, Classical Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM, Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) and Transformer-Based Regression. On the other hand, quantum algorithms including Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (Q-LSTM), Sampler-QNN, Estimator-QNN, Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR), Quantum Linear Regression(Q-LR), QML with JAX optimization were also tested. The results revealed that classical algorithms gave better R^2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE results than the quantum models. Among the classical models, LSTM has the best result with an accuracy of 99.77%. Estimator-QNN has the highest accuracy for quantum algorithms with an MSE of 0.0124 and an accuracy of 99.75%. This study ascertains both the strengths and weaknesses of the classical and the quantum approaches. As far as our knowledge goes, this work could pave the way for the future application of quantum algorithms in astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Development and Performance Validation of a Versatile VLBI Digital Backend Using the ROACH2 Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Customized digital backends for Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) are critical components for radio astronomy observatories. There are several serialized products such as the Digital Baseband Converter (DBBC), Reconfigurable Open Architecture Computing Hardware (ROACH) Digital BackEnd (RDBE), and Chinese Data Acquisition System (CDAS). However, the reliance on high-speed analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) often necessitates dedicated hardware platforms with long development cycles and prohibitive cost, limiting scalability and adaptability to evolving observational needs. To address these challenges, we propose a design leveraging the versatile and cost-effective ROACH2 hardware platform, developed by CASPER (Collaboration for Astronomy Signal Processing and Electronics Research). ROACH2's mature technology and streamlined firmware development capabilities significantly reduce the hardware platform's development cycle and cost, making it ideal for modern astronomical applications. This VLBI digital backend, based on the ROACH2 platform, incorporates key technologies such as Polyphase Filter Banks (PFB) algorithm implementation, digital complex-to-real baseband signal conversion, Mark5B data formatter design and two-bit optimal threshold quantization. These features ensure compatibility with existing systems while providing enhanced performance. The backend's performance was validated through multi-station VLBI experiments, demonstrating its ability to achieve good correlation fringes compared to the customized CDAS2-D system. Furthermore, this platform offers flexibility for rapid deployment of additional digital backends, such as those for spectral line observations, showcasing its potential for broader astronomical applications.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Amplifier Sensing Charged-Coupled Device: Model and improvement of the Node Removal Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multiple Amplifier Sensing Charge-Coupled Device (MAS-CCD) has emerged as a promising technology for astronomical observation, quantum imaging, and low-energy particle detection due to its ability to reduce the readout noise without increasing the readout time as in its predecessor, the Skipper-CCD, by reading out the same charge packet through multiple inline amplifiers. Previous works identified a new parameter in this sensor, called the Node Removal Inefficiency (NRI), related to inefficiencies in charge transfer and residual charge removal from the output gates after readout. These inefficiencies can lead to distortions in the measured signals similar to those produced by the charge transfer inefficiencies in standard CCDs. This work introduces more details in the mathematical description of the NRI mechanism and provides techniques to quantify its magnitude from the measured data. It also proposes a new operation strategy that significantly reduces its effect with minimal alterations of the timing sequences or voltage settings for the other components of the sensor. The proposed technique is corroborated by experimental results on a sixteen-amplifier MAS-CCD. At the same time, the experimental data demonstrate that this approach minimizes the NRI effect to levels comparable to other sources of distortion the charge transfer inefficiency in scientific devices.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for AGN Accretion and Jet Feedback in Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, especially due to relativistic jets, is crucial for understanding the cool-core problem in galaxy clusters. We present a new subgrid method to model accretion onto and feedback from AGN in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. Instead of applying the traditional Bondi formalism, we use a sink particle algorithm in which the accretion flux is measured directly through a control surface. A weighting kernel is used to reset the gas properties within the accretion radius at the end of each timestep. We implement feedback in the form of bipolar jets whose properties are tied to the accretion rate. The method is tested with a spherically symmetric Bondi gas flow problem and a Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton wind problem, with and without jet feedback. We discuss the reliability of this model by comparing our jet simulations with those in the literature, and we examine the dependence of test results on parameters such as the resolution and size of the jet injection region. We find that the sink particle model can account for the $\alpha$ factor in accretion measurement, and the accretion radius must be resolved with at least two zones to produce realistic black hole accretion. We also show how under-resolving the AGN feedback region in simulations can impact the feedback energy deposited and the jet dynamics. The code described here is the framework for a feedback model, described in a companion paper, that will use accretion disk modeling to more self-consistently determine the feedback efficiency.</description>

      <title>Calibrating the Instrumental Drift in MAROON-X using an Ensemble Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MAROON-X is a state-of-the-art extreme precision radial velocity spectrograph deployed on the 8.1-meter Gemini-N telescope on Maunakea, Hawai'i. Using a stabilized Fabry-P\'erot etalon for wavelength and drift calibration, MAROON-X has achieved a short-term precision of $\sim$\,30\,cm\,s$^{-1}$. However, due to a long-term drift in the etalon (2.2\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ per day) and various interruptions of the instrument baseline over the first few years of operation, MAROON-X experiences RV offsets between observing runs several times larger than the short-term precision during any individual run, which hinders the detection of longer-period signals. In this study, we analyze RV measurements of 11 targets that either exhibit small RV scatter or have signals that can be precisely constrained using Keplerian or Gaussian Process models. Leveraging this ensemble, we calibrate MAROON-X's run offsets for data collected between September 2020 and early January 2024 to a precision of $\sim$0.5\,m\,s$^{-1}$. When applying these calibrated offsets to HD 3651, a quiet star, we obtain residual velocities with an RMS of $&lt;$70\,cm\,s$^{-1}$ in both the Red and Blue channels of MAROON-X over a baseline of 29 months. We also demonstrate the sensitivity of MAROON-X data calibrated with these offsets through a series of injection-recovery tests. Based on our findings, MAROON-X is capable of detecting sub m\,s$^{-1}$ signals out to periods of more than 1,000 days.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning in Stellar Astronomy: Progress up to 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has become a key tool in astronomy, driving advancements in the analysis and interpretation of complex datasets from observations. This article reviews the application of ML techniques in the identification and classification of stellar objects, alongside the inference of their key astrophysical properties. We highlight the role of both supervised and unsupervised ML algorithms, particularly deep learning models, in classifying stars and enhancing our understanding of essential stellar parameters, such as mass, age, and chemical composition. We discuss ML applications in the study of various stellar objects, including binaries, supernovae, dwarfs, young stellar objects, variables, metal-poor, and chemically peculiar stars. Additionally, we examine the role of ML in investigating star-related interstellar medium objects, such as protoplanetary disks, planetary nebulae, cold neutral medium, feedback bubbles, and molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>TemplateGeNN: Neural Networks used to accelerate Gravitational Wave Template Bank Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TemplateGeNN, a fast stochastic template bank generation algorithm which uses Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and a LearningMatch model (Siamese neural network). TemplateGeNN generated a binary black hole template bank (chirp mass varied from $5 M_{\odot} \leq \mathcal{M}_{c} \leq 20M_{\odot}$, symmetric mass ratio varied from $0.1 \leq \eta \leq 0.24999$, and equal aligned spin varied from $-0.99 \leq \chi_{1,2}\leq 0.99$) of 31,640 templates in $\sim 1$ day on a single A100 GPU. To test the sensitivity of this template bank we injected 7746 binary black hole templates into LIGO Gaussian noise. This template bank recovered 98$\%$ of the injections with a fitting factor greater than 0.97. For lower mass regions (black hole mass region between $5 M_{\odot} \leq m_{1, 2} \leq 25 M_{\odot}$), 99$\%$ of 9469 injections were recovered with a fitting factor greater than 0.97. LearningMatch and TemplateGeNN are a machine-learning pipeline that can be used to accelerate template bank generation for future gravitational-wave data analysis.</description>

      <title>Calibration of MAJIS (Moons And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer): I. On-ground setup description and characterisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visible and infrared Moon And Jupiter Imaging Spectrometer (MAJIS), aboard the JUpiter ICy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft, will characterize the composition of the surfaces and atmospheres of the Jupiter system. Prior to the launch, a campaign was carried out to obtain the measurements needed to calibrate the instrument. The aim was not only to produce data for the calculation of the radiometric, spectral, and spatial transfer functions, but also to evaluate MAJIS performance, such as signal-to-noise ratio and amount of straylight, under near-flight conditions. Here, we first describe the setup implemented to obtain these measurements, based on five optical channels. We notably emphasize the concepts used to mitigate thermal infrared emissions generated at ambient temperatures, since the MAJIS spectral range extends up to 5.6 $\mu$m. Then, we characterize the performance of the setup by detailing the validation measurements obtained before the campaign. In particular, the radiometric, geometric, and spectral properties of the setup needed for the inversion of collected data and the calculation of the instrument's calibration functions are presented and discussed. Finally, we provide an overview of conducted measurements with MAJIS, and we discuss unforeseen events encountered during the on-ground calibration campaign.</description>

Abstract: The paper presents the new enhancement to the Data Center named DC1 at the University of Naples "Federico II". The ICSC funds at INFN have allowed to improve the power and cooling subsystems, while other funds from the PNRR (the STILES project) and funds directly from the MUR have allowed to enhance the computing, storage and network equipments. All these resources are in addition to the IBiSCo cluster and equipments described earlier in this book, but all together, thanks to a strong synergy between projects, have leaded to a very powerful Data Center for scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Influence of Modeling Assumptions on the Inferred Dynamical State of Resonant Systems: A Case Study of the HD 45364 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planetary systems exhibiting mean-motion resonances (MMRs) offer unique opportunities to study the imprint of disk-induced migration on the orbital architectures of planetary systems. The HD 45364 system, discovered via the radial velocity (RV) method to host two giant planets in a 3:2 MMR, has been the subject of several studies attempting to reconstruct the system's orbital migration history based on its present-day resonant configuration. Recently, Li et al. (2022) called into question the system's residence in the 3:2 MMR based on a revised orbital solution derived from an expanded set of RV observations that extend the time baseline of the original discovery data by over a decade. However, we show that inferences about the planets' dynamical state with respect to the 3:2 MMR are sensitive to the particular prior assumptions adopted in the orbital modeling. Using $N$-body dynamical models, we show that orbital solutions constrained to reside deep in the 3:2 MMR fit the RV data with a similar quality to unconstrained orbital solutions. We conclude that the RV observations of HD 45364 are consistent with orbital configurations produced by smooth migration and resonance capture. We further show that past convergent orbital migration can reproduce the system's present-day orbital configuration provided that the ratio of migration to eccentricity damping timescales, $K$, was in the range $11\lesssim K \lesssim 144$. We also find that dynamical interactions in the system can break the usual mass-inclination degeneracy inherent to Keplerian models of RV observations and constrain the planets' absolute masses to within a factor of $\sim1.5$.</description>

Abstract: Previous studies of the response of the Moon to gravitational waves have been carried out using analytical or semi-analytical models assuming ideal lunar structures. Such models are advantageous for their high-speed calculation but fail to account for the extremely heterogeneous subsurface and/or interior structures of the Moon. Numerical calculations are needed, but it is challenging to model the topography and lateral heterogeneity of the Moon. In addition, the computational cost is great especially when performing the GW simulation for a long time. As a first step towards overcoming the above difficulties, we employ a two-dimensional finite element method to numerically simulate the lunar response to gravitational waves. We verify our method by comparing our numerical results with those semi-analytical solutions. Based on such comparison, we also analyze the limitation of the two-dimensional simulation. Our work breaks a new way towards the precise simulation of realistic lunar response to gravitational waves in the future and lays down a solid foundation for three-dimensional numerical simulations.</description>
