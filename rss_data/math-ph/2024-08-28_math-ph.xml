      <title>Synthesis of the Weyl matrix on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for successive synthesis of the Weyl matrix on the square lattice is proposed. It allows one to compute the Weyl matrix of a large graph by adding new edges and solving elementary systems of linear algebraic equations at each step. Synthesis of the Weyl matrix is useful to further study the inverse problems of the square lattice. Moreover, our approach can be extended to other types of periodic lattices.</description>

      <title>Power spectra of Dyson's circular ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The power spectrum is a Fourier series statistic associated with the covariances of the displacement from average positions of the members of an eigen-sequence. When this eigen-sequence has rotational invariance, as for the eigen-angles of Dyson's circular ensembles, recent work of Riser and Kanzieper has uncovered an exact identity expressing the power spectrum in terms of the generating function for the conditioned gap probability of having $k$ eigenvalues in an interval. These authors moreover showed how for the circular unitary ensemble integrability properties of the generating function, via a particular Painlev\'e VI system, imply a computational scheme for the corresponding power spectrum, and allow for the determination of its large $N$ limit. In the present work, these results are extended to the case of the circular orthogonal ensemble and circular symplectic ensemble, where the integrability is expressed through four particular Painlev\'e VI systems for finite $N$, and two Painlev\'e III$'$ systems for the limit $N\to\infty$, and also via corresponding Fredholm determinants. The relation between the limiting power spectrum $S_\infty(\omega)$, where $\omega$ denotes the Fourier variable, and the limiting generating function for the conditioned gap probabilities is particular direct, involving just a single integration over the gap endpoint in the latter. Interpreting this generating function as the characteristic function of a counting statistic allows for it to be shown that $S_\infty(\omega) \mathop{\sim} \limits_{\omega \to 0} {1 \over \pi \beta | \omega|}$, where $\beta$ is the Dyson index.</description>

      <title>Causal perturbative QED and white noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Bogoliubov's causal perturbative QFT, which includes only one refinement: the creation-annihilation operators at a point, \emph{i.e.} for a specific momentum, are mathematically interpreted as the Hida operators from the white noise analysis. We leave the rest of the theory completely unchanged. This allows avoiding infrared -- and ultraviolet -- divergences in the transition to the adiabatic limit for interacting fields and elimination of the free parameters of the theory, associated with the choice of normalization in computation of the retarded and advanced parts of causal distributions (corresponding to the freedom in the choice of renormalization scheme). This enhances the predictive power of the theory, and in particular allows to derive non-trivial mass relations. The approach is general and can be applied to investigate any perturbative QFT.</description>

      <title>Tree-tubings and the combinatorics of resurgent Dyson-Schwinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a novel combinatorial interpretation to the perturbative series solutions for a class of Dyson-Schwinger equations. We show how binary tubings of rooted trees with labels from an alphabet on the tubes, and where the labels satisfy certain compatibility constraints, can be used to give series solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations with a single Mellin transform which is the reciprocal of a polynomial with rational roots, in a fully combinatorial way. Further, the structure of these tubings leads directly to systems of differential equations for the anomalous dimension that are ideally suited for resurgent analysis. We give a general result in the distinct root case, and investigate the effect of repeated roots, which drastically changes the asymptotics and the transseries structure.</description>

      <title>Continuity bounds for quantum entropies arising from a fundamental entropic inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a tight upper bound for the difference in von Neumann entropies between two quantum states, $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$. This bound is expressed in terms of the von Neumann entropies of the mutually orthogonal states derived from the Jordan-Hahn decomposition of the difference operator $(\rho_1 - \rho_2)$. This yields a novel entropic inequality that implies the well-known Audenaert-Fannes inequality. We employ this inequality to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the quantum conditional entropy of two states whose marginals on the conditioning system coincide. We additionally use it to derive a continuity bound for the quantum relative entropy in both variables. Our proofs are largely based on majorization theory and convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Conformal Four-Point Integrals: Recursive Structure, Toda Equations and Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider conformal four-point Feynman integrals to investigate how much of their mathematical structure in two spacetime dimensions carries over to higher dimensions. In particular, we discuss recursions in the loop order and spacetime dimension. This results e.g. in new expressions for conformal ladder integrals with generic propagator powers in all even dimensions and allows us to lift results on 2d Feynman integrals with underlying Calabi-Yau geometry to higher dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Basso-Dixon generalizations of these integrals obey different variants of the Toda equations of motion, thus establishing a connection to classical integrability and the family of so-called tau-functions. We then show that all of these integrals can be written in a double copy form that combines holomorphic and anti-holomorphic building blocks. Here integrals in higher dimensions are constructed from an intersection pairing of two-dimensional "periods" together with their derivatives. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher-point integrals which provide a richer kinematical setup.</description>

      <title>Singularity formation for the higher dimensional Skyrme model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that singularities form in the classical $(5+1)$-dimensional, co-rotational Skyrme model. It was recently proven by Chen, Sch\"orkhuber, and the author that the strong field limit of the $(5+1)$-dimensional, co-rotational Skyrme model admits an explicit self-similar solution which is asymptotically stable within backwards light cones. Seeded by the limiting model, we construct an open set of initial data whose evolution within a backwards light cone, according to the full model, suffers a gradient blowup in finite time. Moreover, the singularity develops at the self-similar rate and possesses an asymptotic profile given by the self-similar profile of the strong field model.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian approach to origami vertex analysis: Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of origami in engineering has significantly expanded in recent years, spanning deployable structures across scales, folding robotics, and mechanical metamaterials. However, finding foldable paths can be a formidable task as the kinematics are determined by a nonlinear system of equations, often with several degrees of freedom. In this work, we leverage a Lagrangian approach to derive reduced-order compatibility conditions for rigid-facet origami vertices with reflection and rotational symmetries. Then, using the reduced-order conditions, we derive exact, multi-degree of freedom solutions for degree 6 and degree 8 vertices with prescribed symmetries. The exact kinematic solutions allow us to efficiently investigate the topology of allowable kinematics, including the consideration of a self-contact constraint, and then visually interpret the role of geometric design parameters on these admissible fold paths by monitoring the change in the kinematic topology. We then introduce a procedure to construct lower symmetry kinematic solutions by breaking symmetry of higher order kinematic solutions in a systematic way that preserves compatibility. The multi-degree of freedom solutions discovered here should assist with building intuition of the kinematic feasibility of higher degree origami vertices and also facilitate the development of new algorithmic procedures for origami-engineering design.</description>

      <title>Topological string as massive spinning particle in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model is proposed for a classical bosonic string in $d=3$ Minkowski space with an action functional that includes Gauss and mean world-sheet curvature. The Lagrangian is invariant under $3d$ Poincar\'e transformations modulo total divergence. In addition to the diffeomorphism, the action enjoys the extra gauge symmetry with the second derivatives of the scalar gauge parameter. This symmetry gauges out all the local degrees of freedom (DoF's), while some global DoF's survive. The Hamiltonian constrained analysis confirms that the model does not have any local DoF. The world sheet of the string turns out to be a cylinder with time-like axis. The global DoF's of this string describe one single irreducible massive $3d$ particle with spin. The particle momentum is a conserved vector directed along the cylinder axis while the momentum square is a fixed constant determined by the parameters in the action. The total angular momentum is a conserved vector that defines the position of the axis of the cylinder whose specific value is defined by initial data, while the spin, being the product of momentum and angular momentum is fixed by the parameters in the string Lagrangian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been made.</description>

      <title>R-matrices and Miura operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Miura operators for $W$- and $Y$-algebras from first principles as the expectation value of the intersection between a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$ Chern-Simons theory. The expectation value, viewed as the transition amplitude for states in the defect theories forming representations of the affine Yangian of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$, satisfies the Yang-Baxter equation and is thus interpreted as an R-matrix. To achieve this, we identify the representations associated with the line and surface defects by calculating the operator product expansions (OPEs) of local operators on the defects, as conditions that anomalous Feynman diagrams cancel each other. We then evaluate the expectation value of the defect intersection using Feynman diagrams. When the line and surface defects are specified, we demonstrate that the expectation value precisely matches the Miura operators and their products.</description>

      <title>Banana diagrams as functions of geodesic distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the study of banana diagrams in coordinate representation to the case of curved space-times. If the space is harmonic, the Green functions continue to depend on a single variable -- the geodesic distance. But now this dependence can be somewhat non-trivial. We demonstrate that, like in the flat case, the coordinate differential equations for powers of Green functions can still be expressed as determinants of certain operators. Therefore, not-surprisingly, the coordinate equations remain straightforward -- while their reformulation in terms of momentum integrals and Picard-Fuchs equations can seem problematic. However we show that the Feynman parameter representation can also be generalized, at least for banana diagrams in simple harmonic spaces, so that the Picard-Fuchs equations retain their Euclidean form with just a minor modification. A separate story is the transfer to the case when the Green function essentially depends on several rather than a single argument. In this case, we provide just one example, that the equations are still there, but conceptual issues in the more general case will be discussed elsewhere.</description>

      <title>R-matrices from Feynman Diagrams in 5d Chern-Simons Theory and Twisted M-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the analogues of R-matrices that arise in 5d non-commutative topological-holomorphic Chern-Simons theory, which is known to describe twisted M-theory. We first study the intersections of line and surface operators in 5d Chern-Simons theory, which correspond to M2- and M5-branes, respectively. A Feynman diagram computation of the correlation function of this configuration furnishes an expression reminiscent of an R-matrix derivable from 4d Chern-Simons theory. We explain how this object is related to a Miura operator that is known to realize (matrix-extended) $W_{\infty}$-algebras. For 5d Chern-Simons theory with nonabelian gauge group, we then perform a Feynman diagram computation of coproducts for deformed double current algebras and matrix-extended $W_{\infty}$-algebras from fusions of M2-branes, M5-branes, and M2-M5 intersections.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Eigenvalue Sums of Schr\"odinger Operators with Complex Radial Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider eigenvalue sums of Schr\"odinger operators $-\Delta+V$ on $L^2(\R^d)$ with complex radial potentials $V\in L^q(\R^d)$, $q&lt;d$. We prove quantitative bounds on the distribution of the eigenvlaues in terms of the $L^q$ norm of $V$. A consequence of our bounds is that, if the eigenvlaues $(z_j)$ accumulates to a point in $(0,\infty)$, then $(\im z_j)$ is summable. The key technical tools are resolvent estimates in Schatten spaces. We show that these resolvent estimates follow from spectral measure estimates by an epsilon removal argument.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$, which seem no less realistic than $H_\theta$, and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.</description>

      <title>Cartan-Schouten metrics for information geometry and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Cartan-Schouten metrics, explore invariant dual connections, and propose them as models for Information Geometry.
  Based on the underlying Riemannian barycenter and the biinvariant mean of Lie groups, we subsequently propose a new parametric mean for data science and machine learning which comes with several advantages compared to traditional tools such as the arithmetic mean, median, mode, expectation, least square method, maximum likelihood, linear regression. We call a metric on a Lie group, a Cartan-Schouten metric, if its Levi-Civita connection is biinvariant, so every 1-parameter subgroup through the unit is a geodesic.
  Except for not being left or right invariant in general, Cartan-Schouten metrics enjoy the same geometry as biinvariant metrics, since they share the same Levi-Civita connection. To bypass the non-invariance apparent drawback, we show that Cartan-Schouten metrics are completely determined by their value at the unit. We give an explicit formula for recovering them from their value at the unit, thus making them much less computationally demanding, compared to general metrics on manifolds. Furthermore, Lie groups with Cartan-Schouten metrics are complete Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We give a complete characterization of Lie groups with Riemannian or Lorentzian Cartan-Schouten metrics. Cartan-Schouten metrics are in abundance on 2-nilpotent Lie groups. Namely, on every 2-nilpotent Lie group, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of left invariant metrics and that of Cartan-Schouten metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the asymptotic behavior and decay of solutions near vacuum to the Hartree equation with the Coulomb interaction potential in three dimensions. Our approach is direct, which consists of independently deriving the sharp dispersive decay estimates for the density function and establishing the boundedness of energy norms. The global in time well-posedness is done without introducing the phase correction, while the phase modification is explicit in terms of the density function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and solve a minimal model of dynamic passage through a quantum second order phase transition in the presence of weak symmetry breaking interactions and no dissipation. The evolution eventually leads to a highly asymmetric state, no matter how weak the symmetry breaking term is. This suggests a potential mechanism for strong asymmetry in the production of particles with almost identical characteristics. The model's integrability also allows us to obtain exact Kibble-Zurek exponents for the scaling of the number of nonadiabatic excitations.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear d'Alembert comparison theorem and causal differential calculus on metric measure spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational first-order Sobolev calculus on metric measure spacetimes. The key object is the maximal weak subslope of an arbitrary causal function, which plays the role of the (Lorentzian) modulus of its differential. It is shown to satisfy certain chain and Leibniz rules, certify a locality property, and be compatible with its smooth analog. In this setup, we propose a quadraticity condition termed infinitesimal Minkowskianity, which singles out genuinely Lorentzian structures among Lorentz-Finsler spacetimes. Moreover, we establish a comparison theorem for a nonlinear yet elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian in a weak form under the timelike measure contraction property. As a particular case, this extends Eschenburg's classical estimate past the timelike cut locus.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the phase mixing estimates for the density and its derivatives associated with the nonlinear Hartree equation around certain translation-invariant equilibria. Their decay rates are exactly the same as those of free Hartree dynamics. Our method is based on pointwise decay estimates of the Green function associated with the linearized operator in Fourier space and a nonlinear iterative scheme. Another proof of short-range scattering, established in [arXiv:1310.0604, arXiv:1607.07958, arXiv:2308.15929], is also provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Bogoliubov's causal perturbative QFT, which includes only one refinement: the creation-annihilation operators at a point, \emph{i.e.} for a specific momentum, are mathematically interpreted as the Hida operators from the white noise analysis. We leave the rest of the theory completely unchanged. This allows avoiding infrared -- and ultraviolet -- divergences in the transition to the adiabatic limit for interacting fields. Here we present the inductive step. We are especially concentrated with the analysis of the second order contribution to the scattering operator, and give explicit computations using the calculus of integral kernel operators, \emph{i.e} contractions of their vector-valued kernels, and splittings of the contractions into advanced and retarded parts. Explicit example of QED is provided, together with the detailed analysis of the key point in avoiding UV divergence.</description>

Abstract: We describe a general procedure which allows to construct, starting from a given Hamiltonian, the whole family of new ones sharing the same set of unparameterized trajectories in phase space. The symmetry structure of this family can be completely characterized provided the symmetries of initial Hamiltonian are known. Our approach covers numerous models considered in literature as well as it allows to construct novel ones.. It provides a far reaching generalization of Hietarinta et al. coupling-constant metamorphosis method and another proof of Darboux theorem.</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.02546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mutual information method has demonstrated to be very useful for deriving the potential order parameter of a system. Although the method suggests some constraints which help to define this quantity, there is still some freedom in the definition. The method then results inefficient for cases where we have order parameters with a large number of constants in the expansion, which happens when we have many degenerate vacuums. Here we introduce some additional constraints based on the existence of broken symmetries, which help us to reduce the arbitrariness in the definitions of the order parameter in the proposed mutual information method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize a classical inequality between the eigenvalues of the Laplacians with Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions on bounded, planar domains: in 1955, Payne proved that below the $k$-th eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian there exist at least $k + 2$ eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian, provided the domain is convex. It has, however, been conjectured that this should hold for any domain. Here we show that the statement indeed remains true for all simply connected planar Lipschitz domains. The proof relies on a novel variational principle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10690v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss singular loci in the phase spaces of theories which lack globally well-defined numbers of dynamical modes. This is a topic which appears quite often in the recent literature on modified gravity. In particular, there were discussions about $R^2$ gravity around Minkowski space. It is a relatively simple case, and still there were some confusions. It clearly shows that one should be very accurate when trying to understand a potentially problematic theory through perturbations around a simply looking background. At the same time, many modern teleparallel approaches are laden with even more severe issues. Therefore, it is a topic which is certainly worth carefully thinking about.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Form factors, spectral and K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation in nonlocal quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the conical region of convergence of exponential and asymptotically polynomial form factors and their integral representations. Then, we calculate the spectral representation of the propagator of nonlocal theories with entire form factors, in particular, of the above type. The spectral density is positive-definite and exhibits the same spectrum as the local theory. We also find that the piece of the propagator corresponding to the time-ordered two-point correlation function admits a generalization of the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation with a standard momentum dependence and a spectral density differing from the local one only in the presence of interactions. These results are in agreement with what already known about the free theory after a field redefinition and about perturbative unitarity of the interacting theory. The spectral and K\"all\'en-Lehmann representations have the same standard local limit, which is recovered smoothly when sending the fundamental length scale $\ell_*$ in the form factor to zero.</description>

      <title>Towards $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three years ago, we proposed free off-shell models for ${\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal higher-spin multiplets in arbitrary conformally flat backgrounds, constructed conserved conformal higher-spin supercurrents for a massless hypermultiplet, and sketched the Noether procedure to generate its cubic couplings to the superconformal higher-spin multiplets. This paper is devoted to completing the Noether procedure. Specifically, we: (i) describe the unique off-shell primary extensions of the conformal higher-spin supercurrents; (ii) embed the off-shell superconformal prepotentials given in arXiv:2104.10416 into primary unconstrained isotwistor multiplets; and (iii) present the unique gauge transformations of the hypermultiplet and the isotwistor prepotentials. An extension of the Noether procedure beyond the cubic level is also sketched, following the earlier ${\mathcal N}=1$ superconformal approach of arXiv:2208.07783. Our construction is based on making use of the polar hypermultiplet within the projective-superspace setting.</description>
