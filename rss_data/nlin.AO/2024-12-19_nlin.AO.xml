      <title>Representational Drift and Learning-Induced Stabilization in the Olfactory Cortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain encodes external stimuli through patterns of neural activity, forming internal representations of the world. Recent experiments show that neural representations for a given stimulus change over time. However, the mechanistic origin for the observed "representational drift" (RD) remains unclear. Here, we propose a biologically-realistic computational model of the piriform cortex to study RD in the mammalian olfactory system by combining two mechanisms for the dynamics of synaptic weights at two separate timescales: spontaneous fluctuations on a scale of days and spike-time dependent plasticity (STDP) on a scale of seconds. Our study shows that, while spontaneous fluctuations in synaptic weights induce RD, STDP-based learning during repeated stimulus presentations can reduce it. Our model quantitatively explains recent experiments on RD in the olfactory system and offers a mechanistic explanation for the emergence of drift and its relation to learning, which may be useful to study RD in other brain regions.</description>

      <title>Urban Scaling is hardwired in the human brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging field of the Science of Cities has unveiled previously undiscovered facets of urban life. Contrary to the expectation of chaotic behaviour influenced solely by cultural and geographic factors, cities globally exhibit universal power-law trends in urban scaling. Leveraging recent advances in mathematical descriptions of urban dynamics, this study investigates the interplay among fundamental allometry, fractal dimension, and the number of close contacts within cities. Through a dynamic exploration of these factors, a causal relationship is established, shedding light on the intricate dynamics that shape urban environments. Remarkably, our analysis suggests that the Big Five personality traits play a pivotal role in determining the fractal aspects of urban life. This research contributes to the understanding of urban scaling and proposes a novel connection between human personality traits and the structural patterns observed in cities, opening avenues for further interdisciplinary exploration.</description>

      <title>Consensus formation and relative stimulus perception in quality-sensitive, interdependent agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14856v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of a collective decision-making model inspired by honeybee behavior. This model integrates individual exploration for option discovery and social interactions for information sharing, while also considering option qualities. Our assessment of the decision process outcome employs standard consensus metrics and investigates its correlation with convergence time, revealing common trade-offs between speed and accuracy. Furthermore, we show the model's compliance with Weber's Law of relative stimulus perception, aligning with previous analysis of collective decision problems. Our study also identifies non-equilibrium critical behavior in specific limits of the model, where the highest values of consensus are achieved. This result highlights the intriguing relationship between optimal performance, critically, and the fluctuations caused by finite size effects, often seen in biological systems. Our findings are especially relevant for finite adaptive systems, as they provide insights into navigating decision-making scenarios with similar options more effectively.</description>
