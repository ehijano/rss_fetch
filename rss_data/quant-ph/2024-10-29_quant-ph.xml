      <title>QADL: Prototype of Quantum Architecture Description Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Software (QSW) uses the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically programming quantum bits (qubits) that manipulate quantum gates, to implement quantum computing systems. QSW has become a specialized field of software development, requiring specific notations, languages, patterns, and tools for mapping the behavior of qubits and the structure of quantum gates to components and connectors of QSW architectures. To support declarative modeling of QSW, we aim to enable architecture-driven development, where software engineers can design, program, and evaluate quantum software systems by abstracting complex details through high-level components and connectors. We introduce QADL (Quantum Architecture Description Language), which provides a specification language, design space, and execution environment for architecting QSW. Inspired by classical ADLs, QADL offers (1) a graphical interface to specify and design QSW components, (2) a parser for syntactical correctness, and (3) an execution environment by integrating QADL with IBM Qiskit. The initial evaluation of QADL is based on usability assessments by a team of quantum physicists and software engineers, using quantum algorithms such as Quantum Teleportation and Grover's Search. QADL offers a pioneering specification language and environment for QSW architecture.

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel and efficient scheme to engineer arbitrary (local) many-body Hamiltonians by interleaving the free evolution of a fixed system Hamiltonian with layers of single-qubit Pauli or Clifford gates. These sequences are constructed by solving a linear program (LP) which minimizes the total evolution time. The target Hamiltonians that can be engineered by our method are only limited by the locality of the Pauli terms in the system Hamiltonian. We then construct an efficient relaxation of this LP with a classical runtime that depends on the number of Pauli terms in the Pauli decomposition of the system Hamiltonian and is thus a low-degree polynomial in the number of qubits in practice. With our method, it is also possible to engineer Hamiltonians if only partial knowledge of the system Hamiltonian is available, which can be used to cancel unknown unwanted Pauli terms. We show the classical efficiency of our method by engineering an arbitrary two-body Hamiltonian on a 2D square lattice with $225$ qubits in only $60$ seconds. We also provide numerical simulations of our method modelling an ion trap device with an Ising Hamiltonian and engineering a general Heisenberg Hamiltonian. Moreover, we address dominant error sources in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Method for noise-induced regularization in quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current quantum computing paradigm, significant focus is placed on the reduction or mitigation of quantum decoherence. When designing new quantum processing units, the general objective is to reduce the amount of noise qubits are subject to, and in algorithm design, a large effort is underway to provide scalable error correction or mitigation techniques. Yet some previous work has indicated that certain classes of quantum algorithms, such as quantum machine learning, may, in fact, be intrinsically robust to or even benefit from the presence of a small amount of noise. Here, we demonstrate that noise levels in quantum hardware can be effectively tuned to enhance the ability of quantum neural networks to generalize data, acting akin to regularisation in classical neural networks. As an example, we consider a medical regression task, where, by tuning the noise level in the circuit, we improved the mean squared error loss by 8%.</description>

      <title>Classifying coherence with a finite set of witnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence is a fundamental resource in quantum information processing, which can be certified by a coherence witness. In order to detect all the coherent states, we introduce a useful concept of coherence witness and structure the set of coherence witnesses $C^{d}_{[m,M]}$. We present necessary and sufficient conditions of detecting quantum coherence of $d-$dimensional quantum states based on $C^{d}_{[m,M]}$. Moreover, we show that each coherent state can be detected by one of the coherence witnesses in a finite set. The corresponding finite set of coherence witnesses is presented explicitly, which detects all the coherent states.</description>

      <title>Cavity dark mode mediated by atom array without atomic scattering loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize a ring cavity strongly interacting with an atom array with configurable spatial structures. By preparing the atom array with a maximized structure factor, we observe the emergence of a cavity dark mode, where the standing-wave nodes are dynamically locked to the positions of the atoms. The dark mode is decoupled from the atoms, protecting the system from dissipation through atomic scattering, but still mediates strong coupling and enables efficient conversion between two optical modes. Moreover, we impart an arbitrary large phase shift on the converted optical fields by translating the atom array. This strongly interacting ring cavity system with single-atom addressability opens ways to quantum optical engineering and the generation of photonic quantum states based on the geometrical structure of atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations of nonlinear dynamics in coupled twin spin masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin masers are a prototype nonlinear dynamic system. They undergo a bifurcation at a critical amplification factor, transiting into a limit cycle phase characterized by a Larmor precession around the external bias magnetic field, thereby serving as a key frequency reference for precision measurements. Recently, a system of coupled twin spin masers placed in dual bias magnetic fields, involving simultaneously two intrinsic Larmor frequencies, has been studied. Compared with previous spin masers, this setup exhibits new attractors such as quasi-periodic orbits and chaos in addition to the usual limit cycles and the trivial no signal fixed point. The richer dynamic phases imply the existence of bifurcations, whose nature has not been fully analyzed. Here, to shed light on the nature of the bifurcations, we turn to a closely related system and systematically study the various bifurcations therein along different routes in parameter space. We identify the bifurcations as of the types including pitchfork, Hopf, homoclinic bifurcations, and saddle-node bifurcations of cycles. By both analytical and numerical methods, we reveal how various attractors interplay with each other and change their stability. We also quantitatively evaluate the locations where these bifurcations occur by tracking the both stable and even not easily detected unstable limit cycles. These findings deepen our understanding of the underlying mechanisms resulting in the rich dynamic phases in the coupled twin spin masers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin dynamics induced by feedback under continuous Larmor frequency distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear spin dynamics are essential in exploring nonequilibrium quantum phenomena and have broad applications in precision measurement. Among these systems, the combination of a bias magnetic field and feedback mechanisms can induce self-sustained oscillations at the base Larmor frequency due to nonlinearity. These features have driven the development of single-species and multiple-species spin masers. The latter, with multiple discrete Larmor frequencies, provides significant advantages for precision measurement by mitigating uncertainties in precession frequencies due to long-term drifts in experimental conditions. The self-sustained oscillations of single-species and multiple-species spin masers correspond to limit cycles and quasi-periodic orbits of the stable nonlinear dynamics of the systems respectively; the correspondence is elucidated in a recent study on a related spin system featuring two discrete intrinsic Larmor frequencies under dual bias magnetic fields. Here, we extend the study to the case that the intrinsic Larmor frequencies of individual spins of the system, given rise to by an inhomogeneous bias magnetic field, form a continuum. We show that generically the stable dynamics of the system includes limit cycles, quasi-periodic orbits, and chaos. We establish the relation between the synchronization frequency of limit cycles and the field inhomogeneity and derive an equation determining the stability of limit cycles. Furthermore, detailed characteristics of different dynamical phases, especially the robustness of limit cycles and quasi-periodic orbits against experimental fluctuations, are discussed. Our findings not only encompass the case of discrete Larmor frequencies, but also provide crucial insights for precision measurement and the exploration of continuous time crystals and quasi-crystals.</description>

      <title>Fidelity preserving and decoherence for mixed unitary quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguishable and non-distinguishable quantum states are fundamental resources in quantum mechanics and quantum technologies. Interactions with the environment often induce decoherence, impacting both the distinguishability and non-distinguishability between quantum states. In this paper, we investigate mixed unitary quantum channels and the conditions under which fidelity, a measure of quantum state closeness, is preserved. More precisely, for quantum channels in the form $\Phi(\rho) = \sum_{i=1}^N p_i U_i \rho U_i^*$, we analyze their effect on quantum state $|\varphi\rangle$ through the associated purification $|\Psi\rangle$, explore the structure of such quantum channels that preserve either distinguishable or non-distinguishable states and then discuss the challenges of maintaining fidelity, particularly under the influence of phase damping.</description>

      <title>Controllable single-photon wave packet scattering in two-dimensional waveguide by a giant atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocal interactions between photonic waveguide and giant atoms have attracted extensive attentions. Researchers have studied how to optimize and control quantum states via giant atoms. We here study the dynamical scattering of a single-photon wave packet by a giant atom coupled to a two-dimensional photonic waveguide via multiple spatial points. We show that arbitrary target scattering single-photon wave packets can be generated by adjusting the coupling strength between the giant atom and different lattice sites of the waveguide. Furthermore, the dynamical scattering of the wave packets enables us to study the propagating properties of the target scattering wave packets and observe the excitation of giant atoms. Our study provides alternative way for photon state control based on giant atoms.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of the Bell-type inequalities for four qubit Dicke state using IBM Quantum Processing Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violation of the Bell-type inequalities is very necessary to confirm the existence of the nonlocality in the nonclassical (entangled) states. We have designed a customized operator which is made of the sum of the identity and Pauli matrices ($I$, $\sigma_x$, $\sigma_y$, and $\sigma_z$). We theoretically evaluate the Bell-type violation for the two-qubit Bell state and a four-qubit Dicke state, which gives the Bell-CHSH parameter values $2\sqrt{2}$ and $3.05$, respectively for our customized operator. For experimental implementation, IBM's 127-qubitQuantum Processing Units (QPU) were utilized, where we have applied our customized operator to evaluate Bell-type inequalities for two-qubit Bell state ($\vert\Phi^+\rangle$) and four-qubit Dicke state ($|D^{(2)}_4\rangle$). We observed, for the two-qubit Bell state, the experimental Bell violation was $2.7507\pm 0.0197$. For Dicke state, we found the violation be to $2.1239\pm0.0457$ and $2.2175\pm0.0352$ respectively for two distinct methods of state preparation. All our results show clear violation of the local realism; however, we find that the experimental violation of the Bell state ($2.75$) is close to the theoretical ($2.82$) results due to lower circuit depth in state-preparation as well as fewer measurements, while the Dicke state shows greater errors ($2.12$ and $2.21$ vs. $3.05$) from higher depth and more measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized fusions of photonic quantum states using static linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using numerical simulations, we explore generalized fusion measurements, extending them in three key ways. We incorporate ancilla-boosting and code-boosting to optimize fusion measurements, which may, but do not necessarily, correspond to Bell measurements. For ancilla-boosting beyond Bell measurements, we identify a hierarchy of fusion efficiencies involving up to four single-photon ancillas. From this numerical evidence, we conjecture the efficiencies for a larger number of single-photon ancillas. Interestingly, our findings suggest that achieving unit efficiency is impossible without utilizing entangled ancilla states. Additionally, in the context of code-boosting, we present an example of a global measurement that surpasses the best-known, via transversal Bell measurements achievable efficiency for a small instance of the quantum parity code.</description>

      <title>Upconversion of Phonon Modes into Microwave Photons in a Lithium Niobate Bulk Acoustic Wave Resonator Coupled to a Microwave Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coupling between acoustic vibrations in a lithium niobate bulk acoustic wave resonator and microwave photons of a re-entrant microwave cavity was investigated at a temperature close to 4 K. Coupling was achieved by placing the acoustic resonator in the location of the re-entrant cavity electric field maxima, in a symmetric ``split-post'' configuration, with a large overlap between the microwave field and the acoustic mode, allowing acoustic modulations of the microwave frequency. We show that the acoustic modes in this setup retain large inherent quality factors of greater than $10^6$. A maximum optomechanical coupling rate was determined to be $g_0$ = 0.014 mHz, four orders of magnitude larger than previous results obtained using a quartz BAW at 4 K in a similar experimental setup, but using a single post-re-entrant cavity resonator.</description>

      <title>Efficient Frequency Allocation for Superconducting Quantum Processors Using Improved Optimization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on previous research on frequency allocation optimization for superconducting circuit quantum processors, this work incorporates several new techniques to improve overall solution quality. New features include tightening constraints, imposing edgewise differences, including edge orientation in the optimization, and integrating multimodule designs with various boundary conditions. These enhancements allow for greater flexibility in processor design by eliminating the need for handpicked orientations. We support the efficient assembly of large processors with dense connectivity by choosing the best boundary conditions. Examples demonstrate that, at low computational cost, the new optimization approach finds a frequency configuration for a square chip with over 1,000 qubits and over 10% yield at much larger dispersion levels than required by previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Efficient Circuit Wire Cutting Based on Commuting Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum devices face challenges when dealing with large circuits due to error rates as circuit size and the number of qubits increase. The circuit wire-cutting technique addresses this issue by breaking down a large circuit into smaller, more manageable subcircuits. However, the exponential increase in the number of subcircuits and the complexity of reconstruction as more cuts are made poses a great practical challenge. Inspired by ancilla-assisted quantum process tomography and the MUBs-based grouping technique for simultaneous measurement, we propose a new approach that can reduce subcircuit running overhead. The approach first uses ancillary qubits to transform all quantum input initializations into quantum output measurements. These output measurements are then organized into commuting groups for the purpose of simultaneous measurement, based on MUBs-based grouping. This approach significantly reduces the number of necessary subcircuits as well as the total number of shots. Lastly, we provide numerical experiments to demonstrate the complexity reduction.</description>

      <title>Gain-Loss Coupled Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving oscillations with small dimensions, high power, high coherence, and low phase noise has been a long-standing goal in wave physics, driving innovations across classical electromagnetic theory and quantum physics. Key applications include electronic oscillators, lasers, and spin-torque oscillations. In recent decades, physicists have increasingly focused on harnessing passive oscillatory modes to manipulate these oscillations, leading to the development of diverse gain-loss coupled systems, including photon-photon, exciton-photon, photon-magnon, magnon-phonon, and magnon-magnon couplings. This review provides a comprehensive overview of these systems, exploring their fundamental physical structures, key experimental observations, and theoretical insights. By synthesizing insights from these studies, we propose future research directions to further advance the understanding and application of gain-loss coupled systems for quantum science and quantum technologies. (The field of gain-loss coupled systems is vast. The authors welcome suggestions and feedback from the community to continuously improve this review article until it is published).</description>

      <title>Bidirectional quantum teleportation using quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for bidirectional teleportation of a single qubit using quantum walks on two independent one dimensional lattices and two independent cycles with four vertices, employing nearest neighbor jumps with coin outcomes. In addition, we discuss two different methods for two qubit teleportation by employing nearest neighbor jumps and next nearest neighbor jumps with a single coin and two coins, respectively. Finally, we show that the two qubit single jump quantum walk and the two jump quantum walk teleportation schemes yield the same results.</description>

      <title>Characterizing entangled state update in different reference frames with weak measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the quantum state of a system upon measurement results in state update. In this work, we investigate the characterization of updated states of multi-partite entangled qubit states with non-destructive weak measurements, involving weakly coupling a pointer to each qubit in a relativistic context. As is well-known, the updated state at intermediate times is frame-dependent, and outcome randomness intrinsic to projective measurements prevents any information to be acquired on the updated state. Here we will see that when weak measurements are implemented there is instead an interplay between randomness and interference, depending on the number of qubits, so as to maintain consistency between descriptions in arbitrary reference frames. Analytical results are given for a small or infinite number of qubits, while for a finite number of qubits we will resort to Monte-Carlo sampling in order to simulate numerically the results of weak measurements. As a by-product, we show how a single-shot measurement of the pointers positions allows to make quantitative predictions on the outcomes that can be obtained for any observable measured on a distant qubit of the multi-partite state.</description>

      <title>Certifying classes of $d$-outcome measurements with quantum steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent certification schemes are based on minimal assumptions about the quantum system under study, which makes the most desirable among certification schemes. However, they are often the most challenging to implement. In order to reduce the implementation cost one can consider semi-device-independent schemes such as those based on quantum steering. Here we provide a construction of a family of steering inequalities which are tailored to large classes of $d$-outcomes projective measurements being a certain linear combination of the Heisenberg-Weyl operators on the untrusted side and a fixed set of known measurements on the trusted side. We then prove that the maximal quantum violation of those inequalities can be used for certification of those measurements and the maximally entangled state of two qudits. Importantly, in our self-testing proof, we do not assume the shared state to be pure, nor do we assume the measurements to be projective. We believe that our construction broadens the scope of semi-device-independent certification, paving the way for more general but still less costly quantum certification protocols.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Noise using variants of Unitarity Randomized Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20528v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking of noise that is induced during the implementation of quantum gates is the main concern for practical quantum computers. Several protocols have been proposed that empirically calculate various metrics that quantify the error rates of the quantum gates chosen from a preferred gate set. Unitarity randomized benchmarking (URB) protocol is a method to estimate the coherence of noise induced by the quantum gates which is measured by the metric \textit{unitarity}. In this paper, we for the first time, implement the URB protocol in a quantum simulator with all the parameters and noise model are used from a real quantum device. The direct implementation of the URB protocol in a quantum device is not possible using current technologies, as it requires the preparation of mixed states. To overcome this challenge, we propose a modification of the URB protocol, namely the m-URB protocol, that enables us to practically implement it on any quantum device. We validate our m-URB protocol using two single-qubit noise channels -- (a) depolarising channel and (b) bit-flip channel. We further alter the m-URB protocol, namely, native gate URB or Ng-URB protocol, to study the noise in the native gates into which the quantum circuits are compiled in a quantum computer. Using our Ng-URB protocol, we can also detect the presence of cross-talk errors which are correlated errors caused due to non-local and entangling gates such as CNOT gate. For illustration, we simulate the noise of the native gates taking the noise parameter from two real IBM-Q processors.</description>

      <title>A Path Integral Treatment of Time-dependent Dunkl Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analytical treatment of the path integral formalism for time-dependent quantum systems within the framework of Wigner-Dunkl mechanics, emphasizing systems with varying masses and time-dependent potentials. By employing generalized canonical transformations, we reformulated the path integral to develop an explicit expression for the propagator. This formalism is applied to specific cases, including a Dunkl-harmonic oscillator with time-dependent mass and frequency. Solutions for the Dunkl-Caldirola-Kanai oscillator and a model with a strongly pulsating mass are derived, providing exact propagator expressions and corresponding wave functions. These findings extend the utility of Dunkl operators in quantum mechanics, offering new insights into the dynamics of time-dependent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating and probing many-body quantum states in waveguide-QED systems with giant atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (wQED) with giant atoms provides a distinctive opportunity to study one-dimensional (1D) coupled spin systems through its unique decoherence-free interactions. This study presents a theoretical framework for simulating the diagonal Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper (AAH) model in the context of giant-atom wQED. The proposed scheme employs photonic modes in the waveguide to not only mediate interactions between atoms but also to detect the energy spectrum of the atom array. To illustrate the effectiveness of this approach, we present a simulation of the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum with high precision. Furthermore, for an incommensurate AAH atomic chain, we demonstrate that the photon transmission spectrum can accurately distinguish between the many-body localized phase and the extended phase. The method presented here is also applicable to the simulation of other types of 1D atomic chains based on giant-atom wQED.</description>

      <title>Photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions as a resource for quantum science and technology in cold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon-mediated dipole-dipole interactions arise from atom-light interactions, which are universal and prevalent in a wide range of open quantum systems. This pairwise and long-range spin-exchange interaction results from multiple light scattering among the atoms. A recent surge of interests and progresses in both experiments and theories promises this core mechanism of collective interactions as a resource to study quantum science and to envision next-generation applications in quantum technology. Here we summarize recent developments in both theories and experiments, where we introduce several central theoretical approaches and focus on cooperative light scattering from small sample of free-space atoms, an atom-waveguide coupled interface that hosts the waveguide QED, and topological quantum optical platforms. The aim of this review is to manifest the essential and distinct features of collective dynamics induced by resonant dipole-dipole interactions and to reveal unprecedented opportunities in enhancing the performance or offering new applications in light manipulations, quantum metrology, quantum computations, and light harvesting innovations.</description>

      <title>All-optical measurement-device-free feedforward enabling ultra-fast quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical circuit systems, unlike other systems, have the potential to perform quantum information processing (QIP) at higher clock rate than conventional processing. The approach utilizing the electromagnetic field of light allows deterministic QIP by feedforward process, which counteracts the quantum randomness by performing adaptive quantum operation according to the measurement result of an entangled state. However, conventional feedforward with electronic measurement devices has limited the clock rate of the QIP down to around 100 MHz. In this paper, we demonstrate a variable squeezing gate with a clock rate of 1.3 THz by all-optical measurement-device-free feedforward. We utilize a periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide as an optical parametric amplifier, which eliminates the need for electronic measuring devices and enables ultra-fast feedforward. Experimental results demonstrate that our all-optical QIP operates at a THz clock rate, representing a major step toward a true optical quantum computer which opens the curtain to a new era of ultra-fast information processing.</description>

      <title>Detecting the Chern number via quench dynamics in two independent chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Chern number, as a topological invariant, characterizes the topological features of a 2D system and can be experimentally detected through Hall conductivity. In this work, we investigate the connection between the Chern number and the features of two independent chains. It is shown that there exists a class of 2D systems that can be mapped into two independent chains. We demonstrate that the Chern number is identical to the linking number of two loops, which are abstracted from each chain individually. This allows for the detection of the Chern number via quench dynamics in two independent chains. As an example, the Qi-Wu-Zhang (QWZ) model is employed to illustrate the scheme. Our finding provides a way to measure the phase diagram of a 2D system from the 1D systems.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Reliability Characterizing Systematic Errors in Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing utilize quantum effects, such as entanglement and coherence, to measure physical signals. The performance of a sensing process is characterized by error which requires comparison to a true value. However, in practice, such a true value might be inaccessible. In this study, we utilize quantum reliability as a metric to evaluate quantum sensor's performance based solely on the apparatus itself, without any prior knowledge of true value. We derive a general relationship among reliability, sensitivity, and systematic error, and demonstrate this relationship using a typical quantum sensing process. That is to measure magnetic fields (as a signal) by a spin-$1/2$ particle and using the Stern-Gerlach apparatus to read out the signal information. Our findings illustrate the application of quantum reliability in quantum sensing, opening new perspectives for reliability analysis in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Maneuvering measurement-coherence into measurement-entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum coherence, fundamental to the distinct behavior of quantum systems, serves as a static resource in both quantum states and measurements, the latter termed measurement-coherence. Previous studies have established the conversion of static quantum coherence into entanglement for states and measurements, and the conversion from coherence generating power to entanglement-generating power in quantum dynamics. In this work, we extend this framework by demonstrating that a quantum channel's measurement-coherence generating power can also be converted to measurement-entanglement generating power without requiring additional measurement-coherence. This result completes the coherence-to-entanglement conversion picture at the dynamical level, incorporating the static cases. We formulate resource theories for both measurement-coherence and measurement-entanglement generating powers, and elucidate the structure of incoherent measurements to facilitate our investigation into measurement-coherence generating powers. Furthermore, we establish that a quantum channel's coherence generating power is equivalent to the measurement-coherence generating power of its adjoint map, with a corresponding, though weaker, relation for quantum entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years there have emerged various ideas to create and control topological excitations in superconducting devices. Notably, nontrivial Chern bands were predicted to exist in conventional multiterminal Josephson junctions, but the Chern number is yet to be experimentally verified, and the pathway towards feasible quantum hardware applications is unclear. Here we show how generic multiterminal circuits can be expressed as gyrator networks with quantized gyration conductance, giving rise to anyonic excitations carrying $q/p$ fractional fluxes ($q,p$ integer), measurable via a fractional Aharonov-Casher phase. The magnitude of interactions between the anyons depends on the flatness of the topological bands, prompting us to investigate circuit-specific band-engineering techniques. Circular scattering in three-terminal quantum dot chains gives rise to a flat topological ground state, where disorder mitigates Chern number fluctuations and the quasiparticle continuum provides a work-around for known limitations to create nontrivial flat bands. Further band-engineering strategies are presented where the superconducting phase is scrambled either via parallelization or dissipative phase transitions. We provide concepts for error correction protocols, and quantum simulations of interacting fermionic (or generally anyonic) many-body systems -- notably, introducing the possibility to mimic fractional quantum Hall physics or to implement local fermionic models that explicitly break the Wigner superselection rule. The latter indicates that a full understanding of multiterminal circuits will require grappling with a virtually unexplored class of parity-breaking quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The procedure for simulating the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum linked to the spin system of a molecule for a certain nucleus entails diagonalizing the associated Hamiltonian matrix. As the dimensions of said matrix grow exponentially with respect to the spin system's atom count, the calculation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors marks the performance of the overall process. The aim of this paper is to provide a formalization of the complete procedure of the simulation of a spin system's NMR spectrum while also explaining how to diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix with a quantum computer, thus enhancing the overall process's performance. Two well-known quantum algorithms for calculating the eigenvalues of a matrix are analyzed and put to the test in this context: quantum phase estimation and the variational quantum eigensolver. Additionally, we present simulated results for the later approach while also addressing the hypothetical noise found in a physical quantum computer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipationless localized bound states of open quantum systems are significantly robust to decoherence and have potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, the decoherence dynamics and dissipationless localized bound states of a two-mode open quantum system are investigated. The conditions for the emergence of dissipationless localized bound states are analytically solved, and the corresponding critical system-environment couplings under different values of the inter-mode coupling and the detuning are determined. The decoherence dynamics of the system under such conditions are analyzed and dissipationless coherence between the different localized bound states against decoherence is clearly shown. This may provide a new avenue to develop dissipationless quantum technology for quantum operations.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, quantum computation has been rapidly advancing, driving a technological revolution with significant potential across various sectors, particularly in finance. Despite this, the insurance industry, an essential tool for mitigating unforeseen risks and losses, has received limited attention. This paper provides an initial exploration into the realm of quantum computational insurance and actuarial science. After introducing key insurance models and challenges, we examine quantum algorithms designed to address complex insurance issues. Our study includes experimental and numerical demonstrations of quantum applications in non-life insurance, life insurance, and reinsurance. Additionally, we explore the timeline for quantum insurance, the development of quantum-enhanced insurance products, and the challenges posed by quantum computational advancements.</description>

Abstract: The negatively-charged nitrogen vacancy (NV$^{-}$) center in diamond is widely used for quantum sensing since the sensitivity of the spin triplet in the electronic ground state to external perturbations such as strain and electromagnetic fields make it an excellent probe for changes in these perturbations. The spin state can be measured through optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR), which is most commonly achieved by detecting the photoluminescence (PL) after exciting the spin-triplet transition. Recently, methods have been proposed and demonstrated that use the absorption of the infrared singlet transition at 1042 nm instead. These methods however require cryogenic temperatures or external cavities to enhance the absorption signal. Here, we report on our optimization efforts of the magnetometer sensitivity at room temperature and without cavities. We reach sensitivities of 18 pT$/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, surpassing previously reported values. We also report on a defect that is native to CVD-grown diamond and thus absent in HPHT diamond, the excitation of which impacts the measured singlet absorption signal.</description>

      <title>Geometric-Like imaginarity: quantification and state conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the perspective of resource-theoretic approach, this study explores the quantification of imaginary in quantum physics. We propose a well defined measure of imaginarity, the geometric-like measure of imaginarity. Compared with the usual geometric imaginarity measure, this geometric-like measure of imaginarity exhibits smaller decay difference under quantum noisy channels and higher stability. As applications, we show that both the optimal probability of state transformations from a pure state to an arbitrary mixed state via real operations, and the maximal probability of stochastic-approximate state transformations from a pure state to an arbitrary mixed state via real operations with a given fidelity $f$, are given by the geometric-like measure of imaginarity.</description>

      <title>Decoherence rate expression due to air molecule scattering in spatial qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a solution for decoherence in spatial superpositions due to scattering/collision with air molecules. This result reproduces the short- and long-wavelength limits known in the literature. We compare the decoherence rate with several existing interpolations in the literature and evaluate the decoherence rate and experimental parameters when creating macroscopic quantum spatial superpositions (i.e., micron-size spheres). Finally, we consider the decoherence rate's time dependence while creating and closing the spatial superposition in an interferometer setup.</description>

      <title>Improved separation between quantum and classical computers for sampling and functional tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper furthers existing evidence that quantum computers are capable of computations beyond classical computers. Specifically, we strengthen the collapse of the polynomial hierarchy to the second level if: (i) Quantum computers with postselection are as powerful as classical computers with postselection ($\mathsf{PostBQP=PostBPP}$), (ii) any one of several quantum sampling experiments ($\mathsf{BosonSampling}$, $\mathsf{IQP}$, $\mathsf{DQC1}$) can be approximately performed by a classical computer (contingent on existing assumptions). This last result implies that if any of these experiment's hardness conjectures hold, then quantum computers can implement functions classical computers cannot ($\mathsf{FBQP\neq FBPP}$) unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its 2nd level. These results are an improvement over previous work which either achieved a collapse to the third level or were concerned with exact sampling, a physically impractical case.
  The workhorse of these results is a new technical complexity-theoretic result which we believe could have value beyond quantum computation. In particular, we prove that if there exists an equivalence between problems solvable with an exact counting oracle and problems solvable with an approximate counting oracle, then the polynomial hierarchy collapses to its second level, indeed to $\mathsf{ZPP^{NP}}$.</description>

      <title>State Swapping via Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prediction of non-local phenomena is a key attribute of quantum mechanics that distinguishes it from classical theories. It was recently suggested that state swapping is one such effect that a fundamentally classical gravitational field cannot give rise to. The reasoning was that the phenomenology of classical fields is restricted to Local Operations and Classical Communication~(LOCC) whereas swapping is a non-LOCC effect, so gravity must not be a classical channel if it can give rise to such a phenomenon. Here, we show that the Hamiltonian of semiclassical gravity results in an evolution of coherent states that is virtually indistinguishable from swapping them, both theoretically and experimentally. Our results indicate that drawing a definitive conclusion about the nature of gravity based solely on its ability to swap a pair of coherent states would be premature. We discuss the implications of these results regarding proposed experimental tests for the quantum nature of gravity and clarify some conceptual issues.</description>

      <title>Effect of environment-induced interatomic interaction on entanglement generation for uniformly accelerated atoms with a boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering environment-induced interatomic interaction, we study the entanglement dynamics of two uniformly accelerated atoms interact with fluctuating massless scalar fields in the Minkowski vacuum with the presence of a reflecting boundary. The two atoms are initially prepared in a state such that one is in the ground state and other is in the excited state, which is separable. When the acceleration is small, the rate of entanglement generation at the initial time and the maximum of concurrence generated during evolution oscillate with the distance between the atoms and the boundary before reaching a stable value, and may decrease non-monotonically with the acceleration, which means that the anti-Unruh phenomenon can exist for some situation even when environmental considerations are taken into account. The results show that there exists the competition of the vacuum fluctuations caused by the boundary and the acceleration. In addition, the time evolution of concurrence will not be affected by the environment-induced interatomic interaction in some conditions. For a larger acceleration, when the environment-induced interatomic interaction is considered, the concurrence may disappear later compared with the result when the environment-induced interatomic interaction is neglected.</description>

      <title>Robustness and Generalization in Quantum Reinforcement Learning via Lipschitz Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning leverages quantum computing to enhance accuracy and reduce model complexity compared to classical approaches, promising significant advancements in various fields. Within this domain, quantum reinforcement learning has garnered attention, often realized using variational quantum circuits to approximate the policy function. This paper addresses the robustness and generalization of quantum reinforcement learning by combining principles from quantum computing and control theory. Leveraging recent results on robust quantum machine learning, we utilize Lipschitz bounds to propose a regularized version of a quantum policy gradient approach, named the RegQPG algorithm. We show that training with RegQPG improves the robustness and generalization of the resulting policies. Furthermore, we introduce an algorithmic variant that incorporates curriculum learning, which minimizes failures during training. Our findings are validated through numerical experiments, demonstrating the practical benefits of our approach.</description>

      <title>Quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering in magnon frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant progress has been made for the emerging concept of magnon frequency comb (MFC) but mainly in the classical region. The quantum property of the comb structure is yet to be explored. Here we theoretically investigate the quantum fluctuations of frequency combs and demonstrate the continuous-variable quantum entanglement and Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering between different teeth of MFC. Without loss of generality, we address this issue in a hybrid magnon-skyrmion system. We observe a strong two-mode squeezed entanglement and asymmetric steering between the sum- and difference-frequency magnon teeth mediated by the skyrmion that acts as an effective reservoir to cool the Bogoliubov mode delocalized over the first-order magnon pair in MFC. Our findings show the prominent quantum nature of MFC, which has the potential to be utilized in ultrafast quantum metrology and multi-task quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel coding: Approximation algorithms and strong converse exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study relaxations of entanglement-assisted quantum channel coding and establish that non-signaling assistance and the meta-converse are equivalent in terms of success probabilities. We then present a rounding procedure that transforms any non-signaling-assisted strategy into an entanglement-assisted one and prove an approximation ratio of $(1 - e^{-1})$ in success probabilities for the special case of measurement channels. For fully quantum channels, we give a weaker (dimension dependent) approximation ratio, that is nevertheless still tight to characterize the strong converse exponent of entanglement-assisted channel coding [Li and Yao, arXiv:2209.00555]. Our derivations leverage ideas from position-based decoding, quantum decoupling theorems, the matrix Chernoff inequality, and input flattening techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore a new approach to designing both algorithms and error detection codes for preparing approximate ground states of molecules. We propose a classical algorithm to find the optimal stabilizer state by using excitations of the Hartree-Fock state, followed by constructing quantum error-detection codes based on this stabilizer state using codeword-stabilized codes. Through various numerical experiments, we confirm that our method finds the best stabilizer approximations to the true ground states of molecules up to 36 qubits in size. Additionally, we construct generalized stabilizer states that offer a better approximation to the true ground states. Furthermore, for a simple noise model, we demonstrate that both the stabilizer and (some) generalized stabilizer states can be prepared with higher fidelity using the error-detection codes we construct. Our work represents a promising step toward designing algorithms for early fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum magic dynamics in random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic refers to the degree of "quantumness" in a system that cannot be fully described by stabilizer states and Clifford operations alone. In quantum computing, stabilizer states and Clifford operations can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, even though they may appear complicated from the perspective of entanglement. In this sense, magic is a crucial resource for unlocking the unique computational power of quantum computers to address problems that are classically intractable. Magic can be quantified by measures such as Wigner negativity and mana that satisfy fundamental properties such as monotonicity under Clifford operations. In this paper, we generalize the statistical mechanical mapping methods of random circuits to the calculation of Renyi Wigner negativity and mana. Based on this, we find: (1) a precise formula describing the competition between magic and entanglement in many-body states prepared under Haar random circuits; (2) a formula describing the the spreading and scrambling of magic in states evolved under random Clifford circuits; (3) a quantitative description of magic "squeezing" and "teleportation" under measurements. Finally, we comment on the relation between coherent information and magic.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the 1d XY model on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of quantum computing has grown fast in recent years, both in theoretical advancements and the practical construction of quantum computers. These computers were initially proposed, among other reasons, to efficiently simulate and comprehend the complexities of quantum physics. In this paper, we present the comprehensive scheme for the exact simulation of the 1-D XY model on a quantum computer. We successfully diagonalize the proposed Hamiltonian, enabling access to the complete energy spectrum. Furthermore, we propose a novel approach to design a quantum circuit to perform exact time evolution. Among all the possibilities this opens, we compute the ground and excited state energies for the symmetric XY model with spin chains of n=4 and n=8 spins. Further, we calculate the expected value of transverse magnetization for the ground state in the transverse Ising model. Both studies allow the observation of a quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a paramagnetic state. Additionally, we have simulated the time evolution of the state all spins up in the transverse Ising model. The scalability and high performance of our algorithm make it an ideal candidate for benchmarking purposes, while also laying the foundation for simulating other integrable models on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Microscale Sensing with Strongly Interacting NV Ensembles at High Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21182v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in sensing devices that utilize NV center ensembles in diamond are driving progress in microscale nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Utilizing quantum sensing techniques in the high-field regime significantly boosts sensitivity by increasing thermal polarization, and improve spectral quality via enhanced energy shifts. Compatible with the latter, a straightforward manner to further raise sensor sensitivity is to increase NV concentration; although, this intensifies detrimental dipole-dipole interactions among NVs. In this work, we present a method for detecting NMR signals in high-field scenarios while effectively suppressing dipole-dipole couplings in the NV ensemble. Thus, this approach enhances sensitivity by combining highly doped diamond substrates and elevated magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Improving BB84 Efficiency with Delayed Measurement via Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel modification to the BB84 Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocol, aimed at enhancing its efficiency through the use of quantum memory and delayed measurement. In the standard BB84 protocol, the receiver immediately measures the qubits sent by the sender using randomly chosen bases. Due to mismatches between the sender and receiver's bases, a significant portion of the qubits are discarded, reducing the overall key generation rate. Our proposed protocol allows the receiver to store the received qubits in quantum memory and defer measurement until after the sender reveals her basis choices, effectively eliminating the need to discard mismatched qubits. This modification improves the key generation efficiency while maintaining the core security features of the standard BB84 protocol. By avoiding the unnecessary loss of qubits, our protocol achieves a higher secret key rate without introducing additional vulnerabilities. We present a detailed step-by-step explanation of the delayed measurement process. Although this approach does not alter the security guarantees of BB84, it represents a significant improvement in efficiency, making the protocol more viable for large-scale quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Sample-Optimal Quantum Estimators for Pure-State Trace Distance and Fidelity via Samplizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trace distance and infidelity (induced by square root fidelity), as basic measures of the closeness of quantum states, are commonly used in quantum state discrimination, certification, and tomography. However, the sample complexity for their estimation still remains open. In this paper, we solve this problem for pure states. We present a quantum algorithm that estimates the trace distance and square root fidelity between pure states to within additive error $\varepsilon$, given sample access to their identical copies. Our algorithm achieves the optimal sample complexity $\Theta(1/\varepsilon^2)$, improving the long-standing folklore $O(1/\varepsilon^4)$. Our algorithm is composed of a samplized phase estimation of the product of two Householder reflections. Notably, an improved (multi-)samplizer for pure states is used as an algorithmic tool in our construction, through which any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to the reflection operator about a pure state $|\psi\rangle$ can be converted to a $\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum sample algorithm using $\Theta(Q^2/\delta)$ samples of $|\psi\rangle$. This samplizer for pure states is shown to be optimal.</description>

      <title>Simple analytical model describing the collective nonlinear response of an ensemble of two-level emitters weakly coupled to a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model and investigate the collective nonlinear optical response of an ensemble of two-level emitters that are weakly coupled to a single-mode waveguide. Our approach generalizes the insight that photon-photon correlations in the light scattered by a single two-level emitter result from two-photon interference to the case of many emitters. Using our model, we study different configurations for probing the nonlinear response of the ensemble, e.g., through the waveguide or via external illumination, and derive analytical expressions for the second-order quantum coherence function, $g^{(2)}(\tau)$, as well as for the squeezing spectrum of the output light in the waveguide, $S_\theta(\omega)$. For the transmission of resonant guided light, we recover the same predictions as previously made with far more involved theoretical models when analyzing experimental results regarding $g^{(2)}(\tau)$ (Prasad et al. [1]) and $S_\theta(\omega)$ (Hinney et al. [2]). We also study the transmission of light that is detuned from the transition of the two-level emitter, a situation that we recently studied experimentally (Cordier et al. [3]). Our model predictions show how the collectively enhanced nonlinear response of weakly coupled emitters can be harnessed to generate non-classical states of light using ensembles ranging from a few to many emitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation and performance analysis of a portable, rack-mounted standalone warm vapor quantum memory system, that also includes the laser package, control electronics and data processing hardware. The optical memory is based on long-lived hyperfine ground states of Cesium which are connected to an excited state via the $D_1$ line at 895 nm in a $\Lambda$-configuration. The memory is operated with weak coherent pulses containing on average $&lt;1$ photons per pulse. The long-term stability of the memory efficiency and storage fidelity is demonstrated at the single-photon level together with operation in a non-laboratory environment.</description>

      <title>Noise robustness and threshold of many-body quantum magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding quantum magic (i.e., nonstabilizerness) in many-body quantum systems is challenging but essential to the study of quantum computation and many-body physics. We investigate how noise affects magic properties in entangled many-body quantum states by quantitatively examining the magic decay under noise, with a primary aim being to understand the stability of magic associated with different kinds of entanglement structures. As a standard model, we study hypergraph states, a representative class of many-body magic states, subject to depolarizing noise. First, we show that interactions facilitated by high-degree gates are fragile to noise. In particular, the $\mathrm{C}^{n-1}Z$ state family exhibits a vanishing magic threshold of $\Theta(1/n)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate efficiently preparable families of hypergraph states without local magic but with a non-vanishing magic threshold which signifies robust magic that is entirely embedded in global entanglement. We also discuss the qudit case based on the discrete Wigner formalism.</description>

      <title>RE-completeness of entangled constraint satisfaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) are a natural class of decision problems where one must decide whether there is an assignment to variables that satisfies a given formula. Schaefer's dichotomy theorem, and its extension to all alphabets due to Bulatov and Zhuk, shows that CSP languages are either efficiently decidable, or NP-complete. It is possible to extend CSP languages to quantum assignments using the formalism of nonlocal games. Due to the equality of complexity classes MIP$^\ast=$ RE, general succinctly-presented entangled CSPs become RE-complete. In this work, we show that a wide range of NP-complete CSPs become RE-complete in this setting, including all boolean CSPs, such as 3SAT, and all CSPs with two variables per constraint ($2$-CSPs), such as $k$-colouring. This also implies that these CSP languages remain undecidable even when not succinctly presented.
  To show this, we work in the weighted algebra framework introduced by Mastel and Slofstra, where synchronous strategies for a nonlocal game are represented by tracial states on an algebra. Along the way, we improve the subdivision technique in order to be able to separate constraints in the CSP while preserving constant soundness, and we show a variety of relations between the different ways of presenting CSPs as games. In particular, we show that all $2$-CSP games are oracularizable, wherein the two players' operators for questions asked at the same time must commute for a perfect strategy.</description>

      <title>Shot-noise reduction for lattice Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently estimating energy expectation values of lattice Hamiltonians on quantum computers is a serious challenge, where established techniques can require excessive sample numbers. Here we introduce geometric partitioning as a scalable alternative. It splits the Hamiltonian into subsystems that extend over multiple lattice sites, for which transformations between their local eigenbasis and the computational basis can be efficiently found. This allows us to reduce the number of measurements as we sample from a more concentrated distribution without diagonalizing the problem. For systems in an energy eigenstate, we prove a lower bound on the sampling number improvement over the "naive" mutually commuting local operator grouping, which grows with the considered subsystem size, consistently showing an advantage for our geometric partitioning strategy. Notably, our lower bounds do not decrease but increase for more correlated states (Theorem 1). For states that are weakly isotropically perturbed around an eigenstate, we show how the sampling number improvement translates to imperfect eigenstate improvements, namely measuring close to the true eigenbasis already for smaller perturbations (Theorem 2). We illustrate our findings on multiple two-dimensional lattice models incl. the transverse field XY- and Ising model as well as the Fermi Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) aims to extract noise-robust features from a data set by examining the number and persistence of holes in its topology. We show that a computational problem closely related to a core task in TDA -- determining whether a given hole persists across different length scales -- is $\mathsf{BQP}_1$-hard and contained in $\mathsf{BQP}$. This result implies an exponential quantum speedup for this problem under standard complexity-theoretic assumptions. Our approach relies on encoding the persistence of a hole in a variant of the guided sparse Hamiltonian problem, where the guiding state is constructed from a harmonic representative of the hole.</description>

      <title>Pseudochaotic Many-Body Dynamics as a Pseudorandom State Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics in quantum simulations, namely 'pseudochaotic dynamics,' which generates computationally indistinguishable states from Haar-random states within the limited access to the measurement outcomes and runtime of quantum computations. While it is not chaotic, a defining characteristics of many-body quantum chaos, namely out-of-time-ordered correlators, fail to differentiate the pseudochaotic dynamics from chaotic one. We systematically construct such pseudochaotic unitary evolution and investigate their nature through extensive numerical and analytic calculations. Remarkably, we show that the pseudochaotic dynamics can generate a representative pseudo-quantum state, specifically a random subset-phase state, from initial computational states with a depth tightly bound by polylog(n) with the system size n, which opens up a practical route to realize pseudorandom states in near term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19747v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Tensor Train Multiplication (TTM) algorithm for the elementwise multiplication of two tensor trains with bond dimension $\chi$. The computational complexity and memory requirements of the TTM algorithm scale as $\chi^3$ and $\chi^2$, respectively. This represents a significant improvement compared with the conventional approach, where the computational complexity scales as $\chi^4$ and memory requirements scale as $\chi^3$.We benchmark the TTM algorithm using flows obtained from artificial turbulence generation and numerically demonstrate its improved runtime and memory scaling compared with the conventional approach. The TTM algorithm paves the way towards GPU accelerated tensor network simulations of computational fluid dynamics problems with large bond dimensions due to its dramatic improvement in memory scaling.</description>

      <title>Thermal cycling -- evidence for a generalized tunneling model and a tool to distinguish noise sources in quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural two level systems (TLSs) ubiquitous in amorphous solids are dramatically sensitive to thermal cycling to about $20$K and then back to low temperature, a process upon which the excitation energy of most TLSs is significantly changed. Using Monte Carlo simulations we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not contained within the standard tunneling model, but is well explained by a model that includes an additional set of TLSs that are pseudo-gapped at low energies, yet possess strong strain interaction through which they generate significant dynamical disorder upon thermal cycling. Our results give support for the general applicability of the Two-TLS model to amorphous solids at low temperatures, in that nearing our understanding of the low-temperature universality of phonon attenuation in amorphous solids. Further, we suggest thermal cycling as a unique protocol to distinguish TLS noise from other noise sources in quantum circuits.</description>

Abstract: Rovibrational energies, wave functions, and Raman transition moments are reported for the lowest-energy states of the H$_3^+$ molecular ion including the magnetic couplings of the proton spins and molecular rotation in the presence of a weak external magnetic field. The rovibrational-hyperfine-Zeeman Hamiltonian matrix is constructed and diagonalized using the rovibrational eigenstates and the proton spin functions. The developed methodology can be used to compute hyperfine-Zeeman effects also for higher-energy rovibrational excitations of H$_3^+$ and other polyatomic molecules. These developments will guide future experiments extending quantum logic spectroscopy to polyatomic systems.</description>

      <title>A Photonic Crystal Receiver for Rydberg Atom-Based Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom-based sensors use atoms dressed by lasers to detect and measure radio frequency electromagnetic fields. The absorptive properties of the atomic gas, configured as a Rydberg atom-based sensor, change in the presence of a radio frequency electromagnetic field. While these sensors are reasonably sensitive, the best conventional radio frequency sensors still outperform Rydberg atom-based sensors with respect to sensitivity. One approach to increase the sensitivity of Rydberg atom-based sensors is to engineer the vapor cell that contains the atomic gas. In this work, we introduce a passive, all-dielectric amplifier integrated into a Rydberg atom-based sensor vapor cell. The vapor cell is a combination of a slot waveguide and a photonic crystal. The structural features of the vapor cell yield a power amplification of ~24 dB. The radio frequency electromagnetic field is coupled adiabatically into the slot waveguide and slowed to increase the interaction between the radio frequency field and the atoms to effectively amplify the incoming signal, i.e., increase the Rabi frequency on the radio frequency transition. The work shows the utility of vapor cell engineering for atom-based quantum technologies and paves the way for other such devices.</description>

      <title>The Communication Complexity of Approximating Matrix Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fully determine the communication complexity of approximating matrix rank, over any finite field $\mathbb{F}$. We study the most general version of this problem, where $0\leq r&lt;R\leq n$ are given integers, Alice and Bob's inputs are matrices $A,B\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$, respectively, and they need to distinguish between the cases $\mathrm{rk}(A+B)=r$ and $\mathrm{rk}(A+B)=R$. We show that this problem has randomized communication complexity $\Omega(1+r^{2}\log|\mathbb{F}|)$. This is optimal in a strong sense because $O(1+r^{2}\log|\mathbb{F}|)$ communication is sufficient to determine, for arbitrary $A,B$, whether $\mathrm{rk}(A+B)\leq r$. Prior to our work, lower bounds were known only for consecutive integers $r$ and $R$, with no implication for the approximation of matrix rank. Our lower bound holds even for quantum protocols and even for error probability $\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}|\mathbb{F}|^{-r/3}$, which too is virtually optimal because the problem has a two-bit classical protocol with error $\frac{1}{2}-\Theta(|\mathbb{F}|^{-r})$.
  As an application, we obtain an $\Omega(\frac{1}{k}\cdot n^{2}\log|\mathbb{F}|)$ space lower bound for any streaming algorithm with $k$ passes that approximates the rank of an input matrix $M\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times n}$ within a factor of $\sqrt{2}-\delta$, for any $\delta&gt;0$. Our result is an exponential improvement in $k$ over previous work.
  We also settle the randomized and quantum communication complexity of several other linear-algebraic problems, for all settings of parameters. This includes the determinant problem (given matrices $A$ and $B$, distinguish between the cases $\mathrm{det}(A+B)=a$ and $\mathrm{det}(A+B)=b$, for fixed field elements $a\ne b)$ and the subspace sum and subspace intersection problem (given subspaces $S$ and $T$ of known dimensions $m$ and $\ell$, respectively, approximate the dimensions of $S+T$ and $S\cap T$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present new solutions of the non-linear Schr\"oodinger equation proposed by Nobre, Rego-Monteiro and Tsallis for the free particle, obtained from different Lie symmetry reductions. Analytical expressions for the wave function, the auxiliary field and the probability density are derived using a variety of approaches. Solutions involving elliptic functions, Bessel and modified Bessel functions, as well as the inverse error function are found, amongst others. On the other hand, a closed-form expression for the general solution of the traveling wave ansatz (see Bountis and Nobre) is obtained for any real value of the nonlinearity index. This is achieved through the use of the so-called generalized trigonometric functions as defined by Lindqvist and Dr\'abek, the utility of which in analyzing the equation under study is highlighted throughout the paper.</description>

      <title>Characterization of $n$-Dimensional Toric and Burst-Error-Correcting Quantum Codes from Lattice Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for the development of any scalable quantum computer. In this work we introduce a generalization of a quantum interleaving method for combating clusters of errors in toric quantum error-correcting codes. We present new $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes, where $n\geq 5$, which are featured by lattice codes and apply the proposed quantum interleaving method to such new $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes. Through the application of this method to these novel $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes we derive new $n$-dimensional quantum burst-error-correcting codes. Consequently, $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes and burst-error-correcting quantum codes are provided offering both a good code rate and a significant coding gain when it comes to toric quantum codes. Another important consequence from the presented $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes is that if the Golomb and Welch conjecture in \cite{perfcodes} regarding the Lee sphere in $n$ dimensions for the respective close packings holds true, then it follows that these $n$-dimensional toric quantum codes are the only possible ones to be obtained from lattice codes. Moreover, such a methodology can be applied for burst error correction in cases involving localized errors, quantum data storage and quantum channels with memory.</description>

      <title>New MiniBooNE excess interpretation using Pseudo-Hermitian neutrino oscillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The excess observed in the MiniBooNE experiment data has been confirmed by several data-releases and analysis. And several attempts to explain such excess are proposed in the litterature using approaches ranging from experimental error to new neutrino theories. None of the attempts seem to fully account for the observed excess. In this paper, we present a new approach this case using a non standard two flavor oscillation theory. In recent years, there is a raising interest in the pseudo-hermitian hamiltonian theories and their impact on several quantum phenomena. The neutrino oscillation is modified using the approach of PT-pseudo hermitian oscillation by having zero-distance effect and asymmetry of the probability of appearance of specific flavors. Such effects can account according to this study for the excess and has a better fit to the data than the best found fit in the standard oscillation framework. We present in this paper the study of the fit of MiniBooNE data the this new oscillation model and its premise.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from a solution of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct [lift] a solution of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Furthermore we show that operators constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions satisfy these constraints as well.</description>

      <title>An approximation of the $S$ matrix for solving the Marchenko equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20409v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present a new approximation of the $S$-matrix dependence on momentum $q$, formulated as a sum of a rational function and a truncated Sinc series. This approach enables pointwise determination of the $S$ matrix with specified resolution, capturing essential features such as resonance behavior with high accuracy. The resulting approximation provides a separable kernel for the Marchenko equation (fixed-$l$ inversion), reducing it to a system of linear equations for the expansion coefficients of the output kernel. Numerical results demonstrate good convergence of this method, applicable to both unitary and non-unitary $S$ matrices. Convergence is further validated through comparisons with an exactly solvable square-well potential model. The method is applied to analyze $S_{31}$ $\pi N$ scattering data.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on epitaxial InGaP for quantum and nonlinear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optical materials are essential for the development of both nonlinear and quantum optics and have advanced recently from bulk crystals to integrated material platforms. In this Perspective, we provide an overview of the emerging InGaP $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinear integrated photonics platform and its experimental achievements. With its exceptional $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity and low optical losses, the epitaxial InGaP platform significantly enhances a wide range of second-order nonlinear optical effects, from second-harmonic generation to entangled photon pair sources, achieving efficiencies several orders of magnitude beyond the current state of the art. Moreover, the InGaP platform enables quantum nonlinear optics at the few- and single-photon levels via passive nonlinearities, which has broad implications for quantum information processing and quantum networking. We also examine the current limitations of the InGaP platform and propose potential solutions to fully unlock its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Equivalence in virtual transitions between uniformly accelerated and static atoms: from a bird's eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the prospect of equivalence principle at the quantum regime by investigating the transition probabilities of a two-level atomic detector in different scenarios. In particular, two specific set-ups are considered. ($i$) {\it Without a boundary}: In one scenario the atom is in uniform acceleration and interacting with Minkowski field modes. While in the other the atom is static and in interaction with Rindler field modes. ($ii$) {\it With a reflecting boundary}: In one scenario the atom is uniformly accelerated and the mirror is static, and in the other scenario the atom is static and the mirror is in uniform acceleration. In these cases the atom is interacting with the field modes, defined in mirror's frame. For both the set-ups, the focus is on the excitation and de-excitation probabilities in $(1+1)$ and $(3+1)$ spacetime dimensions. Our observations affirm that in $(1+1)$ dimensions, for both set-ups the transition probabilities from different scenarios become the same when the atomic and the field frequencies are equal. In contrast, in $(3+1)$ dimensions this equivalence is not observed in general, inspiring us to look for a deeper physical interpretation. Our findings suggest that when the equivalence between different scenarios is concerned, the excitation to de-excitation ratio provides a more consistent measure even in $(3+1)$ dimensions. We discuss the physical interpretation and implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>

      <title>Transforming optimization problems into a QUBO form: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Practically relevant problems of quadratic optimization often contain multidimensional arrays of variables interconnected by linear constraints, such as equalities and inequalities. The values of each variable depend on its specific meaning and can be binary, integer, discrete, and continuous. These circumstances make it technically difficult to reduce the original problem statement to the QUBO form. The paper identifies and considers three main transformations of the original problem statement, namely, the transition from a multidimensional to a one-dimensional array of variables, the transition in mixed problems to binary variables, and the inclusion of linear constraints in the objective function in the form of quadratic penalties. Convenient formulas for calculations are presented and proven, simplifying the implementation of these transformations. In particular, the formulas for the transition in the problem statement from a multidimensional to a one-dimensional array of variables are based on the use of the Kronecker product of matrices. The considered transformations are illustrated by numerous examples.</description>

      <title>Minisuperspace model of quantum geometrodynamics in the Madelung-Bohm formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An analogy between non-relativistic quantum mechanics in the Madelung formulation and quantum geometrodynamics in the case of the maximally symmetric space is drawn. The equations equivalent to the continuity equation and the hydrodynamic Euler equation describing the evolution of the velocity introduced for the case of hypothetical fluid flow characterizing the cosmological system are obtained. It is shown that the perfect nature of the fluid is broken by the quantum Bohm potential. The quantum potential is calculated in semi-classical approximation for different forces acting in the system both in standard quantum mechanics and in minisuperspace model of quantum geometrodynamics. The explicit dependences of the cosmic scale factor on the conformal time, which take into account the quantum additive, are found for empty space with spatial curvature and for a spatially flat universe with dust and radiation.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of Quantum Strings by Edge Defect in Kagome Rydberg Atom Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers can grab particles with their laser beam fingers, so these tiny point objects can be moved by using the laser light. However, manipulation of topological defects, especially higher-dimension ones becomes extremely difficult because they usually require non-local operation involving a great deal of operators, e.g. string operator. Here, using a large-scale quantum Monte Carlo method, we demonstrate the quantum string excitation can be grabbed in the Kagome Rydberg atom array with well-designed edges. After inserting an edge defect, the fractional charge at one end of the string is found to be pinned, allowing the quantum string to be manipulated. Since the quantum string is directed, its quantum fluctuations can be clearly observed due to the movement of the dangling fractional charge at the other end. Then, we can drag the two ends of the string in opposite directions, which is analogous to the separation of a quark-anti-quark pair connected by a gluon string. As the separation distance increases, the quantum fluctuations of the string are strongly suppressed. Eventually, a string-breaking phenomenon occurs. However, if both edge defects are located on the same side, the strings are always broken because both dangling fractional charges take the same gauge charge and can not annihilate each other into the vacuum. This work not only proposes an ideal experimental platform for analyzing quantum string excitations in the ground state but also provides a much simpler method for manipulating quantum string excitations in frustrated systems, such as spin ice.</description>

      <title>Defending the Quantum Reconstruction Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The program of reconstructing quantum theory based on information-theoretic principles enjoys much popularity in the foundations of physics. Surprisingly, this endeavor has only received very little attention in philosophy. Here I argue that this should change. This is because, on the one hand, reconstructions can help us to better understand quantum mechanics, and, on the other hand, reconstructions are themselves in need of interpretation. My overall objective, thus, is to motivate the reconstruction program and to show why philosophers should care. My specific aims are threefold. (i) Clarify the relationship between reconstructing and interpreting quantum mechanics, (ii) show how the informational reconstruction of quantum theory puts pressure on standard realist interpretations, (iii) defend the quantum reconstruction program against possible objections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As nations and organisations worldwide intensify their efforts and investments to commercialise quantum technologies and explore practical applications across various industries, there is a burgeoning demand for skilled professionals to support this rapidly growing ecosystem. With an expanding array of stakeholders from diverse professions beginning to engage with this ecosystem, there is an urgent need for innovative educational methodologies. These methodologies must not only convey the intricate principles of quantum mechanics effectively to varied professionals, enabling them to make informed decisions but also spark interest among students to delve into and pursue careers within this cutting-edge field. In response, we introduce the Experience-Name-Speak-Apply-Repeat (ENSAR) methodology, coupled with its hands-on implementation through the Qureka Box - an innovative tool designed to demystify quantum computing for a diverse audience by emphasising a pedagogical approach rooted in experiential learning, conceptual understanding, and practical application. We present the results of deploying the ENSAR methodology using the Qureka Box across a diverse group to validate our claims. The findings suggest a significant enhancement in the participants' grasp of foundational quantum computing concepts, thereby showcasing the potential of this approach to equip individuals from diverse professional backgrounds with the knowledge and skills to bridge the workforce demand.</description>

      <title>Topologically driven no-superposing theorem with a tight error bound</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To better understand quantum computation we can search for its limits or no-gos, especially if analogous limits do not appear in classical computation. Classical computation easily implements and extensively employs the addition of two bit strings, so here we study 'quantum addition': the superposition of two quantum states. We prove the impossibility of superposing two unknown states, no matter how many samples of each state are available. The proof uses topology; a quantum algorithm of any sample complexity corresponds to a continuous function, but the function required by the superposition task cannot be continuous by topological arguments. Our result for the first time quantifies the approximation error and the sample complexity $N$ of the superposition task, and it is tight. We present a trivial algorithm with a large approximation error and $N=1$, and the matching impossibility of any smaller approximation error for any $N$. Consequently, our results exclude the superposition as an elementary gate for quantum computation, and limit state tomography as a useful subroutine for the superposition. State tomography is useful only in a model that tolerates randomness in the superposed state. The optimal protocol in this random model remains open.</description>

Abstract: The ground state degeneracy of topologically ordered gapped Hamiltonians is the bedrock for self-correcting quantum memories, which are unfortunately not stable away from equilibrium even at zero temperature. This plague precludes practical robust self-correction since stability at zero temperature is a prerequisite for finite-temperature robustness. In this work, we show that the emergence of a bounded light cone renders the unitary time evolution a quasi-adiabatic continuation that preserves topological order, with the initial ground space retaining its macroscopic distance at all times as a quantum code. We also show how bounded light cones can emerge through suitable perturbations in Kitaev's toric code and honeycomb model. Our results suggest that topological orders and self-correcting quantum memories can be dynamically robust at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>On the exact quantum query complexity of $\text{MOD}_m^n$ and $\text{EXACT}_{k,l}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10935v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The query model has generated considerable interest in both classical and quantum computing communities. Typically, quantum advantages are demonstrated by showcasing a quantum algorithm with a better query complexity compared to its classical counterpart. Exact quantum query algorithms play a pivotal role in developing quantum algorithms. For example, the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm demonstrated exponential quantum advantages over classical deterministic algorithms. As an important complexity measure, exact quantum query complexity describes the minimum number of queries required to solve a specific problem exactly using a quantum algorithm.
  In this paper, we consider the exact quantum query complexity of the following two $n$-bit symmetric functions $\text{MOD}_m^n:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,...,m-1\}$ and $\text{EXACT}_{k,l}^n:\{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}$, which are defined as $\text{MOD}_m^n(x) = |x| \bmod m$ and $ \text{EXACT}_{k,l}^n(x) = 1$ iff $|x| \in \{k,l\}$, where $|x|$ is the number of $1$'s in $x$. Our results are as follows: i) We present an optimal quantum algorithm for computing $\text{MOD}_m^n$, achieving a query complexity of $\lceil n(1-\frac{1}{m}) \rceil$ for $1 &lt; m \le n$. This settles a conjecture proposed by Cornelissen, Mande, Ozols and de Wolf (2021). Based on this algorithm, we show the exact quantum query complexity of a broad class of symmetric functions that map $\{0,1\}^n$ to a finite set $X$ is less than $n$. ii) When $l-k \ge 2$, we give an optimal exact quantum query algorithm to compute $\text{EXACT}_{k,l}^n$ for the case $k=0$ or $k=1,l=n-1$. This resolves the conjecture proposed by Ambainis, Iraids and Nagaj (2017) partially.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08334v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective light cones, characterized by Lieb-Robinson bounds, emerge in non-relativistic local quantum systems. Here, we present several analytical results derived from logarithmic light cones (LLCs), which can arise in the one-dimensional XXZ model with random fields and in a phenomenological model of many-body localization (MBL). In the LLC regime, we prove that the entanglement growth is upper-bounded by logarithmic time with an additional subleading double-logarithmic term stemming from a real asymptotic solution of the \emph{Lambert W} function. In the context of the XXZ model, recent numerical results suggest that the double-logarithmic term correlates with number entropy. We also show that information scrambling is logarithmically slow in the LLC regime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LLC supports long-lived quantum memories under unitary time evolution as quantum codes with macroscopic code distance and an exponentially scaling lifetime. Our analytical results provide benchmarks for future numerical explorations of the MBL regime on large time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of external fields on the stability of spin helix states in an XXZ Heisenberg model. Exact diagonalization on a finite system shows that random transverse fields in the x and y directions drive the transition from integrability to nonintegrability. In such a system, the helix state can be regarded as a quantum scar. Simultaneously, the presence of uniform z field enables the helix state to better maintain its dynamical nature, allowing for a clearer understanding of its evolutionary behavior. However, the entanglement entropy reveals that irrespective of the presence of a uniform z field, as long as the system remains chaotic, the scar extent of the helix state shows no significant variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The set of two-body reduced states of translation invariant, infinite quantum spin chains can be approximated from inside and outside using matrix product states and marginals of finite systems, respectively. These lead to hierarchies of algebraic approximations that become tight only in the limit of infinitely many auxiliary variables. We show that this is necessarily so for any algebraic ansatz by proving that the set of reduced states is not semialgebraic. We also provide evidence that additional elementary transcendental functions cannot lead to a finitary description.</description>

      <title>Magic Can Enhance the Quantum Capacity of Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the role of magic in the quantum capacity of channels. We consider the quantum channel of the recently proposed discrete beam splitter with the fixed environment state. We find that if the fixed environment state is a stabilizer state, then the quantum capacity is zero. Moreover, we find that the quantum capacity is nonzero for some magic states, and the quantum capacity increases linearly with respect to the number of single-qudit magic states in the environment. These results suggest that magic can increase the quantum capacity of channels, which sheds new insight into the role of stabilizer and magic states in quantum communication.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13080v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a thermodynamic framework to quantify instrument incompatibility via a resource theory subject to thermodynamic constraints. We use the minimal thermalisation time needed to erase incompatibility's signature to measure incompatibility. Unexpectedly, this time value is equivalent to incompatibility advantage in a work extraction task. Hence, both thermalisation time and extractable work can directly quantify instrument incompatibility. Finally, we show that incompatibility signatures must vanish in non-Markovian thermalisation.</description>

Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations can enable sensing beyond the classical limits of precision, with the realization of such sensors poised for transformative impacts across science and engineering. Real devices, however, face the accumulated impacts of noise effects, architecture constraints, and finite sampling rates, making the design and success of practical quantum sensors challenging. Numerical and theoretical frameworks that support the optimization and analysis of imperfections from one end of a sensing protocol through to the other (i.e., from probe state preparation through to parameter estimation) are thus crucial for translating quantum advantage into widespread practice. Here, we present an end-to-end variational framework for quantum sensing protocols, where parameterized quantum circuits and neural networks form trainable, adaptive models for quantum sensor dynamics and estimation, respectively. The framework is general and can be adapted towards arbitrary qubit architectures, as we demonstrate with experimentally-relevant ans\"atze for trapped-ion and photonic systems, and enables to directly quantify the impacts that noisy state preparation/measurement and finite data sampling have on parameter estimation. End-to-end variational frameworks can thus underpin powerful design and analysis tools for realizing quantum advantage in practical, robust sensors.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here we achieve the first coexistence of thermalization and memory in a quantum system, where we use both Rydberg blockade and facilitation in an atom array to engineer a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disjointed subspaces. We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>A quantum expectation identity: Applications to statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09860v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we derive a useful expectation identity using the language of quantum statistical mechanics, where density matrices represent the state of knowledge about the system. This identity allows to establish relations between different quantum observables depending on a continuous parameter. Such a parameter can be contained in the observables itself (e.g. perturbative parameter) or may appear as a Lagrange multiplier (inverse temperature, chemical potential, etc.) in the density matrix, excluding parameters that modify the underlying Hilbert space. In this way, using both canonical and grand canonical density matrices along with certain quantum observables (Hamiltonian, number operator, the density matrix itself, etc.) we found new identities in the field, showing not only its derivation but also their meaning. Additionally, we found that some theorems of traditional quantum statistics and quantum chemistry, such as the thermodynamical fluctuation-dissipation theorem, the Ehrenfest, and the Hellmann-Feynman theorems, among others, are particular instances of our aforementioned quantum expectation identity. At last, using a generalized density matrix arising from the Maximum-Entropy principle, we derive generalized quantum expectation identities: these generalized identities allow us to group all the previous cases in a unitary scheme.</description>

      <title>Quantum teleportation coexisting with classical communications in optical fiber</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability for quantum and conventional networks to operate in the same optical fibers would aid the deployment of quantum network technology on a large scale. Quantum teleportation is a fundamental operation in quantum networking, but has yet to be demonstrated in fibers populated with high-power conventional optical signals. Here we report to the best of our knowledge the first demonstration of quantum teleportation over fibers carrying conventional telecommunications traffic. Quantum state transfer is achieved over a 30.2-km fiber carrying 400-Gbps C-band classical traffic with a Bell state measurement performed at the fiber's midpoint. To protect quantum fidelity from spontaneous Raman scattering noise, we use optimal O-band quantum channels, narrow spectro-temporal filtering, and multi-photon coincidence detection. Fidelity is shown to be well maintained with an elevated C-band launch power of 18.7 dBm for the single-channel 400-Gbps signal, which we project could support multiple classical channels totaling many terabits/s aggregate data rates. These results show the feasibility of advanced quantum and classical network applications operating within a unified fiber infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Distribution of lowest eigenvalue in $k$-body bosonic random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically study the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems with $k$-body interactions modeled by Bosonic Embedded Gaussian Orthogonal [BEGOE($k$)] and Unitary [BEGUE($k$)] random matrix Ensembles. Following the recently published result that the $q$-normal describes the smooth form of the eigenvalue density of the $k$-body embedded ensembles, the first four moments of the distribution of lowest eigenvalues have been analyzed as a function of the $q$ parameter, with $q \sim 1$ for $k = 1$ and $q = 0$ for $k = m$; $m$ being the number of bosons. Analytics are difficult as we are dealing with highly correlated variables, however we provide ansatzs for centroids and variances of these distributions. These match very well with the numerical results obtained. Our results show the distribution exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like for $q$ close to 1 to a modified Gumbel like for intermediate values of $q$ to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution for $q=0$. It should be emphasized that this is a new result which numerically demonstrates that the distribution of the lowest eigenvalue of finite many-boson systems with $k$-body interactions exhibits a smooth transition from Gaussian like (for $q$ close to 1) to a modified Gumbel like (for intermediate values of $q$) to the well-known Tracy-Widom distribution (for $q=0$). In addition, we have also studied the distribution of normalized spacing between the lowest and next lowest eigenvalues and it is seen that this distribution exhibits a transition from Wigner's surmise (for $k=1$) to Poisson (for intermediate $k$ values with $k \le m/2$) to Wigner's surmise (starting from $k = m/2$ to $k = m$) with decreasing $q$ value. Thus, the spacings at the spectrum edge behave differently from the spacings inside the spectrum bulk.</description>

      <title>Prediction of chaotic dynamics and extreme events: A recurrence-free quantum reservoir computing approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In chaotic dynamical systems, extreme events manifest in time series as unpredictable large-amplitude peaks. Although deterministic, extreme events appear seemingly randomly, which makes their forecasting difficult. By learning the dynamics from observables (data), reservoir computers can time-accurately predict extreme events and chaotic dynamics, but they may require many degrees of freedom (large reservoirs). In this paper, by exploiting quantum-computer ans\"atze and entanglement, we design reservoir computers with compact reservoirs and accurate prediction capabilities. First, we propose the recurrence-free quantum reservoir computer (RF-QRC) architecture. By developing ad-hoc quantum feature maps and removing recurrent connections, the RF-QRC has quantum circuits with small depths. This allows the RF-QRC to scale well with higher-dimensional chaotic systems, which makes it suitable for hardware implementation. Second, we forecast the temporal chaotic dynamics and their long-term statistics of low- and higher-dimensional dynamical systems. We find that RF-QRC requires smaller reservoirs than classical reservoir computers. Third, we apply the RF-QRC to the time prediction of extreme events in a model of a turbulent shear flow with turbulent bursts. We find that the RF-QRC has a longer predictability than the classical reservoir computer. The results and analyses indicate that quantum-computer ans\"atze offer nonlinear expressivity and computational scalability, which are useful for forecasting chaotic dynamics and extreme events. This work opens new opportunities for using quantum machine learning on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Generalized R\'enyi entropy accumulation theorem and generalized quantum probability estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy accumulation theorem, and its subsequent generalized version, is a powerful tool in the security analysis of many device-dependent and device-independent cryptography protocols. However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which can often be challenging to construct optimally in practice. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as an intuitively interpretable convex optimization, without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of R\'enyi entropies if desired, yielding fully-R\'enyi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the frameworks of quantum probability estimation or $f$-weighted R\'enyi entropies, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to those frameworks as well. In particular, those findings imply that our bounds apply to prepare-and-measure protocols without the virtual tomography procedures or repetition-rate restrictions previously required for entropy accumulation.</description>

      <title>A computational test of quantum contextuality, and even simpler proofs of quantumness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell non-locality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics whereby measurements performed on "spatially separated" quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be understood as revealing predetermined values. This is a special case of the more general phenomenon of "quantum contextuality", which says that such correlations can occur even when the measurements are not necessarily on separate quantum systems, but are merely "compatible" (i.e. commuting). Crucially, while any non-local game yields an experiment that demonstrates quantum advantage by leveraging the "spatial separation" of two or more devices (and in fact several such demonstrations have been conducted successfully in recent years), the same is not true for quantum contextuality: finding the contextuality analogue of such an experiment is arguably one of the central open questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In this work, we show that an arbitrary contextuality game can be compiled into an operational "test of contextuality" involving a single quantum device, by only making the assumption that the device is computationally bounded. Our work is inspired by the recent work of Kalai et al. (STOC '23) that converts any non-local game into a classical test of quantum advantage with a single device. The central idea in their work is to use cryptography to enforce spatial separation within subsystems of a single quantum device. Our work can be seen as using cryptography to enforce "temporal separation", i.e. to restrict communication between sequential measurements.
  Beyond contextuality, we employ our ideas to design a "proof of quantumness" that, to the best of our knowledge, is arguably even simpler than the ones proposed in the literature so far.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metrology with Higher-order Exceptional Points in Atom-cavity Magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), early arising from non-Hermitian physics, significantly amplify the system's response to minor perturbations, and act as a useful concept to enhance measurement in metrology. In particular, such a metrological enhancement grows dramatically with the EP's order. However, the Langevin noises intrinsically existing in the non-Hermitian systems diminish this enhancement. In this study, we propose a protocol for quantum metrology with the construction of higher-order EPs (HOEPs) in atom-cavity system through Hermitian magnon-photon interaction. The construction of HOEPs utilizes the atom-cavity non-Hermitian-like dynamical behavior but avoids the external Langevin noises via the Hermitian interaction. A general analysis is exhibited for the construction of arbitrary $n$-th order EP (EPn). As a demonstration of the superiority of these HOEPs in quantum metrology, we work out an EP3/4-based atomic sensor with sensitivity being orders of magnitude higher than that achievable in an EP2-based one. We further unveil the mechanism behind the sensitivity enhancement from HOEPs. The experimental establishment for this proposal is suggested with potential candidates. This EP-based atomic sensor, taking advantage of the atom-light interface, offers new insight into quantum metrology with HOEPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11639v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of correlated states and measurements promises improvements in the accuracy of frequency metrology and the stability of atomic clocks. However, developing strategies robust against dominant noise processes remains challenging. We address the issue of decoherence due to spontaneous decay and show that Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, in conjunction with a correlated measurement and nonlinear estimation strategy, achieve gains of up to 2.25 dB, comparable to fundamental bounds for up to about 80 atoms in the presence of decoherence. This result is surprising since GHZ states do not provide any enhancement under dephasing due to white frequency noise compared to the standard quantum limit of uncorrelated states. The gain arises from a veto signal, which allows for the detection and mitigation of errors caused by spontaneous emission events. Through comprehensive Monte-Carlo simulations of atomic clocks, we demonstrate the robustness of the GHZ protocol.</description>

      <title>Finding Quantum Codes via Riemannian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel optimization scheme designed to find optimally correctable subspace codes for a known quantum noise channel. To each candidate subspace code we first associate a universal recovery map, as if the code was perfectly correctable, and aim to maximize a performance functional that combines a modified channel fidelity with a tuneable regularization term that promotes simpler codes. With this choice optimization is performed only over the set of codes, and not over the set of recovery operators. The set of codes of fixed dimension is parametrized as a complex-valued Stiefel manifold: the resulting non-convex optimization problem is then solved by gradient-based local algorithms. When perfectly correctable codes cannot be found, a second optimization routine is run on the recovery Kraus map, also parametrized in a suitable Stiefel manifold via Stinespring representation. To test the approach, correctable codes are sought in different scenarios and compared to existing ones: three qubits subjected to bit-flip errors (single and correlated), four qubits undergoing local amplitude damping and five qubits subjected to local depolarizing channels. Approximate codes are found and tested for the previous examples as well pure non-Markovian dephasing noise acting on a $7/2$ spin, induced by a $1/2$ spin bath, and the noise of the first three qubits of IBM's \texttt{ibm\_kyoto} quantum computer. The fidelity results are competitive with existing iterative optimization algorithms, with respect to which we maintain a strong computational advantage, while obtaining simpler codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an effective ansatz for the wave function of correlated electrons that brings closer the fields of machine learning parameterizations and tensor rank decompositions. We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization of a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple, compact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes $N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor decompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable truncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of local energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling reductions to $\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard and chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while extending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates competitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D hydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Quantum landscape tomography for efficient single-gate optimization on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circuit optimization is a fundamental task for practical applications of near-term quantum computers. In this work we address this challenge through the powerful lenses of tensor network theory. Our approach involves the full characterization of the influence of individual gates on the entire circuit, a process we call quantum landscape tomography. We derive the necessary and sufficient requirements of this process and propose two implementations, respectively based on 2-unitary design and Clifford tableaux. The latter implementation strikes a convenient balance between the number of shots and the number of circuits needed for the tomography. Numerical simulations based on a realistic noise model demonstrate the advantage of our approach with respect to both gradient-free and gradient-based methods. Overall, our findings highlight the potential of quantum landscape tomography to enhance circuit optimization in near-term quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Complexity of two-level systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of inhomogeneously correlated systems using block interaction product states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strength of DMRG lies in its treatment of identical sites that are energetically degenerate and spatially similar. However, this becomes a drawback when applied to quantum chemistry calculations for large systems, as entangled orbitals often span broad ranges in energy and space, with notably inhomogeneous interactions. In this study, we propose addressing strong intra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlations separately using a multi-configurational block interaction product state (BIPS) framework. The strong correlation is captured in electronic states on fragments, considering entanglement between fragments and their environments. This method has been tested in various chemical systems and shows high accuracy and efficiency in addressing inhomogeneous effects in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Halving the Cost of Quantum Algorithms with Randomization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) provides a systematic framework for implementing a polynomial transformation of a linear operator, and unifies nearly all known quantum algorithms. In parallel, recent works have developed randomized compiling, a technique that promotes a unitary gate to a quantum channel and enables a quadratic suppression of error (i.e., $\epsilon \rightarrow O(\epsilon^2)$) at little to no overhead. Here we integrate randomized compiling into QSP through Stochastic Quantum Signal Processing. Our algorithm implements a probabilistic mixture of polynomials, strategically chosen so that the average evolution converges to that of a target function, with an error quadratically smaller than that of an equivalent individual polynomial. Because nearly all QSP-based algorithms exhibit query complexities scaling as $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ -- stemming from a result in functional analysis -- this error suppression reduces their query complexity by a factor that asymptotically approaches $1/2$. By the unifying capabilities of QSP, this reduction extends broadly to quantum algorithms, which we demonstrate on algorithms for real and imaginary time evolution, phase estimation, ground state preparation, and matrix inversion.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body simulation of finite-temperature systems with sampling a series expansion of a quantum imaginary-time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating thermal-equilibrium properties at finite temperature is crucial for studying quantum many-body systems. Quantum computers are expected to enable us to simulate large systems at finite temperatures, overcoming challenges faced by classical computers, like the sign problem of the quantum Monte-Carlo technique. Conventional methods suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) devices are designed for studying large-scale quantum many-body systems but require a large number of ancilla qubits and a deep quantum circuit with many basic gates, making them unsuitable for the early stage of the FTQC era, at which the availability of qubits and quantum gates is limited. In this paper, we propose a method suitable for quantum devices in this early stage to calculate the thermal-equilibrium expectation value of an observable at finite temperatures. Our proposal, named the Markov-chain Monte Carlo with sampled pairs of unitaries (MCMC-SPU) algorithm, involves sampling simple quantum circuits and generating the corresponding statistical ensembles. This approach addresses the issues of resource demand and the decay in probability associated with postselection of measurement outcomes on ancilla qubits. We validate our proposal with numerical simulation on the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model as an illustrative example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning consists in taking advantage of quantum computations to generate classical data. A potential application of quantum machine learning is to harness the power of quantum computers for generating classical data, a process essential to a multitude of applications such as enriching training datasets, anomaly detection, and risk management in finance. Given the success of Generative Adversarial Networks in classical image generation, the development of its quantum versions has been actively conducted. However, existing implementations on quantum computers often face significant challenges, such as scalability and training convergence issues. To address these issues, we propose LatentQGAN, a novel quantum model that uses a hybrid quantum-classical GAN coupled with an autoencoder. Although it was initially designed for image generation, the LatentQGAN approach holds potential for broader application across various practical data generation tasks. Experimental outcomes on both classical simulators and noisy intermediate scale quantum computers have demonstrated significant performance enhancements over existing quantum methods, alongside a significant reduction in quantum resources overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement plays a crucial role not only in understanding Hermitian many-body systems but also in offering valuable insights into non-Hermitian quantum systems. In this paper, we analytically investigate the entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement energy spectrum of a non-Hermitian spin ladder using perturbation theory in the biorthogonal basis. Specifically, we examine the entanglement properties between coupled non-Hermitian quantum spin chains. In the strong coupling limit ($J_\mathrm{rung}\gg1$), first-order perturbation theory reveals that the entanglement Hamiltonian closely resembles the single-chain Hamiltonian with renormalized coupling strengths, allowing for the definition of an ad hoc temperature. Our findings provide new insights into quantum entanglement in non-Hermitian systems and offer a foundation for developing novel approaches for studying finite temperature properties in non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Pancharatnam phase as an entanglement witness for quantum gravity in dual Stern-Gerlach interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in the fundamental tests and practical applications of quantum mechanics. Because entanglement is a feature unique to quantum systems, its observations provide evidence of quantumness. Hence, if gravity can generate entanglement between quantum superpositions, this indicates that quantum amplitudes are field sources and that gravity is quantum. I study the dual spin-one-half Stern-Gerlach interferometers and show that the Pancharatnam phase is a tool that qualitatively distinguishes semiclassical from quantum gravity. The semiclassical evolution is equivalent to that of two independent interferometers in an external field. In this case, a phase jump was observed, as expected from the geodesic rule, which dictates the noncyclic evolution in the Bloch sphere. By contrast, in the quantum case, the quantum amplitudes are the sources of the gravitational field, inducing entanglement between the two interferometers, and the phase is continuous.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fast Implementation of Functional Bootstrapping and Private Information Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical privacy-preserving computation techniques safeguard sensitive data in cloud computing, but often suffer from low computational efficiency. In this paper, we show that employing a single quantum server can significantly enhance both the efficiency and security of privacy-preserving computation.
  We propose an efficient quantum algorithm for functional bootstrapping of large-precision plaintexts, reducing the time complexity from exponential to polynomial in plaintext-size compared to classical algorithms. To support general functional bootstrapping, we design a fast quantum private information retrieval (PIR) protocol with logarithmic query time. The security relies on the learning with errors (LWE) problem with polynomial modulus, providing stronger security than classical ``exponentially fast'' PIR protocol based on ring-LWE with super-polynomial modulus.
  Technically, we extend a key classical homomorphic operation, known as blind rotation, to the quantum setting through encrypted conditional rotation. Underlying our extension are insights for the quantum extension of polynomial-based cryptographic tools that may gain dramatic speedups.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents two efficient and stable algorithms for recovering phase factors in quantum signal processing (QSP), a crucial component of many quantum algorithms. The first algorithm, the ``Half Cholesky" method, which is based on nonlinear Fourier analysis and fast solvers for structured matrices, demonstrates robust performance across all regimes. The second algorithm, ``Fast Fixed Point Iteration," provides even greater efficiency in the non-fully-coherent regime. Both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate the significant advantages of these new methods over all existing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify regimes where post-selection can be used scalably in quantum error correction (QEC) to improve performance. We use statistical mechanical models to analytically quantify the performance and thresholds of post-selected QEC, with a focus on the surface code. Based on the non-equilibrium magnetization of these models, we identify a simple heuristic technique for post-selection that does not require a decoder. Along with performance gains, this heuristic allows us to derive analytic expressions for post-selected conditional logical thresholds and abort thresholds of surface codes. We find that such post-selected QEC is characterised by four distinct thermodynamic phases, and detail the implications of this phase space for practical, scalable quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Extending Simulability of Cliffords and Matchgates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though Cliffords and matchgates are both examples of classically simulable circuits, they are considered simulable for different reasons. While the simulability of Clifford conjugated matchgate circuits for single qubit outputs has been briefly considered, the simulability of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits has not been generalized up to this point. In this paper we resolve this, studying simulability of marginals as well as Pauli expectation values of Clifford and matchgate hybrid circuits. We describe a hierarchy of Clifford circuits, and find that as we consider more general Cliffords, we lose some amount of simulability of bitstring outputs. Most importantly, we show that the known simulability of Pauli expectation values of Clifford circuits acting on product states can be generalized to Clifford circuits acting after any matchgate circuit. We conclude with some general discussion about the relationship between Cliffords and matchgates, and argue that we can understand stabilizer states as the vacuum states of particular fermion-to-qubit encodings.</description>

Abstract: We develop a hybrid classical-quantum method for solving the Lorenz system. We use the forward Euler method to discretize the system in time, transforming it into a system of equations. This set of equations is solved using the Variational Quantum Linear Solver (VQLS) algorithm. We present numerical results comparing the hybrid method with the classical approach for solving the Lorenz system. The simulation results demonstrate that the VQLS method can effectively compute solutions comparable to classical methods. The method is easily extended to solving similar nonlinear differential equations.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Mpemba effect with non-classical states of light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect refers to the surprising observation where, under certain conditions, a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward equilibrium faster than a state closer to equilibrium. A paradigmatic example is provided by the curious fact that hot water can sometimes freeze faster than cold water. The Mpemba effect has intrigued scientists since long time and has been predicted and observed in a variety of classical and quantum systems. Recently, the search for Mpemba-like effects of purely quantum nature has raised a major interest. Here we predict the emergence of Mpemba effect in the quantum optics context exploiting non-classical states of light. By analyzing the decay dynamics of photon fields in a leaky optical resonator or waveguide, it is demonstrated that bosonic Mpemba effect emerges in the context of the quantum nature of light. Specifically, the relaxation dynamics is strongly influenced by the photon statistics of the initially trapped light field. The Mpemba effect is observed when comparing the decay dynamics of classical light fields (coherent states) with certain non-classical states, such as Fock states, squeezed states and Schr\"odinger cat states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent progress in quantum machine learning has sparked interest in using quantum methods to tackle classical control problems via quantum reinforcement learning. However, the classical reinforcement learning environments often scale to high dimensional problem spaces, which represents a challenge for the limited and costly resources available for quantum agent implementations. We propose to solve this dimensionality challenge by a classical autoencoder and a quantum agent together, where a compressed representation of observations is jointly learned in a hybrid training loop. The latent representation of such an autoencoder will serve as a tailored observation space best suited for both the control problem and the QPU architecture, aligning with the agent's requirements. A series of numerical experiments are designed for a performance analysis of the latent-space learning method. Results are presented for different control problems and for both photonic (continuous-variable) and qubit-based agents, to show how the QNN learning process is improved by the joint training.</description>

Abstract: This paper extends the decomposition from the group theory based methods of Sasao and Saraivanov to design binary input multivalued output quantum cascades realized with optical NOT, SWAP, and Fredkin Gates. We present this method for 3, 5, and 7 valued outputs, but in general it can be used for odd prime valued outputs. The method can be extended to realize hybrid functions with different valued outputs. A class of local transformations is presented that can simplify the final cascade circuits. Using these simplifying transformations, we present an upper bound on the maximum number of gates in an arbitrary $n$-variable input and $k$-valued output function.</description>

Our proposed methodology is well suited for quantum layouts, as each single-qubit gate has one target qubit and each double-qubit gate has one control qubit and one target qubit, thereby never creating a graph of triangular connectivity.</description>

      <title>Trapping of Bose-Einstein condensates in a three-dimensional dark focus generated by conical refraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:1705.02425v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient three-dimensional dark-focus optical trapping potential for neutral atoms and Bose-Einstein condensates. This "optical bottle" is created by a single blue-detuned light field exploiting the phenomenon of conical refraction occurring in biaxial crystals. The conversion of a Gaussian input beam to the bottle beam has an efficiency of close to 100 % and the optical setup requires the addition of the biaxial crystal and a circular polarizer only. Based on the conical-refraction theory, we derive the general form of the potential, the trapping frequencies, and the potential barrier heights. We present experiments on confining a $^{87}$Rb Bose-Einstein condensate in three dimensions. We determine the trap shape, the vibrational frequencies along the weak axis, as well as the lifetime of ultracold atoms in this type of potential.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Free Fermions in Timelike Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the entanglement entropy of free fermion quantum states in an arbitrary spacetime slice of a discrete set of points, and particularly investigate timelike (causal) slices. For 1D lattice free fermions with an energy bandwidth $E_0$, we calculate the time-direction entanglement entropy $S_A$ in a time-direction slice of a set of times $t_n=n\tau$ ($1\le n\le K$) spanning a time length $t$ on the same site. For zero temperature ground states, we find that $S_A$ shows volume law when $\tau\gg\tau_0=2\pi/E_0$; in contrast, $S_A\sim \frac{1}{3}\ln t$ when $\tau=\tau_0$, and $S_A\sim\frac{1}{6}\ln t$ when $\tau&lt;\tau_0$, resembling the Calabrese-Cardy formula for one flavor of nonchiral and chiral fermion, respectively. For finite temperature thermal states, the mutual information also saturates when $\tau&lt;\tau_0$. For non-eigenstates, volume law in $t$ and signatures of the Lieb-Robinson bound velocity can be observed in $S_A$. For generic spacetime slices with one point per site, the zero temperature entanglement entropy shows a clear transition from area law to volume law when the slice varies from spacelike to timelike.</description>

      <title>The Composite Particle Duality: A New Class of Topological Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The composite particle duality extends the notions of both flux attachment and statistical transmutation in spacetime dimensions beyond 2+1D. It constitutes an exact correspondence that can be understood either as a theoretical framework or as a dynamical physical mechanism. The immediate implication of the duality is that an interacting quantum system in arbitrary dimensions can experience a modification of its statistical properties if coupled to a certain gauge field. In other words, commutation relations of quantum fields can be effectively modified by a dynamical physical process. For instance, an originally bosonic quantum fluid in $d$ spatial dimensions can feature composite fermionic (or anyonic) excitations when coupled to a statistical gauge field. In 3+1D the mechanism of flux attachment induces a dynamical formation of dyons as higher-dimensional analogues of Laughlin quasiparticles. In 1+1D there is lack of flux attachment but a remnant in the form of a statistical gauge field can be explicitly constructed. We also introduce a family of interacting quantum many-body systems that undergo statistical transmutation as indicated by the duality. This opens the door to a new realm of topological phases across dimensions both in lattice and continuum systems.</description>

      <title>The quantum vortices dynamics: spatio-temporal scale hierarchy and origin of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the evolution and interaction of quantum vortex loops with a small but non-zero radius of core ${\sf a}$. The quantization scheme of the classical vortex system is based on the approach proposed by the author \cite{Tal,Tal_PhRF}.
  We consider small perturbations in the ring-shaped loops, which include both helical-type shape variations and small excitations of the flow in the vortex core. The quantization of the circulation $\Gamma$ is deduced from the first principles of quantum theory. As a result of our approach, the set of quantized circulation values is wider than the standard one. The developed theory introduces a hierarchical spatio-temporal scale in the quantum evolution of vortices. We also explore the applicability of this model for describing the origins of turbulence in quantum fluid flows. To achieve this specific objective, we employ the method of random Hamiltonians to describe the interaction of quantum vortex loops.</description>

      <title>Phonon state tomography of electron correlation dynamics in optically excited solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce phonon state tomography (PST) as a diagnostic probe of electron dynamics in solids whose phonons are optically excited by a laser pulse at initial time. Using a projected-purified matrix-product states algorithm, PST decomposes the exact correlated electron-phonon wavefunction into contributions from purely electronic states corresponding to statistically typical configurations of the optically accessible phononic response, enabling a 'tomographic' reconstruction of the electronic dynamics generated by the phonons. Thus, PST may be used to diagnose electronic behavior in experiments that access only the phonon response, such as thermal diffuse x-ray and electron scattering. We study the dynamics of a metal whose infrared phonons are excited by an optical pulse at initial time and use it to simulate the sample-averaged momentum-resolved phonon occupancy and accurately reconstruct the electronic correlations. We also use PST to analyze the influence of different pulse shapes on the light-induced enhancement and suppression of electronic correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window around 5 e-folds for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

Abstract: Nowadays, predominant asymmetric cryptographic schemes are considered to be secure because discrete logarithms are believed to be hard to be computed. The algorithm of Shor can effectively compute discrete logarithms, i.e. it can brake such asymmetric schemes. But the algorithm of Shor is a quantum algorithm and at the time this algorithm has been invented, quantum computers that may successfully execute this algorithm seemed to be far out in the future. The latter has changed: quantum computers that are powerful enough are likely to be available in a couple of years. In this article, we first describe the relation between discrete logarithms and two well-known asymmetric security schemes, RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography. Next, we present the foundations of lattice-based cryptography which is the bases of schemes that are considered to be safe against attacks by quantum algorithms (as well as by classical algorithms). Then we describe two such quantum-safe algorithms (Kyber and Dilithium) in more detail. Finally, we give a very brief and selective overview of a few actions currently taken by governments and industry as well as standardization in this area. The article especially strives towards being self-contained: the required mathematical foundations to understand post-quantum cryptography are provided and examples are given.</description>

      <title>Faster and Better Quantum Software Testing through Specification Reduction and Projective Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises polynomial and exponential speedups in many domains, such as unstructured search and prime number factoring. However, quantum programs yield probabilistic outputs from exponentially growing distributions and are vulnerable to quantum-specific faults. Existing quantum software testing (QST) approaches treat quantum superpositions as classical distributions. This leads to two major limitations when applied to quantum programs: (1) an exponentially growing sample space distribution and (2) failing to detect quantum-specific faults such as phase flips. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a QST approach, which applies a reduction algorithm to a quantum program specification. The reduced specification alleviates the limitations (1) by enabling faster sampling through quantum parallelism and (2) by performing projective measurements in the mixed Hadamard basis. Our evaluation of 143 quantum programs across four categories demonstrates significant improvements in test runtimes and fault detection with our reduction approach. Average test runtimes improved from 169.9s to 11.8s, with notable enhancements in programs with large circuit depths (383.1s to 33.4s) and large program specifications (464.8s to 7.7s). Furthermore, our approach increases mutation scores from 54.5% to 74.7%, effectively detecting phase flip faults that non-reduced specifications miss. These results underline our approach's importance to improve QST efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong charge-photon coupling allows the coherent coupling of a charge qubit, realized by a single charge carrier (either an electron or a hole) in a double quantum dot, to photons of a microwave resonator. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that, in the dispersive regime, the photons can mediate both an $i\mathrm{SWAP}$ gate as well as a $\sqrt{i\mathrm{SWAP}}$ gate between two distant charge qubits. We provide a thorough discussion of the impact of the dominant noise sources, resonator damping and charge qubit dephasing on the average gate fidelity. Assuming a state-of-the art resonator decay rate and charge qubit dephasing rate, the predicted average gate fidelities are below 90\%. However, a decrease of the charge qubit dephasing rate by one order of magnitude is conjectured to result in gate fidelities surpassing 95\%.</description>

      <title>Microwave-Induced Cooling in Double Quantum Dots: Achieving Millikelvin Temperatures to Reduce Thermal Noise around Spin Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin qubits in gate-defined quantum dots (QDs) are emerging as a leading technology due to their scalability and long coherence times. However, maintaining these qubits at ultra-low temperatures typically requires complex cryogenic systems. This paper proposes a novel gate-defined double quantum dot (DQD) cooling system, where the DQDs act as refrigerants to reduce the local phonon environment around computational qubits. The cooling process occurs in two distinct stages: the first step involves microwave-induced state depopulation combined with fast cyclic detuning to transfer the DQD's population to the ground state, effectively lowering the DQD's temperature. In the second step, the cooled DQD interacts with and absorbs phonons resonant with the DQD spin energy, thereby filtering out these phonons that contribute to spin-lattice relaxation in the surrounding environment. This study focuses on the first step, presenting detailed calculations and numerical results that demonstrate the feasibility of achieving local DQD temperatures below 10 mK at a bath temperature of 1 K. The sensitivity of the cooling performance to detuning energy, magnetic field strength, and diabatic return time is analyzed, while the phonon filtering in the second step will require further investigation.</description>

Abstract: We present an all-digital method for stabilising the phase biases in an electro-optic I/Q modulator for carrier-suppressed single-sideband modulation. Building on the method presented in S. Wald \ea, Appl. Opt. \textbf{62}, 1-7 (2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and demodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical carrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a multiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for unavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at exactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase stability. We demonstrate $&gt;23\,\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier relative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\,\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours and over temperature variations of $20^\circ\rm C$.</description>

Abstract: Magneto-conductance in thin wires often exhibits complicated patterns due to the quantum interference of conduction electrons. These patterns reflect microscopic structures in the wires, such as defects or potential distributions. In this study, we propose an inverse design method to automatically generate a microscopic structure that exhibits desired magneto-conductance patterns. We numerically demonstrate that our method accurately generates defect positions in wires and can be effectively applied to various complicated patterns. We also discuss techniques for designing structures that facilitate experimental investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an angular analysis based on the reconstruction of the helicity amplitudes from dedicated experimental data corresponding to the tripartite state composed by one qutrit and two qubits, which arises in the three-body decays of a spin zero particle into one vector and a fermion pair. Starting from the associated spin density matrix of the final state, entanglement quantifiers were investigated and the corresponding significances were determined up to second order in the error propagation of the uncertainties of the angular measurements. As an application of our analysis, we performed a full quantum tomography of the final state in the $B^0\to K^{*0}\mu^+\mu^-$ decays using data recorded by LHCb collaboration. We found the presence of genuine quantum entanglement of the final state and also in both kaon-muon and di-muon subsystems. In recent years, $B$ meson decays received significant attention from both experimental and theoretical sides, and the proposed observables provide novel perspectives for studying them. Furthermore, this analysis could be also applied to other several processes if the complete experimental data were available for the helicity amplitudes reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space methods for neutrino oscillations: extension to multi-beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Phase-Space approach (PSA), which was originally introduced in [Lacroix et al., Phys. Rev. D 106, 123006 (2022)] to describe neutrino flavor oscillations for interacting neutrinos emitted from stellar objects is extended to describe arbitrary numbers of neutrino beams. The PSA is based on mapping the quantum fluctuations into a statistical treatment by sampling initial conditions followed by independent mean-field evolution. A new method is proposed to perform this sampling that allows treating an arbitrary number of neutrinos in each neutrino beam. We validate the technique successfully and confirm its predictive power on several examples where a reference exact calculation is possible. We show that it can describe many-body effects, such as entanglement and dissipation induced by the interaction between neutrinos. Due to the complexity of the problem, exact solutions can only be calculated for rather limited cases, with a limited number of beams and/or neutrinos in each beam. The PSA approach considerably reduces the numerical cost and provides an efficient technique to accurately simulate arbitrary numbers of beams. Examples of PSA results are given here, including up to 200 beams with time-independent or time-dependent Hamiltonian. We anticipate that this approach will be useful to bridge exact microscopic techniques with more traditional transport theories used in neutrino oscillations. It will also provide important reference calculations for future quantum computer applications where other techniques are not applicable to classical computers.</description>

Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>
