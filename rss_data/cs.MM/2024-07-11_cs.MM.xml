      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of diffusion models (DMs) has significantly advanced image and video applications, making "what you want is what you see" a reality. Among these, video editing has gained substantial attention and seen a swift rise in research activity, necessitating a comprehensive and systematic review of the existing literature. This paper reviews diffusion model-based video editing techniques, including theoretical foundations and practical applications. We begin by overviewing the mathematical formulation and image domain's key methods. Subsequently, we categorize video editing approaches by the inherent connections of their core technologies, depicting evolutionary trajectory. This paper also dives into novel applications, including point-based editing and pose-guided human video editing. Additionally, we present a comprehensive comparison using our newly introduced V2VBench. Building on the progress achieved to date, the paper concludes with ongoing challenges and potential directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Standard compliant video coding using low complexity, switchable neural wrappers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of high resolution videos posts great storage and bandwidth pressure on cloud video services, driving the development of next-generation video codecs. Despite great progress made in neural video coding, existing approaches are still far from economical deployment considering the complexity and rate-distortion performance tradeoff. To clear the roadblocks for neural video coding, in this paper we propose a new framework featuring standard compatibility, high performance, and low decoding complexity. We employ a set of jointly optimized neural pre- and post-processors, wrapping a standard video codec, to encode videos at different resolutions. The rate-distorion optimal downsampling ratio is signaled to the decoder at the per-sequence level for each target rate. We design a low complexity neural post-processor architecture that can handle different upsampling ratios. The change of resolution exploits the spatial redundancy in high-resolution videos, while the neural wrapper further achieves rate-distortion performance improvement through end-to-end optimization with a codec proxy. Our light-weight post-processor architecture has a complexity of 516 MACs / pixel, and achieves 9.3% BD-Rate reduction over VVC on the UVG dataset, and 6.4% on AOM CTC Class A1. Our approach has the potential to further advance the performance of the latest video coding standards using neural processing with minimal added complexity.</description>

      <title>Video-to-Audio Generation with Hidden Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating semantically and temporally aligned audio content in accordance with video input has become a focal point for researchers, particularly following the remarkable breakthrough in text-to-video generation. In this work, we aim to offer insights into the video-to-audio generation paradigm, focusing on three crucial aspects: vision encoders, auxiliary embeddings, and data augmentation techniques. Beginning with a foundational model VTA-LDM built on a simple yet surprisingly effective intuition, we explore various vision encoders and auxiliary embeddings through ablation studies. Employing a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that emphasizes generation quality and video-audio synchronization alignment, we demonstrate that our model exhibits state-of-the-art video-to-audio generation capabilities. Furthermore, we provide critical insights into the impact of different data augmentation methods on enhancing the generation framework's overall capacity. We showcase possibilities to advance the challenge of generating synchronized audio from semantic and temporal perspectives. We hope these insights will serve as a stepping stone toward developing more realistic and accurate audio-visual generation models.</description>

      <title>SHERL: Synthesizing High Accuracy and Efficient Memory for Resource-Limited Transfer Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter-efficient transfer learning (PETL) has emerged as a flourishing research field for adapting large pre-trained models to downstream tasks, greatly reducing trainable parameters while grappling with memory challenges during fine-tuning. To address it, memory-efficient series (METL) avoid backpropagating gradients through the large backbone. However, they compromise by exclusively relying on frozen intermediate outputs and limiting the exhaustive exploration of prior knowledge from pre-trained models. Moreover, the dependency and redundancy between cross-layer features are frequently overlooked, thereby submerging more discriminative representations and causing an inherent performance gap (vs. conventional PETL methods). Hence, we propose an innovative METL strategy called SHERL for resource-limited scenarios to decouple the entire adaptation into two successive and complementary processes. In the early route, intermediate outputs are consolidated via an anti-redundancy operation, enhancing their compatibility for subsequent interactions; thereby in the late route, utilizing minimal late pre-trained layers could alleviate the peak demand on memory overhead and regulate these fairly flexible features into more adaptive and powerful representations for new domains. Extensive ablations on vision-and-language and language-only tasks show that SHERL combines the strengths of both parameter and memory-efficient techniques, performing on-par or better across diverse architectures with lower memory during fine-tuning.

      <title>SaMoye: Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion Based on Feature Disentanglement and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07728v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Singing voice conversion (SVC) aims to convert a singer's voice in a given music piece to another singer while keeping the original content. We propose an end-to-end feature disentanglement-based model, which we named SaMoye, to enable zero-shot many-to-many singing voice conversion. SaMoye disentangles the features of the singing voice into content features, timbre features, and pitch features respectively. The content features are enhanced using a GPT-based model to perform cross-prediction with the phoneme of the lyrics. SaMoye can generate the music with converted voice by replacing the timbre features with the target singer. We also establish an unparalleled large-scale dataset to guarantee zero-shot performance. The dataset consists of 1500k pure singing vocal clips containing at least 10,000 singers.</description>

      <title>Multi-task Prompt Words Learning for Social Media Content Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of the Internet has profoundly changed human life. Humans are increasingly expressing themselves and interacting with others on social media platforms. However, although artificial intelligence technology has been widely used in many aspects of life, its application in social media content creation is still blank. To solve this problem, we propose a new prompt word generation framework based on multi-modal information fusion, which combines multiple tasks including topic classification, sentiment analysis, scene recognition and keyword extraction to generate more comprehensive prompt words. Subsequently, we use a template containing a set of prompt words to guide ChatGPT to generate high-quality tweets. Furthermore, in the absence of effective and objective evaluation criteria in the field of content generation, we use the ChatGPT tool to evaluate the results generated by the algorithm, making large-scale evaluation of content generation algorithms possible. Evaluation results on extensive content generation demonstrate that our cue word generation framework generates higher quality content compared to manual methods and other cueing techniques, while topic classification, sentiment analysis, and scene recognition significantly enhance content clarity and its consistency with the image.</description>

      <title>RT-LA-VocE: Real-Time Low-SNR Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to generate clean speech frame by frame from a live video stream and a noisy audio stream without relying on future inputs. To this end, we propose RT-LA-VocE, which completely re-designs every component of LA-VocE, a state-of-the-art non-causal audio-visual speech enhancement model, to perform causal real-time inference with a 40ms input frame. We do so by devising new visual and audio encoders that rely solely on past frames, replacing the Transformer encoder with the Emformer, and designing a new causal neural vocoder C-HiFi-GAN. On the popular AVSpeech dataset, we show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results in all real-time scenarios. More importantly, each component is carefully tuned to minimize the algorithm latency to the theoretical minimum (40ms) while maintaining a low end-to-end processing latency of 28.15ms per frame, enabling real-time frame-by-frame enhancement with minimal delay.</description>

      <title>Lightning Fast Video Anomaly Detection via Adversarial Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.15597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a very fast frame-level model for anomaly detection in video, which learns to detect anomalies by distilling knowledge from multiple highly accurate object-level teacher models. To improve the fidelity of our student, we distill the low-resolution anomaly maps of the teachers by jointly applying standard and adversarial distillation, introducing an adversarial discriminator for each teacher to distinguish between target and generated anomaly maps. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks (Avenue, ShanghaiTech, UCSD Ped2), showing that our method is over 7 times faster than the fastest competing method, and between 28 and 62 times faster than object-centric models, while obtaining comparable results to recent methods. Our evaluation also indicates that our model achieves the best trade-off between speed and accuracy, due to its previously unheard-of speed of 1480 FPS. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive ablation study to justify our architectural design choices. Our code is freely available at: https://github.com/ristea/fast-aed.</description>
