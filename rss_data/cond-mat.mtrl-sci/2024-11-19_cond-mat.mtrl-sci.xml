      <title>Performance Evaluation of Deep,Near Ultraviolet Laser Assisted Atom Probes for a range of Material system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atom probe tomography (APT) enables near atomic scale three dimensional elemental mapping through the controlled field evaporation of surface atoms triggered by the combined application of a DC voltage and either voltage or laser pulses. As the selected laser wavelength for the atom probes transitioned from the near-infrared (1050 nm) to shorter wavelengths e.g., green (532 nm) and near ultraviolet, the quality of data improved and the range of materials amenable for analysis broadened. A new commercial laser atom probe with a wavelength of 257.5 nm, referred to as deep ultraviolet (DUV), has been recently launched. However, the effects of DUV lasers on different classes of materials have not yet been systematically investigated. In this study, a range of materials, including metals, semiconductor, and oxides, have been examined using commercial atom probes with different laser wavelengths but in principle comparable particle detection system. The quality of the NUV and DUV laser atom probe data is evaluated based on four key metrics: background, detection events, ion detection histogram, and mass-resolving power. Furthermore, the application of a thin coating to the finished APT specimens enhances the data quality for both laser wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Heterostructure and Interfacial Engineering for Low-Resistance Contacts to Ultra-Wide Bandgap AlGaN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the heterostructure and interfacial engineering of metalorganic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) grown reverse-graded contacts to ultra-wide bandgap AlGaN. A record low contact resistivity of 1.4 x 10-6 Ohm.cm2 was reported on an Al0.82Ga0.18N metal semiconductor field effect transistor (MESFET) by compositionally grading the contact layer from Al0.85Ga0.15N to Al0.14Ga0.86N with degenerate doping and proper interfacial engineering considering bandgap-narrowing-induced band offset between channel and contact layer. This represents orders-of-magnitude of lower contact resistivity than that obtained in similar MOCVD-grown structures. A detailed, layer-by-layer analysis of the reverse graded contact and TCAD simulation of the bandgap narrowing effect highlighted that the reverse graded contact layer itself is extremely conductive and interfacial resistance due to bandgap-narrowing-induced barrier between contact and channel dominates the contact resistance.</description>

      <title>Effects of Four-Phonon Scattering and Wave-like Phonon Tunneling Effects on Thermoelectric Properties of Mg2GeSe4 using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine-learning interatomic potential (MLIP) framework, which substantially accelerates the prediction of lattice thermal conductivity for both particle-like and wave-like thermal transport, including three-phonon and four-phonon scattering processes, and achieves speedups of five orders of magnitude compared to the conventional DFT calculations. We illustrate our approach through an in-depth study of Mg2GeSe4 as an exemplar thermoelectric material. Four phonon scattering is found to reduce lattice thermal conductivity by 22.5% at 300K and 26.7% at 900 K. The particle-like contribution to lattice thermal conductivity decreases, while the wave-like component increases with increasing temperature. The maximum figure of merit zT at 900K is found to be 0.49 for the n-type and 0.45 for the p-type Mg2GeSe4, respectively. Our analysis reveals that a substantial contribution to the Seebeck coefficient is driven by multi-band features in the valence band. Our study gives insight into the promising thermoelectric performance of Mg2GeSe4 and provides an efficient and accurate scheme for developing rational materials discovery strategies and practical applications of thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structures of Atomic Silicon Dimer Wires as a Function of Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bare silicon dimers on hydrogen-terminated Si(100) have two dangling bonds. These are atomically localized regions of high state density near to and within the bulk silicon band gap. We studied bare silicon dimers as monomeric units. Silicon dimer wires are much more stable than wires composed of individual dangling bonds. Dimer wires composed of 1 to 5 dimers were intentionally fabricated and characterised by STM techniques combined with density functional theory to provide detailed insights into geometric and electronic structure. Structural and dynamic qualities displayed by short wires were shown to be similar to the characteristics of a relatively long 37 dimer wire. Rather than adding two states into the band gap, experiment and theory reveal that each dimer adds one empty state into the gap and one filled state into the valence bands. Coupling among these states provides a conduction pathway with small bulk coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing Charge Dynamics in Amorphous Oxide Semiconductors by Time-of-flight Microwave Impedance Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unique electronic properties of amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin films are closely associated with the complex charge dynamics of the materials. Conventional studies of charge transport in a-IGZO usually involve steady-state or transient measurements on field-effect transistors. Here, we employed microwave impedance microscopy to carry out position-dependent time-of-flight (TOF) experiments on a-IGZO devices, which offer spatial and temporal information of the underlying transport dynamics. The drift mobility calculated from the delay time between carrier injection and onset of TOF response is 2 - 3 cm2/Vs, consistent with the field-effect mobility from device measurements. The spatiotemporal conductivity data can be nicely fitted to a two-step function, corresponding to two coexisting mechanisms with a typical timescale of milliseconds. The competition between multiple-trap-and-release conduction through band-tail states and hopping conduction through deep trap states is evident from the fitting parameters. The underlying length scale and time scale of charge dynamics in a-IGZO are of fundamental importance for transparent and flexible nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, as well as emerging back-end-of-line applications.</description>

      <title>Structural origins of ultra-low glass-like thermal conductivity in AgGaGe3Se8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with a low thermal conductivity are important for a variety of applications such as thermal barrier coatings and thermoelectrics, and understanding the underlying mechanisms of low heat transport, and relating them to structural features, remains a central goal within material science. Here, we report on the ultra-low thermal conductivity of the quarternary silver chalcogenide AgGaGe3Se8 with a remarkable value of only 0.2 Wm-1K-1 at room temperature, and an unusual glass-like thermal behavior from 2 K to 700 K. The ultra-low thermal conductivity is linked to a disordered nature of Ag in the structure, displaying extremely large Ag atomic displacement parameters obtained from multi-temperature synchrotron powder X-ray scattering measurements, and Ag ionic conductivity at elevated temperatures. Additionally, signs of structural anharmonicity and soft bonding are evident from a low temperature Boson peak in the heat capacity and a low Debye temperature of 147 K.</description>

      <title>Prolonging Carrier Lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC Epilayer by Thermal Oxidation and Hydrogen Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minority carrier lifetime of 25.46 $\mu$s in a P-type 4H-SiC epilayer has been attained through sequential thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing. Thermal oxidation can enhance the minority carrier lifetime in the 4H-SiC epilayer by reducing carbon vacancies. However, this process also generates carbon clusters with limited diffusivity and contributes to the enlargement of surface pits on the 4H-SiC. High-temperature hydrogen annealing effectively reduces stacking fault and dislocation density. Moreover, electron spin resonance analysis indicates a significant reduction in carbon vacancy defects after hydrogen annealing. The mechanisms of the elimination of carbon vacancies by hydrogen annealing include the decomposition of carbon clusters formed during thermal oxidation and the low-pressure selective etching by hydrogen, which increases the carbon content on the 4H-SiC surface and facilitates carbon diffusion. Consequently, the combination of thermal oxidation and hydrogen annealing eliminates carbon vacancies more effectively, substantially enhancing the minority carrier lifetime in P-type 4H-SiC. This improvement is advantageous for the application of high-voltage SiC bipolar devices.</description>

      <title>The Mechanism of Spin-Phonon Relaxation in Endohedral Metallofullene Single Molecule Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the first-ever investigation of spin-phonon coupling mechanisms in fullerene-based single-molecule magnets (SMMs) using ab initio CASSCF combined with DFT calculations. While lanthanide-based SMMs, particularly those with DyIII ions, are known for their impressive blocking temperatures and relaxation barriers, endohedral metallofullerene (EMFs) offer a unique platform for housing low-coordinated lanthanides within rigid carbon cages. We have explored the spin dynamics of in DyScS@C82 exhibiting among the highest blocking temperature (TB) reported. Through our computational analysis, we reveal that while the fullerene cage enhances crystal field splitting and provides structural stability without significantly contributing to spin-relaxation-driving low-energy phonons, the internal ionic motion emerges as the primary factor controlling spin relaxation and limiting blocking temperature. This computational investigation into the spin dynamics of EMF-based SMMs provides key insights into their magnetic behaviour for the first time an</description>

      <title>Weak Host Interactions Induced Thermal Transport Properties of Metal Halide Perovskites Deviating from the Rattling Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-frequency phonon branches of metal halide perovskites typically exhibit the characteristic of hardening with the increase of the cation mass, which leads to anomalous thermal transport phenomenon. However, the underlying physical mechanism is not yet understood. Here, we theoretically compare the thermal transport properties of $A_2$SnI$_6$ ($A$=K, Rb, and Cs) perovskites. The thermal transport in perovskites is widely explained using the rattling model, where ``guest'' cations inside the metal halide framework act as ``rattlers'', but this fails to explain the following phenomenon: The low-frequency phonon branch of $A_2$SnI$_6$ perovskites is insensitive to the mass of the $A^+$ cation and strongly correlated with the interaction of the $A^+$ cation with the I$^-$ anion in the octahedral structures. The failure of the rattling model stems mainly from the weak interactions between the octahedral structures. By developing a new spring model, we successfully explain the thermal transport behavior in $A_2$SnI$_6$ perovskites. Our work gives new insights into the thermal transport mechanism in metal halide perovskites, which has a guiding significance for designing extremely low thermal conductivity materials.</description>

      <title>Effect of Hubbard U corrections on the electronic and magnetic properties of 2D materials: A high-throughput study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic investigation of the role of Hubbard U corrections in electronic structure calculations of two-dimensional (2D) materials containing 3d transition metals. Specifically, we use density functional theory (DFT) with the PBE and PBE+U approximations to calculate the crystal structure, band gaps, and magnetic parameters of 638 monolayers. Based on a comprehensive comparison to experiments we first establish that inclusion of the U correction worsens the accuracy for the lattice constant. Consequently, PBE structures are used for subsequent property evaluations. The band gaps show significant dependence on the U-parameter. In particular, for 134 (21%) of the materials the U parameter leads to a metal-insulator transition. For the magnetic materials we calculate the magnetic moment, magnetic exchange coupling, and magnetic anisotropy parameters. In contrast to the band gaps, the size of the magnetic moments shows only weak dependence on U. Both the exchange energies and magnetic anisotropy parameters are systematically reduced by the U correction. On this basis we conclude that the Hubbard U correction will lead to lower predicted Curie temperatures in 2D materials. All the calculated properties are available in the Computational 2D Materials Database (C2DB).</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Study of Liquid Condensation on Nano-structured Sinusoidal Hybrid Wetting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although real surfaces exhibit intricate topologies at the nanoscale, rough surface consideration is often overlooked in nanoscale heat transfer studies. Superimposed sinusoidal functions effectively model the complexity of these surfaces. This study investigates the impact of sinusoidal roughness on liquid argon condensation over a functional gradient wetting (FGW) surface with 84% hydrophilic content using molecular dynamics simulations. Argon atoms are confined between two platinum substrates: a flat lower substrate heated to 130K and a rough upper substrate at 90K. Key metrics of the nanoscale condensation process, such as nucleation, surface heat flux, and total energy per atom, are analyzed. Rough surfaces significantly enhance nucleation, nearly doubling cluster counts compared to smooth surfaces and achieving a more extended atomic density profile with a peak of approximately and improved heat flux. Stronger atom-surface interactions also lead to more efficient energy dissipation. These findings underscore the importance of surface roughness in optimizing condensation and heat transfer, offering a more accurate representation of surface textures and a basis for designing surfaces that achieve superior heat transfer performance.</description>

      <title>Grain Selection Growth of Soft Metal in Electrochemical Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft metals like lithium and sodium play a critical role in battery technology owing to their high energy density. Texture formation by grain selection growth of soft metals during electrochemical processes is a crucial factor affecting power and safety. Developing a framework to understand and control grain growth is a multifaceted challenge. Here, a general thermodynamic theory and phase-field model are formulated to study grain selection growth of soft metals. Our study focuses on the interplay between surface energy and atomic mobility-related intrinsic strain energy in grain selection growth. Differences in grain selection growth arise from the anisotropy in surface energy and diffusion barrier of soft metal atoms. Our findings highlight the kinetic limitations of solid-state Li metal batteries, which originate from load stress-induced surface energy anisotropy. These insights lead to the development of an amorphous LixSi1-x (0.50&lt;x&lt;0.79) seed layer, improving the critical current density at room temperature for anode-free Li solid-state batteries through the control of grain selection growth.</description>

      <title>Twisted Type-II Rashba Homobilayer: A Platform for Tunable Topological Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of topological flat bands in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide homobilayers and multilayer graphene has sparked significant research interest. We propose a new platform for realizing tunable topological moire flat bands: twisted type-II Rashba homobilayers. The interplay between Rashba spin-orbit coupling and interlayer interactions generates an effective pseudo-antiferromagnetic field, opening a gap within the Dirac cone with non-zero Berry curvature. Using twisted BiTeI bilayers as an example, we predict the emergence of flat topological bands with a remarkably narrow bandwidth (below 20 meV). Notably, the system undergoes a transition from a valley Hall insulator to a quantum spin Hall insulator as the twisting angle increases. This transition arises from a competition between the twisting-driven effective spin-orbit coupling and sublattice onsite energies presented in type-II Rashba moir\'e structures. The high tunability of Rashba materials in terms of the spin-orbit coupling strength, interlayer interaction, and twisting angle expands the range of materials suitable for realizing and manipulating correlated topological properties.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-based phenomenological model for magnon transport in a multiferroic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons carriers of spin information can be controlled by electric fields in the multiferroic BiFeO$_3$ (BFO), a milestone that brings magnons closer to application in future devices. The origin of magnon-spin currents in BFO, however, is not fully understood due to BFO's complicated magnetic texture. In this letter, we present a phenomenological model to elucidate the existence of magnon spin currents in generalized multiferroics by examining the symmetries inherent to their magnetic and polar structures. This model is grounded in experimental data obtained from BFO and its derivatives, which informs the symmetry operations and resultant magnon behavior. By doing so, we address the issue of symmetry-allowed, switchable magnon spin transport in multiferroics, thereby establishing a critical framework for comprehending magnon transport within complex magnetic textures.</description>

      <title>Constructing accurate machine-learned potentials and performing highly efficient atomistic simulations to predict structural and thermal properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\text{Cu}_7\text{P}\text{S}_6$ compound has garnered significant attention due to its potential in thermoelectric applications. In this study, we introduce a neuroevolution potential (NEP), trained on a dataset generated from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, using the moment tensor potential (MTP) as a reference. The low root mean square errors (RMSEs) for total energy and atomic forces demonstrate the high accuracy and transferability of both the MTP and NEP. We further calculate the phonon density of states (DOS) and radial distribution function (RDF) using both machine learning potentials, comparing the results to density functional theory (DFT) calculations. While the MTP potential offers slightly higher accuracy, the NEP achieves a remarkable 41-fold increase in computational speed. These findings provide detailed microscopic insights into the dynamics and rapid Cu-ion diffusion, paving the way for future studies on Cu-based solid electrolytes and their applications in energy devices.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation of nuclear quantum effects on the phase transitions in BaTiO3 using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The machine learning potential (MLP) based molecular dynamics (MD) method was applied for constructing the pressure-temperature phase diagram in the barium titanate (BaTiO3) crystals. The nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) on the phase transitions were quantitatively evaluated from the difference in the phase transition pressures between the NQEs-incorporated and classical simulations. In this study, the quantum thermal bath (QTB) method was used for incorporating the NQEs. The constructed phase diagrams verified that the NQEs lower the phase transition temperatures and pressures. The NQEs are more significant at lower temperatures but cannot be ignored even at room temperature. The phase diagram in the QTB-based MLPMD is in good agreement with those of the previous studies based on dielectric measurements and path-integral based simulations. In addition, this study clarified that the large cell size (a 16x16x16 or larger cell) and friction coefficient (&gt;= 15 THz) are required for accurately reproducing the phase transitions during the QTB-MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Tunable Dirac nodal line in orthorhombic RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure evolution of RuO2 is studied using single-crystal x-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil cell, combined with \textit{ab initio} band-structure calculations. The tetragonal rutile structure transforms into the orthorhombic CaCl$_2$-type structure above 13 GPa under quasi-hydrostatic pressure conditions. This second-order transition is ferroelastic in nature and accompanied by tilts of the RuO$_6$ octahedra. Orthorhombic RuO$_2$ is expected to be paramagnetic metal, similar to ambient-pressure RuO$_2$. It shows the increased $t_{2g}-e_g$ crystal-field splitting that is responsible for the pressure-induced color change. It further features the Dirac nodal line that shifts across the Fermi level upon compression.</description>

      <title>Magnetocaloric effect near room temperature in chromium telluride (Cr2Te3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal telluride compositions are explored extensively for their unique magnetic behavior. Since chromium telluride (Cr2Te3) exhibits a near-room-temperature phase transition, the material can be effectively used in applications such as magnetic refrigeration. Compared to existing magnetocaloric materials, Heusler alloys, and rare-earth-based alloys, the large-scale synthesis of Cr2Te3 involves less complexity, resulting in a stable composition. Compared to existing tellurides, Cr2Te3 exhibited a large magnetic entropy change of 2.36 J/kg-K at a very small magnetic field of 0.1 T. The refrigeration capacity (RC) of 160 J/kg was determined from entropy change versus temperature curve. The results were comparable with the existing Cr compounds. The telluride system, Cr2Te3 compared to pure gadolinium, reveals an enhanced room temperature magnetocaloric effect (MCE) with a broad working temperature range. The heating cycle of MCE was successfully visualized using a thermal imaging setup. To confirm the observed magnetic properties of Cr2Te3, first-principles calculations were conducted. Through density functional theory (DFT) studies, we were able to determine both Curie temperature (TC) and Neel temperature (TN) which validated our experimental transitions at the same temperatures. Structural transition was also observed using first principles DFT calculation which is responsible for magnetic behavior.</description>

      <title>Toward a Better Understanding of the Photothermal Heating of High-Entropy-Alloy Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical approach, for the first time, to investigate optical and photothermal properties of high-entropy alloy nanoparticles with a focus on FeCoNi-based alloys. We systematically analyze the absorption spectra of spherical nanoparticles composed of pure metals and alloys in various surrounding media. Through comparison with experimental data, we select appropriate dielectric data for the constituent elements to accurately compute absorption spectra for FeCoNi-based high-entropy-alloy nanoparticles. Then, we predict the temperature rise over time within a substrate comprised of Fe nanoparticles exposed to solar irradiation and find quantitative agreement with experimental data for FeCoNi nanoparticles reported in previous studies. The striking similarity between the optical and photothermal behaviors of FeCoNi nanoparticles and their pure iron counterparts suggests that iron nanoparticles can effectively serve as a model for understanding the optical and thermal response of FeCoNi-based alloy nanoparticles. These findings offer a simplified approach for theoretical modeling of complex high-entropy alloys and provide valuable insights into their nanoscale optical behavior.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Metamaterial Stiffness Beyond Hashin-Shtrikman Upper Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its introduction more than 60 years ago, the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound has stood as the theoretical limit for the stiffness of isotropic composites and porous solids, acting as an important reference against which the moduli of heterogeneous structural materials are assessed. Here, we show through first-principles calculations, supported by finite element simulations, that the Hashin-Shtrikman upper bound can be exceeded by the isotropic elastic response of an anisotropic structure constructed from an anisotropic material. The material and structural anisotropies mutually reinforce each other to realize the overall isotropic response, without incurring the mass penalty faced by the hybridization of geometries with complementary anisotropies. 3 designs were investigated (plate BCC, plate FCC and plate SC) but only plate SC yielded a solution for the anisotropic properties of the material, which are remarkably similar to that of single crystal nickel and single crystal ferrite.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Electronic Exchange Behavior: Exploring Insights from Simple Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exchange couplings are fundamental to our understanding of many physical phenomena in condensed matter physics and material science. Model systems provide a controlled environment to investigate such phenomena, effectively. In this study, we employ first-principle calculations based on density functional theory and Green's function (GF) method to explore the impact of chemical structure on the sign and magnitude of exchange coupling, systematically. By designing model systems with bcc-Fe bulk doped with nonmagnetic X= (H, B, C, N, O, and F) atoms, we examine the effects of different ligands on the behavior of Fe-Fe exchange coupling, and demonstrate that the chemical environment surrounding the metal atom significantly influences the Fe-Fe exchange coupling. Our results highlight the tunability of exchange coupling based on Fe-dopant bond length(s), where the nature of ligand atoms and their electron correlation play a crucial role. This work illuminates the complex relationship between structure, and magnetism in magnetic materials, providing insights into the development of high-performance magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Tuneable large nonlinear charge transport driven by the quantum metric at room temperatures in TbMn6Sn6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear electrodynamics in materials manifests as an electronic response that depends on second- or higher-order powers of the applied electromagnetic field. This response is highly dependent on the underlying crystal symmetries in the material and is typically smaller than the linear responses. Nonlinear responses are therefore usually employed to expose the symmetry breaking, geometric properties of the electronic band structure in materials. Naturally, a material system with a strong nonlinear response is also the key component in nonlinear devices. Here we report the strong room-temperature second-harmonic transport response in a quantum magnet,TbMn6Sn6, which is governed by the quantum metric and can be tuned with applied magnetic fields and temperature. We show that around room temperature, which is close to the spontaneous spin-reorientation transition, the magnetic configurations, and therefore the related symmetry breaking phases, are easily controlled. Our results pave the way from quantum materials to high performance tuneable nonlinear device applications at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon associated carrier mobility in MgSe and MgTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon (E-p) coupling incorporated density functional theory (DFT) based investigation of structural, electronic and vibrational properties of bulk MgSe and MgTe is presented. Electron-phonon coupling is incorporated to understand its effect on charge carrier dynamics. It is observed that the MgTe possesses room temperature hole and electron mobility of 18.7 cm2/Vs and 335 cm2/Vs, respectively; in contrast to this, the bulk MgSe follows reverse trend in temperature dependent carrier mobilities owing to its different scattering rate and electron-phonon coupling profiles. The key feature of the study was to showcase the importance of electron-phonon coupling in determining the carrier mobility and the relative dynamics in the material. Further, the incorporation of e-p coupling softens the electronic and phonon dispersions which is subjected to the inclusion of the interaction between the electrons and the phonons of the systems. The overall results indicate that the incorporation of the electron-phonon coupling is crucial in determining the carrier dynamics of the system which is in excellent agreement with the experimental findings. Both materials possess moderate magnitudes of mobilities that are subjected to the modification by means of changing the dimensional confinement and/or chemical composition that can strongly influence the carrier dynamics by means of altered edge states and coupling parameters.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing low symmetry-based functions of materials at room temperature through isosymmetric electronic bistability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking is pivotal for controlling ferroelectric, ferroelastic and/or ferromagnetic functions of materials, which enables applications in sensors, memories, transducers or actuators. Commonly, ferroic phases emerge from descending symmetry-breaking, as the laws of thermodynamics dictate that the ordered low entropy phases form at low temperature, which limits practical applications of many materials at room temperature. Rare examples of ascending symmetry-breakings have been observed, but the driving force remains often unclear. Here, we report on a ferroelastic symmetry-breaking occurring at high temperature in a spin-crossover material, studied by magnetic, DSC and X-ray diffraction measurements. Our DFT calculations and our model, based on the Landau theory of phase transitions, explain how the cooperative thermal switching of molecular spin state drives a ferroelastic symmetry breaking at high temperature, through a coupled Jahn-Teller distortion. Ferroelastic materials have rich properties, with important applications in memory, multifunctional and novel controllable devices. The electronic bistability in soft functional materials represents an important source of entropy gain, capable of overcoming the cost of symmetry-breaking entropy, which opens up new perspectives for stabilizing high-temperature and low-symmetry ferroic functions of advanced materials</description>

      <title>Strongly Magnetically Tuned Exciton-Polaritons in van der Waals CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic semiconductors offer an ideal platform to achieve exciton-polaritons correlated with magnetic orders for developing solid-state quantum, spintronic, and photonic devices. However, in the as-demonstrated systems, the coupling strength, light velocity, and effective mass of exciton-polaritons are almost inert to the external magnetic field. Here, we report the experimental observation of giant magnetic tuning of B exciton-polaritons in vdW magnet CrSBr crystals. The Rabi splitting energy is tuned up to 100 meV within a moderate 0.45 T in-plane magnetic field due to changes in excitonic states during the spin transitions. Besides, the light velocity and effective mass of exciton-polaritons are tuned by 10.3% and 26.1% below 100 meV of exciton energy. Further, the strong coupling persists at room temperature, controlled by temperature-tailored exciton-magnon and exciton-phonon coupling. These results advance the development of on-demand strong coupling systems for spin-correlated quantum optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11585v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed (hcp) cadmium, which keep their linear out-of-plane and quadratic inplane dispersions up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Computational guide to optimize electric conductance in MoS$_2$ films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum disulfide (MoS$_2$) is a high-potential material for nanoelectronic applications, especially when thinned to a few layers. Liquid phase exfoliation enables large-scale fabrication of thin films comprising single- and few-layer flakes of MoS$_2$ or other transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), exhibiting variations in flake size, geometry, edge terminations, and overlapping areas. Electronic conductivity of such films is thus determined by two contributions: the intraflake conductivity, reflecting the value of each single layer, and charge transport across these overlapping flakes. Employing first-principles simulations, we investigate the influence of various edge terminations and of the overlap between flakes on the charge transport in MoS$_2$ film models. We identify characteristic electronic edge states originating from the edge atoms and their chemical environment, which resemble donor and acceptor states of doped semiconductors. This makes either electrons or holes to majority carriers and enables selective control over the dominant charge carrier type (n-type or p-type). Compared to pristine nanosheets, overlapping flakes exhibit lower overall conductance. In the best performing hexagonal flakes occurring in Mo-rich environments, the conductance is reduced by 20% compared to the pristine layer, while the drop by 40%, and 50% is predicted for truncated triangular, and triangular flakes, respectively in S-rich environments. An overlap of 6.5 nm is sufficient to achieve the highest possible interflake conductance. These findings allow for a rational optimization of experimental conditions for the preparation of MoS$_2$ and other TMDC semiconducting thin films.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial growth of mono- and (twisted) multilayer graphene on SiC(0001)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To take full advantage of twisted bilayers of graphene or other two-dimensional materials, it is essential to precisely control the twist angle between the stacked layers, as this parameter determines the properties of the heterostructure. In this context, a growth routine using borazine as a surfactant molecule on SiC(0001) surfaces has been reported, leading to the formation of high-quality epitaxial graphene layers that are unconventionally oriented, i.e., aligned with the substrate lattice (G-$R0^\circ$) [Bocquet et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 125, 106102 (2020)]. Since the G-$R0^\circ$ layer sits on a buffer layer, also known as zeroth-layer graphene (ZLG), which is rotated $30^\circ$ with respect to the SiC substrate and still covalently bonded to it, decoupling the ZLG-$R30^\circ$ from the substrate can lead to high-quality twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Here we report the decoupling of ZLG-$R30^\circ$ by increasing the temperature during annealing in a borazine atmosphere. While this converts ZLG-$R30^\circ$ to G-$R30^\circ$ and thus produces tBLG, the growth process at elevated temperature is no longer self-limiting, so that the surface is covered by a patchwork of graphene multilayers of different thicknesses. We find a 20% coverage of tBLG on ZLG, while on the rest of the surface tBLG sits on one or more additional graphene layers. In order to achieve complete coverage with tBLG only, alternative ways of decoupling the ZLG, e.g., by intercalation with suitable atoms, may be advantageous.</description>

      <title>Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCx24): Bridging Experiments and Computational Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for low-cost, durable, and effective catalysts is essential for green hydrogen production and carbon dioxide upcycling to help in the mitigation of climate change. Discovery of new catalysts is currently limited by the gap between what AI-accelerated computational models predict and what experimental studies produce. To make progress, large and diverse experimental datasets are needed that are reproducible and tested at industrially-relevant conditions. We address these needs by utilizing a comprehensive high-throughput characterization and experimental pipeline to create the Open Catalyst Experiments 2024 (OCX24) dataset. The dataset contains 572 samples synthesized using both wet and dry methods with X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction characterization. We prepared 441 gas diffusion electrodes, including replicates, and evaluated them using zero-gap electrolysis for carbon dioxide reduction (CO$_2$RR) and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) at current densities up to $300$ mA/cm$^2$. To find correlations with experimental outcomes and to perform computational screens, DFT-verified adsorption energies for six adsorbates were calculated on $\sim$20,000 inorganic materials requiring 685 million AI-accelerated relaxations. Remarkably from this large set of materials, a data driven Sabatier volcano independently identified Pt as being a top candidate for HER without having any experimental measurements on Pt or Pt-alloy samples. We anticipate the availability of experimental data generated specifically for AI training, such as OCX24, will significantly improve the utility of computational models in selecting materials for experimental screening.</description>

      <title>Energy shifts and broadening of excitonic resonances in electrostatically-doped semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tuning the density of resident electrons or holes in semiconductors provides crucial insight into the composition of excitonic complexes that are observed as absorption or photoluminescence resonances in optical studies. Moreover, we can change the way these resonances shift and broaden in energy by controlling the quantum numbers of the resident carriers with magnetic fields and doping levels, and by selecting the quantum numbers of the photoexcited or recombining electron-hole (e-h) pair through optical polarization. We discuss the roles of distinguishability and optimality of excitonic complexes, showing them to be key ingredients that determine the energy shifts and broadening of optical resonances in charge-tunable semiconductors. A distinguishable e-h pair means that the electron and hole undergoing photoexcitation or recombination have quantum numbers that are not shared by any of the resident carriers. An optimal excitonic complex refers to a complex whose particles come with all available quantum numbers of the resident carriers. All optical resonances may be classified as either distinct or indistinct depending on the distinguishability of the e-h pair, and the underlying excitonic complex can be classified as either optimal or suboptimal. The universality of these classifications, inherited from the fundamental Pauli exclusion principle, allows us to understand how optical resonances shift in energy and whether they should broaden as doping is increased. This understanding is supported by conclusive evidence that the decay of optical resonances cannot be simply attributed to enhanced screening when resident carriers are added to a semiconductor. Finally, applying the classification scheme in either monolayer or moire heterobilayer systems, we relate the energy shift and amplitude of the neutral exciton resonance to the compressibility of the resident carrier gas.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of Hierarchical Sapphire Nanostructures using Ultrafast Laser Induced Morphology Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sapphire is an attractive material in photonic, optoelectronic, and transparent ceramic applications that stand to benefit from surface functionalization effects stemming from micro/nanostructures. Here we investigate the use of ultrafast lasers for fabricating nanostructures in sapphire by exploring the relationship between irradiation parameters, morphology change, and selective etching. In this approach an ultrafast laser pulse is focused on the sapphire substrate to change the crystalline morphology to amorphous or polycrystalline, which is characterized by examining different vibrational modes using Raman spectroscopy. The irradiated regions are then removed using a subsequent wet etch in hydrofluoric acid. Laser confocal measurements conducted before and after the etching process quantify the degree of selective etching. The results indicate that a threshold laser pulse intensity is required for selective etching to occur. This process can be used to fabricate hierarchical sapphire nanostructures over large areas with enhanced hydrophobicity, which exhibits an apparent contact angle of 140 degrees and a high roll-off angle that are characteristic of the rose petal effect. Additionally, the fabricated structures have high broadband diffuse transmittance of up to 81.8% with low loss, which can find applications in optical diffusers. Our findings provide new insights into the interplay between the light-matter interactions, where Raman shifts associated with different vibrational modes can be used as a predictive measure of selective etching. These results advance the development of sapphire nanostructure fabrication, which can find applications in infrared optics, protective windows, and consumer electronics.</description>

      <title>Visualization of Mesoscopic Conductivity Fluctuations in Amorphous Semiconductor Thin-Film Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transport in amorphous semiconductors is considerably more complicated than process in crystalline materials due to abundant localized states. In addition to device-scale characterization, spatially resolved measurements are important to unveil electronic properties. Here, we report gigahertz conductivity mapping in amorphous indium gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistors by microwave impedance microscopy (MIM), which probes conductivity without Schottky barrier's influence. The difference between dc and microwave conductivities reflects the efficacy of the injection barrier in an accumulation-mode transistor. The conductivity exhibits significant nanoscale inhomogeneity in the subthreshold regime, presumably due to trapping and releasing from localized states. The characteristic length scale of local fluctuations, as determined by autocorrelation analysis, is about 200 nm. Using random-barrier model, we can simulate the spatial variation of potential landscape, which underlies the mesoscopic conductivity distribution. Our work provides an intuitive way to understand the charge transport mechanism in amorphous semiconductors at microscopic level.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Electrical Circuit Analysis: Applications in Dielectric Material Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific machine learning (SciML) represents a significant advancement in integrating machine learning (ML) with scientific methodologies. At the forefront of this development are Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which offer a promising approach by incorporating physical laws directly into the learning process, thereby reducing the need for extensive datasets. However, when data is limited or the system becomes more complex, PINNs can face challenges, such as instability and difficulty in accurately fitting the training data. In this article, we explore the capabilities and limitations of the DeepXDE framework, a tool specifically designed for implementing PINNs, in addressing both forward and inverse problems related to dielectric properties. Using RC circuit models to represent dielectric materials in HVDC systems, we demonstrate the effectiveness of PINNs in analyzing and improving system performance. Additionally, we show that applying a logarithmic transformation to the current (ln(I)) significantly enhances the stability and accuracy of PINN predictions, especially in challenging scenarios with sparse data or complex models. In inverse mode, however, we faced challenges in estimating key system parameters, such as resistance and capacitance, in more complex scenarios with longer time domains. This highlights the potential for future work in improving PINNs through transformations or other methods to enhance performance in inverse problems. This article provides pedagogical insights for those looking to use PINNs in both forward and inverse modes, particularly within the DeepXDE framework.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mold: overcoming the time constraints of molecular dynamics on general-purpose hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations has been intimately linked to that of computing hardware. For decades following the creation of MD, simulations have improved with computing power along the three principal dimensions of accuracy, atom count (spatial scale), and duration (temporal scale). Since the mid-2000s, computer platforms have however failed to provide strong scaling for MD as scale-out CPU and GPU platforms that provide substantial increases to spatial scale do not lead to proportional increases in temporal scale. Important scientific problems therefore remained inaccessible to direct simulation, prompting the development of increasingly sophisticated algorithms that present significant complexity, accuracy, and efficiency challenges. While bespoke MD-only hardware solutions have provided a path to longer timescales for specific physical systems, their impact on the broader community has been mitigated by their limited adaptability to new methods and potentials. In this work, we show that a novel computing architecture, the Cerebras Wafer Scale Engine, completely alters the scaling path by delivering unprecedentedly high simulation rates up to 1.144M steps/second for 200,000 atoms whose interactions are described by an Embedded Atom Method potential. This enables direct simulations of the evolution of materials using general-purpose programmable hardware over millisecond timescales, dramatically increasing the space of direct MD simulations that can be carried out.</description>

      <title>Stability frontiers in the AM$_6$X$_6$ kagome metals; The LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Lu,Y) family and density-wave transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kagome motif is a versatile platform for condensed matter physics, hosting rich interactions between magnetic, electronic, and structural degrees of freedom. In recent years, the discovery of a charge density wave (CDW) in the AV$_3$Sb$_5$ superconductors and structurally-derived bond density waves in FeGe and ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ have stoked the search for new kagome platforms broadly exhibiting density wave (DW) transitions. In this work, we evaluate the known AM$_6$X$_6$ chemistries and construct a stability diagram that summarizes the structural relationships between the $\approx$125 member family. Subsequently we introduce our discovery of the broader LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ (Ln:Ce-Nd,Sm,Gd-Tm,Lu,Y) family of kagome metals and an analogous DW transition in LuNb$_6$Sn$_6$. Our X-ray scattering measurements clearly indicate a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) ordering wave vector ($\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}\times3$ superlattice) and diffuse scattering on half-integer $L$-planes. Our analysis of the structural data supports the ``rattling mode'' DW model proposed for ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ and paints a detailed picture of the steric interactions between the rare-earth filler element and the host Nb-Sn kagome scaffolding. We also provide a broad survey of the magnetic properties within the HfFe$_6$Ge$_6$-type LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ members, revealing a number of complex antiferromagnetic and metamagnetic transitions throughout the family. This work integrates our new LnNb$_6$Sn$_6$ series of compounds into the broader AM$_6$X$_6$ family, providing new material platforms and forging a new route forward at the frontier of kagome metal research.</description>

      <title>Systematic characterization of nanoscale $h$-BN quantum sensor spots created by helium-ion microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nanosized boron vacancy ($V_\mathrm{B}^-$) defect spot in hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) is promising for a local magnetic field quantum sensor. One of its advantages is that a helium-ion microscope can make a spot at any location in an $h$-BN flake with nanometer accuracy. In this study, we investigate the properties of the created nanosized $V_\mathrm{B}^-$ defect spots by systematically varying three conditions: the helium-ion dose, the thickness of the $h$-BN flakes, and the substrate on which the $h$-BN flakes are attached. The physical background of the results obtained is successfully interpreted using Monte Carlo calculations. From the findings obtained here, a guideline for their optimal creation conditions is obtained to maximize its performance as a quantum sensor concerning sensitivity and localization.</description>

Abstract: We report the observation of a light-induced subpicosecond topological phase transition in the antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetal EuAgAs, achieved through precise manipulation of its magnetic configuration. Using ultrafast optical spectroscopy, we probe the nonequilibrium carrier dynamics and reveal a magnetic-order-driven transition between distinct topological states. Our results demonstrate that EuAgAs, with its highly tunable magnetic structure, offers a unique platform for exploring topological phase transitions, distinct from conventional methods like Floquet engineering, coherent-phonon excitation, and lattice structural modifications. These results underscore the potential of ultrashort optical pulses as powerful tools for real-time control of topological phases, opening pathways for advances in spintronics, quantum computing, and energy-efficient information technologies.</description>

      <title>Strongly Anisotropic Charge Dynamics in La3Ni2O7 with Coherent-to-Incoherent Crossover of Interlayer Charge Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an optical spectroscopy study of the charge-dynamics anisotropy in the La3Ni2O7 single crystals with the electric field of the incident light parallel to the crystalline c-axis and ab-plane respectively. The evolution of the low-energy part of its c-axis optical conductivity spectra ({\sigma}1c({\omega})) from a Drude component to a finite-energy peak, together with the change in the c-axis electron mean-free-path which is distinctly longer than the c-axis lattice constant at 10 K but is shorter than the c-axis lattice constant at 300 K, demonstrates a crossover from coherent to incoherent interlayer charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7, which is associated with the variation from weak to strong dissipation within its ab-plane. In contrast, the Drude component robust in its {\sigma}1ab({\omega}) and the long ab-plane electron mean-free-path greater than the a-axis and b-axis unit-cell lengths manifest the persistence of coherent in-plane charge dynamics from 10 to 300 K. Thus, the charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7 shows a remarkable anisotropy at high temperatures. At low temperatures, the large values of the ratio between the ab-plane and c-axis Drude weights and the ratio {\sigma}1ab({\omega} -&gt; 0)/{\sigma}1c({\omega} -&gt; 0) indicate a strong anisotropy of the low-temperature charge dynamics in La3Ni2O7.</description>

      <title>A Data-Efficient Sequential Learning Framework for Melt Pool Defect Classification in Laser Powder Bed Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the quality and reliability of Metal Additive Manufacturing (MAM) components is crucial, especially in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF) process, where melt pool defects such as keyhole, balling, and lack of fusion can significantly compromise structural integrity. This study presents SL-RF+ (Sequentially Learned Random Forest with Enhanced Sampling), a novel Sequential Learning (SL) framework for melt pool defect classification designed to maximize data efficiency and model accuracy in data-scarce environments. SL-RF+ utilizes RF classifier combined with Least Confidence Sampling (LCS) and Sobol sequence-based synthetic sampling to iteratively select the most informative samples to learn from, thereby refining the model's decision boundaries with minimal labeled data. Results show that SL-RF+ outperformed traditional machine learning models across key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, demonstrating significant robustness in identifying melt pool defects with limited data. This framework efficiently captures complex defect patterns by focusing on high-uncertainty regions in the process parameter space, ultimately achieving superior classification performance without the need for extensive labeled datasets. While this study utilizes pre-existing experimental data, SL-RF+ shows strong potential for real-world applications in pure sequential learning settings, where data is acquired and labeled incrementally, mitigating the high costs and time constraints of sample acquisition.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Chiral Majorana Edge States and Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Two-Dimensional Nonsymmorphic Dirac Semimetal/Superconductor Heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Dirac semimetals are renowned for the host of singular symmetry-protected band degeneracies which can give rise to other exotic phases. In this work, we consider a two-dimensional Dirac semimetal stabilized by PT symmetry and nonsymmorphic symmetries. We find that an out-of-plane Zeeman field can lift the Dirac points and transform the system into a Chern insulator with chiral edge states. By placing the nonsymmorphic Dirac semimetal in proximity to an s-wave superconductor, we uncover that chiral topological superconductors with large Chern numbers can be achieved. In addition, we find that topologically-protected Bogoliubov Fermi surface can also emerge in this system, due to the coexistence of inversion symmetry and particle-hole symmetry. Notably, we find that the chiral Majorana edge state persists even when the Chern number becomes ill-defined due to the appearance of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. The impact of these Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces on the thermal Hall effects is also investigated. Our study not only identifies a class of materials capable of realizing topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces through conventional s-wave superconductivity, but also uncovers an exotic phase where chiral Majorana edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces coexist.</description>

      <title>Emergence of giant spin-orbit torque in a two-dimensional hole gas on the hydrogen-terminated diamond surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carrier systems exhibit various significant physical phenomena for electronics and spintronics, where one of the most promising traits is efficient spin-to-charge conversion stemming from their Rashba-type spin-orbit interaction. Meanwhile, a nuisance in quests of promising materials for spintronics application is that vast majority of the investigated platforms consists of rare and/or toxic elements, such as Pt and Te, which hinders progress of spin conversion physics in view of element strategy and green technology. Here, we show the emergence of giant spin-orbit torque driven by 2D hole gas at the surface of hydrogen-terminated diamond, where the constituent substances are ubiquitous elements, carbon and hydrogen. The index of its spin torque efficiency at room temperature is several times greater than that of rare metal, Pt, the benchmark system/element for spin-to-charge conversion. Our finding opens a new pathway for more sustainable spintronics and spin-orbitronics applications, with efficient spin-orbit torque employing ubiquitous non-toxic elements.</description>

      <title>Imaging half-unit-cell Cooper-pair density waves in monolayer 1T$^{\prime}$-MoTe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors that spontaneously break space-group symmetries of their underlying crystal lattice are distinguished by spatial modulations of the superconducting order parameter. These states have recently captured significant attention in various strongly correlated materials, where the breaking of translational or intra-unit-cell symmetries results in the emergence of pair density waves with wavelengths extending across one or multiple unit cells. Here, we employ a spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscope to identify robust half-unit-cell modulations of the superconducting gap magnitude, coherence strength and subgap states in tunable 1T$^{\prime}$-MoTe$_2$ monolayer. The modulations are oriented perpendicular to the zigzag Mo chains and coexist with three-unit-cell primary pair density wave modulations along the Mo chains, both of which attenuate with increasing temperature and the application of external magnetic fields. Importantly, we find that the superconductivity modulations are strongly linked to unconventional electron pairing mechanisms, which significantly deviate from the Cooper pairing observed in traditional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductors. Our results advance the knowledge of Cooper-pair density modulations and the intricate interplay with other symmetry-breaking states in strongly correlated superconductors.</description>

      <title>Multi-topological phases of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of topological phases of matter and topological boundary states had tremendous impact on condensed matter physics and photonics, where topological phases are defined via energy bands, giving rise to topological band theory. However, topological systems that cannot be described by band topology but still support non-trivial boundary states are little-known and largely unexplored. Here, we uncover a new kind of topological phase of matter named "multi-topological phase" (MTP) that features multiple sets of boundary states, where each set is associated with one distinct topological invariant. Unlike conventional topological phase transitions, the MTP transitions can occur without band-gap closing. We present typical examples of MTPs in a one-dimensional topological insulator and a two-dimensional higher-order topological insulator, where the systems are otherwise trivial according to band topology. Furthermore, MTPs can exist also in indirectly gapped Chern insulators, beyond the regime where the conventional bulk-boundary correspondence predicts the existence of boundary states. Experimentally, we demonstrate the first two examples of MTPs in laser-written photonic lattices. Our findings constitute a fundamental advance in topological physics and provide a route for designing novel topological materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of giant nonlinear Hall conductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a system of two-dimensional electrons, a combination of broken symmetry, interactions, and nontrivial topology can conspire to give rise to a nonlinear transport regime, where electric current density scales as the square of electric field. This regime has become a venue for exciting discoveries such as the nonlinear Hall effect and diode-like nonreciprocal transport. However, interpretation of experimental data is challenging in the nonlinear regime as DC transport is described by a rank-3 conductivity tensor with 6 free parameters. Here, we resolve this challenge by analytically solving for the nonlinear potential distribution across the disk sample for an arbitrary linear and nonlinear conductivity tensors. This allows us to unambiguously extract all components of the nonlinear tensor from experimental measurement. Using this novel tool, we identify giant nonlinear Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene. Our methodology provides the first systematic framework for interpreting nonlinear transport and uncovers a new route towards understanding quasi-2D materials.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Emitter Characterization with Latent Neural Ordinary Differential Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network models can be used to learn complex dynamics from data and reconstruct sparse or noisy signals, thereby accelerating and augmenting experimental measurements. Evaluating the quantum optical properties of solid-state single-photon emitters is a time-consuming task that typically requires interferometric photon correlation experiments, such as Photon correlation Fourier spectroscopy (PCFS) which measures time-resolved single emitter lineshapes. Here, we demonstrate a latent neural ordinary differential equation model that can forecast a complete and noise-free PCFS experiment from a small subset of noisy correlation functions. By encoding measured photon correlations into an initial value problem, the NODE can be propagated to an arbitrary number of interferometer delay times. We demonstrate this with 10 noisy photon correlation functions that are used to extrapolate an entire de-noised interferograms of up to 200 stage positions, enabling up to a 20-fold speedup in experimental acquisition time from $\sim$3 hours to 10 minutes. Our work presents a new approach to greatly accelerate the experimental characterization of novel quantum emitter materials using deep learning.</description>

      <title>Spin-glass ground states in the frustrated pyrochlore and fluorite antiferromagnets NaCd$M_2$F$_7$ ($M$ = Ni$^{2+}$, Mn$^{2+}$)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the crystal structures, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of two magnetically frustrated $A$'$A$"$M_2$F$_7$-type antiferromagnets, NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ and NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$. While NaCdNi$_2$F$_7$ forms a stable pyrochlore structure (SG: $Fd \overline{3} m$, #227) with magnetic $S$ = 1 Ni$^{2+}$ ions on the frustrated pyrochlore 16$c$ site and fully disordered non-magnetic Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ions on the pyrochlore 16$d$ site, NaCdMn$_2$F$_7$ favors the defect-fluorite structure (SG: $Fm \overline{3} m$, #225) with magnetic $S$ = 5/2 Mn$^{2+}$ and non-magnetic Na$^+$ and Cd$^{2+}$ ions fully disordered on the fluorite 4$a$ site. This is a result of the Mn$^{2+}$ ionic radius being too close to the average Na$^+$/Cd$^{2+}$ ionic radius, hindering the cationic site ordering towards the stable pyrochlore structure. In both cases, dominant antiferromagnetic interactions $\theta_{CW,Ni}$ = -91.2(5) K and $\theta_{CW,Mn}$ = -42.4(4) K are noted, with no magnetic transition until $T_{f,Ni}$ = 3.2 K and $T_{f,Mn}$ = 2.0 K, implying substantial frustration, with frustration indices $f_{Ni}$ = 28.5 and $f_{Mn}$ = 21. AC susceptibility measurements and bifurcation of ZFC/FC low-field magnetization indicate a glassy ground-state, precipitated by the magnetic-bond-disorder stemming from the inherent structural disorder.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Sondheimer oscillations of conductivity in thin cadmium crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11586v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decades ago, Sondheimer discovered that the electric conductivity of metallic crystals hosting ballistic electrons oscillates with magnetic field. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field and the period proportional to the sample thickness, have been understood in a semi-classical framework. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thickness varying between 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m. When the magnetic field is sufficiently large or the sample sufficiently thick, the amplitude of oscillation falls off as $B^{-4}$ as previously reported. In contrast, the ten first oscillations follow a $B^{-2.5}e^{-B/B_0}$ field dependence and their amplitude is set by the quantum of conductance, the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We demonstrate that they are beyond the semi-classical picture, as the exponential prefactor indicates quantum tunneling between distinct quantum states. We draw a picture of these quantum oscillations, in which the linear dispersion of the semi-Dirac band in the cadmium plays a crucial role. The oscillations arise by the intersection between the lowest Landau tube and flat toroids on the Fermi surface induced by confinement. Positive and negative corrections to semi-classical magneto-conductance can occur by alternation between destructive and constructive interference in phase-coherent helical states. The quantum limit of Sondheimer oscillations emerges as another manifestation of Aharanov-Bohm flux quantization.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of synthetic molecules whose architectures are generated by space transformations from a point group acting on seed resonators. We show that the dynamical matrix of any such molecule can be reproduced as the left regular representation of a self-adjoint element from the stabilized group's algebra. Furthermore, we use elements of representation theory and K-theory to rationalize the dynamical features supported by such synthetic molecules up to topological equivalences. These tools enable us to identify a set of fundamental models which generate by superposition all possible dynamical matrices up to homotopy equivalences. Interpolations between these fundamental models give rise to topological spectral flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-resolved dispersion dependencies for the topological insulator Mn$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$Bi$_2$Te$_4$ in the $\bar{\rm K}\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}'$ path of the Brillouin zone were studied by spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy using laser radiation (Laser Spin-ARPES) with variation of the concentration of substitutional Ge atoms (x from 0.1 to 0.8) for in-plane ($s_x$) and out-of-plane ($s_z$) spin orientation. The formation of Rashba-like states is shown, which shift to lower energies with increasing Ge concentration. In the region of Ge concentrations from 50% to 75%, the contribution of these states to the formed spin-dependent dispersions becomes predominant. A pronounced in-plane ($s_y$) spin polarization, asymmetric for opposite $\pm k_\parallel$ directions, is revealed for the Dirac cone states, while the Rashba-like states exhibit a pronounced asymmetry in both in-plane ($s_y$) and out-of-plane ($s_z$) spin polarizations. Theoretical calculations confirmed the asymmetric polarization of the Rashba-like states formed in the $\bar{\rm K}\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}'$ path of the BZ, simultaneously for in-plane and out-of-plane spin orientation. Constant energy maps for Rashba-like states show a pronounced $s_z$ spin component along the $\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm K}$ direction, with a sign change as the contour crosses the $\bar{\Gamma}\bar{\rm M}$ direction. The observed spin polarization can influence the development of spin devices based on magnetic topological insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundant chemical compositions in ternary hydrides bring much more possibility to explore high temperature superconductors under lower pressure. Here we constructed 115 ternary hydrides on the basis of the elements substitution using 16 metal elements within 5 reported prototype structures. We conducted a three-step approach to screen and study these candidate structures in the aspects of dynamical stability, formation energy and relative enthalpy, respectively. Based on this approach, we found three meta-stable compounds with hydrogen clathrate cages in the space group of P-3m1, including Y2CdH18, Y2InH18 and Ca2SnH18. All of the structures are superconductive under high pressure with Tc above 110 K, which is larger than the superconductive temperature of liquid nitrogen. Our study enriches the database of novel ternary hydrides under high pressure, and provides insight for future theoretical and experimental researches.</description>

Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. Although, understanding of the microscopic mechanism behind the observed softening is still an open question, present analysis strongly suggest sub-ppb level of neutral single-atomic vacancies or other unspecified non-magnetic vacancy concentrations in all investigated diamonds. Our findings also open new avenues for the quantitative determination of non-magnetic vacancies in diamonds, an important information needed for their potential application as a substrate for quantum computers and next-generation semiconductor devices.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations of quantum spins play a crucial role in the emergence of exotic magnetic phases and excitations. The lack of the charge degree of freedom in insulating quantum magnets, however, precludes such fluctuations from mediating electronic transport. Here we show that the quantum fluctuations of a localized frustrated magnet induce strong proximitized charge transport of the conduction electrons in a synthetic heterostructure comprising an epitaxial $\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ ultrathin film on the single crystal of $\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$. The proximity effects are evidenced by the scaling behavior of the $\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ resistance in correspondance with the dynamic scaling of the dynamic spin correlation function of $\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$, which is a result of quantum fluctuations near a multi-phase quantum critical point. The proximitized transport in $\rm{Bi_{2}Ir_{2}O_{7}}$ can be effectively tuned by magnetic field through suppressing the quantum spin fluctuations as well as inducing transitions via magnetic anisotropy in $\rm{Yb_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$.

      <title>Ideal Spin-Orbit-Free Dirac Semimetal and Diverse Topological Transitions in Pr$_8$CoGa$_3$ Family</title>

Abstract: Topological semimetals, known for their intriguing properties arising from band degeneracies, have garnered significant attention. However, the discovery of a material realization and the detailed characterization of spinless Dirac semimetals have not yet been accomplished. Here, we propose from first-principles calculations that the $RE_8\mathrm{Co}X_3$ group ($RE$ = rare earth elements, $X$ = Al, Ga, or In) contains ideal spinless Dirac semimetals whose Fermi surfaces are fourfold degenerate band-crossing points (without including spin degeneracy). Despite the lack of space inversion symmetry in these materials, Dirac points are formed on the rotation-symmetry axis due to accidental degeneracies of two bands corresponding to different 2-dimensional irreducible representations of $C_{6v}$ group. We also investigate, through first-principles calculations and effective model analysis, various phase transitions caused by lattice distortion or elemental substitutions from the Dirac semimetal phase to distinct topological semimetallic phases such as nonmagnetic linked-nodal-line and Weyl semimetals (characterized by the second Stiefel-Whitney class) and ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Spintronic devices and applications using noncollinear chiral antiferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01977v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic materials have a vanishingly small net magnetization, which generates weak dipolar fields and makes them robust against external magnetic perturbation and rapid magnetization dynamics, as dictated by the geometric mean of their exchange and anisotropy energies. However, experimental and theoretical techniques to detect and manipulate the antiferromagnetic order in a fully electrical manner must be developed to enable advanced spintronic devices with antiferromagnets (AFMs) as their active spin-dependent elements. Among the various AFMs, conducting AFMs offer high electrical and thermal conductivities and strong electron-spin-phonon interactions. Noncollinear metallic AFMs with negative chirality, including Mn3Sn, Mn3Ge, and Mn3GaN, offer rich physics that arises from their topology. In this review article, we introduce the crystal structure and the physical phenomena observed in negative chirality AFMs. Experimental and theoretical advances related to current-induced dynamics on the spin structure of Mn3Sn are discussed. We then present a potential AFM spintronic device that can serve as a non-volatile memory, high-frequency signal generator, neuron emulator, and even a probabilistic bit, depending on the design parameters and the input stimuli, i.e., amplitude and pulse width of the injected spin current and the external magnetic field. In this device, spin-orbit torques can be used to manipulate the order parameter, while the device state can be read via tunneling magnetoresistance. We also present analytic models that relate the performance characteristics of the device with its design parameters, thus enabling a rapid technology-device assessment. Effects of Joule heating and thermal noise on the device characteristics are briefly discussed. We close the paper by summarizing the status of research and present our outlook in this rapidly evolving research field.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of atomic structures with prior probabilities from universal interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimization of atomic structures plays a pivotal role in understanding and designing materials with desired properties. However, conventional computational methods often struggle with the formidable task of navigating the vast potential energy surface, especially in high-dimensional spaces with numerous local minima. Recent advancements in machine learning-driven surrogate models offer a promising avenue for alleviating this computational burden. In this study, we propose a novel approach that combines the strengths of universal machine learning potentials with a Bayesian approach using Gaussian processes. By using the machine learning potentials as priors for the Gaussian process, the Gaussian process has to learn only the difference between the machine learning potential and the target energy surface calculated for example by density functional theory. This turns out to improve the speed by which the global optimal structure is identified across diverse systems for a well-behaved machine learning potential. The approach is tested on periodic bulk materials, surface structures, and a cluster.</description>

      <title>The resistivity of rare earth impurities diluted in Lanthanum (Part I)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study the temperature independent resistivity of rare-earth magnetic (Gd, Tb, Dy) and non-magnetic (Lu) impurities diluted in dhcp Lanthanum. We considered a two-band system where the conduction is entirely due to $s$-electrons while the screening of the charge difference induced by the impurity is made by the $d$-electrons. We obtain an expression of the resistivity using the $T$-matrix formalism from the Dyson equation. As the electronic properties depend strongly on the band structure, we have considered two types of bands structure, a "parabolic" band and a more realistic one calculated by first principles with VASP. We verify that the exchange parameters appearing as cross products strongly affect the magnitude of the spin resistivity term; And that the role of the band structure in resonant scattering or virtual bound states, depends on the band structure. Our study, also includes the influence of the translational symmetry breaking and the excess charge introduced by the {\it rare-earth} impurity on the resitivity.</description>

      <title>Tensor-involved peridynamics: A unified framework for isotropic and anisotropic materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce tensor involved peridynamics, a unified framework for simulating both isotropic and anisotropic materials. While traditional peridynamics models effectively simulate isotropic materials, they face challenges with anisotropic materials and are prone to instability caused by zero energy modes. Our novel model extend the linear bond based peridynamics framework by incorporating the elastic tensor into the micrmodulus function, thereby ensuring stability for anisotropic materials without the need for additional corrections. For isotropic materials. the model mantains compatibility with conventional bond based peridynamics, assuming Possion's rations of 1/4 in 3D and 1/3 in 2D.Numerical experiments confirm the model's stability and accuracy across various scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a damage model for isotropic materials. validating its performance in predicting crack propagation paths in a 2D plate. The results show superior alignment with experimental date compared to traditional model.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Order and Strain in Hexagonal Manganese Pnictide CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manganese pnictide CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$, with Mn atoms arranged in a puckered honeycomb structure, exhibits narrow-gap antiferromagnetism, and it is currently a promising candidate for the study of complex electronic and magnetic phenomena, such as magnetotransport effects and potential spin spirals under high pressure. In this paper, we perform a detailed research of the magnetic properties of CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$ using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the Hubbard U correction and spin-orbit coupling, which accurately describe the magnetic interactions. Our results obtained for a large number of magnetic configurations are accurately captured by a modified Heisenberg model that includes on-site magnetization terms to describe magnetic energy excitations. We further investigate the role of the spin-orbit coupling, and find that the magnetic anisotropy of CaMn$_2$Bi$_2$ shows an easy plane, with the preferred magnetization direction being exchanged between axes in the plane by applying small strain values. This strain-tunable magnetization, driven by the interplay between spin-orbit interactions and lattice distortions, highlights the potential for controlling magnetic states in Mn-pnictides for future applications in spintronic and magnetoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>The effect of formation temperature and flexo-chemical strains on the electrophysical properties of the molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We synthesized the powder of molybdenum-disulfide-oxide nanoflowers consisting of self-assembled 10-20 nm thin nanoflakes by reaction of (NH4)6Mo7O24 with thiourea in aqueous solution at temperatures from 130oC to 180oC in hydrothermal conditions. The detailed analysis of the XPS, EDX and Raman spectroscopy results reveal the significant amount of the molybdenum oxides, sulfides and sulfates in the molybdenum disulfide nanoflakes, which allows to consider the "effective" formulae MoSxOy for their chemical composition. The MoSxOy nanoflakes reveal unusual electric transport features interesting for material science and promising for applications. The chemical composition and microstructure of the nanoflakes, which are determined by the temperature of synthesis, is shown to be responsible for the electro-conduction mechanism. Namely, the current-voltage characteristics (I-V curves) grow monotonically with the applied voltage for the samples, synthesized at the temperatures T_s&lt;&lt;150oC and T_s&gt;&gt;150oC, being non-ohmic and hysteretic at lower voltages and becoming close to the ohmic at higher voltages. The I-V curves acquire N-like shape with a strongly pronounced negative differential resistivity part at T_s=150oC. Both with and without N-shape, the I-V curves manifest hysteretic behavior with the difference between increasing and decreasing voltage sweeps, and the hysteresis loop parameters are determined by the temperature of synthesis. Important, that the studied nanoflakes manifest very long living deep charging and discharging after the voltage switching "on" and "off".Considering that the presence of oxygen non-stoichiometry and bending can create strong flexo-chemical strains in the nanoflakes, we proposed the flexo-chemical model of the polar and electro-transport properties of the pressed MoSxOy nanoflakes, which describes the observed I-V curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kondo lattice, describing a grid of the local magnetic moments coupling to itinerant electrons, is a fertile ground of strongly correlated states in condensed matter physics. While the Kagome lattice has long been predicted to host Kondo physics with exotic magnetism and nontrivial topology, no experimental realization has been achieved. Here, we report the discovery of CsCr6Sb6, a van der Waals-like Kagome Kondo lattice featuring extremely flat, isolated bands at the Fermi level (EF) that composed entirely of Cr-3d electrons. We observe heavy fermions with the effective mass over 100 times greater than those of its vanadium counterpart. We also observe Kondo insulating behavior in an ultra-low carrier density of 1019 cm-3 and dimensionality-induced Kondo breakdown. More interestingly, the frustrated magnetism observed in the bulk give way to a hidden A-type antiferromagnetic ordering in few layers, in sharp contrast to the common sense of weakened magnetism with thinning. The realization of Kondo physics in Kagome lattice opens avenues for exploring diverse quantum criticalities in a strongly-correlated frustrated system.</description>

      <title>Chiral Floquet Engineering on Topological Fermions in Chiral Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay of chiralities in light and quantum matter provides an opportunity to design and manipulate chirality-dependent properties in quantum materials. Herein we report the chirality-dependent Floquet engineering on topological fermions with the high Chern number in chiral crystal CoSi via circularly polarized light (CPL) pumping. Intense light pumping does not compromise the gapless nature of topological fermions in CoSi, but displaces the crossing points in momentum space along the direction of light propagation. The Floquet chirality index is proposed to signify the interplay between the chiralities of topological fermion, crystal, and incident light, which determines the amplitudes and directions of light-induced momentum shifts. Regarding the time-reversal symmetry breaking induced by the CPL pumping, momentum shifts of topological fermions result in the birth of transient anomalous Hall signals in non-magnetic CoSi within an ultrafast time scale, which Mid-infrared (IR) pumping and terahertz (THz) Kerr or Faraday probe spectroscopy could experimentally detect. Our findings provide insights into exploring novel applications in optoelectronic devices by leveraging the degree of freedom of chirality in the non-equilibrium regime.</description>

      <title>A Workflow-Centric Approach to Generating FAIR Data Objects for Computationally Generated Microstructure-Sensitive Mechanical Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a data perspective, the materials mechanics field is characterized by sparsity of available data, mainly due to the strong microstructure-sensitivity of properties like strength, fracture toughness, and fatigue limit. This requires testing specimens with different thermo-mechanical histories, even when the composition is similar. Experimental data on mechanical behavior is rare, as mechanical testing is destructive and requires significant material and effort. Furthermore, mechanical behavior is typically characterized in simplified tests under uniaxial loading conditions, whereas a complete characterization requires multiaxial testing. To address this data sparsity, simulation methods like micromechanical modeling can contribute to microstructure-sensitive data collections. This work introduces a novel data schema integrating both metadata and mechanical data, following the workflows of the material modeling processes by which the data has been generated. Each workflow run produces unique data objects by incorporating user, system, and job-specific information correlated with mechanical properties. This approach can be applied to any type of workflow as long as it is well-defined. This integrated format provides a sustainable way of generating Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) data objects. The metadata elements focus on key features required to characterize microstructure-specific data, simplifying the collection of purpose-specific datasets by search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Types of Size-Dependent Melting in Fe Nanoclusters: a Molecular Dynamics Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metallic nanoclusters are of interest in many fields because of their size-dependent catalytic activity. This activity can, in part, be influenced by their melting properties. In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $n \leq 100$ atoms were investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. Adding a single atom to many cluster sizes induced strong variations in surface and core melting points, and cluster energetics. Clusters with size-dependent melting behavior were classified into 3 distinct cluster types: closed-shell, near-closed-shell, and far-from-closed-shell clusters. For small clusters, near-closed-shell clusters had very low surface melting points and very high melting points (heat capacity maximum). Cluster sizes with symmetric closed shells and near-closed shells almost always had first-order-like phase transitions. For intermediate cluster sizes, far-from-closed-shell clusters often exhibited second-order-like phase transitions due to geometric factors. Larger cluster sizes began to favor bcc lattice structures. Variations in the surface and core melting behavior of neighboring cluster sizes may have implications for catalytic systems such as the growth of single-wall carbon nanotubes.</description>

      <title>CO2-induced Drastic Decharging of Dielectric Surfaces in Aqueous Suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of airborne CO2 on the charge state of carboxylate stabilized polymer latex particles suspended in aqueous electrolytes. We combine conductometric experiments interpreted in terms of Hessinger's conductivity model with Poisson-Boltzmann cell (PBC) model calculations with charge regulation boundary conditions. Without CO2, a minority of the weakly acidic surface groups are dissociated and only a fraction of the total number of counter-ions actually contribute to conductivity. The remaining counter-ions exchange freely with added other ions like Na+, K+ or Cs+. From the PBC-calculations we infer a corresponding pKa of 4.26 as well as a renormalized charge in reasonably good agreement with the number of freely mobile counter-ions. Equilibration of salt- and CO2-free suspensions against ambient air leads to a drastic de-charging, which exceeds by far the expected effects of to dissolved CO2 and its dissociation products. Further, no counter-ion-exchange is observed. To reproduce the experimental findings, we have to assume an effective pKa of 6.48. This direct influence of CO2 on the state of surface group dissociation explains our recent finding of a CO2-induced decrease of the {\zeta}-potential and supports the suggestion of an additional charge regulation caused by molecular CO2. Given the importance of charged surfaces in contact with aqueous electrolytes, we anticipate that our observations bear substantial theoretical challenges and important implications for applications ranging from desalination to bio-membranes.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient and Interpretable Inverse Materials Design using a Disentangled Variational Autoencoder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inverse materials design has proven successful in accelerating novel material discovery. Many inverse materials design methods use unsupervised learning where a latent space is learned to offer a compact description of materials representations. A latent space learned this way is likely to be entangled, in terms of the target property and other properties of the materials. This makes the inverse design process ambiguous. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach based on a disentangled variational autoencoder to learn a probabilistic relationship between features, latent variables and target properties. This approach is data efficient because it combines all labelled and unlabelled data in a coherent manner, and it uses expert-informed prior distributions to improve model robustness even with limited labelled data. It is in essence interpretable, as the learnable target property is disentangled out of the other properties of the materials, and an extra layer of interpretability can be provided by a post-hoc analysis of the classification head of the model. We demonstrate this new approach on an experimental high-entropy alloy dataset with chemical compositions as input and single-phase formation as the single target property. High-entropy alloys were chosen as example materials because of the vast chemical space of their possible combinations of compositions and atomic configurations. While single property is used in this work, the disentangled model can be extended to customize for inverse design of materials with multiple target properties.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we synthesized S functionalized graphene sponge electrode and applied it for electrochemical oxidation of five commonly used antibiotics, namely sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim, ofloxacin, roxithromycin and erythromycin, and inactivation of a multidrug resistant Escherichia coli, E. coli. The experiments were performed using real drinking water in a flow through, one pass mode. Highly polar antibiotics such as sulfamethoxazole did not adsorb onto the graphene sponge but were completely removed, i.e., more than 95% removal, at low applied current densities, 14.5 A m2. Antibiotics with high affinity for pi pi interactions were completely removed already in the open circuit, and current application led to their further degradation. S doped graphene sponge anode resulted in 4.5 log removal of a multi-drug resistant E. coli at 29 A m2. There was no regrowth of bacteria observed during storage of the electrochemically treated samples, suggesting that the treatment severely impacted the cell viability. Further E. coli removal of 0.7 log was observed after the storage of electrochemically treated samples. The energy consumption of a continuously operated electrochemical system that achieved 4.5 log inactivation of a multidrug resistant E. coli and 87 to 99% removal of antibiotics was 1.1 kWh m3.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystal Scattering and the Riemann Zeta Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03673</link>

Abstract: I carry out numerical scattering calculations against a family of finite-length one-dimensional point-like arrangements of atoms, $\chi(x)$, related to the distribution of prime numbers by a shift operation making the atomic density approximately constant. I show how the Riemann Zeta Function (RZF) naturally parameterizes the analytic structure of the scattering amplitude and give numerical results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive AI-Driven Material Synthesis: Towards Autonomous 2D Materials Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials are poised to revolutionize current solid-state technology with their extraordinary properties. Yet, the primary challenge remains their scalable production. While there have been significant advancements, much of the scientific progress has depended on the exfoliation of materials, a method that poses severe challenges for large-scale applications. With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI) in materials science, innovative synthesis methodologies are now on the horizon. This study explores the forefront of autonomous materials synthesis using an artificial neural network (ANN) trained by evolutionary methods, focusing on the efficient production of graphene. Our approach demonstrates that a neural network can iteratively and autonomously learn a time-dependent protocol for the efficient growth of graphene, without requiring pretraining on what constitutes an effective recipe. Evaluation criteria are based on the proximity of the Raman signature to that of monolayer graphene: higher scores are granted to outcomes whose spectrum more closely resembles that of an ideal continuous monolayer structure. This feedback mechanism allows for iterative refinement of the ANN's time-dependent synthesis protocols, progressively improving sample quality. Through the advancement and application of AI methodologies, this work makes a substantial contribution to the field of materials engineering, fostering a new era of innovation and efficiency in the synthesis process.</description>
