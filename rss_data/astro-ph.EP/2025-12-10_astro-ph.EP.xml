      <title>Detection of 27 Candidate Circumbinary Planets Through Apsidal Precession of Eclipsing Binaries Observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most circumbinary planets have been discovered by their transits, limiting our understanding of such systems to those with mutually coplanar architectures. This bias makes it difficult to infer the true circumbinary planet population, highlighting the need for alternative detection methods that do not rely on transits. In this work, we explore one such approach by leveraging apsidal precession as a dynamical signature of planetary companions. We analyse TESS photometry of a sample of 1,590 eclipsing binaries from the Gaia DR3 Catalogue of Eclipsing Binary Candidates to identify systems exhibiting detectable apsidal precession. We rule general relativistic, tidal, and rotational contributions as insufficient to account for the measured apsidal precession, demonstrating that an additional gravitational perturber is required. This enables us to constrain the possible masses and orbital separations of a companion that would cause the observed precession. We present a new set of 27 candidate circumbinary planets identified through this precession-based method as well as 6 candidate companions with a higher minimum mass. Their inferred properties remain degenerate, as the same dynamical signatures can arise from lower-mass planets at less than 1 AU or from more massive companions on wider, few-AU orbits, reflecting the current uncertainty in characterising these systems. Radial velocities can help break this degeneracy and provide direct confirmation.</description>

      <title>Heavy element enriched atmospheres and where they are born</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The heavy element content of giant exoplanets, inferred from structure models based on their radius and mass, often exceeds predictions based on classical core accretion. Pebble drift, coupled with volatile evaporation, has been proposed as a possible remedy to this with the level of heavy element enrichment a planet can accrete, as well as its atmospheric composition, being strongly dependent on where in the disc it is forming. We use a planet formation model which simulates the evolution of the protoplanetary disc, accounting for pebble growth, drift and evaporation, and the formation of planets from pebble and gas accretion. The growth and migration of planetary embryos is simulated in 10 different protoplanetary discs which have their chemical compositions matched to the host stars of the planets which we aim to reproduce, providing a more realistic model of their growth than previous studies. The heavy element content of giant exoplanets is used to infer their formation location and thus make a prediction of their atmospheric abundances. We focus here on giants more massive than Saturn, as we expect that their heavy element content is dominated by their envelope rather than their core. The heavy element content of 9 out of the 10 planets simulated is successfully matched to their observed values. Our simulations predict formation in the inner disc regions, where the majority of the volatiles have already evaporated and can thus be accreted onto the planet via the gas. As the majority of the planetary heavy element content originates from water vapour accretion, our simulations predict a high atmospheric O/H ratio in combination with a low atmospheric C/O ratio, in general agreement with observations. For certain planets, namely WASP-84b, these properties may be observable in the near future, offering a method of testing the constraints made on the planet's formation.</description>

      <title>Growth and thermal evolution of icy planetesimals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Icy planetesimals are likely to supply volatiles to terrestrial planets and serve as building blocks of icy bodies in the outer Solar System. Samples from the C-type asteroid Ryugu, collected by the Hayabusa-2 spacecraft, indicate a low-temperature history with aqueous alteration and organic materials. In contrast, iron meteorites with isotopic ratios similar to carbonaceous chondrites suggest exposure to higher temperatures. These findings imply that the thermal evolution of icy planetesimals is highly diverse. Since direct exploration provides only localized data, understanding this diversity requires comparing observational results with model calculations incorporating key evolutionary processes. We develop a model including radial growth, impact heating, water phase changes, aqueous alteration, and structural differentiation, to re-evaluate the thermal evolution of icy planetesimals during the first 100 Myr after CAI formation. The model considers final radius (10-1000 km), growth onset (1.0 or 2.0 Myr after CAI), growth duration (0.4 or 4.0 Myr), and growth mode (linear or runaway). Our results show that larger planetesimals generally reach higher temperatures, but growth timing and mode significantly affect thermal evolution. Early accretion leads to higher temperatures, with some bodies reaching the Fe-FeS eutectic (1250 K), while delayed or prolonged growth reduces heating. Our results show that the constituent materials of Ryugu, which kept below 40 degC, likely formed near the surface of a hydrated mineral layer. This is possible even in planetesimals several hundred kilometers in size due to efficient heat transport via convection. If accretion begins 2.0 Myr after CAI and completes in 0.4 Myr, a wide region in such a body could yield Ryugu's material.</description>

      <title>Was the Solar System's dynamical instability triggered by a (sub)stellar flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An instability among the giant planets' orbits can match many aspects of the Solar System's current orbital architecture. We explore the possibility that this dynamical instability was triggered by the close passage of a star or substellar object during the Sun's embedded cluster phase. We run N-body simulations starting with the giant planets in a resonant chain and an outer planetesimal disk, with a wide-enough planet-disk separation to preserve the planets' orbital stability for $&gt;$100 Myr. We subject the system to a single flyby, testing a wide range in flyby mass, velocity and closest approach distance. We find a variety of outcomes, from flybys that over-excite the system (or strip the planets entirely) to flybys too weak to perturb the planets at all. An intermediate range of flybys triggers a dynamical instability that matches the present-day Solar System. Successful simulations -- that match the giant planets' orbits without over-exciting the cold classical Kuiper belt -- are characterized by the flyby of a substellar object ($3-30 M_{Jup}$) passing within 20 au of the Sun. We performed Monte Carlo simulations of the Sun's birth cluster phase, parameterized by the product of the stellar density $\eta$ and the cluster lifetime $T$. The balance between under- and over-excitation of the young Solar System is at $\eta T \approx 5 \times 10^4$~Myr pc$^{-3}$, in a range consistent with previous work. We find a probability of $\sim$1% that the Solar System's dynamical instability was triggered by a substellar flyby. The probability increases to $\sim$5% if the occurrence rate of free-floating planets and low-mass brown dwarfs is modestly higher than predicted by standard stellar initial mass functions.</description>

      <title>NEOWISE data and Thermophysical Modeling of 98943 Torifune (2001 CC21)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hayabusa2# flyby target 98943 Torifune (2001 CC21) has an uncertain size based on an uncertain albedo and uncertain absolute magnitude. We have collected all the NEOWISE observations of 2001 CC21 from Nov 2021 through Feb 2024, a total of 132 frames, and analyzed this data to estimate an infrared radiometric diameter. We analyze the multi-epoch 3.4 and 4.6 micron NEOWISE data using an ellipsoidal rotating, cratered ThermoPhysical Model (TPM) to obtain estimates for the diameter, rotation pole, shape, and thermal inertia. 2001 CC21 is quite faint at 4.6 microns when Delta is about 0.7 AU, so the resulting diameter is substantially smaller than the 700 meters derived from the H magnitude and L spectral type. Recent polarimetric data has also suggested a smaller diameter, but not quite as small as the diameter derived from the thermal IR data. A fit to an ellipsoidal TPM model gives a volume equivalent sphere diameter of 337-27+33 meters [posterior median and central 68% confidence interval]. Prograde rotation with an obliquity of 24-9+6 deg is preferred. We also applied this TPM to the Spitzer data presented by Fornasier etal. (2024) and obtain a diameter of 476 +/- 9% meters which is consistent with the NEATM modeling presented by Fornasier etal. but with more realistic errorbars. Finally, fitting the NEOWISE and Spitzer data together requires unexpectedly large thermal inertias and gives a bimodal posterior diameter distribution.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Irradiation on the Radius and Thermal Evolution of Transiting Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masses and radii of transiting brown dwarfs can be measured directly in contrast to isolated field brown dwarfs, whose mass and radius inferences are model dependent. Therefore, transiting brown dwarfs are a testbed for the interior and evolutionary models of brown dwarfs and giant exoplanets. We have developed atmospheric and evolutionary models for this emerging population. We show that intense stellar irradiation can cause a large enhancement in the radius of transiting brown dwarfs at all masses, especially if the incident flux exceeds $log_{10}(F/cgs)\ge$9 ($T_{\rm eq}\ge 1450$ K). Stellar irradiation can significantly alter rates of nuclear burning in irradiated brown dwarfs, making the Deuterium-burning and Hydrogen-burning minimum masses strong functions of incident stellar flux. We show that the D-burning and H-burning minimum masses can decrease by 16% and 13%, respectively, between isolated and strongly irradiated brown dwarfs ( $log_{10}(F/cgs)\ge$10 ($T_{\rm eq}\ge 2570$ K)). This shows that stellar irradiation has a larger impact on the planet-brown dwarf-star mass boundaries than metallicity or clouds. We show that metal cores or migration affect their evolution to a much lesser extent, whereas low mass highly irradiated old sources can help us test the physics of hot Jupiter radius anomaly. We fit the observed radii of 46 transiting brown dwarfs and show that our irradiated evolutionary models fit their radii better than models that ignore the host star, especially for highly irradiated objects. However, the measured radii of 10 objects are still inconsistent at $&gt;3\sigma$ level, indicating residual gaps in our irradiated evolutionary model.</description>

      <title>Supervised Classification of LEO Debris Families Using Multi-Set Proper Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques using proper elements to reconnect families of satellite fragmentation debris have recently advanced, becoming key to space sustainability and domain awareness. However, an evolving circumterrestrial environment may limit their applicability, particularly when models are trained on outdated debris representations. In this work, we devise a computational pipeline using synthetic fragmentation data from explosive breakup events, generated via a Standard Breakup Model and propagated under a high-fidelity dynamical model. Proper elements are extracted using adapted algorithms for modified equinoctial (MEE), Poincar'e (PNC), and quaternion (QTN) sets.
  Extending beyond previous approaches limited to MEE space, we include PNC and QTN sets to broaden the dynamical fingerprints available to the classifier. Neural networks trained on various element combinations are used to determine if fragment pairs share a parent. Crucially, we identify a fundamental limitation when applying standard quaternion sets to neural networks: the loss of orbital size information during feature normalization. We introduce an augmented representation (QTN$_p$) that explicitly restores the semi-latus rectum, improving accuracy from 0.31 to 0.60 compared to the standard set. In synthetic Starlink-like LEO experiments, expanding proper-element sets generally improves discrimination. The best model, using a joint feature set (MEE + PNC + QTN), achieves an ROC-AUC of 0.858 compared to 0.789 for the MEE-only baseline, alongside higher accuracy and F1 scores.</description>

      <title>A Search for Transit Duration Variations in M dwarf Multi-Planet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nominal habitable zone for exoplanets orbiting M dwarfs lies close to the host star, making dynamical considerations especially important. One consequence of this proximity is the expectation of spin synchronization, with implications for atmospheric circulation. Several mechanisms can maintain non-zero obliquities over long timescales in compact multi-planet systems, including capture into Cassini State 2 (CS2) and other forms of secular spin-orbit coupling; such pathways are plausible in the orbital architectures of close-in M-dwarf planets. In this study, we search for transit duration variations (TDVs) consistent with the nodal precession rates predicted by Laplace-Lagrange secular theory in compact M-dwarf multi-planet systems. Our sample includes 23 exoplanets orbiting 12 stars. We compare recent, high-precision transit durations obtained from JWST white-light curves with measurements published at the discovery epoch and afterward. The resulting transit duration variation ranges from seconds to minutes, and we fit a linear trend to duration versus time for each planet. All systems are consistent with flat (no TDV) at the 3{\sigma} level. The strongest candidate is TRAPPIST-1d, whose fitted slope differs from zero with 2.2{\sigma} confidence. We calculate the expected TDV signals predicted by secular precession and compare them to the observed limits. Our null detection is consistent with the low-impact-parameter regime, where theoretical TDVs are only a few seconds per decade and below our sensitivity. Higher-impact-parameter configurations predict substantially larger TDVs and are disfavored: under uniformly distributed geometries, at least half of the allowed configurations would be excluded.</description>

      <title>Astrometric Reconnaissance of Exoplanetary Systems (ARES). I. Methodology validation with HST point-source images of Proxima Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of the Astrometric Reconnaissance of Exoplanetary Systems (ARES) project, aimed at validating and characterizing candidate exoplanets around the nearest systems using multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data. In this first paper, we focus on Proxima Centauri, leveraging archival and recent HST observations in point-source imaging mode. We refine the geometric-distortion calibration of the HST detector used, and develop a robust methodology to derive high-precision astrometric parameters by combining HST measurements with the Gaia DR3 catalog. We determine Proxima's position, proper motion, and parallax with uncertainties at the $\sim$0.4-mas, 50-$\mu$as yr$^{-1}$, and 0.2-mas level, respectively, achieving consistent results with what measured by Gaia within $\sim$1$\sigma$. We further investigate the presence of the candidate exoplanet Proxima c by analyzing the proper-motion anomaly derived from combining long-term HST-based and short-term Gaia astrometry. Under the assumption of a circular, face-on orbit, we obtain an estimated mass of $m_c = 3.4^{+5.2}_{-3.4}$ $M_\odot$, broadly consistent with radial-velocity constraints but limited by our current uncertainties. These results establish the foundation for the next phase of ARES, which will exploit HST spatial-scanning observations to achieve astrometric precisions of a few tens of $\mu$as and enable a direct search for astrometric signatures of low-mass companions.</description>

      <title>The Two-Dimensional Structure of Circumplanetary Disks and their Radiative Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During their formative stages, giant planets are fed by infalling material sourced from the background circumstellar disk. Due to conservation of angular momentum, the incoming gas and dust collects into a circumplanetary disk that processes the material before it reaches the central planet itself. This work investigates the complex vertical structure of these circumplanetary disks and calculates their radiative signatures. A self-consistent numerical model of the temperature and density structure of the circumplanetary environment reveals that circumplanetary disks are thick and hot, with aspect ratios $H/R\sim0.1-0.25$ and temperatures approaching that of the central planet. The disk geometry has a significant impact on the radiative signatures, allowing future observations to determine critical system parameters. The resulting disks are gravitationally stable and viscosity is sufficient to drive the necessary disk accretion. However, sufficiently rapid mass accretion can trigger a thermal instability, which sets an upper limit on the mass accretion rate. This paper shows how the radiative signatures depend on the properties of the planetary system and discuss how the system parameters can be constrained by future observations.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiters are Inflated Primarily by Shallow Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unexpectedly large radii of transiting hot Jupiters have led to many proposals for the physical mechanisms responsible for heating their interiors. While it has been shown that hot Jupiters reinflate as their host stars brighten due to heating deep in planetary interiors, young hot Jupiters also exhibit signs of delayed cooling possibly related to heating closer to their surfaces. To investigate this tension, we enhance our previously published hot Jupiter thermal evolution model by adding a parameter that allows for both deep heating and delayed cooling. We fit our thermal evolution models to a homogeneous, physically self-consistent catalog of accurate and precise hot Jupiter system properties in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. We find that hot Jupiters' interior cooling rates are reduced on average by 95\%--98\% compared to simpler anomalous heating models. The most plausible explanation for this inference is substantial shallow heating just below their radiative--convective boundaries that enables reinflation with much less deep heating. Shallow heating by Ohmic dissipation and/or temperature advection are therefore important components of accurate models of hot Jupiter atmospheres, especially in circulation models. If hot Jupiters are inflated primarily by shallow heating as we propose, then we predict that their observed phase curve offsets should increase with temperature in the range $T_{\text{eq}}~\lesssim1500~\text{K}$, peak in the range $1500~\text{K}~\lesssim~T_{\text{eq}}~\lesssim~1800~\text{K}$, and decrease in the range $T_{\text{eq}}~\gtrsim~1800~\text{K}$.</description>

      <title>The interstellar signature: A computational framework for open source interstellar tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects such as 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov offer a unique window into the formation and evolution of other star systems, yet the tracking and analysis of their trajectories remain limited to specialized research institutions. Existing interstellar and solar system datasets are large, complex, and difficult to navigate, reducing accessibility for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts. To address this, we present The Interstellar Signature: a computational framework for open-source interstellar tracking, implemented through a web-based platform.
  Interstellar Signature bridges raw astronomical data and an intuitive, developer-friendly interface. The framework integrates live data streams from public repositories and APIs with physics-based simulation methods to model and visualize the motion of interstellar and solar system objects in real time. The platform supports interactive visualizations, comparative orbital analysis, and modular tools that allow users to explore and extend the system for research, experimentation, or development.
  As an open-source project, the framework encourages collaboration and hands-on engagement with complex datasets. It exists within NexusCosmos, an ecosystem envisioned as a "Linux for the space race," aimed at democratizing access to space science tools and data. By transforming large datasets into visual, interactive, and customizable simulations, Interstellar Signature expands participation in interstellar research and observation.
  Future extensions will add AI-driven trajectory prediction, anomaly detection, and advanced visualization. By combining open-source accessibility with computational rigor, this framework lowers the barrier to interstellar analysis and serves as a step toward bridging professional astronomy and public scientific engagement.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the microlensing detectability of extraterrestrial technosignatures originating from Dyson sphere \textendash like structures, such as Dyson Swarms surrounding primordial black holes (PBHs). These hypothetical swarms consist of stochastically varying, partially opaque structures that could modulate standard microlensing light curves through time-dependent transmission effects. We introduce a probabilistic framework that includes a stochastic transmission model governed by variable optical depth and random gap distributions. We perform a parameter scan and generate heatmaps of the optical transit duration. We study the infrared excess radiation and peak emission wavelength as complementary observational signatures. Additionally, we define and analyze the effective optical depth and the anomalous microlensing event rate for these stochastic structures. Our findings provide a new avenue for searching for extraterrestrial advanced civilizations by extending microlensing studies to include artificial, dynamic modulation signatures.</description>

      <title>The HIP 54515 b Superjovian Planet as an Early, Critical Look at the Roman Coronagraph's Performance in the Faint Target Star, Small IWA Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Roman Coronagraph's capabilities in the faint star, small IWA limit has enormous scientific (programmatic) impacts. Testing its performance in this limit provides a first look at challenges that may be encountered with the Habitable Worlds Observatory in imaging rocky planets around the nearest K and M stars. We propose such a rigorous test with the HLC/575nm targeting a newly-discovered superjovian planet HIP 54515 b, whose predicted contrast is $\sim$4.7 $\times$10$^{-8}$--2.5 $\times$10$^{-7}$. The companion lies close to the coronagraph IWA (well interior to the TTR5 performance region) and orbits a V = 6.8 star, near the limit for which the coronagraph may yield deep contrasts. Multiple reference stars are available that will further test CGI's performance as a function of $\Delta$ pitch angle to assess how the telescope's thermal environment impacts contrasts.</description>

      <title>von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov oscillations in nearby bright stars. I. Lambda Ophiuchi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The challenge of constraining both the inner and the outer orbits in multiple stars has resulted in a growing abyss between the rich theoretical and the sparse observational studies of von Zeipel-Kozai-Lidov (ZKL) oscillations in stellar systems. Here we solve for the full orbital architecture of the bright intermediate-mass nearby system Lambda Ophiuchi based on astrometric measurements of the outer orbit (period of 129 years) compiled in the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars and new VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric measurements that are used to determine the inner orbit (period of 42 days). The orbits are retrograde and misaligned by either $88.5\pm1.9^o$ or $113.5\pm1.9^o$, which in either case results in the inner binary currently undergoing ZKL oscillations. While pure Newtonian point source evolution would have predicted the stars in the inner binary to have merged long ago, in reality the eccentricity oscillations are significantly modulated by general relativistic, tidal and rotational bulge precession. We show that due to the effect of ``slaved'' precession the dynamics can still be solved semi-analytically. We find that the (currently unknown) inclination angles between the stellar spins axes and the inner orbital axis play a very important role in the amplitude of the ZKL oscillations, which is at a minimum $\Delta e = e_{\mathrm{max}} - e_{\mathrm{min}} \simeq 0.15$ and could be as high as $\Delta e \simeq 0.70$. We argue that currently feasible spectroscopic and interferometric observations could allow for a complete and unique dynamical solution for this system.</description>

      <title>Follow-up Observations of Candidate White Dwarf Planets with MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on second-epoch imaging of two candidate planet-hosting white dwarfs stars, WD2105-82 and WD1202-232. Both stars showed evidence of resolved, planet-mass candidate companions in observations using the MIRI mid-infrared imager on JWST. WD2105-82 also showed evidence of an infrared excess consistent with an unresolved 1.4 Jupiter mass companion with an orbital separation of &lt;4 au. Our second epoch observations confirm that the source of the excess shares common proper motion with the star. The excess is almost certainly due to a companion planet or debris disk. However, neither of the two resolved sources with projected separations of &gt;1" in the first epoch of JWST observations show measurable proper motion and are thus likely faint, unresolved background galaxies. We also search for common proper motion companions out to hundreds of au, but find no evidence of widely separated companions.</description>

Abstract: Astrochemistry is a well-established multidisciplinary field devoted to study molecules in space. While most astrochemists are oriented to observe molecules in the gas phase and reproduce their abundances by modeling the physical conditions of the medium, the microscopic dust particles wandering in the interstellar medium deserve the attention of a smaller community. Radiation and thermally-driven processes taking place in the bare dust, and particularly in dust particles covered by ice mantles, are mimicked in the laboratory. In addition to water, interstellar ice contains other simple species. In this Review we present our current knowledge on ice photochemistry and thermal processing that ultimately leads to formation of complex organic molecules (COMs). Numerous COMs are of astrobiological interest and match those present in comets and asteroids. Upon impact of these minor bodies, water and COMs were delivered to the earth and might have intervened in the first prebiotic reactions.</description>

      <title>Thermochemical models of outer core convection with heterogeneous core-mantle boundary heat flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03538v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermochemical convection in Earth's outer core is driven by the crystallisation of the inner core that releases latent heat and light elements. A key question in core dynamics is whether a stable layer exists just below the core-mantle boundary. Recent core convection simulations, accounting for CMB heterogeneities, propose locally stable regions (or regional inversion lenses, RILs) rather than a global layer, allowing both stable and unstable regions to coexist. In this study, we consider a suite of numerical simulations of thermal, chemical, and thermochemical convection models focussed on Ekman number ($E=10^{-5}$) with thermal and chemical flux Rayleigh numbers $\widetilde{Ra}_T=30-4000$ and $\widetilde{Ra}_C=30-100000$, and thermal and chemical Prandtl numbers $Pr_T=1$ and $Pr_\xi=10$. Analysis of purely chemical models reveals light element accumulation (LEA) below the CMB, resulting in either locally stable regions near the poles or global layers, depending on the strength of chemical forcing. These chemically stratified regions persist in our thermochemical models even if the thermal field is fully destabilising. The addition of a heterogeneous CMB heat flux leads to the formation of RILs driven by thermal stratification. Stable regions in these thermochemical models have varying locations, properties, and morphologies depending on whether thermal or chemical convection dominates. In the investigated parameter range, these RILs are O(100 km) thick, and their strength and thickness generally increase with the strength of thermal driving; they are comparatively less sensitive to the strength of chemical driving. Our simulations reveal a diverse range of possible stable regions and/or a global layer at the top of Earth's core, with a seismically plausible range of thickness and strength, which may also have a signature in geomagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>A Thick Volatile Atmosphere on the Ultrahot Super-Earth TOI-561 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrashort-period (USP) exoplanets -- with $R_p \leq 2~$R$_{\oplus}$ and periods $\leq$1 day -- are expected to be stripped of volatile atmospheres by intense host star irradiation, which is corroborated by their nominal bulk densities and previous eclipse observations consistent with bare rock surfaces. However, a few USP planets appear anomalously under-dense relative to an Earth-like composition, suggesting an exotic interior structure (e.g., core-less) or a volatile-rich secondary atmosphere increasing their apparent radius. Here we present the first dayside emission spectrum of the low-density (4.3$\pm$0.4 g~cm$^{-3}$) USP planet TOI-561 b, which orbits an iron-poor, alpha-rich, $\sim$10 Gyr old thick disk star. Our 3-5 $\mu$m JWST/NIRSpec observations demonstrate the dayside of TOI-561 b is inconsistent with a bare-rock surface at high statistical significance, suggesting instead a thick volatile envelope that is cooling the dayside to well below the $\sim$3000 K expected in the bare-rock or thin-atmosphere case. These results reject the popular hypothesis of complete atmospheric desiccation for highly irradiated exoplanets and support predictions that planetary-scale magma oceans can retain substantial reservoirs of volatiles, opening the geophysical study of ultrahot super-Earths through the lenses of their atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The Transition from Giant Planets to Brown Dwarfs beyond 1 au from the Stellar Metallicity Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Giant planets and brown dwarfs are thought to form via a combination of pathways, including bottom-up mechanisms in which gas is accreted onto a solid core and top-down mechanisms in which gas collapses directly into a gravitationally-bound object. One can distinguish the prevalence of these mechanisms using host star metallicities. Bottom-up formation thrives in metal-rich environments, whereas top-down formation is weakly dependent on ambient metal content. Using a hierarchical Bayesian model and the results of the California Legacy Survey (CLS), a low-bias and homogeneously analyzed radial velocity survey, we find evidence for a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at a companion mass of $\gamma = 27_{-8}^{+12} \, M_{\rm Jup}$ for companions with orbital separations between $1-50$ au. Companions below and above this threshold tend to orbit stars with higher ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = 0.17 \pm 0.12$ dex) and lower ($\rm{[Fe/H]} = -0.03 \pm 0.10$ dex) metallicities, respectively. Previous studies of relatively close-in companions reported evidence of a lower transition mass of $\leq 10 \, {\rm M_{\rm Jup}}$. When applied to the CLS sample, our model predicts the probability of a transition in the stellar metallicity distribution at or below $10 \, { M_{\rm Jup}}$ to be $&lt; 1 \%$. We compare our results to estimates of $\gamma$ gleaned from other observational metrics and discuss implications for planet formation theory.</description>

      <title>Shaping the Mantle: The Role of Superheated Core After Giant Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13436v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Moon-forming giant impact significantly influenced the initial thermal state of Earth's mantle by generating a global magma ocean, marking the onset of mantle evolution. Recent Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations indicate that such a collision would produce a superheated core, whose cooling would strongly influence subsequent mantle dynamics. Here, we present systematic SPH simulations of diverse giant-impact scenarios and show that the superheated core formed after the impact can trigger secondary mantle melting, thereby governing the final state of the magma ocean. To further quantify this effect, we employ a parameterized mantle-melting model to evaluate the influence of secondary melting on the lower mantle. Our results suggest three possible outcomes: complete mantle melting, the formation of a basal melt layer, or the initiation of an early superplume. Combined with recent two-phase magma-ocean solidification models, we infer that all three scenarios would result in basal melt layers of varying thickness, partially retaining the thermal energy of the superheated core. In the canonical Moon-forming scenario, the superheated core would rapidly transfer heat to Earth's lower mantle, causing secondary mantle melting within approximately 277-5983 years and generating either a basal melt layer or a fully molten mantle. Both outcomes would effectively erase primordial heterogeneities in the lower mantle and impose distinct pathways for its subsequent thermal evolution.</description>

      <title>From Flash to Crater: Morphological and Spectral Analysis of the Brightest Lunar Impact on 11 September 2013 using LRO Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive morphological and spectrophotometric analysis of the lunar impact that occurred on September 11, 2013, based on pre- and post-event observations by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). The crater formed exhibits a rim-to-rim diameter of $35 \pm 0.7$ m, a depth of $4.9 \pm 0.4$ m, and an ejecta blanket extending over 2 km with an area of approximately $7 \times 10^{5}\,$m$^{2}$. The ejecta shows a pronounced asymmetry and, assuming uniform distribution, an average thickness limit of $\sim 2$ mm. Spectral analysis using WAC images reveals a consistent reddening of the central ejecta region, with an average 16.54 % increase in spectral slope between 321 nm and 643 nm, marking the first reported detection of color changes resulting from a lunar impact. We evaluated several scaling laws and found that the Gault et al. (1974) formulation most accurately reproduces the observed crater size. Furthermore, luminous efficiency values below $\eta = 2 \times 10^{-3}$ and higher projectile densities are most consistent with the morphology of the ejecta. The impact direction inferred from this pattern is not compatible with the radiant of the September $\varepsilon$-Perseids stream. Moreover, an independent probability analysis yields a greater than 96 % likelihood that the event was caused by a sporadic meteoroid. Our results also demonstrate the potential of WAC imagery for the automated detection of new lunar craters, which can improve statistical estimates of the current impact flux. This methodology offers a powerful complement to high-resolution imaging, with important implications for both lunar safety and planetary defense.</description>

      <title>The Albedo Problem and Cloud Cover on Hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of transiting hot Jupiters have revealed a mismatch between the values of the Bond versus geometric albedos. In the planetary science literature, the ratio of these quantities is known as the phase integral. It has been extensively measured for the Solar System planets and shown to generally be non-unity in value. We use existing Cassini data of Jupiter to derive bandpass-integrated geometric albedos and phase integrals in the CHEOPS, TESS and Ariel bandpasses, demonstrating that these quantities vary markedly across these different wavelength ranges. By performing a population study of geometric albedos and phase integrals, we demonstrate that atmospheres with partial cloud cover may be identified using measurements of the phase integral if its measured uncertainty is $\sim 0.1$, which corresponds to an uncertainty of $\sim 3\%$ on the optical/visible secondary eclipse depth. The upcoming Ariel space mission will conduct an unprecedented statistical survey of cloud cover on hot Jupiters via the simultaneous measurement of $\sim 100$ infrared phase curves and optical secondary eclipses. Whenever available, the shape of optical phase curves of reflected light will directly constrain the phase integral, spherical albedo, degree of cloud cover and scattering asymmetry factor.</description>

      <title>Euclid: Quick Data Release (Q1) - A photometric search for ultracool dwarfs in the Euclid Deep Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a catalogue of 5306 new ultracool dwarf (UCD) candidates in the three Euclid Deep Fields in the Q1 data release. They range from late M to late T dwarfs, and include 1200 L and T dwarfs. A total of 546 objects have been spectroscopically confirmed, including 329 L dwarfs and 26 T dwarfs. We also provide empirical Euclid colours as a function of spectral type. Our UCD selection criteria are based only on colour ($I_\mathrm{E}-Y_\mathrm{E}&gt;2.5$). The combined requirement for optical detection and stringent signal-to-noise ratio threshold ensure a high purity of the sample, but at the expense of completeness, especially for T dwarfs. The detections range from magnitudes 19 and 24 in the near-infrared bands, and extend down to 26 in the optical band. We discuss Euclid's capability to identify UCD candidates based on its photometric passbands. The average surface density of detected UCDs on the sky is approximately 100 objects per $\mathrm{deg}^2$, including 20 L and T dwarfs per $\mathrm{deg}^2$. This leads to an expectation of at least 1.4 million ultracool dwarfs in the final data release of the Euclid Wide Survey, including at least $300\,000$ L dwarfs, and more than 2600 T dwarfs, using the strict selection criteria from this work.</description>
