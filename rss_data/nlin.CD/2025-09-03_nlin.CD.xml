      <title>Time-varying sensitivity analysis for mixing in chaotic flows: a comparison study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineered injection and extraction systems that create chaotic advection are promising procedures for enhancing mixing between two species. Mixing efficiencies vary considerably, so carefully selecting the design parameters, like pumping rates, well locations, or operation times, is crucial. While numerous studies investigate the conditions required to achieve chaotic flow, sensitivity analyses addressing its impact on mixing have rarely been performed. However, selecting a suitable sensitivity analysis method depends on the underlying system and is often restricted by the computational cost, especially when considering complex, high-dimensional models. Moreover, the most appropriate metric to quantify mixing (e.g., plume area, peak concentration) can also be system-specific. We perform a time-varying sensitivity analysis on the mixing enhancement of two chaotic flow fields with different complexities. The rotated potential mixing (RPM) flow is parametrized using two or four hyperparameters, while the quadrupole flow utilizes 16 hyperparameters. We compare three global sensitivity analysis methods: Sobol indices, Morris scores, and a modification of the activity scores. We evaluate the temporal evolution of the sensitivity of the design parameters, compare the performance of the three methods, and highlight their potential in analyzing parameter interactions. The analysis of the RPM flow shows comparable sensitivities for all methods. Additionally, our numerical experiments show that Morris is the cheapest method, needing at most four times fewer model evaluations than Sobol to reach convergence. This motivates us to only use the computationally cheaper but as reliable Morris and activity scores on the 16-dimensional model, yielding again consistent results.</description>

      <title>Designing learning in high dimensional oscillator networks with low dimensional read-out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate how to configure an oscillator network based reservoir computer with a high number of oscillators and a low dimensional read-out. The read-out is a function on the average phases with respect to each oscillator population. Hence, this read-out provides a robust measurement of the oscillator states. We consider a low number of populations which leads to a low-dimensional read-out. Here, the task is time-series prediction. The input time-series is introduced via a forcing term. After a training phase the input is learned. Importantly, the training weights are introduced in the forcing term meaning that the oscillator network is left untouched. Hence, we can apply classical methods for oscillator networks. Here, we consider the continuum limit for Kuramoto oscillators by using the Ott-Antonsen Ansatz. The success and failure of the reservoir computer is then studied by bifurcations in the coupling and forcing parameter space. We will also show that the average phase read-out can naturally arise when considering the read-out on the phase states. Finally, we give numerical evidence that at least 4 oscillator populations are necessary to learn chaotic target dynamics.</description>

      <title>Learning with Mandelbrot and Julia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent developments in applied mathematics increasingly employ machine learning (ML)-particularly supervised learning-to accelerate numerical computations, such as solving nonlinear partial differential equations. In this work, we extend such techniques to objects of a more theoretical nature: the classification and structural analysis of fractal sets. Focusing on the Mandelbrot and Julia sets as principal examples, we demonstrate that supervised learning methods-including Classification and Regression Trees (CART), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Recurrent Neural Networks using both Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), Random Forests (RF), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)-can classify fractal points with significantly higher predictive accuracy and substantially lower computational cost than traditional numerical approaches, such as the thresholding technique. These improvements are consistent across a range of models and evaluation metrics. Notably, KNN and RF exhibit the best overall performance, and comparative analyses between models (e.g., KNN vs. LSTM) suggest the presence of novel regularity properties in these mathematical structures. Collectively, our findings indicate that ML not only enhances classification efficiency but also offers promising avenues for generating new insights, intuitions, and conjectures within pure mathematics.</description>

      <title>A hybrid dynamical-stochastic model of maximum temperature time series of Imphal, Northeast India incorporating nonlinear feedback and noise diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate variability is a complex phenomenon resulting from numerous interacting components of a climate system across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales. Although significant advances have been made in understanding global climate variability, there are relatively less studies on regional climate modeling, particularly in developing countries. In this work, we propose a framework of data driven hybrid dynamical stochastic modeling to investigate the variability of maximum temperature recorded for the capital city of Imphal in the state of Manipur, located in the Northeast India. In light of increasing concerns over global warming, studying maximum temperature variability over varying time scales is an important area of research. Analysis using publicly available climate data over the course of 73 years, our approach yields key insights into the temperature dynamics, such as a positive increase in temperature in the region during the period investigated. Our hybrid model, combining spectral analysis and Fourier decomposition methods with stochastic noise terms and nonlinear feedback mechanisms, is found to effectively reproduce the observed dynamics of maximum temperature variability with high accuracy. Our results are validated by robust statistical and qualitative tests. We further derive Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for the maximum temperature dynamics, offering the theoretical ground and analytical interpretation of the model that links the temperature dynamics with underlying physical principles.</description>

      <title>Response function as a quantitative measure of consciousness in brain dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the neural correlates of consciousness remains a central challenge in neuroscience. In this study, we investigate the relationship between consciousness and neural responsiveness by analyzing intracranial ECoG recordings from non-human primates across three distinct states: wakefulness, anesthesia, and recovery. Using a nonequilibrium recurrent neural network (RNN) model, we fit state-dependent cortical dynamics to extract the neural response function as a dynamics complexity indicator. Our findings demonstrate that the amplitude of the neural response function serves as a robust dynamical indicator of conscious state, consistent with the role of a linear response function in statistical physics. Notably, this aligns with our previous theoretical results showing that the response function in RNNs peaks near the transition between ordered and chaotic regimes -- highlighting criticality as a potential principle for sustaining flexible and responsive cortical dynamics. Empirically, we find that during wakefulness, neural responsiveness is strong, widely distributed, and consistent with rich nonequilibrium fluctuations. Under anesthesia, response amplitudes are significantly suppressed, and the network dynamics become more chaotic, indicating a loss of dynamical sensitivity. During recovery, the neural response function is elevated, supporting the gradual re-establishment of flexible and responsive activity that parallels the restoration of conscious processing. Our work suggests that a robust, brain-state-dependent neural response function may be a necessary dynamical condition for consciousness, providing a principled framework for quantifying levels of consciousness in terms of nonequilibrium responsiveness in the brain.</description>

Abstract: Stability is a fundamental concept that refers to a system's ability to return close to its original state after disturbances. The minimal conditions for stability when system parameters vary in time, though common in physics, have been largely overlooked. Here, we study the minimal amount of periodic stiffness a linear mass-spring system requires to remain stable and apply our findings to optimally trap the upside-down state of a compass in a time-varying magnetic field. We show that the ability to return close to its original state only needs to be ensured over small but precisely defined durations within each period for the system to achieve dynamic stability. These precise durations form a discrete set, remarkably predicted by rules analogous to those of quantum mechanics. This unexpected connection opens new avenues for controlling dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Modeling of Cyclo-Stationary Time Series Using Score-Based Generative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit cyclo-stationary behavior characterized by periodic forcing such as annual and diurnal cycles. We present a data-driven method leveraging recent advances in score-based generative modeling to construct reduced-order models for such cyclo-stationary time series. Our approach accurately reproduces the statistical properties and temporal correlations of the original data, enabling efficient generation of synthetic trajectories. We demonstrate the performance of the method through application to the Planet Simulator (PlaSim) climate model, constructing a reduced-order model for the 20 leading principal components of surface temperature driven by the annual cycle. The resulting surrogate model accurately reproduces the marginal and joint probability distributions, autocorrelation functions, and spatial coherence of the original climate system across multiple validation metrics. The approach offers substantial computational advantages, enabling generation of centuries of synthetic climate data in minutes compared to weeks required for equivalent full model simulations. This work opens new possibilities for efficient modeling of periodically forced systems across diverse scientific domains, providing a principled framework for balancing computational efficiency with physical fidelity in reduced-order modeling applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>
