      <title>On the radiation from unbaffled pistons and their dipole equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation efficiency from simple vibrating planar surfaces is often used as a basis to describe the sound radiation from more complex structures, having important applications in various fields of acoustics. The low-frequency radiation efficiency of a baffled piston can easily be represented by a simple monopole source. Notably, the equivalent source strength is dependent on the piston surface area. However, the unbaffled case presents additional difficulties as the so-called ``edge effects'' significantly alter the piston radiation impedance. Consequently, a low-frequency equivalence between dipoles and an unbaffled pistons is not as straight forward, since not only the piston area but also its shape will have an effect on the radiated sound. In this work, the search for a simple and generic, equivalence between dipoles and unbaffled pistons is pursued. A finite element model is used to calculate the radiation efficiency from unbaffled pistons with the same surface area but different shapes. A broad set of results indicate that the ``edge effects'' can be accurately represented by a simple term dependent on the piston compactness (ratio of area to perimeter). Effectively, pistons with smaller area to perimeter ratio will be less efficient radiators. Such term allows the definition of an equivalent dipole source strength that approximates the low-frequency behavior of an unbaffled piston of arbitrary shape.</description>
