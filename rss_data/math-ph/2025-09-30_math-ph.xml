      <title>General integral-identities involving Legendre polynomials and their derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrals involving derivatives of Legendre polynomials frequently arise in applications ranging from multipole expansions for processes involving electromagnetic probes to spectral methods in numerical physics. Despite their practical relevance, closed-form expressions for such integrals - particularly involving arbitrary derivative orders - are not readily accessible in standard references or symbolic tools. In this note, we derive and present general analytic expressions for integrals of the form $\int_{-1}^{+1} dx P^{(q)}_{n} (x) P^{(k)}_{m} (x)$, where $P_{n} (x)$ and $P_{m} (x)$ are Legendre polynomials and $q$, $k$ denote their order of differentiation. Using repeated integration by parts, parity arguments, and closed-form boundary evaluations, we obtain explicit binomial and Gamma-function representations valid for all non-negative integers $n$, $m$, $q$, $k$. These results unify and extend known orthogonality relations and provide ready-to-use tools for analytic and computational contexts.</description>

      <title>Form uniqueness for graphs with weakly spherically symmetric ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give characterizations for the failure of form uniqueness on weakly spherically symmetric graphs. The first characterization is in terms of the graph structure, the second involves the capacity of a Cauchy boundary. We also discuss the stability of form uniqueness and give characterizations for graphs which, following the removal of a set, consist of a disjoint union of weakly spherically symmetric graphs.</description>

      <title>Exponentially slow Mixing arising from Entropic Repulsion in $p$-SOS model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Glauber dynamics of the generalized (2+1)-dimensional $p$-SOS model under a hard floor constraint. This setting induces entropic repulsion: the integer-valued interface height is forced to remain above the wall and consequently rises to a typical height $H(p,L)$ that depends on both the parameter $p$ and the system size $L$. In the classical SOS model ($p=1$), \cite{caputo2016scaling, caputo2014dynamics} derived an exponential lower bound for the mixing time, demonstrating that the Glauber dynamics mixes only after an exponentially long time in the low-temperature regime (large $\beta$, the inverse temperature). However, beyond this case, no rigorous lower bounds were previously known: even for the widely studied Discrete Gaussian model ($p=2$), the metastable slowdown predicted by the entropic repulsion picture had remained an open problem. On the equilibrium side, \cite{lubetzky2016harmonic} obtained sharp large-deviation principles and precise estimates of typical and maximal heights for all $1\le p&lt;\infty$, but the dynamical consequences of these results had not been established.
  Our main contribution is to close this gap by proving, for the first time, that exponentially slow mixing arising from entropic repulsion persists throughout the regime $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. Specifically, we establish an exponential lower bound, showing that the mixing time satisfies $\tau_{\mathrm{mix}}\ge e^{cL}$ for some $c&gt;0$ depending on $p$ and $\beta$. In addition, we provide a refined metastability analysis, proving that the hitting time of an intermediate level $aH(p,L)$ is at least $\exp{\left(cL^{a^{d(p)}}\right)}$, where $d(p)$ is a positive function depending on $p$. Taken together, these results demonstrate that entropic repulsion induces uniformly slow mixing across the entire $p$-SOS family, thereby extending a phenomenon that had previously been established only for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Effective medium theory for embedded sound-soft obstacles in an anisotropic inhomogeneous medium with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of time-harmonic acoustic scattering in an inhomogeneous medium with a complex topological structure. Specifically, the medium is anisotropic and contains several disjoint sound-soft obstacles. This model commonly arises in the inverse scattering problem of simultaneously recovering the embedded obstacles and the surrounding medium. We propose a novel theoretical framework that demonstrates how embedded obstacles can be effectively approximated by an isotropic and lossy medium with specified physical parameters, wherein the total wave field exhibits decay properties related to these specified material parameters at the boundaries of the obstacles. This mathematical characterization of the wave in an effective medium model can be used to locate the underlying obstacles. Furthermore, we establish rigorous estimates to validate this approximation and provide a concrete example illustrating our theoretical results. Our proposed effective medium theory offers substantial applications within the context of the aforementioned inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Binary Representation in Multicomplex and Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a binary representation for basis elements of an algebra combined with a framework of multiplier and index functions, a connection has been established between the structure of a large class of algebras and the XOR componentwise operation. This result covers both multicomplex and Clifford algebras of any dimension. Necessary conditions for the existence of a diagonal basis are derived directly from this result, with an algorithm-like method to obtain it through a change-of-coordinates matrix in the commutative case. The same framework is then used to define an algebra of conjugate operations and study its properties.</description>

      <title>Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization conditions for Schrodinger operator: the Method of Microlocal Wronskian and Gram Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new formulation of the well known Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization rule (BS) of order 2 for a Schrodinger operator within the algebraic and microlocal framework of B. Helffer and J. Sjostrand; BS holds precisely when the Gram matrix consisting of scalar products of some WKB solutions with respect to the "flux norm" is not invertible. This condition is obtained using the microlocal Wronskian and does not rely on traditional matching techniques. It is simplified by using action-angle variables. The interest of this procedure lies in its possible generalization to more general frameworks, including self-adjoint 1-D h-PDO or matrixvalued Hamiltonians, like Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Haag Duality for 2D Quantum Spin Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Haag duality is a strong notion of locality for two-dimensional lattice quantum spin systems, requiring that the commutant of the algebra of observables supported in a cone-like region coincides with the algebra of observables in its complement. Originally introduced within algebraic quantum field theory, Haag duality has recently become pivotal in the operator-algebraic analysis of quantum many-body systems. In particular, it plays a key role in the description of anyonic excitations, which are widely believed to classify two-dimensional non-chiral gapped quantum phases of matter. Prior to this work, Haag duality had only been rigorously established for Kitaev's quantum double models with abelian input groups. In this paper, we establish that two-dimensional tensor network states based on biconnected $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras satisfy Haag duality. These states include as particular cases Kitaev quantum double and Levin-Wen string-net models, and we expect them to encompass representatives of all non-chiral phases. Our proof relies on deriving an operator-algebraic sufficient condition for Haag duality in finite systems, which we verify using tensor-network methods. As part of our analysis, we extend the tensor-network bulk-boundary correspondence, construct explicit commuting parent Hamiltonians for these models, and prove that in the biconnected case they satisfy the local topological quantum order condition.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of acoustic sources from the initial arrival time of waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel time domain sampling method based on the initial arrival time of waves is proposed to reconstruct acoustic sources, including point sources, curve sources, surface sources and block sources. The uniqueness of reconstructing sources whose spatial support is a convex region is proved. Theoretical analyses are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed sampling method in reconstructing various types of sound sources. The proposed algorithm does not involve the time integral, exhibits high computational efficiency, and demonstrates strong noise resistance. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>From Quasiperiodicity to a Complete Coloring of the Kohmoto Butterfly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectra of the Kohmoto model give rise to a fractal phase diagram, known as the Kohmoto butterfly. The butterfly encapsulates the spectra of all periodic Kohmoto Hamiltonians, whose index invariants are sought after. Topological methods - such as Chern numbers - are ill defined due to the discontinuous potential, and hence fail to provide index invariants. This Letter overcomes that obstacle and provides a complete classification of the Kohmoto model indices. Our approach encodes the Kohmoto butterfly as a spectral tree graph, reflecting the quasiperiodic nature via the periodic spectra. This yields a complete coloring of the phase diagram and a new perspective on other spectral butterflies.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of charges in a conducting needle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the distribution of point charges in a straight conductive needle and the electric field created by them. Starting from the bead model with $n$ point charges on the needle, we show the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium state. We also study the differential system pertaining to the system and show that the system of point charges does not converge towards an equilibrium state. In order to move from a discrete to a continuous model we increase the number of the point charges and explain the paradoxical convergence towards a uniform distribution although the charges tend to accumulate towards the ends of the needle (both at equilibrium and for the differential system of equations describing the Newtonian motion). This convergence has to be understood as that of the distribution functions of a sequence of probabilities (whether it is at equilibrium or when the charges move). We also provide visual illustrations that help understanding the studied phenomena.</description>

      <title>On compatible linear and quadratic Poisson brackets on $gl(N)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, using two constant tensors $c$ and $b$ on $sl(N)\otimes sl(N)$ satisfying certain linear-quadratic equation and a technique of Poisson bivectors and Schouten brackets, we explicitly construct quadratic Poisson bracket on the space $ (sl(N)+\mathbb{C})^*$ which is compatible with the standard Lie--Poisson bracket on $gl(N)^* \simeq (sl(N)\oplus \mathbb{C})^*$. The case of $N=3$ is considered in details. The relation of the proposed brackets with the generalized classical Sklyanin algebras is explained.</description>

      <title>Phase spaces in field theory: Reduction vs. resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we review the concept of phase space in classical field theory, discussing several variations on the basic notion, as well as the relation between them. In particular we will focus on the case where the field theory admits local (gauge) symmetry, in which case the physical phase space of the system emerges after a (usually singular) quotient with respect to the action of the symmetry group. We will highlight the symplectic and Poisson underpinnings of the reduction procedure that defines a phase space, and discuss how one can replace quotients with graded smooth objects within classical field theory via cohomological resolutions, a practice that goes under the name of Batalin--Vilkovisky formalism. Special attention is placed on the reduction and resolution of gauge theories on manifolds with corners, which famously depend on a number of arbitrary choices. We phrase these choices in terms of homotopies for the variational bicomplex, and define a homotopy version of Noether's current and conservation theorem.</description>

      <title>The failure of the Ehlers--Kundt conjecture in the impulsive case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1962, Ehlers and Kundt conjectured that plane waves are the only class of complete Ricci-flat~\emph{pp}-waves, i.e.\ metrics on ${\mathbb R}^4$ of the form \[ ds^2=2du\,dv+dx^2+dy^2+H(x,y,u)du^2\,. \] Recently, Flores and S\'{a}nchez gave a proof of the conjecture in the fundamental case of spatially polynomially bounded profile functions $H$. However, impulsive pp-waves, i.e., waves with concentrated profile functions of the form $H(x,y,u)=f(x,y)\,\delta(u)$ ($\delta$, the Dirac measure) have been found to be complete. We summarise completeness results for several classes of impulsive wave spacetimes achieved during the last years and discuss them in the context of the Ehlers--Kundt conjecture.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium states for non relativistic Bose gases with condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the construction of the equilibrium states at positive temperature in the presence of a condensation phase for a Gas of non relativistic Bose particles on an infinite space interacting through a localised two body interaction. We use methods of quantum field theory in the algebraic formulation to obtain this result and in order to prove convergence of the partition function and of the generating function of the correlation functions, we introduce an auxiliary stochastic Gaussian field which mediates the interaction of the Bose particles (Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation). The construction of the equilibrium state and of the partition function in the presence of the condensate, treating the auxiliary stochastic field as external potential, can be achieved using and adapting ideas and methods of Araki. Explicit formulas for the relative entropy of the equilibrium state with the external potential with respect to the equilibrium state of the free theory are obtained adapting known Feynman-Kac formulas for the propagators of the theory. If the two-body interaction is sufficiently weak, the proof of the convergence of the partition function after evaluation of the external stochastic field on a suitable Gaussian state can be given utilizing the properties of the relative entropy mentioned above. Limits where the localisation of the two-body interaction is removed are eventually discussed in combination of the limits of vanishing temperature and or in the weakly interacting regime.</description>

      <title>On stability of triangular factorization of positive operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak f=\{\mathscr F_s\}_{s&gt;0}$ be a nest and $C$ a bounded positive operator in a Hilbert space $\mathscr F$. The representation $C=V^*V$ provided $V\mathscr F_s\subset\mathscr F_s$ is a triangular factorization (TF) of $C$ w.r.t. $\mathfrak f$. The factorization is stable if $C^\alpha\underset{\alpha\to\infty}\to C$ and $C^\alpha=V^{\alpha\,*}V^\alpha$ implies $V^\alpha\to V$. If $C$ is positive definite (isomorphism), then TF is stable. The paper deals with the case of positive but not positive definite $C$. We impose some assumptions on $C^\alpha$ and $C$ which provide the stability of TF.</description>

      <title>Quantum Yang-Mills Charges in Strongly Coupled 2D Lattice QCD with Three Flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of the truly gauge-invariant and conserved charges of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, focusing on lattice QCD in the strong coupling regime. The construction of those charges uses the integral version of the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills equations, and they correspond to the eigenvalues of a charge operator. The gauge invariance of the charges suggests that they are not confined, hence hadronic states may carry them. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we evaluate the correlation functions of those charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the gauge group SU(N) (N=2,3) and Grassmannian variables - the fermionic fields. Our results show that the expectation values of the lowest non-trivial charges are nonzero for baryon and meson states but vanish for non-gauge-invariant states, supporting the interpretation that hadrons indeed carry these charges. While renormalization effects and higher-order contributions remain to be analyzed, these findings point toward a potential link between gauge-invariant charges and confinement.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Derivations Of K-Theoretic Donaldson Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory on $X\times S^1$, with $X$ a closed smooth four-manifold. A partial topological twisting along $X$ renders the theory formally independent of the metric on $X$. The theory depends on the spin structure and the circumference $R$ of $S^1$. The coefficients of the $R$-expansion of the partition function are Witten indices, which are identified with $L^2$-indices of Dirac operators on moduli spaces of instantons. The partition function encodes BPS indices for instanton particles on a spatial manifold $X$, and these indices are special cases of K-theoretic Donaldson invariants. When the 't Hooft flux of the gauge theory is nonzero and $X$ is not spin, the 5d theory can be anomalous, but this anomaly can be canceled by coupling to a line bundle with connection for the global $U(1)$ ``instanton number symmetry''. For $b_2^+(X)&gt;0$ we can derive the partition function from integration over the Coulomb branch of the effective 4d low-energy theory. When $X$ is toric we can also use equivariant localization with respect to the $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ symmetry. The two methods lead to the same results for the wall-crossing formula. We also determine path integrals for four-manifolds with $b_2^+(X)&gt;1$. Our results agree with those for algebraic surfaces by G\"ottsche, Kool, Nakajima, Yoshioka, and Williams, but apply to a larger class of manifolds. When the circumference of the circle is tuned to special values, the path integral is associated with the 5d superconformal $E_1$ theory. Topological invariants in this case involve generalizations of Seiberg-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Interplay of blowups in a differential kinetic model of gravity wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the blowup scenarios in a novel phase-parametrized differential approximation model of deep water surface gravity waves that was recently derived in the limit of a large number of multicomponent fields. Previous work showed that upon precisely tuning the phase parameter $\phi$ to $\pi$, the model formally supports steady-state solutions transitioning from Kolmogorov-Zakharov $\propto \omega^{-4}$ to Phillips' critical balance $\propto \omega^{-5}$ at small scales, a feature qualitatively consistent with oceanic measurements. Here we show that the critical balance is in fact a generic feature of the model, which prescribes a finite-time transfer of the energy from the IR towards the UV for any value of $\phi \in [0,\pi)$. We observe a bifurcation in the blowup scenario from continuous to discrete self-similarity as $\phi$ is increased above $\phi_*\simeq 2.7$. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a non-continuous blowup in the kinetic theory of waves.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova Formula in (Fractional) Sobolev Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior, as $\varepsilon \to 0$, of nonlocal functionals $$ \mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u) = \iint_{\mathbb{R}^N\times\mathbb{R}^N}
  \rho_{\varepsilon}(y-x)\,|u(x)-u(y)|^p\,dx\,dy,\qquad u\in L^p(\mathbb{R}^N),\quad 1\leqslant p&lt;\infty, $$ associated with a general family of nonnegative measurable kernels $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$. Our primary aim is to single out the weakest moment-type assumptions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$ that are necessary and sufficient for the pointwise convergence $$ \lim_{\varepsilon\to 0}\mathcal{F}_{\varepsilon}(u)=2\|u\|_{L^p}^p $$ to hold for every $u$ in a prescribed subspace of $L^p(\mathbb{R}^N)$. In the canonical smooth regime of compactly supported functions ($u\in C_c^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^N)$) we show that convergence occurs when two optimal conditions are satisfied: (i) a mass-escape condition, and (ii) a short-range attenuation effect, expressed by the vanishing as $\varepsilon\to 0$ of the kernels' $p$-moments in any fixed neighborhood of the origin. This general framework recovers the classical Maz'ya--Shaposhnikova theorem for fractional-type kernels and extends the convergence result to a much broader class of interaction profiles, which may be non-symmetric and non-homogeneous. Using a density argument that preserves the moment assumptions, we prove that the same necessary and sufficient conditions remain valid in the integer-order Sobolev setting ($u\in W^{1,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$). Finally, by adapting the method to fractional Sobolev spaces $W^{s,p}(\mathbb{R}^N)$ with $s\in(0,1)$, we recover the Maz'ya-Shaposhnikova formula and extend it under analogous abstract conditions on the family $\{\rho_{\varepsilon}\}_{\varepsilon&gt;0}$.</description>

      <title>Anticoherent $k$-planes and coding techniques for a 3-qubit scheme of universal quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toponomic quantum computing (TQC) employs rotation sequences of anticoherent $k$-planes to construct noise-tolerant quantum gates. In this work, we demonstrate the implementation of generalized Toffoli gates, using $k$-planes of spin systems with $s \geq k + 1$, and of the Hadamard gate for a 3-qubit system, using a spin $s \!= \! 15$ 8-plane. We propose a universal quantum computing scheme for 3-qubit systems (via Hadamard + Toffoli gates) based on coding techniques. A key advantage of this construction is its inherent robustness against noise: apart from reparametrization invariance, our scheme is characterized by immunity to arbitrarily large deformations of the path in (rotational) parameter space.</description>

      <title>Crossing probabilities in geometric inhomogeneous random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a geometric inhomogeneous random graph vertices are given by the points of a Poisson process and are equipped with independent weights following a heavy tailed distribution. Any pair of distinct vertices is independently forming an edge with a probability decaying as a function of the product of the weights divided by the distance of the vertices. For this continuum percolation model we study the crossing probabilities of annuli, i.e. the probabilities that there exist paths starting inside a ball and ending outside a larger concentric ball with increasing inner and outer radii. Depending on the radii, the power-law exponent of the degree distribution and the decay of the probability of long edges, we identify regimes where the crossing probabilities by a path are equivalent to the crossing probabilities by one or by two edges. We also identify the escape probabilities from balls with strong centre, i.e. the asymptotics of the probability that there exists a path starting from a vertex with a given weight leaving a centred ball as radius and weight are going to infinity. As a corollary we get the subcritical one-arm exponents characterising the decay of the probability that a typical point is in a component not contained in a centred ball whose radius goes to infinity.</description>

Abstract: We present an infinite set of non-local integrals of motion for the deformed $W$-algebra $W_{q,t}(g)$ associated with the affine Lie algebras $g=A_l^{(1)}, D_l^{(1)}$ and $E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$.They can be regarded as a two-parameter deformation of trace of the monodromy matrix of the $g$-KdV theory. Commutativity of the non-local integrals of motion is shown in the case of $g=A_l^{(1)}$ and $D_l^{(1)}$ by a direct calculation. In the case of $g=E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$ it is a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Chiral Analogues of Knit Stitches Designed Using Chiral Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fabrics are flexible thin structures made of entangled yarn or fibers, yet the topological bases of their mechanics remain poorly understood. For weft knitted fabrics, we describe how the entanglement of adjacent stitches contributes to the flexibility of the fabric. Interpreting heterogeneous stitch pairs as domain boundaries reveals that the step between pairs of neighboring stitches is responsible for direction-specific flexibility. In typical knitted fabrics, anisotropic flexibility can be attributed to latticed domain boundaries. The intersections between domain boundaries result in point defects that induce frustration that resembles the impossible Penrose stairs. We identify these by a chiral characteristic, defined summing the ascending or descending steps in a cycle surrounding the defect. Remarkably, seed fabric, a knit with high flexibility in both course and wale directions, is characterized as a racemic crystal of these chiral point defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sum rules are elegant formulas that relate entropy functionals to coefficients associated with orthogonal polynomials [Sim11]. In a series of paper (see for example [GNR16], [GNR17], [BSZ18a], [BSZ18b]), interesting connections have been established between the large theory of spectral measures built on random matrices and sum rules. In this work, we extend this approach by studying sum rules within random matrix models with polynomial potentials on the unit circle, with a particular focus on cases where the equilibrium measure lacks full support.</description>

      <title>Quantum Stability at One Loop for BPS Membranes in a Lorentz-Covariant RVPD Matrix Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first rigorous one-loop demonstration that the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD) preserves the quantum stability of its BPS membranes. By exploiting the closure of the restricted kappa-symmetry with RVPD, the BRST complex terminates without higher ghosts and the gauge-fixed measure remains under analytic control.
  Performing the one-loop expansion around BPS backgrounds, we match bosonic and fermionic spectra, prove that the RVPD ghost determinant is benign, and evaluate the determinants through zeta regularization. The resulting Main Theorem establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes stay stable, whereas the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode. Our analysis unifies the treatment of zero modes, connects the effective action to central charges, and clarifies the relationship with BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for extending RVPD-based formulations.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, while larger $N$ is analogous to multi-channel or higher-spin impurity scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

Abstract: We show that interval partition functions (transition amplitudes) of three-dimensional $N = 2$ theories admit factorizations into sums of products of hemisphere partition functions with additional normalization factors. We prove the factorization explicitly for supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics and Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theories. In the former case, we interpret the factorization geometrically in terms of the factorization of equivariant K-theory classes. In the latter case, we prove that hemisphere partition functions are affine characters and determine the normalization factors explicitly in special cases.</description>

Abstract: On a torus of arbitrary dimension, it is conjectured that Schr\"odinger propagators with bounded potentials are observable from any space-time set of positive Lebesgue measure. We establish a criterion that proves the conjecture on the one-dimensional torus, yields new examples of measurable observation sets, and, more significantly, reduces the general conjecture to verifying certain integrability bounds for free Schr\"odinger waves. These bounds are far weaker than Bourgain's conjectured periodic Strichartz estimates, yet remain highly nontrivial.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In earlier joint work with Ruijsenaars, we constructed and studied symmetric joint eigenfunctions $J_N$ for quantum Hamiltonians of the hyperbolic relativistic $N$-particle Calogero--Moser system. For generic coupling values, they are non-elementary functions that in the $N=2$ case essentially amount to a `relativistic' generalisation of the conical function specialisation of the Gauss hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1$. In this paper, we consider a discrete set of coupling values for which the solution to the joint eigenvalue problem is known to be given by functions $\psi_N$ of Baker--Akhiezer type, which are elementary, but highly nontrivial, functions. Specifically, we show that $J_N$ essentially amounts to the antisymmetrisation of $\psi_N$ and, as a byproduct, we obtain a recursive construction of $\psi_N$ in terms of an iterated residue formula.</description>

      <title>Decoupling hydrodynamization from thermalization via nonlinear Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early thermalization puzzle arises from the unexpectedly early applicability of hydrodynamics in heavy-ion collisions. While hydrodynamics has traditionally been associated with the onset of local thermal equilibrium, its derivations -- whether microscopic or macroscopic -- rely instead on linearization around equilibrium. However, the linearization timescale -- the time at which a system's evolution begins to follow a linearized equation -- has not been systematically investigated. In this work, we employ the spectral nonlinear Boltzmann equation -- the lowest-order truncation of the spectral Bogoliubov--Born--Green--Kirkwood--Yvon (BBGKY) hierarchy -- to analyze the timescales of linearization and thermalization under three distinct truncation schemes. The first two truncations allow for analytic treatment via recursive spectral equations, while the third requires numerical methods for generic initial conditions. The analysis is performed for a homogeneous, massless system with a constant differential cross section. For this simplified setup, we find a robust separation: the linearization time is consistently about half the thermalization time ($\tau_{\mathrm{lin}}/\tau_{\mathrm{therm}} \approx 1/2$). This separation of timescales suggests an explanation for the early applicability of hydrodynamics and points toward a possible quantitative resolution of the early thermalization puzzle.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, inextensible flows of curves in four-dimensional pseudo-Galilean space are expressed, and the necessary and sufficient conditions of these curve flows are given as partial differential equations. Also, the directional derivatives are defined in accordance with the Serret-Frenet frame in G41, the extended Serret-Frenet relations are expressed by using Frenet formulas in G41. Furthermore, the bending elastic energy functions are expressed for the same particle according to curve a(s,t).</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content gone largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian Kerr-Schild ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the Poincar\'e subalgebra containing exclusively time translations and spatial rotations. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.</description>

      <title>Geometric Brownian motion with random observation time as generalization of the double Pareto distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the probability distribution of the value of geometric Brownian motion at the stochastic observation time. It is known that the exponentially distributed observation time yields the distribution called the double Pareto distribution, and this study aims to generalize this distribution. First, we provide a calculation formula for the moment of the observed value of geometric Brownian motion using the moment-generating function of the observation time distribution. Next, the probability density of the observed value of geometric Brownian motion is exactly derived under the observation time following the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution. This result includes cases where the observation time follows the gamma, inverse gamma, and inverse Gaussian distributions, and can be regarded as a generalization of the double Pareto distribution.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced criticality in $p$-adic scaling limits of random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An anisotropy parameter $h$ in $(0,1]$ induces on $\mathbb{Q}_p^2$ a duality-compatible, two-scale filtration that collapses to one scale at the right endpoint. This filtration defines shell-uniform transition laws for hierarchical random walks on a discrete group whose scaling limits are L\'{e}vy processes on $\mathbb{Q}_p^2$. The diffusion constants of the coordinate processes jump at the right endpoint, even though the radial jump law depends continuously on $h$. This instance of geometry-induced criticality isolates a structural mechanism that should extend to locally compact abelian groups and suggests a route to studying critical behavior in ultrametric models.</description>

      <title>A Fourier-Mukai Transform For KR Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In complex K-theory, the Fourier-Mukai transform is an isomorphism between K-theory groups of a torus and its dual torus which is defined by pullback, tensoring by the Poincar\'e line bundle and pushforward. The Fourier-Mukai transform extends to families of dual tori provided one works with twisted K-theory. The Fourier-Mukai transform is then an isomorphism between twisted K-theory groups of $T$-dual torus bundles. In this paper we prove an extension of these results to twisted KR-theory. We introduce a notion of Real $T$-duality for torus bundles with Real structures and prove the existence of Real $T$-duals. We then define a Real Fourier-Mukai transform for Real $T$-dual torus bundles and prove that it is an isomorphism. Lastly, we consider an application of these results to the families index of Real Dirac operators which is relevant to Real Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a family of radially symmetric Coulomb gas systems at inverse temperature $\beta = 2$. The family is characterised by the property that the density of the equilibrium measure vanishes on a ring at radius $r_*$, which lies strictly inside the droplet. The large $n$ expansion of the logarithm of the partition function is obtained up to a novel $n^{1/4}$ term. We perform a double scaling limit of the correlation kernel at the $n^{1/4}$ scale and obtain a new limiting kernel in the bulk, which differs from the well-known Ginibre kernel.</description>

      <title>Event-based complexity in atmospheric turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the studies of Kolmogorov and Oboukhov in 1941, the problem of intermittent large velocity excursions was recognized to be one of the most intriguing and elusive aspects of turbulent flows. While many efforts were devoted since 1960s to the magnitude intermittency, related to the statistics of the large increments in the turbulent signals, the attention towards the so-called clustering intermittency has started to increase only in the last two decades, even if some pioneering studies were carried in previous years. The low attention towards the clustering intermittency is somewhat surprising, as intermittency itself is essentially defined as an alternance of extended quiescent periods/regions and short/small high activity periods/zones. It is then natural to characterize intermittency by means of events marked along the dependent variable axes, whatever time or space. Conversely, the concept of crucial events and of temporal complexity, related to non-trivial clustering properties of these same events, has been proposed as a general interpretative framework for the investigation of complex systems with metastable self-organizing dynamics. Without any claim to being complete, in this chapter we give a review of event-based complexity approaches used in literature for the description of turbulence in the planetary boundary layer. The main goal is to put a first bridge between turbulence studies exploiting event-based complexity approaches, such as clustering exponents and classical Oboukhov intermittency exponents, and studies about intermittent complex systems, where concepts and ideas developed in the fields of non-equilibrium statistical physics, probability theory and dynamical system theory are jointly exploited.</description>

      <title>Information Loss and Cost in Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and information-theoretic framework to characterize symmetry breaking of generalized, non-invertible symmetries in two spatial dimensions. The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound governed by the Jones index, equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric code, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of condensation patterns. Our results forge new connections between operator algebras, tensor category theory, and quantum information in the study of generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Discrete flat disks: rigid quadrangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Ferrari in the physics context of JT gravity, we introduce and enumerate a combinatorial family of quadrangulations of the disk, called rigid quadrangulations. These form a subclass of the flat quadrangulations in the sense that every inner vertex has degree 4, and therefore it can be viewed as a discrete model of flat metrics on the disk. Our main result is a bijection between rigid quadrangulations and certain colorful integer-labeled quadrangulations of the sphere, together with a dictionary relating a variety of natural statistics on both sides. Adaptions of the bijection to various boundary conditions allow us to import recent enumerative results for colorful quadrangulation obtained by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price. We discuss some consequences of the enumeration of rigid quadrangulations for a flat version of JT gravity at finite cutoff, and comment on potential scaling limits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of rigid quadrangulations, recently introduced by Budd and proven to be in bijection with colorful quadrangulations. The generating function for the latter has been derived in an algebraic manner by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price, which therefore also counts rigid quadrangulations. In this paper we will provide a direct, bijective proof, for this generating function. We will relate the rigid quadrangulations to some naturally appearing trees, decorated with certain natural data. By some slight bijective manipulation of the data, we get a decorated tree, for which the generating function can be found. This result opens the door to better understand the geometry of random rigid quadrangulations (and maybe even of random colorful quadrangulations), by studying the corresponding decorated trees. These properties are relevant the formulation of UV complete JT-gravity, following the work of Ferrari.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a system of stochastic interacting particles with general diffusion coefficient and drift functions and we study the types of collisions that arise in them. In particular, interactions between particles are inversely proportional to their separation, and the coupling function of interaction is also considered in great generality. Our main result indicates that under very mild conditions, all collisions are simple almost surely, namely, only one pair of particles collides at any time, while more complicated collisions such as three-body or disjoint two-body collisions occur with zero probability. In order to obtain our results we make use of symmetric polynomials on the square of particle separations; the degree of these polynomials indicates the type of collision, and by a locality argument we show that polynomials indicating a non-simple collision almost surely do not cancel. We make use of our main result to study the Hausdorff dimension of times at which collisions occur, and we show that this dimension is given by the ratio between the interaction coupling and diffusion functions. Our results cover many of the most well-known particle systems, such as the Dyson model and Wishart processes and their extensions to non-constant diffusion coefficients and background drifts.</description>

      <title>Consistent energy-momentum trace couplings of fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational models with non-minimal couplings involving the trace of the energy-momentum tensor have become increasingly popular. The idea of coupling the trace of the matter tensor to the geometry can be applied to various matter models, including relativistic perfect fluids. However, it is well-known that the variational formulation of perfect fluids involves some technicalities. We carefully derive the field equations including the trace coupling of a perfect fluid using two different approaches, namely, that given by Brown using Lagrange multipliers, and that given by Schutz using velocity potentials. We show that previous results involving such trace couplings do not match the results presented here. We demonstrate that our fluid's equations of motion are consistent with the gravitational field equations. Moreover, we present a simple on-shell argument which further supports the correctness of our results.
  Our work implies that a vast amount of the $f(R,T)$ literature using perfect fluids needs to be revisited.</description>

      <title>A coarse-graining theory for elliptic operators and homogenization in high contrast</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review a coarse-graining theory for divergence-form elliptic operators. The construction centers on a pair of coarse-grained matrices defined on spatial blocks that encode a scale-dependent notion of ellipticity, transmit precise information from small to large scales, and yield coarse-grained counterparts of standard elliptic estimates. Under simplifying assumptions, we give a complete proof of the result of [arXiv:2405.10732] that homogenization is reached within at most $C\log^2(1+\Theta)$ dyadic length scales in the high-contrast regime, where $\Theta$ is the ellipticity contrast. We argue that this scale-local notion of ellipticity is genuinely iterable across arbitrarily many scales, providing a framework for a rigorous renormalization group analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish up-to-constants estimates for arm events in the Brownian loop soup on the 2D metric graph associated with the square lattice. More specifically, we consider two natural geometric events: first, ``bulk'' four-arm events, corresponding to two large connected components of loops getting close to each other; and then, two-arm events in the half-plane, used to estimate the probability that a cluster of loops approaches the boundary. Our proof relies on an estimate by Lupu-Werner [Probab. Theory Related Fields 171(3):775-818, 2018], thanks to the well-known coupling between the loop soup and the Gaussian free field on the metric graph [Lecture Notes in Mathematics, volume 2026, 2011] and [Ann. Probab. 44(3):2117-2146, 2016].
  As a consequence, we also obtain up-to-constant upper bounds for the corresponding arm events in the random walk loop soup on the square lattice. In this way, we verify Assumptions 5.7 and 5.11 in arXiv:2409.16273: in a box with side length $N$, this implies the existence of crossings where the Gaussian free field remains below $a\sqrt{\log \log N}$ in absolute value, for some constant $a &gt; 0$ large enough.</description>

      <title>Effective Free Energy Landscapes and Hawking-Page Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent interesting development on the dynamics of black hole phase transitions, the Hawking-Page transition, has been the so-called Gibbs free energy landscape approach. In this formalism, it is assumed that there exists a canonical ensemble of a series of black hole spacetimes with arbitrary horizon radius at a given ensemble temperature. An off-shell Gibbs free energy is defined for every spacetime state in the ensemble, with the horizon radius treated as the order parameter. The minima (maxima) of this function correspond to the various stable (unstable) black hole states. This off-shell Gibbs free energy is then treated as a classical effective drift potential of an associated Fokker-Planck equation used to study the stochastic dynamics of black hole phase transition under thermal fluctuations. Additive noise, which is independent of the black hole size, is assumed in obtaining the Fokker-Planck equation. In this work we extend the previous treatment by considering the effects of multiplicative noise, namely, noise that could scale with black hole size. This leads to an effective free energy function that can be used to study the modification of the Hawking-Page transition of a black hole system. It is realized that it is generally difficult to form black holes under a multiplicative noise, unless the effective and the original free energy become extremal at the same horizon radius. For this latter situation some theoretical noise profiles which are monotonically increasing/deceasing functions of the horizon radius are considered. It is found that stronger noise disfavors the formation of black hole.</description>

      <title>Quantitative quantum soundness for all multipartite compiled nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compiled nonlocal games transfer the power of Bell-type multi-prover tests into a single-device setting by replacing spatial separation with cryptography. Concretely, the KLVY compiler (STOC'23) maps any multi-prover game to an interactive single-prover protocol, using quantum homomorphic encryption. A crucial security property of such compilers is quantum soundness, which ensures that a dishonest quantum prover cannot exceed the original game's quantum value. For practical cryptographic implementations, this soundness must be quantitative, providing concrete bounds, rather than merely asymptotic. While quantitative quantum soundness has been established for the KLVY compiler in the bipartite case, it has only been shown asymptotically for multipartite games. This is a significant gap, as multipartite nonlocality exhibits phenomena with no bipartite analogue, and the difficulty of enforcing space-like separation makes single-device compilation especially compelling. This work closes this gap by showing the quantitative quantum soundness of the KLVY compiler for all multipartite nonlocal games. On the way, we introduce an NPA-like hierarchy for quantum instruments and prove its completeness, thereby characterizing correlations from operationally-non-signaling sequential strategies. We further develop novel geometric arguments for the decomposition of sequential strategies into their signaling and non-signaling parts, which might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains by separation of variables: Complete spectrum and matrix elements of some quasi-local operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:1206.0646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integrable quantum models, associated to the transfer matrices of the 6-vertex reflection algebra for spin 1/2 representations, are studied in this paper. In the framework of Sklyanin's quantum separation of variables (SOV), we provide the complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfer matrix and the proof of the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum. Moreover, we use these integrable quantum models as further key examples for which to develop a method in the SOV framework to compute matrix elements of local operators. This method has been introduced first in [1] and then used also in [2], it is based on the resolution of the quantum inverse problem (i.e. the reconstruction of all local operators in terms of the quantum separate variables) plus the computation of the action of separate covectors on separate vectors. In particular, for these integrable quantum models, which in the homogeneous limit reproduce the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions, we have obtained the SOV-reconstructions for a class of quasi-local operators and determinant formulae for the covector-vector actions. As consequence of these findings we provide one determinant formulae for the matrix elements of this class of reconstructed quasi-local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates.</description>

      <title>All correlation functions of the open XXX spin 1/2 quantum chains for unparallel boundary magnetic fields with one constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this first paper, we start the analysis of correlation functions of quantum spin chains with general integrable boundary conditions. We initiate these computations for the open XXX spin 1/2 quantum chains with some unparallel magnetic fields allowing for a spectrum characterization in terms of homogeneous Baxter like TQ-equations, in the framework of the quantum separation of variables (SoV). Previous SoV analysis leads to the formula for the scalar products of the so-called separate states. Here, we solve the remaining fundamental steps allowing for the computation of correlation functions. In particular, we rederive the ground state density in the thermodynamic limit thanks to SoV approach, we compute the so-called boundary-bulk decomposition of boundary separate states and the action of local operators on these separate states in the case of unparallel boundary magnetic fields. These findings allow us to derive multiple integral formulae for these correlation functions similar to those previously known for the open XXX quantum spin chain with parallel magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: It is shown that generators of single-particle, translation-invariant Lindblad operators on the infinite line are unitarily equivalent to direct integrals of finite-range bi-infinite Laurent operator with finite-range perturbations. This representation enables rigorous calculation of spectra for local dissipation such as dephasing and incoherent hopping, and yields proofs of gaplessness, absence of residual spectrum and a condition for convergence of finite volume spectra to their infinite volume counterparts. The analysis relies on new results on the spectra of direct integrals of non-normal operators which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation sequences in the secular 3D planetary 3-Body problem: a geometric approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement the geometric method proposed in ([9], [3], [16]) to analytically predict the sequence of bifurcations leading to a change of stability and/or the appearance of new periodic orbits in the secular 3D planetary three body problem. Stemming from the analysis in [17], we examine various normal form models as regards the extent to which they lead to a phase space dynamics qualitatively similar as that in the complete system. For fixed total angular momentum, the phase space in Hopf variables is the 3D sphere, and the complete sequence of bifurcations of new periodic orbits can be recovered through formulas yielding the tangencies or degenerate intersections between the sphere and the surfaces of a constant second integral of motion of the normal form flow. In particular, we find the critical values of the second integral giving rise to pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations of new periodic orbits in the system. This analysis renders possible to predict the most important structural changes in the phase space, as well as the emergence of new possible stable periodic planetary orbital configurations which can take place as the mutual inclination between the two planets is allowed to increase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study heat conduction in a one-dimensional finite, unpinned chain of atoms perturbed by stochastic momentum exchange and coupled to Langevin heat baths at possibly distinct temperatures placed at the endpoints of the chain. While infinite systems without boundaries are known to exhibit superdiffusive energy transport described by a fractional heat equation with the generator $-|\Delta|^{3/4}$, the corresponding boundary conditions induced by heat baths remain less understood. We establish the hydrodynamic limit for a finite chain with $n+1$ atoms connected to thermostats at the endpoints, deriving the macroscopic evolution of the averaged energy profile. The limiting equation is governed by a non-local L\'evy-type operator, with boundary terms determined by explicit interaction kernels that encode absorption, reflection, and transmission of long-wavelength phonons at the baths. Our results provide the first rigorous identification of boundary conditions for fractional superdiffusion arising directly from microscopic dynamics, highlighting their distinction from both diffusive and pinned-chain settings.</description>

Abstract: Using a cone-theoretical method, we prove the uniqueness of the ground state for two Bose Hubbard models. The first model is the usual Bose Hubbard model with real hopping coefficients and attractive interactions. The second model is a two-component Bose Hubbard model. Under certain conditions, we show that the ground state in the subspace with particle number $N=2n$($n$ is a positive integer) is unique for both models. For the second model, we show that the ground state has spin along the z-axis $S^{z}=0$. When the hopping coefficients are real, it has zero spin quantum number, i.e., it is a singlet. Our proofs work equally well for any arbitrary finite-size lattice.</description>

      <title>Notes on the type classification of von Neumann algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01958v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader, and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and II factors in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting connections between type classification and modular theory, including the argument for why type III$_1$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington, and Witten.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06790v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Wilson loop expectations in lattice Yang-Mills models with a compact Lie group $G$. Using tools recently introduced in a companion paper, we provide alternate derivations, interpretations, and generalizations of several recent theorems about Brownian motion limits (Dahlqvist), lattice string trajectories (Chatterjee and Jafarov) and surface sums (Magee and Puder). We show further that one can express Wilson loop expectations as sums over embedded planar maps in a manner that applies to any matrix dimension $N \geq 1$, any inverse temperature $\beta&gt;0$, and any lattice dimension $d \geq 2$.
  When $G=\mathrm{U}(N)$, the embedded maps we consider are pairs $(\mathcal M, \phi)$ where $\mathcal M$ is a planar (or higher genus) map and $\phi$ is a graph homomorphism from $\mathcal M$ to a lattice such as $\mathbb Z^d$. The faces of $\mathcal M$ come in two partite classes: $\textit{edge-faces}$ (each mapped by $\phi$ onto a single edge) and $\textit{plaquette-faces}$ (each mapped by $\phi$ onto a single plaquette). The weight of a lattice edge $e$ is the Weingarten function applied to the partition whose parts are given by half the boundary lengths of the faces in $\phi^{-1}(e)$. (The Weingarten function becomes quite simple in the $N\to \infty$ limit.) The overall weight of an embedded map is proportional to $N^\chi$ (where $\chi$ is the Euler characteristic) times the product of the edge weights. We establish analogous results for $\mathrm{SU}(N)$, $\mathrm{O}(N)$, $\mathrm{SO}(N)$, and $\mathrm{Sp}(N/2)$, where the embedded surfaces and weights take a different form. There are several variants of these constructions. In this context, we present a list of relevant open problems spanning several disciplines: random matrix theory, representation theory, statistical physics, and the theory of random surfaces, including random planar maps and Liouville quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Jacobi sigma models are two-dimensional topological non-linear field theories which are associated with Jacobi structures. The latter can be considered as a generalization of Poisson structures. After reviewing the main properties and peculiarities of these models, we focus on the twisted version in which a Wess-Zumino term is included. This modification allows for the target space to be a twisted Jacobi manifold. We discuss in particular the model on the sphere $S^5$.</description>

Abstract: In arXiv:2404.19088, we initiated a program linking birational invariants with smooth ones and offering new interpretations of classical invariants, such as the Kervaire-Milnor invariants. Here, we rely on the profound geometric reasoning provided by Lupercio and Uribe in the early 00s to establish a connection between Chen-Ruan cohomology and several $G$-birational invariants introduced in the pioneering works Kontsevich, Kresch, Pestun, Tschinkel, along with presenting applications. Combined with the theory of atoms by Katzarkov, Kontsevich, Pantev, and Yu, the proposal in this paper program will lead to a theory of equivariant atoms.</description>

      <title>Sample-based Hamiltonian and Lindbladian simulation: Non-asymptotic analysis of sample complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density matrix exponentiation (DME) is a quantum algorithm that processes multiple copies of a program state $\sigma$ to realize the Hamiltonian evolution $e^{-i \sigma t}$. Wave matrix Lindbladization (WML) similarly processes multiple copies of a program state $\psi_L$ in order to realize a Lindbladian evolution. Both algorithms are prototypical sample-based quantum algorithms and can be used for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum principal component analysis, Hamiltonian simulation, and Lindbladian simulation. In this work, we present detailed sample complexity analyses for DME and sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, as well as for WML and sample-based Lindbladian simulation. In particular, we prove that the sample complexity of DME is no larger than $4t^2/\varepsilon$ for evolution time $t$ and imprecision level $\varepsilon$ quantified by the normalized diamond distance. We also establish a fundamental lower bound on the sample complexity of sample-based Hamiltonian simulation, which matches our DME sample complexity bound up to a constant multiplicative factor. Additionally, we prove that the sample complexity of WML is no larger than $3t^2d^2/\varepsilon$, where $d$ is the dimension of the space on which the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially, and we prove a lower bound of $10^{-4} t^2/\varepsilon$ on the sample complexity of sample-based Lindbladian simulation. These results prove that WML is optimal for sample-based Lindbladian simulation whenever the Lindblad operator acts nontrivially on a constant-sized system. Finally, we point out that the DME sample complexity analysis in [Kimmel et al., npj Quantum Information 3, 13 (2017)] and the WML sample complexity analysis in [Patel and Wilde, Open Systems \&amp; Information Dynamics 30, 2350010 (2023)] appear to be incomplete, highlighting the need for the results presented here.</description>

      <title>Generalizing symplectic topology from 1 to 2 dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In symplectic topology one uses elliptic methods to prove rigidity results about symplectic manifolds and solutions of Hamiltonian equations on them, where the most basic example is given by geodesics on Riemannian manifolds. Harmonic maps from surfaces are the natural 2-dimensional generalizations of geodesics. In this paper, we give the corresponding generalization of symplectic manifolds and Hamiltonian equations, leading to a class of partial differential equations that share properties similar to Hamiltonian (ordinary) differential equations. Two rigidity results are discussed: a non-squeezing theorem and a version of the cuplength result for quadratic Hamiltonians on cotangent bundles. The proof of the latter uses a generalization of Floer curves, for which the necessary Fredholm and compactness results will be proven.</description>

      <title>Walks in Rotation Spaces Return Home when Doubled and Scaled</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of numerous physical systems, such as spins and qubits, can be described as a series of rotation operations, i.e., walks in the manifold of the rotation group. A basic question with practical applications is how likely and under what conditions such walks return to the origin (the identity rotation), which means that the physical system returns to its initial state. In three dimensions, we show that almost every walk in SO(3) or SU(2), even a very complicated one, will preferentially return to the origin simply by traversing the walk twice in a row and uniformly scaling all rotation angles. We explain why traversing the walk only once almost never suffices to return, and comment on the problem in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Information geometry and entanglement under phase-space deformation through nonsymplectic congruence transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao (FR) information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. The geometry of a quantum state can be envisaged through the Riemannian manifold generated by the FR-metric corresponding to the quantum state. Interestingly, any congruence transformation $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ in phase-space leaves the FR-distance for Gaussian states invariant. In the present paper, we investigate whether this isometry affects the entanglement in the bipartite system. It turns out that, even a simple choice of a congruence transformation, induces the entanglement in a bipartite Gaussian system.
  To make our study relevant to physical systems, we choose Bopp's shift in phase-space as an example of $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$, so that the results can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative (NC) phase-space deformation. We explicitly provide a quantitative measure of the dependence of separability on NC parameters. General expressions for the metric structure are also provided.
  The crucial point in the present piece of study is the identification of the connection of phase-space deformation-induced entanglement through a general class of congruence transformation and the identification of a trade-off relationship between the initial correlations and deformation parameters.</description>

      <title>Expanded regimes of area law for lattice Yang-Mills theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the parameter regimes for which area law is proven for pure $\mathrm{U}(N)$ lattice Yang-Mills theories, in particular when $N$ is large. This improves on a classical result of Osterwalder-Seiler from 1978. To do so, we view the master loop equation as a linear inhomogeneous equation for Wilson string expectations, and then prove an a priori bound for solutions to the equation. The main novelty is in how we deal with the merger term in the master loop equation. This is done by introducing a truncated model for which the merger term is unproblematic, and then showing that the truncated model well approximates the original model.</description>

      <title>Super Macdonald polynomials and BPS state counting on the blow-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>On Nilpotent and Solvable Quasi-Einstein Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate nilpotent and unimodular solvable Lie groups that admit quasi-Einstein metrics $(M,g,X)$ with $X$ a left-invariant vector field, which we call totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metrics. We give a complete classification of nilpotent Lie groups admitting such metrics, proving that this occurs if and only if the group is Heisenberg. For unimodular solvable Lie groups $S$, we show that the existence of a non-flat totally left-invariant quasi-Einstein metric forces the center of $S$ to be one-dimensional. Furthermore, under the additional assumption that the adjoint action $\operatorname{ad}_a$ of $S$ is a normal derivation, we obtain a full classification: these groups are standard and their nilradical must be Heisenberg Lie algebra. As an application, we prove that the only near-horizon geometries on a nilmanifold are $\Gamma \backslash H_{n}$, where $ H_{n}$ is $n$-dimensional Heisenberg Lie group.</description>

      <title>Darboux's Theorem in $p$-adic symplectic geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. We derive an analog of Moser's Path Method for $p$-adic analytic manifolds and use it to prove a $p$-adic analog of Darboux's Theorem. Using it as a stepping stone we give a classification of second-countable $p$-adic analytic symplectic manifolds in terms of $p$-adic volume. This is a symplectic version of a classical result of Serre in $p$-adic analytic geometry from 1965. We also prove a $p$-adic version of Weinstein's generalization of Darboux's Theorem to neighborhoods of compact manifolds. Finally we find explicitly Darboux's coordinates for the physical models by Ablowitz-Ladik and Salerno of the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Do quantum linear solvers offer advantage for networks-based system of linear equations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this exploratory numerical study, we assess the suitability of Quantum Linear Solvers (QLSs) toward providing a quantum advantage for Networks-based Linear System Problems (NLSPs). NLSPs are of importance as they are naturally connected to real-world applications. In an NLSP, one starts with a graph and arrives at a system of linear equations. The advantage that one may obtain with a QLS for an NLSP is determined by the interplay between three variables: the scaling of condition number and sparsity functions of matrices associated with the graphs considered, as well as the function describing the system size growth. We recommend graph families that can offer potential for an exponential advantage (best graph families) and those that offer sub-exponential but at least polynomial advantage (better graph families), with the HHL algorithm considered relative to an efficient classical linear solver. Within the scope of our analyses, we observe that only 4% of the 50 considered graph families offer prospects for an exponential advantage, whereas about 20% of the considered graph families show a polynomial advantage. Furthermore, we observe and report some interesting cases where some graph families not only fare better with improved algorithms such as the Childs-Kothari-Somma algorithm but also graduate from offering no advantage to promising a polynomial advantage, graph families that exhibit futile exponential advantage, etc. Given the limited number of graph families that one can survey through numerical studies, we discuss an interesting case where we unify several graph families into one superfamily, and show the existence of infinite best and better graphs in it. Lastly, we very briefly touch upon some practical issues that one may face even if the aforementioned graph theoretic requirements are satisfied, including quantum hardware challenges.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition arXiv:1906.01053, arXiv:1907.09876 and the flat initial condition arXiv:1907.09876 for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions arXiv:2010.07357v1, arXiv:2504.19975 for the two-point distributions.
  In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key ingredient is a probabilistic representation, inspired by arXiv:1701.00018, of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in arXiv:1907.09876. Moreover, we also verify that the equal time version of our formula matches the path integral formula in arXiv:1701.00018 for the KPZ fixed point when the initial condition is of compact support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we observe that the dynamical approach to lattice Yang-Mills set forth in [SZZ23] may also be applied to prove Wilson's area law in the 't Hooft regime of parameters. The main point is to verify the mass gap condition from [DF80], from which area law directly follows. Our results apply for gauge groups $G \in \{\mathrm{U}(N), \mathrm{SU}(N), \mathrm{SO}(2N)\}$, which all have nontrivial center (which is one of the key assumptions in [DF80]).</description>

      <title>An Intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-Algebra on the Khovanov-Sano Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper reinterprets the symmetries of equivariant Khovanov homology, discovered by Khovanov and Sano, within the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism. We identify the Shumakovitch operator $\hat{\nu}$ as a BV Laplacian whose nilpotency, a consequence of the algebra's defining relations, induces an $L_{\infty}$-algebra on homology. We prove this structure is non-trivial through explicit computations of higher brackets. Furthermore, we construct a dual $L_{\infty}$-structure, suggesting a unifying homotopy $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ symmetry. The main result of this paper is to lift this structure from homology to the chain level. Applying the Homotopy Transfer Theorem, we construct an intrinsic $L_{\infty}$-algebra on the Khovanov-Sano complex, whose $\infty$-quasi-isomorphism class is a canonical link invariant. This provides a new algebraic framework in which we conjecture the origin of Steenrod operations in knot homology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>A basis-free, octonionic criterion for Weyl points in solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard ways of locating and characterizing Weyl points--Berry-flux integrals on small spheres and local $k\cdot p$ fits--are topologically sound but depend on user choices (sphere center/radius, gauge smoothing, surface charting, and Pauli-frame transport) that complicate high-throughput workflows. We introduce a local, basis-free criterion that avoids these knobs by using the octonionic geometry of $\operatorname{Im}\mathbb{O}\cong\mathbb{R}^7$. From a smooth two-band projector we build a unit octonion field $u(\mathbf{k})$ and its octonionic connection $\mathcal{A}_i=\operatorname{Im}(\bar u\,\partial_{k_i}u)$. Contracting the three directional derivatives with the $\mathrm{G}_2$-invariant three-form produces a pseudoscalar density whose sign gives the node's chirality. A companion quantity--the octonionic associator--vanishes at leading order precisely when the local three directions close inside an associative (quaternionic) three-plane; its smallness thus provides an intrinsic, pointwise self-consistency check that the two-band reduction is valid. The construction is invariant under $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge changes of the two-band subspace and under $\mathrm{G}_2$ rotations of its completion, and it eliminates enclosing surfaces and gauge seams. In the linear regime the density reduces to the oriented volume set by the velocity matrix, thereby agreeing with the Chern number on a small sphere and with the chirality obtained from a $k\cdot p$ linearization. We outline a practical stencil-based algorithm compatible with Wannier tight-binding Hamiltonians and demonstrate robustness to benign numerical choices, while providing an intrinsic warning signal near band entanglement or multi-fold touchings.</description>
