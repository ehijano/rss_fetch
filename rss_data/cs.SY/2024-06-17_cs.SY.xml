      <title>Validation of human benchmark models for Automated Driving System approval: How competent and careful are they really?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Automated Driving Systems (ADS) are expected to improve comfort, productivity and, most importantly, safety for all road users. To ensure that the systems are safe, rules and regulations describing the systems' approval and validation procedures are in effect in Europe. The UNECE Regulation 157 (R157) is one of those. Annex 3 of R157 describes two driver models, representing the performance of a "competent and careful" driver, which can be used as benchmarks to determine whether, in certain situations, a crash would be preventable by a human driver. However, these models have not been validated against human behavior in real safety-critical events. Therefore, this study uses counterfactual simulation to assess the performance of the two models when applied to 38 safety-critical cut-in near-crashes from the SHRP2 naturalistic driving study. The results show that the two computational models performed rather differently from the human drivers: one model showed a generally delayed braking reaction compared to the human drivers, causing crashes in three of the original near-crashes. The other model demonstrated, in general, brake onsets substantially earlier than the human drivers, possibly being overly sensitive to lateral perturbations. That is, the first model does not seem to behave as the competent and careful driver it is supposed to represent, while the second seems to be overly careful. Overall, our results show that, if models are to be included in regulations, they need to be substantially improved. We argue that achieving this will require better validation across the scenario types that the models are intended to cover (e.g., cut-in conflicts), a process which should include applying the models counterfactually to near-crashes and validating them against several different safety related metrics.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Control for Vehicle Repositioning in Autonomous Mobility on Demand Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Balancing passenger demand and vehicle availability is crucial for ensuring the sustainability and effectiveness of urban transportation systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel hierarchical strategy for the efficient distribution of empty vehicles in urban areas. The proposed approach employs a data-enabled predictive control algorithm to develop a high-level controller, which guides the inter-regional allocation of idle vehicles. This algorithm utilizes historical data on passenger demand and vehicle supply in each region to construct a non-parametric representation of the system, enabling it to determine the optimal number of vehicles to be repositioned or retained in their current regions without modeling the system. At the low level, a coverage control-based controller is designed to provide inter-regional position guidance, determining the desired road intersection each vehicle should target. With the objective of optimizing area coverage, it aligns the vehicle distribution with the demand across different districts within a single region. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through simulation experiments on the real road network of Shenzhen, China. The integration of the two layers provides better performance compared to applying either layer in isolation, demonstrating its potential to reduce passenger waiting time and answer more requests, thus promoting the development of more efficient and sustainable transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Strategy Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Unknown Nonlinear Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a data-driven framework for synthesis of provably-correct controllers for general nonlinear switched systems under complex specifications. The focus is on systems with unknown disturbances whose effects on the dynamics of the system is nonlinear. The specifications are assumed to be given as linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf) formulas. Starting from observations of either the disturbance or the state of the system, we first learn an ambiguity set that contains the unknown distribution of the disturbances with a user-defined confidence. Next, we construct a robust Markov decision process (RMDP) as a finite abstraction of the system. By composing the RMDP with the automaton obtained from the LTLf formula and performing optimal robust value iteration on the composed RMDP, we synthesize a strategy that yields a high probability that the uncertain system satisfies the specifications. Our empirical evaluations on systems with a wide variety of disturbances show that the strategies synthesized with our approach lead to high satisfaction probabilities and validate the theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Two-Step Blackout Mitigation by Flexibility-Enabled Microgrid Islanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blackouts are disastrous events with a low probability of occurrence but a high impact on the system and its users. With the help of more distributed and controllable generation and sector-coupled flexibility, microgrids could be prepared to operate in islanded mode during a blackout. This paper discusses a two-step blackout mitigation approach for highly renewable microgrids that utilizes user flexibility and energy storage systems for power balance in islanded grid operation. The proposed method includes a proactive flexibility reservation step, which derives a minimal reservation schedule for microgrid resources under uncertainty considering related operational costs. As a second step, during a blackout, a fully distributed control is implemented to maximize the usage of available resources based on a sequence of max and min-consensus rounds. This paper focuses on the second step, for which the effectiveness of blackstart and long-term coordination is shown. Load shedding can be reduced by 40\% compared to the forecast value. A hardware-in-the-loop simulation of a grid-forming converter further showed a fast convergence toward the optimal operation point.</description>

      <title>Some contributions to Lagrangian modelling of Power Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lagrangian modelling can be used to derive mathematical models for complex power electronic converters. This approach uses scalar quantities (kinetic and potential energy) to derive models, which is simpler than using (vector-based) force balance equations. It employs generalized coordinates, making it easier to deal with complex systems with constraints. This systematic approach results in equations that can be expressed in state-space form, which allows for the simplification of the simulation and design process and the use of many standard software packages for system analysis and simulation. In this work, contributions are made regarding the procedure to be followed for the Lagrangian modelling of power converters and the incorporation of constraints within the Lagrangian framework. Furthermore, for the first time, Lagrangian modelling is extended to non-ideal, high-fidelity descriptions of standard power electronic circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are useful in many applications, including transportation, healthcare, and speech recognition. Despite various efforts to improve accuracy, few works have studied DNN in the context of real-time requirements. Coarse resource allocation and sequential execution in existing frameworks result in underutilization. In this work, we conduct GPU speedup gain analysis and propose SGPRS, the first real-time GPU scheduler considering zero configuration partition switch. The proposed scheduler not only meets more deadlines for parallel tasks but also sustains overall performance beyond the pivot point.</description>

      <title>Measure This, Not That: Optimizing the Cost and Model-Based Information Content of Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-based design of experiments (MBDoE) is a powerful framework for selecting and calibrating science-based mathematical models from data. This work extends popular MBDoE workflows by proposing a convex mixed integer (non)linear programming (MINLP) problem to optimize the selection of measurements. The solver MindtPy is modified to support calculating the D-optimality objective and its gradient via an external package, \texttt{SciPy}, using the grey-box module in Pyomo. The new approach is demonstrated in two case studies: estimating highly correlated kinetics from a batch reactor and estimating transport parameters in a large-scale rotary packed bed for CO$_2$ capture. Both case studies show how examining the Pareto-optimal trade-offs between information content measured by A- and D-optimality versus measurement budget offers practical guidance for selecting measurements for scientific experiments.</description>

      <title>Temporal Planning via Interval Logic Satisfiability for Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many automated planning methods and formulations rely on suitably designed abstractions or simplifications of the constrained dynamics associated with agents to attain computational scalability. We consider formulations of temporal planning where intervals are associated with both action and fluent atoms, and relations between these are given as sentences in Allen's Interval Logic. We propose a notion of planning graphs that can account for complex concurrency relations between actions and fluents as a Constraint Programming (CP) model. We test an implementation of our algorithm on a state-of-the-art framework for CP and compare it with PDDL 2.1 planners that capture plans requiring complex concurrent interactions between agents. We demonstrate our algorithm outperforms existing PDDL 2.1 planners in the case studies. Still, scalability remains challenging when plans must comply with intricate concurrent interactions and the sequencing of actions.</description>

      <title>Think Deep and Fast: Learning Neural Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics from Inverse Dynamic Games for Split-Second Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-cooperative interactions commonly occur in multi-agent scenarios such as car racing, where an ego vehicle can choose to overtake the rival, or stay behind it until a safe overtaking "corridor" opens. While an expert human can do well at making such time-sensitive decisions, the development of safe and efficient game-theoretic trajectory planners capable of rapidly reasoning discrete options is yet to be fully addressed. The recently developed nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) show promise in enabling fast opinion formation and avoiding safety-critical deadlocks. However, it remains an open challenge to determine the model parameters of NOD automatically and adaptively, accounting for the ever-changing environment of interaction. In this work, we propose for the first time a learning-based, game-theoretic approach to synthesize a Neural NOD model from expert demonstrations, given as a dataset containing (possibly incomplete) state and action trajectories of interacting agents. The learned NOD can be used by existing dynamic game solvers to plan decisively while accounting for the predicted change of other agents' intents, thus enabling situational awareness in planning. We demonstrate Neural NOD's ability to make fast and robust decisions in a simulated autonomous racing example, leading to tangible improvements in safety and overtaking performance over state-of-the-art data-driven game-theoretic planning methods.</description>

Abstract: To explore oceans on ice-covered moons in the solar system, energy-efficient Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) with long ranges must cover enough distance to record and collect enough data. These usually underactuated vehicles are hard to control when performing tasks such as vertical docking or the inspection of vertical walls. This paper introduces a control strategy for DeepLeng to navigate in the ice-covered ocean of Jupiter's moon Europa and presents simulation results preceding a discussion on what is further needed for robust control during the mission.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Analysis of Simultaneous Double Q-learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $Q$-learning is one of the most fundamental reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Despite its widespread success in various applications, it is prone to overestimation bias in the $Q$-learning update. To address this issue, double $Q$-learning employs two independent $Q$-estimators which are randomly selected and updated during the learning process. This paper proposes a modified double $Q$-learning, called simultaneous double $Q$-learning (SDQ), with its finite-time analysis. SDQ eliminates the need for random selection between the two $Q$-estimators, and this modification allows us to analyze double $Q$-learning through the lens of a novel switching system framework facilitating efficient finite-time analysis. Empirical studies demonstrate that SDQ converges faster than double $Q$-learning while retaining the ability to mitigate the maximization bias. Finally, we derive a finite-time expected error bound for SDQ.</description>

      <title>Suppressing seizure via optimal electrical stimulation to the hub of epileptic brain network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrical stimulation to the seizure onset zone (SOZ) serves as an efficient approach to seizure suppression. Recently, seizure dynamics have gained widespread attendance in its network propagation mechanisms. Compared with the direct stimulation to SOZ, other brain network-level approaches that can effectively suppress epileptic seizures remain under-explored. In this study, we introduce a platform equipped with a system identification module and a control strategy module, to validate the effectiveness of the hub of the epileptic brain network in suppressing seizure. The identified surrogate dynamics show high predictive performance in reconstructing neural dynamics which enables the model predictive framework to achieve accurate neural stimulation. The electrical stimulation on the hub of the epileptic brain network shows remarkable performance as the direct stimulation of SOZ in suppressing seizure dynamics. Underpinned by network control theory, our platform offers a general tool for the validation of neural stimulation.</description>

      <title>Technical Report: A Totally Asynchronous Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient Method for Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a totally asynchronous algorithm for convex optimization that is based on a novel generalization of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method. This algorithm is developed for fast convergence under "total asynchrony," i.e., allowing arbitrarily long delays between agents' computations and communications without assuming any form of delay bound. These conditions may arise, for example, due to jamming by adversaries. Our framework is block-based, in the sense that each agent is only responsible for computing updates to (and communicating the values of) a small subset of the network-level decision variables. In our main result, we present bounds on the algorithm's parameters that guarantee linear convergence to an optimizer. Then, we quantify the relationship between (i) the total number of computations and communications executed by the agents and (ii) the agents' collective distance to an optimum. Numerical simulations show that this algorithm requires 28% fewer iterations than the heavy ball algorithm and 61% fewer iterations than gradient descent under total asynchrony.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedforward control can greatly improve the response time and control accuracy of any mechatronic system. However, in order to compensate for the effects of modeling errors or disturbances, it is imperative that this type of control works in conjunction with some form of feedback. In this paper, we present a new adaptive feedforward control scheme for electromechanical systems in which real-time measurements or estimates of the position and its derivatives are not technically or economically feasible. This is the case, for example, of commercial electromechanical switching devices such as solenoid actuators. Our proposal consists of two blocks: on the one hand, a feedforward controller based on differential flatness theory; on the other, an iterative adaptation law that exploits the repetitive operation of these devices to modify the controller parameters cycle by cycle. As shown, this law can be fed with any available measurement of the system, with the only requirement that it can be processed and converted into an indicator of the performance of any given operation. Simulated and experimental results show that our proposal is effective in dealing with a long-standing control problem in electromechanics: the soft-landing control of electromechanical switching devices.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking with Compressed and Event-triggered Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13994v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problems for networked games have been widely investigated in recent years. Despite the increasing attention, communication expenditure is becoming a major bottleneck for scaling up distributed approaches within limited communication bandwidth between agents. To reduce communication cost, an efficient distributed NE seeking (ETC-DNES) algorithm is proposed to obtain an NE for games over directed graphs, where the communication efficiency is improved by event-triggered exchanges of compressed information among neighbors. ETC-DNES saves communication costs in both transmitted bits and rounds of communication. Furthermore, our method only requires the row-stochastic property of the adjacency matrix, unlike previous approaches that hinged on doubly-stochastic communication matrices. We provide convergence guarantees for ETC-DNES on games with restricted strongly monotone mappings and testify its efficiency with no sacrifice on the accuracy. The algorithm and analysis are extended to a compressed algorithm with stochastic event-triggered mechanism (SETC-DNES). In SETC-DNES, we introduce a random variable in the triggering condition to further enhance algorithm efficiency. We demonstrate that SETC-DNES guarantees linear convergence to the NE while achieving even greater reductions in communication costs compared to ETC-DNES. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

Abstract: While neural networks (NNs) have potential as autonomous controllers for Cyber-Physical Systems, verifying the safety of NN based control systems (NNCSs) poses significant challenges for the practical use of NNs, especially when safety is needed for unbounded time horizons. One reason is the intractability of analyzing NNs, ODEs and hybrid systems. To this end, we introduce VerSAILLE (Verifiably Safe AI via Logically Linked Envelopes): The first general approach that allows reusing control theory results for NNCS verification. By joining forces, we exploit the efficiency of NN verification tools while retaining the rigor of differential dynamic logic (dL). Based on provably safe control envelopes in dL, we derive specifications for the NN which is proven via NN verification. We show that a proof of the NN adhering to the specification is mirrored by a dL proof on the infinite-time safety of the NNCS.
  The NN verification properties resulting from hybrid systems typically contain nonlinear arithmetic and arbitrary logical structures while efficient NN verification merely supports linear constraints. To overcome this divide, we present Mosaic: An efficient, sound and complete verification approach for polynomial real arithmetic properties on piece-wise linear NNs. Mosaic partitions complex verification queries into simple queries and lifts off-the-shelf linear constraint tools to the nonlinear setting in a completeness-preserving manner by combining approximation with exact reasoning for counterexample regions. Our evaluation demonstrates the versatility of VerSAILLE and Mosaic: We prove infinite-time safety on the classical Vertical Airborne Collision Avoidance NNCS verification benchmark for two scenarios while (exhaustively) enumerating counterexample regions in unsafe scenarios. We also show that our approach significantly outperforms State-of-the-Art tools in closed-loop NNV.</description>

      <title>Neural Operators for PDE Backstepping Control of First-Order Hyperbolic PIDE with Recycle and Delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recently introduced DeepONet operator-learning framework for PDE control is extended from the results for basic hyperbolic and parabolic PDEs to an advanced hyperbolic class that involves delays on both the state and the system output or input. The PDE backstepping design produces gain functions that are outputs of a nonlinear operator, mapping functions on a spatial domain into functions on a spatial domain, and where this gain-generating operator's inputs are the PDE's coefficients. The operator is approximated with a DeepONet neural network to a degree of accuracy that is provably arbitrarily tight. Once we produce this approximation-theoretic result in infinite dimension, with it we establish stability in closed loop under feedback that employs approximate gains. In addition to supplying such results under full-state feedback, we also develop DeepONet-approximated observers and output-feedback laws and prove their own stabilizing properties under neural operator approximations. With numerical simulations we illustrate the theoretical results and quantify the numerical effort savings, which are of two orders of magnitude, thanks to replacing the numerical PDE solving with the DeepONet.</description>

      <title>Seeing the Unseen: The REVEAL protocol to expose the wireless Man-in-the-Middle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Man-in-the-Middle (MiM) can collect over-the-air packets whether from a mobile or a base station, process them, possibly modify them, and forward them to the intended receiver. This paper exhibits the REVEAL protocol that can detect a MiM, whether it has half duplex capability, full duplex capability, or double full duplex capability. Protocol is based on synchronizing clocks between the mobile and the base station, with the MiM being detected if it interferes in the synchronization process. Once synchronized, the REVEAL protocol creates a sequence of challenge packets where the transmission times of the packets, their durations, and their frequencies, are chosen to create conflicts at the MiM, and make it impossible for the MiM to function. We implement the REVEAL protocol for detecting a MiM in 4G technology. We instantiate a MiM between the 4G/5G base station and a mobile, and exhibit the successful detection mechanisms. With the shared source code, our work can be reproduced using open software defined cellular networks with off-the-shelf devices</description>

      <title>Guarantees on Robot System Performance Using Stochastic Simulation Rollouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10874v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for control policies executed on stochastic robotic systems. Given an open- or closed-loop policy and a finite set of trajectory rollouts under the policy, we bound the expected value, value-at-risk, and conditional-value-at-risk of the trajectory cost, and the probability of failure in a sparse cost setting. The bounds hold, with user-specified probability, for any policy synthesis technique and can be seen as a post-design safety certification. Generating the bounds only requires sampling simulation rollouts, without assumptions on the distribution or complexity of the underlying stochastic system. We adapt these bounds to also give a constraint satisfaction test to verify safety of the robot system. We provide a thorough analysis of the bound sensitivity to sim-to-real distribution shifts and provide results for constructing robust bounds that can tolerate some specified amount of distribution shift. Furthermore, we extend our method to apply when selecting the best policy from a set of candidates, requiring a multi-hypothesis correction. We show the statistical validity of our bounds in the Ant, Half-cheetah, and Swimmer MuJoCo environments and demonstrate our constraint satisfaction test with the Ant. Finally, using the 20 degree-of-freedom MuJoCo Shadow Hand, we show the necessity of the multi-hypothesis correction.</description>

      <title>A Semi-Lagrangian Approach for Time and Energy Path Planning Optimization in Static Flow Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient path planning for autonomous mobile robots is a critical problem across numerous domains, where optimizing both time and energy consumption is paramount. This paper introduces a novel methodology that considers the dynamic influence of an environmental flow field and considers geometric constraints, including obstacles and forbidden zones, enriching the complexity of the planning problem. We formulate it as a multi-objective optimal control problem, propose a novel transformation called Harmonic Transformation, and apply a semi-Lagrangian scheme to solve it. The set of Pareto efficient solutions is obtained considering two distinct approaches: a deterministic method and an evolutionary-based one, both of which are designed to make use of the proposed Harmonic Transformation. Through an extensive analysis of these approaches, we demonstrate their efficacy in finding optimized paths.</description>

      <title>An excursion onto Schr\"odinger's bridges: Stochastic flows with spatio-temporal marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of the present work is to expand substantially the type of control and estimation problems that can be addressed following the paradigm of Schr\"odinger bridges, by incorporating termination (killing) of stochastic flows. Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</description>

      <title>Multi-AUV Kinematic Task Assignment based on Self-organizing Map Neural Network and Dubins Path Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07536v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To deal with the task assignment problem of multi-AUV systems under kinematic constraints, which means steering capability constraints for underactuated AUVs or other vehicles likely, an improved task assignment algorithm is proposed combining the Dubins Path algorithm with improved SOM neural network algorithm. At first, the aimed tasks are assigned to the AUVs by improved SOM neural network method based on workload balance and neighborhood function. When there exists kinematic constraints or obstacles which may cause failure of trajectory planning, task re-assignment will be implemented by change the weights of SOM neurals, until the AUVs can have paths to reach all the targets. Then, the Dubins paths are generated in several limited cases. AUV's yaw angle is limited, which result in new assignments to the targets. Computation flow is designed so that the algorithm in MATLAB and Python can realizes the path planning to multiple targets. Finally, simulation results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively accomplish the task assignment task for multi-AUV system.</description>
