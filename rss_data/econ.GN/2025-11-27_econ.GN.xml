      <title>Strategic bid response under automated market power mitigation in electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In auction markets that are prone to market power abuse, preventive mitigation of bid prices can be applied through automated mitigation procedures (AMP). Despite the widespread application of AMP in US electricity markets, there exists scarce evidence on how firms strategically react to such price-cap-and-penalty regulation: when the price cap rarely leads to penalty mitigation, it is difficult to distinguish whether AMP are an effective deterrent or simply too lax. We investigate their impact on the bids of generation firms, using 2019 data from the New York and New England electricity markets (NYISO, ISO-NE). We employ a regression discontinuity design, which exploits the fact that the price cap with penalty is only activated when a structural index (e.g., congestion, pivotality) exceeds a certain cutoff. By estimating the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE) of screening activation, we can causally identify successful deterrence of anti-competitive behavior. Around 30-40% of the analyzed bidders per market exhibit a significant strategic response - corresponding to a decrease in maximum bid prices of 4-10 $/MWh to avoid the penalty. However, there is significant heterogeneity between firms, and the regulatory impact on the overall market is not statistically detectable, suggesting lax mitigation thresholds. Using a merit-order simulation, we estimate the welfare impact of more stringent thresholds to lie between 350 and 980 thousand dollars of increased buyer surplus per mitigated hour, with the associated number of mitigated hours being below 33 hours/year. Our results motivate the empirical calibration of mitigation thresholds to improve the efficiency of AMP regulation.</description>

      <title>Does joint liability reduce cheating in contests with agency problems? Theory and experimental evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contest participants often have strong incentives to engage in cheating. Sanctions serve as a common deterrent against such conduct. Often, other agents on the contestant's team (e.g., a coach of an athlete) or a company (a manager of an R\&amp;D engineer) have a vested interest in outcomes and can influence the cheating decision. An agency problem arises when only the contestant faces the penalties for cheating. Our theoretical framework examines joint liability, i.e., shifting some responsibility from the contestant to the other agent, as a solution to this agency problem. Equilibrium analysis shows that extending liability reduces cheating if fines are harsh. Less intuitively, when fines are lenient, a shift in liability can lead to an increase in equilibrium cheating rates. Experimental tests confirm that joint liability is effective in reducing cheating if fines are high. However, the predicted detrimental effect of joint liability for low fines does not occur.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Optimal Control of Interacting Particle Systems in Hilbert Spaces and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal control of interacting particles governed by stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces is an open area of research. Such systems naturally arise in formulations where each particle is modeled by stochastic partial differential equations, path-dependent stochastic differential equations (such as stochastic delay differential equations or stochastic Volterra integral equations), or partially observed stochastic systems. The purpose of this manuscript is to build the foundations for a limiting theory as the number of particles tends to infinity. We prove the convergence of the value functions $u_n$ of finite particle systems to a function $\mathcal{V}$, {which} is the unique {$L$}-viscosity solution of the corresponding mean-field Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation {in the space of probability measures}, and we identify its lift with the value function $U$ of the so-called ``lifted'' limit optimal control problem. Under suitable additional assumptions, we show $C^{1,1}$-regularity of $U$, we prove that $\mathcal{V}$ projects precisely onto the value functions $u_n$, and that optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the particle system correspond to optimal (resp. optimal feedback) controls of the lifted control problem started at the corresponding initial condition. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results of this kind for stochastic optimal control problems for interacting particle systems of stochastic evolution equations in Hilbert spaces. We apply the developed theory to problems arising in economics where the particles are modeled by stochastic delay differential equations and stochastic partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Will Remote Work Drive a New Wave of Suburbanisation in Poland? Analysing the Relocation Preferences of Polish Office Employees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study assesses how the growing availability of working from home (WFH) shapes office employees' preferences to move to the suburbs and pinpoints the socio-economic factors that drive those intentions. We focus on Poland, where the housing market is shaped by exceptionally high home-ownership rates and specific suburbanisation patterns. We surveyed city-dwelling office employees (living in municipalities of 100,000 or more) to gauge their willingness to relocate. Logistic-regression estimates then linked those intentions to respondents' demographics, job attributes, commuting patterns, and self-reported productivity shifts under WFH. The study tests three mechanisms. Commuting cost is proxied by travel mode and one-way time; life-course triggers by age, children, and tenure; and job-demands/resources by self-rated productivity under WFH. Sector and city size serve as contextual controls. Linking variables to theory in this way clarifies how the forthcoming results adjudicate among competing explanations. The results indicate that age, commuting mode, self-assessed productivity changes, and employment sector (private versus public) markedly influence the likelihood of considering a move to the suburbs in response to remote-work options. Contrary to expectations, household size, measured by number of children, does not play a significant role. Overall, the evidence suggests that remote work, especially in hybrid form, could become an additional catalyst for suburban expansion in markets characterised by scarce affordable rentals and a strong preference for home ownership, such as Poland.</description>

      <title>"Rich-Get-Richer"? Platform Attention and Earnings Inequality using Patreon Earnings Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using monthly Patreon earnings, we quantify how platform attention algorithms shape earnings concentration across creator economies. Patreon is a tool for creators to monetize additional content from loyal subscribers but offers little native distribution, so its earnings proxy well for the attention creators capture on external platforms (Instagram, Twitch, YouTube, Twitter/X, Facebook, and ``Patreon-only''). Fitting power-law tails to test for a highly unequal earnings distribution, we have three key findings. First, across years and platforms the earnings tail and distribution exhibits a Pareto exponent around $\alpha \approx 2$, closer to concentrated capital income than to labor income and consistent with a compounding, ``rich-get-richer'' dynamic (Barabasi and Albert 1999). Second, when algorithms tilt more attention toward the top, the gains are drawn disproportionately from the creator ``middle class''. Third, over time, creator inequality across social media platforms converge toward similarly heavy-tailed (and increasingly concentrated) distributions, plausibly as algorithmic recommendations rises in importance relative to user-filtered content via the social graph. While our Patreon-sourced data represents a small subset of total creator earnings on these platforms, it provides unique insight into the cross-platform algorithmic effects on earnings concentration.</description>

      <title>U.S. Economy and Global Stock Markets: Insights from a Distributional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial markets are interconnected, with micro-currents propagating across global markets and shaping economic trends. This paper moves beyond traditional stock market indices to examine cross-sectional return distributions-15 in our empirical application, each representing a distinct global market. To facilitate this analysis, we develop a matrix functional VAR method with interpretable factors extracted from cross-sectional return distributions. Our approach extends the existing framework from modeling a single function to multiple functions, allowing for a richer representation of cross-sectional dependencies. By jointly modeling these distributions with U.S. macroeconomic indicators, we uncover the predictive power of financial market in forecasting macro-economic dynamics. Our findings reveal that U.S. contractionary monetary policy not only lowers global stock returns, as traditionally understood, but also dampens cross-sectional return kurtosis, highlighting an overlooked policy transmission. This framework enables conditional forecasting, equipping policymakers with a flexible tool to assess macro-financial linkages under different economic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Narratives to Numbers: Large Language Models and Economic Policy Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates large language models as estimable classifiers and clarifies how modeling choices shape downstream measurement error. Revisiting the Economic Policy Uncertainty index, we show that contemporary classifiers substantially outperform dictionary rules, better track human audit assessments, and extend naturally to noisy historical and multilingual news. We use these tools to construct a new nineteenth-century U.S. index from more than 360 million newspaper articles and exploratory cross-country indices with a single multilingual model. Taken together, our results show that LLMs can systematically improve text-derived measures and should be integrated as explicit measurement tools in empirical economics.</description>
