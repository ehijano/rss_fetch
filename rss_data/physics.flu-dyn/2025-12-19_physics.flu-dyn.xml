      <title>Analytical Solutions for Turbulent Channel Flow Using Alexeev and Navier-Stokes Hydrodynamic Equations: Comparison with Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding turbulent boundary layer flows is important for many application areas. Enhanced theoretical models may provide deeper insights into the fundamental mechanisms of turbulence that elude current models; therefore, the search for improved kinetic equations and their respective hydrodynamic equations continues. In this work, we consider the Generalized Boltzmann Equation (GBE), proposed by Alexeev (1994). The GBE accounts for finite particle size and the variation of the distribution function over timescales of the order of the collision time. The Alexeev hydrodynamic equations are derived from the GBE.
  In this work, the Alexeev hydrodynamic equations (AHE) and Navier-Stokes (NS) equations are solved analytically for turbulent channel flow under the assumption that stationary solutions yield the mean flow velocity. The analytical solutions of the AHE are validated by numerical solutions and compared with the NS solutions and experimental data for turbulent channel flow from multiple sources, spanning Reynolds numbers from 3,000 to 35,000,000. Solutions of the AHE demonstrate significantly better agreement with experimental data than those obtained from the NS equations. The analytical solution revealed a new similarity parameter: the boundary layer thickness scale, which coincides with the Kolmogorov microscale observed in experiments. The mechanisms for turbulence generation and control are discussed.</description>

      <title>Wake transitions and melting dynamics of a translating sphere in warm liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the three-dimensional melting dynamics of an initially spherical particle translating in a warmer liquid using sharp-interface simulations that fully resolve both solid and fluid phases with the Stefan condition. A wide parameter space is explored, spanning initial Reynolds number ($Re_0$), Stefan number ($St$), and Richardson number ($Ri$). In the absence of buoyancy ($Ri= 0$), the interface evolution is governed by canonical wake bifurcations. Four regimes are identified: an axi-symmetric regime ($Re_0&lt;212$) with a rounded front and planar rear; a steady-planar-symmetric regime ($212&lt;Re_0&lt;273$) with an inclined rear plane; a periodic-planar-symmetric regime ($273&lt;Re_0&lt;355$) where vortex shedding emerges in the wake; and a chaotic regime ($Re_0&gt;355$) with fluctuating stagnation points and a more rounded rear. Despite these differences, all regimes exhibit a tendency toward melt-rate homogenisation over time. Besides, we introduce an aspect-ratio-based surface-area formulation that yields a predictive model, accurately capturing volume evolution across regimes. Hydrodynamic loads also reflect the coupling between shape and flow: drag follows rigid-sphere correlations only at moderate $Re_0$; planar rears enhance drag at higher $Re_0$; lift appears only in symmetry-broken regimes and reverses late in time; torque reorients the rear plane toward vertical, consistent with free-body experiments. When buoyancy is included, assisting configurations ($Ri&gt;0$) suppress recirculation and maintain quasi-spherical shapes, whereas opposing or transverse buoyancy ($Ri&lt;0$) destabilises wakes and promotes tilted planar rears. These results provide a unified framework for convection-driven melting across laminar, periodic, and chaotic wakes, with implications for geophysical and industrial processes.</description>

      <title>Intermittent Motility of a Synthetic Active Particle in Changing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the dynamics of synthetic active particles composed of gravitationally bouncing, superwalking droplets confined within an annular fluid bath. Driven by a topologically pumping dual-frequency waveform, the droplets exhibit alternating active (walking) and dormant (bouncing) phases, producing intermittent azimuthal motion. Tracking individual droplets reveals pseudolaminar chaotic dynamics in the time series of particle's angular position, characterized by laminar plateaus that are interrupted by short irregular bursts of activity. Increasing the driving amplitude induces a qualitative change in the active particle's intermittent dynamics, arising from a symmetry-breaking transition in its Faraday-wave field environment: continuous SO(2)-symmetric "channelling" waves give way to discrete "trapping" patterns. These findings demonstrate how environmental symmetry and spatiotemporal structure modulate motility and intermittency in synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>A unified MRT-LB framework for Navier-Stokes and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations and beyond: moment equations, auxiliary moments, multispeed lattices, and Hermite matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified multi-relaxation-time lattice Boltzmann (MRT-LB) framework based on discrete Hermite polynomials (Hermite matrices) for the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs) and nonlinear convection-diffusion equations (NCDEs), using multispeed rectangular lattice (rD$d$Q$b$) models. For NSEs, the proposed MRT-LB model simulates incompressible and compressible isothermal flows in both single-phase and multiphase systems. Macroscopic moment equations are derived from the MRT-LB model via the direct Taylor expansion method. By selecting appropriate fundamental moments, the target NSEs and NCDE are recovered from these moment equations. Critically, the elimination of spurious terms and/or the recovery of the desired terms relies on specific auxiliary moments: the second-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{2G}$) of the source term distribution function (SDF) and the third-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{30}$) of the equilibrium distribution function (EDF) for NSEs, as well as the first-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{1G}$) of the SDF and the second-order auxiliary moment ($\mathbf{M}_{20}$) of the EDF for NCDE. Furthermore, using the weighted orthogonality of Hermite matrices, we establish essential relations for weight coefficients and construct several multispeed rectangular lattice models, including rD2Q25 and rD3Q53, with subgroup models rD2Q21, rD2Q17, rD2Q13, rD3Q45, and rD3Q33. A generalized third-order equilibrium distribution function is derived. We emphasize that for rectangular lattices, specific elements of the Hermite matrix corresponding to third-order discrete Hermite polynomials require correction to satisfy weighted orthogonality.</description>

      <title>Can Transformers overcome the lack of data in the simulation of history-dependent flows?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the lack of information about certain variables necessary for the description of a dynamical system leads to the introduction of historical dependence (lack of Markovian character of the model) and noise. Traditionally, scientists have made up for these shortcomings by designing phenomenological variables that take into account this historical dependence (typically, conformational tensors in fluids). Often, these phenomenological variables are not easily measurable experimentally. In this work, we study to what extent Transformer architectures are able to cope with the lack of experimental data on these variables. The methodology is evaluated on three benchmark problems: a cylinder flow with no history dependence, a viscoelastic Couette flow modeled via the Oldroyd-B formalism, and a non-linear polymeric fluid described by the FENE model. Our results show that the Transformer outperforms a thermodynamically consistent, structure-preserving neural network with metriplectic bias in systems with missing experimental data, providing lower errors even in low-dimensional latent spaces. In contrast, for systems whose state variables can be fully known, the metriplectic model achieves superior performance.</description>

      <title>Survey of Mathematical Models of and Numerical Methods for Fluid Dynamics Water Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become a cornerstone of modern water engineering, providing quantitative tools for the analysis, prediction, and management of complex hydraulic systems across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. This survey reviews the mathematical models and numerical methods that underpin CFD applications in water engineering, from depth-averaged formulations such as the shallow water equations to fully three-dimensional Navier-Stokes models, as well as selected alternative modeling approaches. We examine the historical development of these models, their mathematical structure, and the numerical discretization and solution strategies commonly employed in practice, including finite difference, finite volume, and finite element methods. Beyond core solver technology, the survey addresses practical modeling issues such as source-term treatment, wetting and drying, turbulence modeling, free-surface representation, and computational efficiency. The growing role of data integration is also discussed, encompassing data assimilation, uncertainty quantification, and emerging machine-learning-assisted approaches that complement physics-based solvers. To illustrate the impact of modeling and numerical choices on real-world applications, representative case studies from large-scale water management systems are reviewed. By integrating theory, numerical techniques, and applied perspectives, this survey provides a unified reference for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand both the foundational principles and contemporary challenges of CFD in water engineering.</description>

      <title>Marangoni instabilities of cylindrical drops in a vertical Hele-Shaw cell immersed in stratified liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Marangoni instability of cylindrical drops in vertical Hele-Shaw cells immersed in stably stratified liquids has been studied previously, yet the underlying mechanism has not been explored thoroughly. Here we study the onset of the Marangoni instability of such a system by experimentally explore the parameter space of the drop radius and concentration gradient. The concentration field is directly observed with laser interferometry. The flow is found to become unstable when advection is too strong for diffusion to maintain a stable concentration field. However, two different instability regimes are found depending on the drop radius. When the drop is small, the friction force caused by the two plates of the Hele-Shaw cell is small so that it does not change much the velocity field. Marangoni advection in such a regime can be very strong so that the entire periphery of the drop can become unstable. When the drop is large, the friction becomes so large that the Marangoni velocity plateaus and the boundary layer thickness is also reduced. The modified velocity and concentration fields lead to another instability regime, where only liquid close to the equator of the drop becomes unstable. A unifying scaling theory that includes both instability regimes is developed, which agrees well with the experimental results. Our findings may shed new light on the understandings of Marangoni flows in confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-B\'enard thermal convection in emulsions: a short review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermally driven emulsions arise in a broad range of natural and industrial contexts, yet their fundamental physical understanding remains only partially established. Emulsions exhibit a complex, concentration-dependent rheology, ranging from Newtonian (dilute emulsions) to yield-stress (concentrated emulsions). In buoyancy-driven flows, the complex structure and rheology of the emulsion are strongly coupled to convective flows, giving rise to fascinating and non-trivial phenomena involving stability, transient dynamics, and morphological evolution of the system. We review recent progress on thermally driven emulsions in the celebrated Rayleigh-B\'enard configuration, offering new perspectives on the behaviour of soft materials in thermal convection.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Framework for Thrombosis Risk Prediction in Rotary Blood Pumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Brownian Motion on a Chaotic Fluid Interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion is the erratic motion of an object due to collisions with the fluid in which it is immersed. In this work, we detail a tabletop laboratory demonstration of underdamped Brownian motion wherein a macroscopic particle resting on a driven fluid interface exhibits ballistic motion at short times and diffusive motion at long times. We observe the trajectory of a millimetric disk driven by a field of chaotic Faraday waves excited by a shaker. The crossover from ballistic to diffusive motion occurs at time and length scales experimentally accessible through particle tracking of a video recorded with a standard phone camera. Along with representative data, we provide a complete assembly guide, and operating procedure for students so that the experiment can be readily applied in the classroom. The tabletop setup can also be adapted for other student projects and active research topics relating to particle motion on a vibrating fluid interface.</description>

      <title>Direct calculation of steady-state hydrodynamic solar wind solutions with newtonian viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Steady-state solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations are known to admit solutions that are singular at the sonic point. Consequently, inviscid solar wind models require special treatment of the solution near the sonic points, and this has proven to be a significant impediment to efficient modeling of the solar wind. In this paper we revisit the governing hydrodynamic equations for the expanding solar wind, with the inclusion of the classical (Newtonian) viscous stress , and we show how this inclusion eliminates the singularities that emerge from the inviscid equations. This result has been previously reported and used to generate solar wind profiles from initial conditions in the asymptotic limit; however, those studies did not include realistic treatments of the inner corona, and generally rejected the prospect of extrapolating solutions outward from the Sun into the heliosphere. Here, we expand this method to include external heating and optically thin radiative losses and show that solutions can be computed from initial conditions near the solar surface, thereby capturing the entire range of scales from below the transition region to the outer heliosphere in a single solution. Our approach is to cast the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations as a system of five coupled, ordinary differential equations (ODEs), which we solve using conventional methods, without any special treatment of the governing equations in the vicinity of the sonic point. The representative solutions that we present here demonstrate the utility and efficiency of this extrapolation method, which is considerably more realistic than commonly used analytical or empirical models. This method provides a direct approach to generating accurate solar wind profiles subject to observationally motivated initial conditions near the solar surface, at a fraction of the computational cost of comparable relaxation-based models.</description>

      <title>Explosive dispersal of non-motile microbes through metabolic buoyancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For non-motile microorganisms, spatial expansion in quiescent fluids is presumed to be limited by diffusion. We report that microbial colonies can explosively circumvent this constraint through a self-amplifying physical process. As non-motile yeast and bacteria metabolize dense nutrients into lighter waste within their fluid environment, they generate buoyancy-driven Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, an ubiquitous fluid-dynamical phenomenon that organizes material on scales from chemical reactors to planetary atmospheres. This robust, self-generated flow fragments and disperses cellular aggregates, which seed new growth sites, enhancing total metabolic activity and further strengthening the convective flow in an autocatalytic cycle. The resulting expansion follows accelerating power-law kinetics, quantitatively captured by a physical theory linking metabolic flux to flow velocity, and produces fractal patterns through a flow-focusing instability we term Circulation-Driven Aggregation, the hydrodynamic analogue of Diffusion-Limited Aggregation. This `metabolic fireworks' mechanism establishes a canonical instance of proliferating active matter, where cellular metabolic activity self-organizes a physical transport engine--a living Rayleigh-B\'enard convection--providing a fundamental, physics-based dispersal strategy.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with non-linear barotropic Israel-Stewart fluid with causal relaxation time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive an extended expression for the relaxation time of a barotropic Israel-Stewart (IS) fluid using the non-linear causality constraint, and propose a new formulation for modeling causal viscous dissipation in barotropic fluids. With this generalized relaxation time, the non-linear IS equation simplifies to a first-order non-linear expression connecting bulk viscous pressure and energy density, which remains valid in any homogeneous and isotropic spacetime. In the case of spatially flat Friedmann universe, adopting this extended relation in the generalized non-linear IS theory, provides new class of analytical solutions in both, the linear, and the non-linear regimes. We also find that, the resulting effective equation of state in the linear regime naturally reproduces the generalized polytropic form which is often introduced phenomenologically in literature. Resulting dynamical implications are investigated and the constraints necessary for ensuring an acceptable evolutionary behavior for the fluid are determined. A detailed dynamical system analysis of the coupled Einstein-Israel-Stewart (EIS) system is also performed. Finally, we solve the coupled EIS equations numerically, and show that the model can support a transient Hubble slow-roll expansion phase with a smooth exit to a radiation-dominated universe, which is challenging to obtain in standard inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Angular dependence of third-order law in anisotropic MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In solar wind turbulence, the energy transfer/dissipation rate is typically estimated using MHD third-order structure functions calculated using spacecraft observations. However, the inherent anisotropy of solar wind turbulence leads to significant variations in structure functions along different observational directions, thereby affecting the accuracy of energy-dissipation rate estimation. An unresolved issue is how to optimise the selection of observation angles under limited directional sampling to improve estimation precision. We conduct a series of MHD turbulence simulations with different mean magnetic field strengths, $ B_0 $. Our analysis of the third-order structure functions reveals that the global energy dissipation rate estimated around a polar angle of $ \theta = 60^\circ$ agrees reasonably with the exact one for $ 0 \le B_0/b_{rms} \le 5 $, where $b_{rms}$ denotes the root-mean-square magnetic field fluctuation. The speciality of $60^\circ$ polar angle can be understood by the Mean Value Theorem of Integrals, since the spherical integral of the polar-angle component ($\widetilde{T_\theta}$) of the divergence of Yaglom flux is zero, and $\widetilde{T_\theta}$ changes sign around 60$^\circ$. Existing theory on the energy flux vector as a function of the polar angle is assessed, and supports the speciality of $60^\circ$ polar angle. The angular dependence of the third-order structure functions is further assessed with virtual spacecraft data analysis. The present results can be applied to measure the turbulent dissipation rates of energy in the solar wind, which are of potential importance to other areas in which turbulence takes place, such as laboratory plasmas and astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Effect of inertial lift on a spherical particle suspended in flow through a curved duct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06848</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.06848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a model of the forces on a spherical particle suspended in flow through a curved duct under the assumption that the particle Reynolds number is small. This extends an asymptotic model of inertial lift force previously developed to study inertial migration in straight ducts. Of particular interest is the existence and location of stable equilibria within the cross-sectional plane towards which particles migrates. The Navier-Stokes equations determine the hydrodynamic forces acting on a particle. A leading order model of the forces within the cross-sectional plane is obtained through the use of a rotating coordinate system and a perturbation expansion in the particle Reynolds number of the disturbance flow. We predict the behaviour of neutrally buoyant particles at low flow rates and examine the variation in focusing position with respect to particle size and bend radius, independent of the flow rate. In this regime, the lateral focusing position of particles approximately collapses with respect to a dimensionless parameter dependent on three length scales, specifically the particle radius, duct height, and duct bend radius. Additionally, a trapezoidal shaped cross-section is considered in order to demonstrate how changes in the cross-section design influence the dynamics of particles.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional numerical study on hydrogen bubble growth at electrode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15582v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three-dimensional direct numerical simulation of electrolysis is applied to investigate the growth and detachment of bubbles at electrodes.
  The moving gas-liquid interface is modeled employing the VOF-based method. To ensure the accuracy of the simulations,
  a mesh-independence study has been performed.
  The simulations include the growth phase of the bubbles, followed by their detachment from the electrode surface,
  and the results are validated with analytical models and experimental data.
  The bubble growth is diffusion-controlled, leading to the scaling \(R\propto t^{1/2}\), but our simulation overpredicts the growth exponent during the initial stage.
  We further demonstrate that the number of nucleation sites significantly affects gas transport, as quantified by the Sherwood number.
  The influences of contact angle and nucleation site on bubble detachment are also examined.
  The predicted detachment radius varies linearly with contact angle, consistent with Fritz's linear relation
  between the volume-equivalent radius and contact angle, confirming that the surface tension is the dominant attachment force.
  Finally, as the nucleation sites increase, the induced bubble coalescence accelerates the bubble detachment. Taken together,
  these findings give us valuable insights into improving gas bubble removal and enhancing overall electrolysis efficiency.</description>

      <title>Decay of two-dimensional superfluid turbulence over pinning surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the free decay of quasi-two-dimensional turbulence in superfluid $^4$He confined within nanofluidic channels. Using a pump-probe technique, we observe a complex decay of the vortex density $L(t)$ that deviates from a simple power law. The decay exhibits a universal fast transient, scaling as $L\propto t^{-2}$, followed by a slower non-universal regime that depends on the geometry and flow conditions. We demonstrate that this behavior is governed by the interplay between vortex pinning on the disordered topography of the channel walls and the mobilizing effect of the weak probe flow. A numerical model that treats pinning as a velocity-dependent effective mutual friction successfully reproduces the essential features of our experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Augmentation of a Turbulence Model in Three-dimensional Separated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic turbulence models often struggle to accurately predict complex flows. Although data-driven techniques have addressed these shortcomings, most existing research has concentrated on two-dimensional (2D) cases. This study bridges this gap by enhancing a data-driven turbulence model, the SST-CND (shear stress transport-conditioned) model, which was originally trained on 2D separated flows, in 3D scenarios. An additional correction term, \b{eta}_3D, is introduced to account for 3D effects. The distribution of this term is determined through a 3D field inversion process using high-fidelity data obtained from the flow around a cube. An algebraic expression for \b{eta}_3D is then derived through symbolic regression and formulated to degrade to zero in 2D cases. The performance of the resulting SST-CND3D model is evaluated across a range of flows. In 2D flows, the SST-CND3D model performs identically to its 2D-trained predecessor. However, the model exhibits superior performance in 3D flows, such as the flow around the complex JAXA standard model high-lift configuration. These findings indicate that a sequential approach, constructing a 3D correction term that vanishes in 2D on top of a 2D-trained model, constitutes a promising method for developing data-driven turbulence models that perform accurately in 3D while preserving their effectiveness in 2D.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for Simulating Polymer Solutions/Melts Behavior under Complex Flows using DPD-SPH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian Heterogeneous Multiscale Method (LHMM) for simulating the non-Newtonian rheology of polymer melts in complex two-dimensional flows. The method couples Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) at the microscale with a GENERIC-compliant Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) at the macroscale, in a concurrent framework, overcoming the limitations of traditional Eulerian-based methods in capturing long-memory and history-dependent effects. At the microscale, DPD serves as a virtual rheometer, employing FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) bead-spring polymer chains. This approach provides key rheological properties, including shear-thinning and zero-shear-rate viscosities, relaxation times, and viscoelastic dynamics, which are quantified via Carreau-Yasuda fitting and spectral analysis. The LHMM couples SPH-derived strain rates with microscopic stress responses using the Irving-Kirkwood formalism. This approach enables a concurrent interaction between macroscopic strain rates and microscopic stress tensors, ensuring a consistent viscoelastic response across scales. The method is validated against benchmark flows, including Reverse Poiseuille Flow and flow through a Periodic Array of Cylinders, across Weissenberg numbers $0.5 &lt; \text{Wi} &lt; 30$ and low Reynolds numbers ($\text{Re} &lt; 1$). A final demonstration of flow in a 2D porous medium highlights LHMM's capability to handle highly heterogeneous geometries. The LHMM is implemented in LAMMPS, making it suitable for integrating multiple models to describe microscales. In contrast, large-scale simulations efficiently utilize GPU and CPU resources, managing multiple coupling and time-scaling levels to maintain numerical stability and accuracy. The framework offers a predictive, constitutive-free tool that links microscopic polymer dynamics to macroscopic flow behavior, making it suitable for multiscale applications.</description>

      <title>A new data-driven energy-stable Evolve-Filter-Relax model for turbulent flow simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to define the filter and relax steps in the evolve-filter-relax (EFR) framework for simulating turbulent flows. The EFR main advantages are its ease of implementation and computational efficiency. However, as it only contains two parameters (one for the filter step and one for the relax step) its flexibility is rather limited. In this work, we propose a data-driven approach in which the optimal filter is found based on DNS data in the frequency domain. The optimization step is computationally efficient and only involves one-dimensional least-squares problems for each wavenumber. Across both decaying turbulence and Kolmogorov flow, our learned filter decisively outperforms the standard differential filter and the Smagorinsky model, yielding significantly improved accuracy in energy spectra and in the temporal evolution of both energy and enstrophy. In addition, the relax parameter is determined by requiring energy and/or enstrophy conservation, which enforces stability of the method and reduces the appearance of numerical wiggles, especially when the filter is built in scarce data regimes. Applying the learned filter is also more computationally efficient compared to traditional differential filters, as it circumvents solving a linear system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop and implement numerically a phase field model for the growth and detachment of a gas bubble resting on an electrode and being filled with hydrogen produced by water electrolysis. The bubble is surrounded by a viscous liquid, has a prescribed static contact angle and is also subject to gravitational forces. We compute, as a function of the static contact angle, the time at which the bubble detaches from the substrate and what volume it has at that time. We also investigate de dependence of the detachment time on other parameters such as the applied voltage and the hydrogen ion concentration at the fluid bulk.</description>

      <title>Multiphase transport and compositional mixing mechanisms in twin-wire laser directed energy deposition: toward process stability and graded material fabrication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twin-wire laser directed energy deposition (TW-LDED) provides a promising route for alloying and fabrication of compositionally graded structures. However, inherent multiparameter coupling in twin-wire systems critically exacerbates both process instabilities and compositional inhomogeneity. This unresolved issue escalates into a fundamental technological bottleneck, as the underlying physical mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study developed a high-fidelity multi-physics and multiphase simulation framework coupled with experimental validation to reveal thermal-fluid behavior and heat-mass transfer mechanisms in TW-LDED using Inconel 718 and SS316L fine wires. Three distinct transition modes were identified: twin-wire melt droplet, twin-wire liquid bridge, and droplet-bridge mixed transitions, with the twin-wire liquid bridge regime delivering optimal stability and uniform mixing. Parametric analysis demonstrates that increasing wire feeding speed or decreasing wire initial height promotes stable liquid bridge formation, while small laser spots at low feeding speeds induce excessive volumetric energy density and bridge instability. Simulation and single-track experiments confirm that liquid bridge transitions reduce dimensional fluctuations by 85% while enhancing compositional homogeneity. Conversely, the melt droplet-bridge transition mode creates periodic flow switching and compositional discontinuities along the scan direction. Finally, a 60 mm functionally graded ring was successfully fabricated using optimized parameters, achieving uniform elemental distribution in the transition zone without significant segregation, validating the feasibility of TW-LDED for functionally graded components.</description>
