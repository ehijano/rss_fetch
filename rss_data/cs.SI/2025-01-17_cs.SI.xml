      <title>Intelligent Anti-Money Laundering Solution Based upon Novel Community Detection in Massive Transaction Networks on Spark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criminals are using every means available to launder the profits from their illegal activities into ostensibly legitimate assets. Meanwhile, most commercial anti-money laundering systems are still rule-based, which cannot adapt to the ever-changing tricks. Although some machine learning methods have been proposed, they are mainly focused on the perspective of abnormal behavior for single accounts. Considering money laundering activities are often involved in gang criminals, these methods are still not intelligent enough to crack down on criminal gangs all-sidedly. In this paper, a systematic solution is presented to find suspicious money laundering gangs. A temporal-directed Louvain algorithm has been proposed to detect communities according to relevant anti-money laundering patterns. All processes are implemented and optimized on Spark platform. This solution can greatly improve the efficiency of anti-money laundering work for financial regulation agencies.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Behavioral Differences in Bilingual Information Operations: A Network-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twitter has become a pivotal platform for conducting information operations (IOs), particularly during high-stakes political events. In this study, we analyze over a million tweets about the 2024 U.S. presidential election to explore an under-studied area: the behavioral differences of IO drivers from English- and Spanish-speaking communities. Using similarity graphs constructed from behavioral patterns, we identify IO drivers in both languages and evaluate the clustering quality of these graphs in an unsupervised setting. Our analysis demonstrates how different network dismantling strategies, such as node pruning and edge filtering, can impact clustering quality and the identification of coordinated IO drivers. We also reveal significant differences in the topics and political indicators between English and Spanish IO drivers. Additionally, we investigate bilingual users who post in both languages, systematically uncovering their distinct roles and behaviors compared to monolingual users. These findings underscore the importance of robust, culturally and linguistically adaptable IO detection methods to mitigate the risks of influence campaigns on social media. Our code and data are available on GitHub: https://github.com/bowenyi-pierre/humans-lab-hackathon-24.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Traffic Autonomous Zone (TAZ) for Telecommunication Operations from Spatial Heterogeneity in Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of telecommunications, various operations are driven by different physical quantities. Each has its own patterns in time and space, but all show some clustered structures in their spatial distribution. This reflects a unified rule of human mobility, suggesting the consistency among different telecommunication regionalization objectives. With this in mind, regionalization can be used to identify these patterns and can be applied to improve management efficiency in the context of "autonomous networks". This article introduces the "Traffic Autonomous Zone (TAZ)" concept. This approach aims to create a reasonable unified regionalization scheme by identifying spatial clusters. It is not just a practical way to partition cities based on telecommunications needs, but it also captures self-organization structure of cities in essence. We present examples of this regionalization method using real data. Compared to the popular Louvain community detection method, our approach is on the Pareto frontier, allowing for a balance among various metrics in telecommunications.</description>

      <title>DomainDemo: a dataset of domain-sharing activities among different demographic groups on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media play a pivotal role in disseminating web content, particularly during elections, yet our understanding of the association between demographic factors and political discourse online remains limited. Here, we introduce a unique dataset, DomainDemo, linking domains shared on Twitter (X) with the demographic characteristics of associated users, including age, gender, race, political affiliation, and geolocation, from 2011 to 2022. This new resource was derived from a panel of over 1.5 million Twitter users matched against their U.S. voter registration records, facilitating a better understanding of a decade of information flows on one of the most prominent social media platforms and trends in political and public discourse among registered U.S. voters from different sociodemographic groups. By aggregating user demographic information onto the domains, we derive five metrics that provide critical insights into over 129,000 websites. In particular, the localness and partisan audience metrics quantify the domains' geographical reach and ideological orientation, respectively. These metrics show substantial agreement with existing classifications, suggesting the effectiveness and reliability of DomainDemo's approach.</description>

      <title>Tracking the Takes and Trajectories of English-Language News Narratives across Trustworthy and Worrisome Websites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how misleading and outright false information enters news ecosystems remains a difficult challenge that requires tracking how narratives spread across thousands of fringe and mainstream news websites. To do this, we introduce a system that utilizes encoder-based large language models and zero-shot stance detection to scalably identify and track news narratives and their attitudes across over 4,000 factually unreliable, mixed-reliability, and factually reliable English-language news websites. Running our system over an 18 month period, we track the spread of 146K news stories. Using network-based interference via the NETINF algorithm, we show that the paths of news narratives and the stances of websites toward particular entities can be used to uncover slanted propaganda networks (e.g., anti-vaccine and anti-Ukraine) and to identify the most influential websites in spreading these attitudes in the broader news ecosystem. We hope that increased visibility into our distributed news ecosystem can help with the reporting and fact-checking of propaganda and disinformation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Representation Learning with Localized Topological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representation learning on graphs is a fundamental problem that can be crucial in various tasks. Graph neural networks, the dominant approach for graph representation learning, are limited in their representation power. Therefore, it can be beneficial to explicitly extract and incorporate high-order topological and geometric information into these models. In this paper, we propose a principled approach to extract the rich connectivity information of graphs based on the theory of persistent homology. Our method utilizes the topological features to enhance the representation learning of graph neural networks and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various node classification and link prediction benchmarks. We also explore the option of end-to-end learning of the topological features, i.e., treating topological computation as a differentiable operator during learning. Our theoretical analysis and empirical study provide insights and potential guidelines for employing topological features in graph learning tasks.</description>

      <title>MagnetDB: A Longitudinal Torrent Discovery Dataset with IMDb-Matched Movies and TV Shows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BitTorrent remains a prominent channel for illicit distribution of copyrighted material, yet the supply side of such content remains understudied. We introduce MagnetDB, a longitudinal dataset of torrents discovered through the BitTorrent DHT between 2018 and 2024, containing more than 28.6 million torrents and metadata of more than 950 million files. While our primary focus is on enabling research based on the supply of pirated movies and TV shows, the dataset also encompasses other legitimate and illegitimate torrents. By applying IMDb-matching and annotation to movie and TV show torrents, MagnetDB facilitates detailed analyses of pirated content evolution in the BitTorrent network. Researchers can leverage MagnetDB to examine distribution trends, subcultural practices, and the gift economy within piracy ecosystems. Through its scale and temporal scope, MagnetDB presents a unique opportunity for investigating the broader dynamics of BitTorrent and advancing empirical knowledge on digital piracy.</description>

      <title>Silent Abandonment in Text-Based Contact Centers: Identifying, Quantifying, and Mitigating its Operational Impacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest to improve services, companies offer customers the option to interact with agents via texting. Such contact centers face unique challenges compared to traditional call centers, as measuring customer experience proxies like abandonment and patience involves uncertainty. A key source of this uncertainty is silent abandonment, where customers leave without notifying the system, wasting agent time and leaving their status unclear. Silent abandonment also obscures whether a customer was served or left. Our goals are to measure the magnitude of silent abandonment and mitigate its effects. Classification models show that 3%-70% of customers across 17 companies abandon silently. In one study, 71.3% of abandoning customers did so silently, reducing agent efficiency by 3.2% and system capacity by 15.3%, incurring $5,457 in annual costs per agent. We develop an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate customer patience under uncertainty and identify influencing covariates. We find that companies should use classification models to estimate abandonment scope and our EM algorithm to assess patience. We suggest strategies to operationally mitigate the impact of silent abandonment by predicting suspected silent-abandonment behavior or changing service design. Specifically, we show that while allowing customers to write while waiting in the queue creates a missing data challenge, it also significantly increases patience and reduces service time, leading to reduced abandonment and lower staffing requirements.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Collective Action in Recommender Systems: Promoting Songs by Reordering Playlists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate algorithmic collective action in transformer-based recommender systems. Our use case is a music streaming platform where a collective of fans aims to promote the visibility of an underrepresented artist by strategically placing one of their songs in the existing playlists they control. We introduce two easily implementable strategies to select the position at which to insert the song with the goal to boost recommendations at test time. The strategies exploit statistical properties of the learner by targeting discontinuities in the recommendations, and leveraging the long-tail nature of song distributions. We evaluate the efficacy of our strategies using a publicly available recommender system model released by a major music streaming platform. Our findings reveal that through strategic placement even small collectives (controlling less than 0.01\% of the training data) can achieve up to $40\times$ more test time recommendations than an average song with the same number of training set occurrences. Focusing on the externalities of the strategy, we find that the recommendations of other songs are largely preserved, and the newly gained recommendations are distributed across various artists. Together, our findings demonstrate how carefully designed collective action strategies can be effective while not necessarily being adversarial.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Internet's Hidden Values: An Empirical Study of Desirable Behavior Using Highly-Upvoted Content on Reddit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major task for moderators of online spaces is norm-setting, essentially creating shared norms for user behavior in their communities. Platform design principles emphasize the importance of highlighting norm-adhering examples and explicitly stating community norms. However, norms and values vary between communities and go beyond content-level attributes, making it challenging for platforms and researchers to provide automated ways to identify desirable behavior to be highlighted. Current automated approaches to detect desirability are limited to measures of prosocial behavior, but we do not know whether these measures fully capture the spectrum of what communities value. In this paper, we use upvotes, which express community approval, as a proxy for desirability and examine 16,000 highly-upvoted comments across 80 popular sub-communities on Reddit. Using a large language model, we extract values from these comments across two years (2016 and 2022) and compile 64 and 72 $\textit{macro}$, $\textit{meso}$, and $\textit{micro}$ values for 2016 and 2022 respectively, based on their frequency across communities. Furthermore, we find that existing computational models for measuring prosociality were inadequate to capture on average $82\%$ of the values we extracted. Finally, we show that our approach can not only extract most of the qualitatively-identified values from prior taxonomies, but also uncover new values that are actually encouraged in practice. Our findings highlight the need for nuanced models of desirability that go beyond preexisting prosocial measures. This work has implications for improving moderator understanding of their community values and provides a framework that can supplement qualitative approaches with larger-scale content analyses.</description>

      <title>Navigating Gender Disparities in Communication Research Leadership: Academic Recognition, Career Development, and Compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines gender disparities in communication research through citation metrics, authorship patterns, team composition, and faculty salaries. Using data from 62,359 papers across 121 communication journals, we find that while female authors are increasingly represented, citation gaps persist, with sole-authored papers by women receiving fewer citations than those by men, especially in smaller teams. Team composition analysis reveals a tendency toward gender homophily, with single-gender teams being more common. In top U.S. communication journals, female authors face underrepresentation and citation disparities favoring male authors. Salary analysis from leading U.S. public universities shows that female faculty earn lower salaries at the Assistant Professor level, though disparities lessen at higher ranks. These findings highlight the need for greater efforts to promote gender equity through inclusive collaboration, equitable citation practices, and fair compensation.</description>
