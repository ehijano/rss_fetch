      <title>Policies with Sparse Inter-Agent Dependencies in Dynamic Games: A Dynamic Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common feedback strategies in multi-agent dynamic games require all players' state information to compute control strategies. However, in real-world scenarios, sensing and communication limitations between agents make full state feedback expensive or impractical, and such strategies can become fragile when state information from other agents is inaccurate. To this end, we propose a regularized dynamic programming approach for finding sparse feedback policies that selectively depend on the states of a subset of agents in dynamic games. The proposed approach solves convex adaptive group Lasso problems to compute sparse policies approximating Nash equilibrium solutions. We prove the regularized solutions' asymptotic convergence to a neighborhood of Nash equilibrium policies in linear-quadratic (LQ) games. We extend the proposed approach to general non-LQ games via an iterative algorithm. Empirical results in multi-robot interaction scenarios show that the proposed approach effectively computes feedback policies with varying sparsity levels. When agents have noisy observations of other agents' states, simulation results indicate that the proposed regularized policies consistently achieve lower costs than standard Nash equilibrium policies by up to 77% for all interacting agents whose costs are coupled with other agents' states.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Nash Equilibria in Multiagent Matrix Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a complete characterization for uniqueness of equilibria in unconstrained polymatrix games. We show that while uniqueness is natural for coordination and general polymatrix games, zero-sum games require that the dimension of the combined strategy space is even. Therefore, non-uniqueness is common in zero-sum polymatrix games. In addition, we study the impact of non-uniqueness on classical learning dynamics for multiagent systems and show that the classical methods still yield unique estimates even when there is not a unique equilibrium.</description>

      <title>The Social Cost of Growth: Evaluating GMV-Centric and Welfare-Centric Strategies in Online Food Delivery Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive theoretical framework to analyze the trade-offs between Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) maximization and social welfare optimization in online food delivery platforms. Using a multi-agent simulation and a dual-model approach based on two-sided market theory and welfare economics, we evaluate the impact of GMV-centric and welfare-centric strategies on platform dynamics, including pricing mechanisms, stakeholder welfare, and market efficiency. Our results show that GMV maximization strategies drive rapid short-term transaction growth but lead to uneven welfare distribution, particularly disadvantaging delivery workers. In contrast, welfare-centric strategies promote a more balanced and equitable distribution of benefits among consumers, restaurants, and delivery workers, enhancing platform sustainability in the long run. These findings provide actionable insights for platform operators and policymakers to design strategies that balance growth with social welfare, ensuring both economic efficiency and fairness.</description>

      <title>Convex Markov Games: A Framework for Fairness, Imitation, and Creativity in Multi-Agent Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expert imitation, behavioral diversity, and fairness preferences give rise to preferences in sequential decision making domains that do not decompose additively across time. We introduce the class of convex Markov games that allow general convex preferences over occupancy measures. Despite infinite time horizon and strictly higher generality than Markov games, pure strategy Nash equilibria exist under strict convexity. Furthermore, equilibria can be approximated efficiently by performing gradient descent on an upper bound of exploitability. Our experiments imitate human choices in ultimatum games, reveal novel solutions to the repeated prisoner's dilemma, and find fair solutions in a repeated asymmetric coordination game. In the prisoner's dilemma, our algorithm finds a policy profile that deviates from observed human play only slightly, yet achieves higher per-player utility while also being three orders of magnitude less exploitable.</description>

      <title>Nash Meets Wertheimer: Using Good Continuation in Jigsaw Puzzles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving is a challenging task for computer vision since it requires high-level spatial and semantic reasoning. To solve the problem, existing approaches invariably use color and/or shape information but in many real-world scenarios, such as in archaeological fresco reconstruction, this kind of clues is often unreliable due to severe physical and pictorial deterioration of the individual fragments. This makes state-of-the-art approaches entirely unusable in practice. On the other hand, in such cases, simple geometrical patterns such as lines or curves offer a powerful yet unexplored clue. In an attempt to fill in this gap, in this paper we introduce a new challenging version of the puzzle solving problem in which one deliberately ignores conventional color and shape features and relies solely on the presence of linear geometrical patterns. The reconstruction process is then only driven by one of the most fundamental principles of Gestalt perceptual organization, namely Wertheimer's {\em law of good continuation}. In order to tackle this problem, we formulate the puzzle solving problem as the problem of finding a Nash equilibrium of a (noncooperative) multiplayer game and use classical multi-population replicator dynamics to solve it. The proposed approach is general and allows us to deal with pieces of arbitrary shape, size and orientation. We evaluate our approach on both synthetic and real-world data and compare it with state-of-the-art algorithms. The results show the intrinsic complexity of our purely line-based puzzle problem as well as the relative effectiveness of our game-theoretic formulation.</description>

      <title>EFX Allocations and Orientations on Bipartite Multi-graphs: A Complete Picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the fundamental problem of fairly allocating a set of indivisible items among agents having valuations that are represented by a multi-graph -- here, agents appear as the vertices and items as the edges between them and each vertex (agent) only values the set of its incident edges (items). The goal is to find a fair, i.e., envy-free up to any item (EFX) allocation. This model has recently been introduced by Christodoulou et al. (EC'23) where they show that EFX allocations always exist on simple graphs for monotone valuations, i.e., where any two agents can share at most one edge (item). A natural question arises as to what happens when we go beyond simple graphs and study various classes of multi-graphs?
  We answer the above question affirmatively for the valuation class of bipartite multi-graphs and multi-cycles. Our main positive result is that EFX allocations always exist on bipartite multi-graphs for agents with additive valuations, thereby joining in the few sets of scenarios where EFX allocations are known to exist for an arbitrary number of agents. We also show that EFX allocations can be computed in polynomial time if the number of edges between any two agents in the given bipartite multi-graph is a constant. Next, we study EFX orientations (i.e., allocations where every item is allocated to one of its two endpoint agents) and give a complete picture of when they exist for bipartite multi-graphs dependent on two parameters -- the number of edges shared between any two agents and the diameter of the graph. Finally, we prove that it is NP-complete to determine whether a given fair division instance on a bipartite multi-graph admits an EFX orientation.</description>

      <title>Exploration and Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How to incentivize self-interested agents to explore when they prefer to exploit? Consider a population of self-interested agents that make decisions under uncertainty. They "explore" to acquire new information and "exploit" this information to make good decisions. Collectively they need to balance these two objectives, but their incentives are skewed toward exploitation. This is because exploration is costly, but its benefits are spread over many agents in the future.
  "Incentivized Exploration" addresses this issue via strategic communication. Consider a benign ``principal" which can communicate with the agents and make recommendations, but cannot force the agents to comply. Moreover, suppose the principal can observe the agents' decisions and the outcomes of these decisions. The goal is to design a communication and recommendation policy which (i) achieves a desirable balance between exploration and exploitation, and (ii) incentivizes the agents to follow recommendations. What makes it feasible is "information asymmetry": the principal knows more than any one agent, as it collects information from many. It is essential that the principal does not fully reveal all its knowledge to the agents.
  Incentivized exploration combines two important problems in, resp., machine learning and theoretical economics. First, if agents always follow recommendations, the principal faces a multi-armed bandit problem: essentially, design an algorithm that balances exploration and exploitation. Second, interaction with a single agent corresponds to "Bayesian persuasion", where a principal leverages information asymmetry to convince an agent to take a particular action. We provide a brief but self-contained introduction to each problem through the lens of incentivized exploration, solving a key special case of the former as a sub-problem of the latter.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the top trading cycles rule for housing markets with lexicographic preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a housing market model with limited externalities where agents care both about their own consumption via demand preferences and about the agent who receives their endowment via supply preferences (we extend the associated lexicographic preference domains introduced in Klaus and Meo, 2023). If preferences are demand lexicographic, then our model extends the classical Shapley-Scarf housing market (Shapley and Scarf, 1974) with strict preferences model. Our main result is a characterization of the corresponding top trading cycles (TTC) rule by individual rationality, pair efficiency, and strategy-proofness (Theorem 1), which extends that of Ekici (2024) from classical Shapley-Scarf housing markets with strict preferences to our model. Two further characterizations are immediately obtained by strengthening pair efficiency to either Pareto efficiency or pairwise stability (Corollaries 1 and 2). Finally, we show that as soon as we extend the preference domain to include demand lexicographic as well as supply lexicographic preferences (e.g., when preferences are separable), no rule satisfying individual rationality, pair efficiency, and strategy-proofness exists (Theorem 2).</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Optimizing Atomic Congestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomic congestion games are a classic topic in network design, routing, and algorithmic game theory, and are capable of modeling congestion and flow optimization tasks in various application areas. While both the price of anarchy for such games as well as the computational complexity of computing their Nash equilibria are by now well-understood, the computational complexity of computing a system-optimal set of strategies -- that is, a centrally planned routing that minimizes the average cost of agents -- is severely understudied in the literature. We close this gap by identifying the exact boundaries of tractability for the problem through the lens of the parameterized complexity paradigm. After showing that the problem remains highly intractable even on extremely simple networks, we obtain a set of results which demonstrate that the structural parameters which control the computational (in)tractability of the problem are not vertex-separator based in nature (such as, e.g., treewidth), but rather based on edge separators. We conclude by extending our analysis towards the (even more challenging) min-max variant of the problem.</description>
