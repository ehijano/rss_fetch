      <title>Genetic evolution of a multi-generational population in the context of interstellar space travels -- Part II: Phenotypic effects of gene expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first paper of this series, we included the effects of population genetics in the agent-based Monte Carlo code HERITAGE under the hypothesis of neutral phenotypic effects. It implied that mutations (genetic changes) had only neutral physical manifestations. We now relax this assumption by including genetic effects of mutation and neo-mutations (from radiations) onto the population's life expectancy, fertility, pregnancy chances and miscarriage rates. When applied to a population aboard a generation ship that travels at sub-light speed towards a distant exoplanet, we demonstrate that natural selection indirectly affects the genetic structure of a population via the contribution of phenotypes, in agreement with past studies in conservation biology. For large starting crews (about 500 individuals), the effect aligns with the neutral hypothesis and the frequency of alleles (for non-sexual chromosomes) is stable over centuries. Results are completely different if the spacecraft shielding, integrated into hull design, fails to efficiently protect the crew from high-energy cosmic rays and showers of secondary particles. We tested different scenarios, in which the level of radiation is either fixed at normal or extreme levels, or changing over time due to, e.g., shield degradation, on-board nuclear incident or the outburst of a supernova situated 50 light-years away.</description>

      <title>The New Science of Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After decades of dismissal and secrecy, it has become clear that a significant number of the world's governments take Unidentified Aerospace-Undersea Phenomena (UAP), formerly known as Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs), seriously -- yet still seem to know little about them. As a result, these phenomena are increasingly attracting the attention of scientists around the world, some of whom have recently formed research efforts to monitor and scientifically study UAP. In this paper, we review and summarize approximately 20 historical government studies dating from 1933 to the present (in Scandinavia, WWII, US, Canada, France, Russia, China), several historical private research studies (France, UK, US), and both recent and current scientific research efforts (Ireland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, US). In doing so, our objective is to clarify the existing global and historical scientific narrative around UAP. Studies range from field station development and deployment to the collection and analysis of witness reports from around the world. We dispel the common misconception that UAPs are an American phenomenon and show that UAP can be, and have been, scientifically investigated. Our aim here is to enable future studies to draw on the great depth of prior documented experience.</description>

      <title>Robust Indoor Localization in Dynamic Environments: A Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fingerprint localization has gained significant attention due to its cost-effective deployment, low complexity, and high efficacy. However, traditional methods, while effective for static data, often struggle in dynamic environments where data distributions and feature spaces evolve-a common occurrence in real-world scenarios. To address the challenges of robustness and adaptability in fingerprint localization for dynamic indoor environments, this paper proposes DF-Loc, an end-to-end dynamic fingerprint localization system based on multi-source unsupervised domain adaptation (MUDA). DF-Loc leverages historical data from multiple time scales to facilitate knowledge transfer in specific feature spaces, thereby enhancing generalization capabilities in the target domain and reducing reliance on labeled data. Specifically, the system incorporates a Quality Control (QC) module for CSI data preprocessing and employs image processing techniques for CSI fingerprint feature reconstruction. Additionally, a multi-scale attention-based feature fusion backbone network is designed to extract multi-level transferable fingerprint features. Finally, a dual-stage alignment model aligns the distributions of multiple source-target domain pairs, improving regression characteristics in the target domain. Extensive experiments conducted in office and classroom environments demonstrate that DF-Loc outperforms comparative methods in terms of both localization accuracy and robustness. With 60% of reference points used for training, DF-Loc achieves average localization errors of 0.79m and 3.72m in "same-test" scenarios, and 0.94m and 4.39m in "different-test" scenarios, respectively. This work pioneers an end-to-end multi-source transfer learning approach for fingerprint localization, providing valuable insights for future research in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Testing spooky action between free-traveling electron-positron pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. While the entanglement of confined electron pairs has been established early on, the entanglement of free-traveling electron pairs, particularly at high energies, remains largely unexplored due to the substantial challenges involved in measuring the spins of free-traveling electrons. In this study, we investigate the entanglement and the Bell inequality violation of free-traveling electron-positron pairs generated in a fixed-target experiment. This experimental setup facilitates the creation of a controllable source of entangled electron-positron pairs, where entangled events are produced in specific phase spaces. Based on this source and the prior knowledge of the entangled state, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring the polarization correlations of the entangled $e^+e^-$ pairs through their individual secondary scatterings off two separate additional targets.</description>

      <title>Prolegomena To Any Future Device Physics</title>

Abstract: For the last 60 years, advances in conventional computing platforms have been driven by the empirical notion known as Moores law. In its essence, Moores law is a ubiquitous description of the exponential increase in transistor density acting as a proxy for computing power as a function of time. While this trend started as an interesting observation, it has evolved into a self-fulfilling prophecy used to drive the entire semiconductor industry. Arguments for or against the end of Moores law have proliferated and the reluctant consensus is that Moores law will disappear. Warnings of the end of this trend have been repeatedly thwarted by advances in many different aspects of the computing ecosystem including materials improvements, device design, device or circuit cleverness, and software and architectural innovations. While many have argued the impending doom of Moores law is the ultimate roadblock imposed by atomic length scales, quantum processes, and energy consumption limits, we contend that Moores law must be jettisoned for a different reason: Words matter. Even those who adamantly declare the end of Moores law still use the language of Moores law. The inward focus of this notion imposes an intellectual tyranny that inhibits revolutionary progress. We suggest instead a more outwardly focused perspective and suggest a shift in language to a regime we coin the Feynman Mandate. In this perspective, we outline the issues with the continued use of Moores law as well as a prescription of transitioning to a new lexicon. We outline a new, more general metric for ascertaining progress and identify the roles of various stakeholders in this process.</description>
