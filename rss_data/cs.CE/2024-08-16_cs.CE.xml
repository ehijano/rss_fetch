      <title>Crystalline Material Discovery in the Era of Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystalline materials, with their symmetrical and periodic structures, possess a diverse array of properties and have been widely used in various fields, e.g., sustainable development. To discover crystalline materials, traditional experimental and computational approaches are often time-consuming and expensive. In these years, thanks to the explosive amount of crystalline materials data, great interest has been given to data-driven materials discovery. Particularly, recent advancements have exploited the expressive representation ability of deep learning to model the highly complex atomic systems within crystalline materials, opening up new avenues for fast and accurate materials discovery. These works typically focus on four types of tasks, including physicochemical property prediction, crystalline material synthesis, aiding characterization, and force field development; these tasks are essential for scientific research and development in crystalline materials science. Despite the remarkable progress, there is still a lack of systematic research to summarize their correlations, distinctions, and limitations. To fill this gap, we systematically investigated the progress made in deep learning-based material discovery in recent years. We first introduce several data representations of the crystalline materials. Based on the representations, we summarize various fundamental deep learning models and their tailored usages in material discovery tasks. We also point out the remaining challenges and propose several future directions. The main goal of this review is to offer comprehensive and valuable insights and foster progress in the intersection of artificial intelligence and material science.</description>

      <title>Portability of Fortran's `do concurrent' on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a continuing interest in using standard language constructs for accelerated computing in order to avoid (sometimes vendor-specific) external APIs. For Fortran codes, the {\tt do concurrent} (DC) loop has been successfully demonstrated on the NVIDIA platform. However, support for DC on other platforms has taken longer to implement. Recently, Intel has added DC GPU offload support to its compiler, as has HPE for AMD GPUs. In this paper, we explore the current portability of using DC across GPU vendors using the in-production solar surface flux evolution code, HipFT. We discuss implementation and compilation details, including when/where using directive APIs for data movement is needed/desired compared to using a unified memory system. The performance achieved on both data center and consumer platforms is shown.</description>

      <title>InVAErt networks for amortized inference and identifiability analysis of lumped parameter hemodynamic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimation of cardiovascular model parameters from electronic health records (EHR) poses a significant challenge primarily due to lack of identifiability. Structural non-identifiability arises when a manifold in the space of parameters is mapped to a common output, while practical non-identifiability can result due to limited data, model misspecification, or noise corruption. To address the resulting ill-posed inverse problem, optimization-based or Bayesian inference approaches typically use regularization, thereby limiting the possibility of discovering multiple solutions. In this study, we use inVAErt networks, a neural network-based, data-driven framework for enhanced digital twin analysis of stiff dynamical systems. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of inVAErt networks in the context of physiological inversion of a six-compartment lumped parameter hemodynamic model from synthetic data to real data with missing components.</description>

      <title>Design optimization of advanced tow-steered composites with manufacturing constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tow steering technologies, such as Automated fiber placement, enable the fabrication of composite laminates with curvilinear fiber, tow, or tape paths. Designers may therefore tailor tow orientations locally according to the expected local stress state within a structure, such that strong and stiff orientations of the tow are (for example) optimized to provide maximal mechanical benefit. Tow path optimization can be an effective tool in automating this design process, yet has a tendency to create complex designs that may be challenging to manufacture. In the context of tow steering, these complexities can manifest in defects such as tow wrinkling, gaps, overlaps. In this work, we implement manufacturing constraints within the tow path optimization formulation to restrict the minimum tow turning radius and the maximum density of gaps between and overlaps of tows. This is achieved by bounding the local value of the curl and divergence of the vector field associated with the tow orientations. The resulting local constraints are effectively enforced in the optimization framework through the Augmented Lagrangian method. The resulting optimization methodology is demonstrated by designing 2D and 3D structures with optimized tow orientation paths that maximize stiffness (minimize compliance) considering various levels of manufacturing restrictions. The optimized tow paths are shown to be structurally efficient and to respect imposed manufacturing constraints. As expected, the more geometrical complexity that can be achieved by the feedstock tow and placement technology, the higher the stiffness of the resulting optimized design.</description>

      <title>DeepClair: Utilizing Market Forecasts for Effective Portfolio Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing market forecasts is pivotal in optimizing portfolio selection strategies. We introduce DeepClair, a novel framework for portfolio selection. DeepClair leverages a transformer-based time-series forecasting model to predict market trends, facilitating more informed and adaptable portfolio decisions. To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement learning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step strategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by fine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model. Additionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in investment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio selection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.</description>
