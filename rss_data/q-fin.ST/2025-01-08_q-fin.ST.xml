      <title>Evaluating the resilience of ESG investments in European Markets during turmoil periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the resilience of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investments during periods of financial instability, comparing them with traditional equity indices across major European markets-Germany, France, and Italy. Using daily returns from October 2021 to February 2024, the analysis explores the effects of key global disruptions such as the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine conflict on market performance. A mixture of two generalised normal distributions (MGND) and EGARCH-in-mean models are used to identify periods of market turmoil and assess volatility dynamics. The findings indicate that during crises, ESG investments present higher volatility in Germany and Italy than in France. Despite some regional variations, ESG portfolios demonstrate greater resilience compared to traditional ones, offering potential risk mitigation during market shocks. These results underscore the importance of integrating ESG factors into long-term investment strategies, particularly in the face of unpredictable financial turmoil.</description>

      <title>How to verify that a given process is a L\'evy-Driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming that a L\'evy-Driven Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (or CAR(1)) processes is observed at discrete times $0$, $h$, $2h$,$\cdots$ $[T/h]h$. Here we introduced a step-by-step methodological approach on how a person would verify the model assumptions supported by real-life data examples using this methodology. The model parameter needs to be estimated and the driving process must be approximated. Approximated increments with estimated parameter of the driving process are used to test the assumptions that the CAR(1) process is L\'evy-driven. Performance of the test is illustrated through simulation.</description>
