      <title>Anderson transition in high dimension: comments to arXiv:2403.01974</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recent submission arXiv:2403.01974, Altshuler et al suggested a new approach to the Anderson transition in high dimensions. The main idea consists in the use of the branching graphs instead of high-dimensional lattices: it does not look very convincing, but we do not want to stress this point. Since the authors welcome comments, we put forward a lot of objections to their exposition of the general situation. The arising hypothesis is given in the end.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Embracing Imperfection in Physical Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Performing machine learning (ML) with analog instead of digital signals offers advantages in speed and energy efficiency, but component and measurement imperfections can make nonlinear analog networks difficult to train. As a result, most schemes involve a precise digital model, either to train alone or in tandem with experiments. Here we take a different perspective: working in the analog domain, we characterize the consequences of the inherent imperfection of a physical learning system and, ultimately, overcome them. We train an analog network of self-adjusting resistors -- a contrastive local learning network (CLLN) -- for multiple tasks, and observe limit cycles and characteristic scaling behaviors absent in `perfect' systems. We develop an analytical model that captures these phenomena by incorporating an uncontrolled but deterministic bias into the learning process. Our results suggest that imperfections limit precision and erase memory of previous tasks by continuously modifying the underlying representation of all learned tasks, akin to representational drift in the brain. Finally, we introduce and demonstrate a system-agnostic training method that greatly suppresses these effects. Our work points to a new, scalable approach in analog learning, one that eschews precise modeling and instead thrives in the mess of real systems.</description>

      <title>Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.</description>

      <title>Group Convolutional Neural Network Ground State of the Quantum Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the ground state of the square lattice Quantum Dimer Model in a $\rm{p4m}$-symmetric Group Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) representation and show that results in agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be obtained with a $\mathcal{L}=2$ layer network. In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Scaling Behavior in Sparse Subnetwork Representations of Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within overparametrized neural networks, there exist sparse subnetworks that are capable of matching the performance of the original model when trained in isolation from the original initialization. We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork, not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Emergent universal long-range structure in random-organizing systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-organization through noisy interactions is ubiquitous across physics, mathematics, and machine learning, yet how long-range structure emerges from local noisy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate three paradigmatic random-organizing particle systems drawn from distinct domains: models from soft matter physics (random organization, biased random organization) and machine learning (stochastic gradient descent), each characterized by distinct sources of noise. We discover universal long-range behavior across all systems, namely the suppression of long-range density fluctuations, governed solely by the noise correlation between particles. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the emergence of long-range order and the tendency of stochastic gradient descent to favor flat minima -- a phenomenon widely observed in machine learning. To rationalize these findings, we develop a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that quantitatively captures all observations. Our study resolves long-standing questions about the microscopic origin of noise-induced hyperuniformity, uncovers striking parallels between stochastic gradient descent dynamics on particle system energy landscapes and neural network loss landscapes, and should have wide-ranging applications -- from the self-assembly of hyperuniform materials to ecological population dynamics and the design of generalizable learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Probing disorder-induced Fisher information matrix and Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound by STM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic local density of states of solids, if normalized correctly, represents the probability density that the electron at a specific position has a particular energy. Because this probability density can vary in space in disordered systems, we propose that one can either treat the energy as a random variable and position as an external parameter to construct a real space Fisher information matrix, or treat the position as a random variable and energy as an external parameter to construct an energy space Fisher information, both quantify the variation of local density of states caused by the disorder. The corresponding Cram\'{e}r-Rao bounds in these two scenarios set a limit on the energy variance and the position variance of electrons, respectively, pointing to new interpretations of STM measurements. Our formalism thus bring the notion of information geometry into STM measurements, as demonstrated explicitly by lattice models of metals and topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Dynamic signature of the thermodynamic transition in a novel mean field system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this study, we investigate a novel model system that enables a continuous crossover from a standard three dimensional liquid to a fully connected mean field like system by introducing pseudo neighbours. These pseudo neighbours enhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local structure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence thermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the configurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a temperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow down, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam Gibbs relation. To uncover a possible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyse bond breakage dynamics. Unlike real-real bonds, which decay similarly in both the parent Kob Andersen model and its mean field variant, real-pseudo bonds exhibit long lived, persistent behaviour with strong temperature dependence. These bonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the bond breakage correlation function. Remarkably, we show that the number of surviving pseudo bonds can be analytically estimated and correlates directly with the thermodynamic transition temperature T_K. We propose a phenomenological relation between T_K and the number of surviving pseudo-bonds, establishing a novel link between thermodynamic and dynamic observables. Our results suggest that these persistent pseudo bonds serve as a robust dynamical signature of the thermodynamic transition, and the system might have properties analogous to those of randomly bonded ultrastable glasses.</description>

      <title>Optimization and variability can coexist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological systems perform close to their physical limits, but promoting this optimality to a general principle seems to require implausibly fine tuning of parameters. Using examples from a wide range of systems, we show that this intuition is wrong. Near an optimum, functional performance depends on parameters in a "sloppy'' way, with some combinations of parameters being only weakly constrained. Absent any other constraints, this predicts that we should observe widely varying parameters, and we make this precise: the entropy in parameter space can be extensive even if performance on average is very close to optimal. This removes a major objection to optimization as a general principle, and rationalizes the observed variability.</description>

      <title>The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory with full characterization and realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a complete and unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel universal mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens the rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show the criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.</description>

      <title>Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned tasks. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world data.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal</title>

Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.</description>

      <title>Critical and Nonpercolating Phases in Bond Percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p &lt; 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.</description>
