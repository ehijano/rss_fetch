      <title>Formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

      <title>Stability and disconnected groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the notion of semistability for principal bundles over curves with possibly disconnected structure group. We establish a new characterization of semistability under change of group which is novel even in the connected case. A key ingredient is our identification of the rational characters of any linear algebraic group with the Weyl-invariant rational characters of a maximal torus. In the reductive case, we prove an analogous statement for integral cocharacters. As an application, we extend the recursive description of Kirwan stratifications in Geometric Invariant Theory to disconnected groups, and use it in our study semistability for principal bundles.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_0$ be an irreducible smooth projective curve defined over $\overline{\mathbb Q}$ and $\mathbb E$ a vector bundle on $X_0$. We give a criterion for connections on the base change ${\mathbb E}\otimes_{\overline{\mathbb Q}}{\mathbb C} \rightarrow X_0\times_{{\rm Spec}\,\overline{\mathbb Q}} {\rm Spec}\,\mathbb{C} $ to $\mathbb C$ to be the base change of some connection on $\mathbb E$. A similar criterion is given for Higgs fields on ${\mathbb E}\otimes_{\overline{\mathbb Q}}{\mathbb C}$.</description>

      <title>Monodromy and rigidity of crystalline local systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several rigidity properties of $p$-adic local systems on a smooth rigid analytic space $X$ over a $p$-adic field. We prove that the monodromy of the log isocrystal attached to a $p$-adic local system is ''rigid'' along irreducible components of the special fiber. Then we give several applications. First, suppose that $X$ has good reduction. We show that if a family of semistable representations is crystalline at one classical point on $X$, then it is crystalline everywhere. Second, combining with the $p$-adic monodromy theorem recently studied by the authors and their collaborators, we prove the following surprising rigidity result conjectured by Shankar: for any $p$-adic local system on a smooth projective variety with good reduction, if it is potentially crystalline at one classical point, then it is potentially crystalline everywhere. Finally, we show that if a $p$-adic local system on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor on a smooth rigid analytic space is crystalline at all classical points, then it extends uniquely to a $p$-adic local system on the entire space. In other words, such a local system cannot have geometric monodromy if it has no arithmetic monodromy everywhere on the complement of a reduced normal crossing divisor.</description>

      <title>Intersections of the Ekedahl-Oort and Newton Polygon Stratifications of $\mathcal{A}_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moduli space $\mathcal{A}_g$ of principally polarised abelian varieties of dimension $g$, defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p &gt;0$, is studied through various stratifications. The two most prominent ones are the Newton polygon stratification, based on the isogeny class of the $p$-divisible group of an abelian variety, and the Ekedahl-Oort stratification, defined by the isomorphism class of its $p$-torsion group scheme. In general, it is not known how the strata of these two intersect. In this paper we study intersections of the Ekedahl-Oort and Newton polygon stratification in dimension at most $5$. We give an explicit description of the Ekedahl-Oort stratification of the supersingular locus $\mathcal{S}_{5}$, and describe other $p$-rank zero intersections of the two stratifications. For intersections of positive $p$-rank, we describe all such intersections in dimensions at most $5$. Our proofs use Oort's minimality of $p$-divisible groups, as well as related results of Chai-Oort and Harashita. In addition to these, a new approach used in this paper is an inductive argument, based on understanding the Ekedahl-Oort type of products of abelian varieties and the known intersections in lower dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies wall crossings in Bridgeland stability for the moduli space of Pandharipande--Thomas stable pairs associated with quintic genus 2 curves in the complex projective three-space. We provide a complete list of irreducible components of the moduli space, together with a birational description of each component. As an application, we recover the geometry of the Hilbert scheme for quintic genus 2 curves, for which no previous results are known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study double-sided actions of $(\mathbb{C}^*)^2$ on $SL(3,\mathbb{C})/U$ and the associated quotients, where $U$ is a maximal unipotent subgroup of $SL(3,\mathbb{C})$. The main results of this paper are a sufficient condition for the double-sided quotient to agree with the quotient in terms of the geometric invariant theory (GIT), and an explicit necessary and sufficient condition for $SL(3,\mathbb{C})/U$ to agree with the $\chi$-stable locus in its affine closure. We apply this result to characterize certain complex structures on $SU(3)$ which are not left invariant by means of the GIT quotient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify up to signature all the ways the alternating group $A_n$ can act on a compact Riemann surfaces when the quotient genus is greater than $0$. In particular, we prove that for $A_n$ with $n&gt;6$ every potential signature for the group acting with quotient genus greater than $0$ is an actual signature. We also show that in the case of $n=5$, respectively $n=6$, the only failure is for $[1;2]$, respectively $[1;3]$. Along the way we also prove that for any finite simple non-abelian group, all potential signatures with quotient genus greater than $1$ are actual signatures.</description>

      <title>Reconstrucion of oriented matroids from Varchenko-Gelfand algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebra of $R$-valued functions on the set of chambers of a real hyperplane arrangement is called the Varchenko-Gelfand (VG) algebra. This algebra carries a natural filtration by the degree with respect to Heaviside functions, giving rise to the associated graded VG algebra. When the coefficient ring $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic $2$, the graded VG algebra is known to be isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra.
  In this paper, we study VG algebras over coefficient rings of characteristic different from $2$, and investigate to what extent VG algebras determine the underlying oriented matroid structures.
  Our main results concern hyperplane arrangements that are generic in codimension $2$. For such arrangements, if $R$ is an integral domain of characteristic not equal to $2$, then the oriented matroid can be recovered from both the filtered and the graded VG algebras.
  We also formulate an algorithm that is expected to reconstruct oriented matroids from VG algebras in the case of general arrangements.</description>

      <title>Ricci Flow on Weighted Digraphs with Balancing Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ricci curvature and Ricci flow have proven to be powerful tools for analyzing the geometry of discrete structures, particularly on undirected graphs, where they have been applied to tasks ranging from community detection to graph representation learning. However, their development on directed graphs remains limited, with Ricci flow being especially underexplored. In this work, we introduce a rigorous formulation of Ricci flow on directed weighted graphs, which evolves edge weights while preserving distances, and establish both the existence and uniqueness of its solutions. To capture the essence of asymmetry in directed networks and to enhance the capability of modeling more flexible structures, we incorporate a node-wise balancing factor that regulates between outflow and inflow. Building on the continuous Ricci flow evolution framework, we propose a discrete Ricci flow algorithm that is applicable to numerical computing. Numerical studies on various directed graph examples demonstrate the capacity of the proposed flow to reveal structural asymmetry and dynamic evolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the operad structure on the homology of moduli spaces of pointed rooted trees of $d$-dimensional projective spaces, introduced by Chen, Gibney and Krashen a couple of decades ago. We describe this operad by generators and relations, show that it is homotopy Koszul, exhibit a Givental-type action on representations of that operad, and prove that this operad represents the homotopy quotient of the operad of chains of $S^1$-framed little $2d$-disks by its natural circle action. Our approach also sheds new light on the $d=1$ case, revealing a new combinatorial way to write the original Givental formulas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17395v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Fourier transforms of holonomic D-modules on the complex affine line and show that their enhanced solution complexes are described by a twisted Morse theory. We thus recover and even strengthen the well-known formula for their exponential factors i.e. the stationary phase method. Moreover, we define a Lagrangian cycle that we call the irregular characteristic cycle and describe the enhanced solution complex of the Fourier transform by it. In this way, we obtain a new perspective, from which we can geometrically see how the standard properties of holonomic D-modules are transformed via the Fourier transform. In the course of our study, a formula for the (classical) characteristic cycles of the Fourier transforms will be also obtained and natural bases of their holomorphic solutions will be constructed via rapid decay homology cycles.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate line bundles on $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$ the moduli stack of parahoric Bruhat--Tits bundles over a smooth projective curve. Translating this problem into one concerning twisted conformal blocks, we are able to establish criteria that detect when line bundles on an appropriate flag variety descend to $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$. Along the way we establish a conjecture of Pappas and Rapoport which describes sections of line bundles on $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$ using representation-theoretical means. We conclude the paper with examples where our methods allow us to explicitly determine the Picard group of $\mathrm{Bun}_{\mathcal{G}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau manifolds from the perspective of families of Calabi-Yau manifolds and their period integrals. Special emphasis is laid on distinguished properties of the hypergeometric series of Gel'fand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky that appear in mirror symmetry. After defining mirror symmetry in terms of families of Calabi-Yau manifolds, we summarize a general construction of moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces (complete intersections) in toric varieties. We review the central charge formula, and assuming it, we show mirror symmetry for the pairs of Calabi-Yau manifolds associated with reflexive polytopes. By describing the moduli spaces globally, we present interesting examples of Calabi-Yau manifolds where birational geometry and geometry of Fourier-Mukai partners of a Calabi-Yau manifold arise from the study of mirror symmetry.</description>

      <title>Infinite Euclidean Distance Discriminants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study infinite Euclidean distance discriminants of algebraic varieties, defined as the loci of data points whose fibers under the second projection from the Euclidean distance correspondence are positive-dimensional. In particular, these discriminants contain all data points with infinitely many critical points for the nearest-point problem. We present computer code that computes the infinite Euclidean distance discriminant, and use it to present numerous varieties with nonempty such discriminants. Moreover, we prove that for any data point, the fiber under the second projection is contained in a finite union of hyperspheres centered at that point. For curves, we include a complete characterization; their infinite Euclidean distance discriminants turn out to be affine linear spaces. Finally, we introduce and characterize skew-tube surfaces in three-dimensional space. By construction, these have a one-dimensional infinite Euclidean distance discriminant. We further demonstrate that many skew-tubes have significantly lower Euclidean distance degrees than generic surfaces of the same degree.</description>

      <title>Points of bounded height on quintic del Pezzo surfaces over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove Manin's conjecture for split smooth quintic del Pezzo surfaces over arbitrary number fields with respect to fairly general anticanonical height functions. After passing to universal torsors, we first show that we may restrict the torsor variables to their typical sizes, and then we can solve the counting problem in the framework of o-minimal structures.</description>

      <title>Non-toric brane webs, Calabi-Yau 3-folds, and 5d SCFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study webs of 5-branes with 7-branes in Type IIB string theory from a geometric perspective. Mathematically, a web of 5-branes with 7-branes is a tropical curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with focus-focus singularities introduced. To any such a web $W$, we attach a log Calabi-Yau surface $(Y,D)$ with a line bundle $L$. We then describe supersymmetric webs, which are webs defining 5d superconformal field theories (SCFTs), in terms of the geometry of $(Y,D,L)$. We also introduce particular supersymmetric webs called ``consistent webs", and show that any 5d SCFT defined by a supersymmetric web can be obtained from a consistent web by adding free hypermultiplets. Using birational geometry of degenerations of log Calabi-Yau surfaces, we provide an algorithm to test the consistency of a web in terms of its dual polygon. Moreover, for a consistent web $W$, we provide an algebro-geometric construction of the mirror $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ to $(Y,D,L)$, as a non-toric canonical 3-fold singularity, and show that M-theory on $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ engineers the same 5d SCFT as $W$. We also explain how to derive explicit equations for $\mathcal{X}^{\mathrm{can}}$ using scattering diagrams, encoding disk worldsheet instantons in the A-model, or equivalently the BPS states of an auxiliary rank one 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory.</description>

      <title>A note on weight filtrations at the characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that $\kgl$-linear cohomology theories over an affine Dedekind scheme $S$ admit a canonical weight filtration on resolvable motives without inverting residual characteristics. Combined with upcoming work of Annala--Hoyois--Iwasa, this endows essentially all known logarithmic cohomology theories with weight filtrations when evaluated on projective sncd pairs $(X,D)$ over $S$. Furthermore, the weight-filtered cohomology is an invariant of the open part $U = X-D$.
  On variants of de Rham cohomology, we show that our weight filtration recovers the d\'ecalaged pole-order filtration defined by Deligne. One interpretation of this is that the spectral sequence associated to the pole-order filtration is an invariant of $U$ from the $E_2$-page onwards, which generalizes a result of Deligne from characteristic 0 to positive and mixed characteristic, and suggests that ``mixed Hodge theory'' is a useful invariant of $S$-schemes.
  Finally, we compute explicit examples of weight filtered pieces of cohomology theories. One of the computations reproves a slight weakening of a result of Thuillier stating that the singular cohomology of the dual complex associated to the boundary divisor of a good projective compactification does not depend on the chosen compactification.
  In the appendix, we prove the folklore results that the Whitehead tower functor is fully faithful and that perfect bivariant pairings with respect to the twisted arrow category correspond to duality.</description>

      <title>Fargues-Scholze parameters and torsion vanishing for special orthogonal and unitary groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that when $p$ is an odd prime, $K$ is an unramified finite extension of $\mathbb Q_p$ and $G$ is a pure inner form of an unramified special orthogonal group or unitary group over $K$, the Fargues-Scholze local Langlands correspondence for $G$ agrees with the semi-simplification of classical local Langlands correspondence. As applications, we construct an unambiguous local Langlands correspondence for even orthogonal groups, deduce Fargues' eigen-sheaf conjecture, and prove new torsion vanishing results for orthogonal and unitary Shimura varieties.</description>
