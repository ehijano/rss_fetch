      <title>Porous metal nitride film synthesis without template</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal nitrides possess exceptional catalytic, electronic and physical properties making them widely used in (opto-)electronics and as hard coatings. When used as films in surface-active applications, however, their performance remains limited by poor mass transfer and reduced accessibility of reactive sites. This is associated to compact film architecture yielded by conventional deposition techniques (e.g., 16-26% for sputtered W$_2$N). Here, we demonstrate a template-free method for the design of highly porous (porosity &gt; 84%) metal nitride films with high compositional versatility, as demonstrated for Cu3N, W2N, MoNx and TiN. These are obtained by exploiting the self-assembly of fractal-like metal oxide agglomerates during deposition from aerosols followed by their dry nitridation. In case of Cu$_3$N, monocristalline oxide nanoparticles were converted to polycrystalline nitrides during nitridation, as traced by X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Such films feature consistently lower resistances than their metal oxide counterparts, as well as high reactivity and mass transfer. This is exploited exemplarily for molecular sensing of NO$_2$ at only 75$^\circ$C temperature, leading to up to a five-fold higher response with faster response time over more compact spin-coated films for. As a result, our approach overcomes critical mass transfer performance limitations of metal nitride films that are also relevant for other applications like electrocatalysis and energy storage.</description>

      <title>Electromotive force generation in a ferromagnetic metal thin film under the ferromagnetic resonance excitation with permanent magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) excitation of a ferromagnetic metal single-layer film was tried by using a couple of permanent magnets as the source of the uniform static magnetic field and by using a co-planer waveguide connected with a network analyzer as the source of the radiofrequency (RF) magnetic field. A typical FMR spectrum of a ferromagnetic Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ thin film was successfully obtained and a clear electromotive force (EMF) was generated in the Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ thin film under the FMR excitation with the permanent magnets. That is, we achieved EMF generation in a Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ thin film under the FMR excitation with the permanent magnets, which can be applied as a simple energy transduction technology from ambient RF energy to electrical energy.</description>

      <title>Structural and electrical properties of fiber textured and epitaxial molybdenum thin films prepared by magnetron sputter epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molybdenum (Mo) due to its optimal structural, physical, and acoustic properties find application as electrode material in aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) based bulk acoustic wave (BAW) resonators. Epitaxial Mo thin films exhibiting low resistivity can improve the performance of the BAW resonator by enhancing both the electromechanical coupling coefficient and quality factor. In this study, we systematically vary the growth temperature of Mo grown on fiber-textured and epitaxial wurtzite-aluminum nitride (AlN) to study the changes in structural and electrical properties of the Mo films. Results show that Mo grown at 700{\deg}C on epitaxial AlN exhibit low surface roughness, large average grain diameter, low resistivity, and high crystal quality. XRD pole figure and phi-scan reveal that irrespective of the growth temperature, Mo is fiber textured on fiber-textured AlN, and has three rotational domains on epitaxial AlN. The study shows that the resistivity of Mo reduces with increasing growth temperature, which we relate to increasing average grain diameter. Additionally, we show that fiber-textured Mo has more high angle grain boundaries resulting in consistently higher resistivity than its epitaxial equivalent.</description>

      <title>Photonic Circuit of Arbitrary Non-Unitary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A design framework to implement non-unitary input-output operations to a practical unitary photonic integrated circuit is described. This is achieved by utilising the cosine-sine decomposition to recover the unitarity of the original operation. The recovered unitary operation is decomposed into fundamental unitary building blocks, forming a photonic integrated circuit network based on directional couplers and waveguide phase shifters. The individual building blocks are designed and optimised by three-dimensional full-wave simulations and scaled up using a circuit approach. The paper investigates the scalability and robustness of the design approach. Our study demonstrates that the proposed approach of performing unitary matrix completion can be applied to any arbitrary matrices. This design approach allows for implementation of non-unitary operations to perform various linear functions in neuromorphic photonics for computing, sensing, signal processing and communications.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal graphene-superconductor thermal switch controlled by the superconducting phase difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a superconducting phase-controlled thermal switch based on a four-terminal graphene-superconductor system. By the coupling of two superconducting leads on a zigzag graphene nanoribbon, both the normal-transmission coefficient and the crossed-Andreev-reflection coefficient, which dominate the thermal conductivity of electrons in the graphene nanoribbon, can be well controlled simultaneously by the phase difference of the superconducting leads. As a result, the thermal conductivity of electrons in the graphene nanoribbon can be tuned and a thermal switching effect appears. Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we verify this thermal switching effect numerically. At ambient temperatures less than about one tenth of the superconducting transition temperature, the thermal switching ratio can exceed 2000. The performance of the thermal switch can be regulated by the ambient temperature, and doping or gating can slightly increase the thermal switching ratio. The use of narrower graphene nanoribbons and wider superconducting leads facilitates the obtaining of larger thermal switching ratios. This switching effect of electronic thermal conductance in graphene is expected to be experimentally realized and applied.</description>

      <title>Broadband Optoelectronic Mixer for Terahertz Frequency-Comb Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate ultra-broadband optoelectronic mixing of frequency combs that provides phase-coherent detection of a repetition frequency up to 500 GHz, using a high-speed modified uni-traveling carrier (MUTC) photodiode. Nonlinear photo-electron effects in the photodiode itself enable harmonic generation and down-mixing process of combs with widely different repetition frequency. Specifically, we generate two, 25 GHz frequency combs and use an optical filter to explore coherent down-mixing to baseband of comb spectral components across microwave, millimeter wave, and terahertz (THz) frequencies. The exceptional noise performance of the optoelectronic mixer enables the phase-coherent measurement of millimeter-wave and THz frequency combs with an Allan deviation of 10^-13/t for a measurement time of t. We further investigate the dependence of conversion loss on the reverse bias voltage and photocurrent. The experimental results indicate that we can minimize the conversion loss by operating the photodiode at an optimal voltage and maximum available photocurrent. Our work provides a solution for millimeter-wave and THz frequency comb measurements and facilitates fully stabilized frequency combs with microresonators.</description>

      <title>Understanding Interfacial Ice Premelting: Structure, Adhesion and Nucleation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we perform a systematic computer simulation study of ice premelting, and explore the thickness and structure of quasi-liquid layers formed at the interface of ice with substrates of different hydrophilicity. Our study shows that interfacial premelting occurs on neutral substrates of whatever hydrophilicity, forming films of limited thickness for substrates with contact angles larger than ca. 50$^\circ$ but exhibiting complete interfacial premelting at smaller contact angles. Contrary to most experimental studies, we focus not only on the premelting behavior with temperature, but also with pressure, which is a matter of relevance in important situations such as ice friction. Our study is guided within a rigorous framework of surface thermodynamics, demonstrating that the premelting film structure is a function of a single thermodynamic variable. By this token we are able to relate properties measured along an isobar, with premelting films at arbitrary temperature and pressure. We also find that adhesion strength in atomically smooth surfaces is one to two orders of magnitude larger than those found in experiments, and conjecture that the reason is substrate roughness and the presence of organic adsorbents. Our theoretical framework also allows us to exploit our results on interfacial premelting in order to gain insight into heterogeneous ice nucleation. We show that apolar smooth substrates of whatever hydrophilicity are unlikely nucleators, and that too large hydrophilicity conspires also against ice nucleation. Furthermore, we exploit statistical-thermodynamic framework to shed light into the nature of the surface intermolecular forces promoting interfacial premelting, and provide a model to predict quasi-liquid layer thickness as a function of the substrate's hydrophilicity with great potential applications in fields ranging from earth sciences to aircraft engineering.</description>

      <title>Room temperature Multiferroicity and Magnetoelectric coupling in (1-x) BaTiO$_{3-}$(x) CaMnO$_3$ solid solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials with magnetoelectric coupling (MEC) between ferroic orders at room temperature are extremely important in modern technology and physics. BaTiO$_3$ is a robust ferroelectric in which several doping have led to MEC. However, often MEC depends on the amount of substitution. In a series of (1-x)BaTiO$_{3.}$(x)CaMnO$_3$ (x=0,0.03, 0.06, 0.09), MEC was only observed in (0.97)BaTiO$_{3.}$(0.03)CaMnO$_3$. The structural modifications with changing substitution reveal a reduced Ti-O-Ti angle for this sample which is the most ferromagnetic in nature. A mixed phase of tetragonal P4mm and hexagonal P6$_3$/mmc space groups of BaTiO$_3$ is observed in the substituted samples, with nominal contribution of the hexagonal phase for x=0.03. A valence state study using XPS and XANES reveals the presence of enhanced proportion of Mn3+ ions in the sample which support a Jahn-Teller distortion, thereby supporting the ferroelectricity for x=0.03. Indirect and direct evidences of MEC was obtained from magnetodielectric and magnetoelectric measurements. A magnetocapacitance of 0.4% was observed with a dc magnetic field of 4kOe at 10kHz, while magnetoelectric coupling coefficient, $\alpha_{\rm ME} \sim 88$ mVcm$^{-1}$Oe$^{-1}$ was obtained for dc magnetic field of 600 Oe and a 10Hz ac field of 40 Oe. Such MEC was not observed for higher substitution which emphasizes the sensitivity of the structural properties on substitution.</description>

      <title>$CdTe_{0.25}Se_{0.75}$ Quantum Dots as Efficient Room Temperature Single Photon Source for Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room temperature single photon sources (SPS) are crucial for developing the next generation quantum technologies. Quantum dots (QDs), recently, have been reported as promising materials as SPS at room temperature. By optimizing the single particle optical properties of a series of water-soluble, $CdTe_{x}Se_{1-x}$, here we provide an efficient SPS with increased single photon purity. The data revealed that second order photon correlation, $g^2(0)$ value decreases substantially from 0.21 in CdTe to 0.02 in $CdTe_{0.25}Se_{0.75}$ QDs. They also exhibited deterministic emissions with an increase in ON time exceeding 95% of the total time. This was accompanied by an increased photon count rate, substantially reduced blinking events, and extended single particle ON-time. The increased single photon emission in $CdTe_{x}Se_{1-x}$ is attributed to very fast electron trapping to dense trap states, which suppresses the multiexciton recombination.</description>

      <title>Magnetic levitation in the field of a rotating dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that two permanent magnets of fixed orientation will either always repel or attract one another regardless of the distance between them. However, if one magnet is rotated at sufficient speed, a stable position at a given equilibrium distance can exist for a second free magnet. The equilibrium is produced by magnetic forces alone, which are strong enough to maintain a levitating state under gravity. We show that a stable levitation can be obtained when the rotating magnet is tilted from the rotation axis, with no offset in its position. In this regime, the levitating magnet remains centered and its spinning rate remains negligible, while its magnetic moment precesses in synchronization with the driving magnet. We provide a physical explanation of the levitation through a model relying on static dipolar interactions between the two magnets and present experimental results which validate the proposed theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how growth of an oxide film will influence the deuterium recycling properties of Li on plasma facing surfaces. Lithium films on the walls or plasma-facing material surfaces of a fusion vacuum vessel improves plasma performance in part by removing residual impurity atoms from the plasma. Oxygen atoms, from residual water vapor or eroded oxide surfaces, are a prominent ubiquitous impurity that can create a layer of oxide on lithium films. The results of the work herein also indicate a possibility for determining the thickness of the oxide layer on such Li films by measuring the reflection probability of incident deuterium particles from the surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The neutralization process of an ion particle on a surface is key issue of the plasma-wall interaction (PWI). We investigated helium (He) ion injection onto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) simulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the process of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the time evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei simultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected $\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ on the surface are approximately 40 percent and 25 percent, respectively. The captured electrons by $\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s and 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some challenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.</description>

      <title>Ultrabroadband thin-film lithium tantalate modulator for high-speed communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The continuous growth of global data traffic over the past three decades, along with advances in disaggregated computing architectures, presents significant challenges for optical transceivers in communication networks and high-performance computing systems. Specifically, there is a growing need to significantly increase data rates while reducing energy consumption and cost. High-performance optical modulators based on materials such as InP, thin-film lithium niobate (LiNbO3), or plasmonics have been developed, with LiNbO3 excelling in high-speed and low-voltage modulation. Nonetheless, the widespread industrial adoption of thin film LiNbO3 remains compounded by the rather high cost of the underlying 'on insulator' substrates -- in sharp contrast to silicon photonics, which can benefit from strong synergies with high-volume applications in conventional microelectronics. Here, we demonstrate an integrated 110 GHz modulator using thin-film lithium tantalate (LiTaO3) -- a material platform that is already commercially used for millimeter-wave filters and that can hence build upon technological and economic synergies with existing high-volume applications to offer scalable low-cost manufacturing. We show that the LiTaO3 photonic integrated circuit based modulator can support 176 GBd PAM8 transmission at net data rates exceeding 400 Gbit/s. Moreover, we show that using silver electrodes can reduce microwave losses compared to previously employed gold electrodes. Our demonstration positions LiTaO3 modulator as a novel and highly promising integration platform for next-generation high-speed, energy-efficient, and cost-effective transceivers.</description>

Abstract: We present a 3D food printing (3DFP) method to create coiled structures, harnessing the liquid rope coiling effect as a rapid method of food printing with tunable fractural properties. By studying the printability and coil-forming ability of pea, carrot, and cookie dough inks, we identified optimal printing parameters to induce steady and controlled coiling, enabling the creation of coiled structures with tunable porosities using a single nozzle. Fracture profiles from post-processed coiled structures showed complex responses but presented direct correlations between the porosity and textural parameters, including hardness, brittleness, and initial stiffness. This study provides a foundation for the fabrication of coiled food structures using 3DFP and highlights its potential application in designing textural properties and a range of unique sensory experiences.</description>
