      <title>Predictability of viral load dynamics in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 through a model-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pipeline to evaluate the evolution of viral dynamics based on a new model-driven approach has been developed in the present study. The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics. We focus on viral load kinetics whose dynamical features are typically available in the symptomatic stage of the infection. Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province. The considered database refers to early-phase infections, whose viral load kinetics have not been affected by the mass vaccination policies in Italy.</description>

      <title>A modified Hegselmann-Krause model for interacting voters and political parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hegselmann--Krause model is a prototypical model for opinion dynamics. It models the stochastic time evolution of an agent's or voter's opinion in response to the opinion of other like-minded agents. The Hegselmann--Krause model only considers the opinions of voters; we extend it here by incorporating the dynamics of political parties which influence and are influenced by the voters. We show in numerical simulations for $1$- and $2$-dimensional opinion spaces that, as for the original Hegselmann--Krause model, the modified model exhibits opinion cluster formation as well as a phase transition from disagreement to consensus. We provide an analytical sufficient condition for the formation of unanimous consensus in which voters and parties collapse to the same point in opinion space in the deterministic case. Using mean-field theory, we further derive an approximation for the critical noise strength delineating consensus from non-consensus in the stochastically driven modified Hegselmann--Krause model. We compare our analytical findings with simulations of the modified Hegselmann--Krause model.</description>

      <title>Correlated Growth of Causal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16647v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this work, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically demonstrate that degree correlations emerge as a consequence of marginal dependencies on these correlations. Our theoretical predictions align quantitatively with empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</description>
