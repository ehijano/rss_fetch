      <title>Tropical balls, geodesics and honeycomb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of tropical balls in $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with the tropical metric introduced by Cohen, Gaubert and Quadrat, an additive form of Hilbert's projective metric. After defining the tropical length of rectifiable curves, we formulate tropical geodesics in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and then characterize compact tropically geodesic sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Next, we present several equivalent descriptions of the tropical unit ball: as a zonotope (Minkowski sum of tropical unit segments), via its tropical generating set, as a union of $n+1$ tropical unit hypercubes, and as the tropical geodesic hull of the tropical unit vectors. Finally, we give an explicit proof that translates of the tropical unit ball whose centers lie in a sublattice of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ form a facet-to-facet honeycomb tiling of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Avoiding configurations of small size in the square grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximum size of a subset of the $n \times n$ integer grid that does not contain specific geometric configurations, a variation of the classical problems initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Purdy. While extremal problems for 3-point patterns, such as collinear triples and right triangles are well-studied, the landscape for 4-point configurations in the grid remains less explored. In this paper, we survey the state-of-the-art regarding forbidden 3-point and 4-point configurations, including parallelograms, trapezoids, and concyclic sets. Furthermore, we prove new lower bounds for grid subsets avoiding rhombuses and kites. Specifically, by combining the probabilistic method with the arithmetic properties of Sidon sets, we show that the maximum size of a rhombus-free subset is $\Omega(n^{4/3}(\log n)^{-1/3})$. We also provide near-quadratic lower bounds for sets avoiding kites with axis-parallel diagonals using Behrend-type constructions and discuss implications for square-free sets. These results illustrate the strong interplay between discrete geometry and additive combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Linear extensions and directed clique counts via modular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting linear extensions is a fundamental problem in poset theory. It is known to be #P-complete, with polynomial-time formulas available in special cases. In this work, we develop new recursive formulas for counting linear extensions of posets whose modular partitions have particular structure. Specifically, we focus on posets whose incomparability graph has a modular partition with a skeleton that is a tree, a necklace of cliques, or a combination of both. The proofs are constructive and allow for the explicit generation of all linear extensions. We also discuss equivalent formulations of the problem in terms of permutations and directed graphs. The directed graph perspective is related to counting directed simplices in the directed flag complex of a digraph, with applications to understanding higher-order structure in neural circuits.</description>

      <title>New Perspectives On The Unimodality Of Domination Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The domination polynomial of a graph $G$ is given by $D(G,x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n} d_k(G)x^k$ where $d_k(G)$ records the number of $k$-element dominating sets in $G$. A conjecture of Alikhani and Peng asserts that these polynomials have unimodal coefficient sequences. We develop three complementary perspectives that strengthen existing tools for resolving the conjecture. First, we view dominating sets as transversals of the closed neighborhood hypergraph. Motivated by the relationship between the unimodality of a polynomial and its roots, we use this perspective to expand on known root phenomena for domination polynomials. In particular, we obtain a bound on the modulus of domination roots that is linear in the maximum degree of a graph, improving related exponential bounds of Bencs, Csikv\'{a}ri and Regts. The hypergraph viewpoint also yields explicit combinatorial formulas for top coefficients of $D(G,x)$, extending formulas in the literature and offering fruitful ground for combinatorial approaches to the unimodality conjecture. Second, we strengthen the coefficient-ratio method of Beaton and Brown. This includes tightening their inequalities, and combining a union bound for non-dominating $k$-element sets with an overlap correction based on spanning trees. This produces a new parameter $\tau_k(G)$ measuring maximal pairwise neighborhood overlap and yields an overlap-corrected sufficient criterion for unimodality. Third, we prove that the domination polynomial of threshold graphs are log-concave, and hence unimodal, by a planar network argument from total positivity. This offers a new tactic for resolving the unimodality of hereditary graph classes.</description>

      <title>Total Prime Labelings of Various Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A total prime labeling of a graph of order $n$ is an extension of a prime labeling in which we distinctly label the vertices and edges. The goal of the labeling is for adjacent vertex labels to be relatively prime, and for each vertex of degree at least two, the greatest common divisor of the labels on its incident edges is equal to 1. In this paper, we construct total prime labelings by extending known prime and minimum coprime labelings and by developing new constructions for various classes of graphs. In particular, we show that snakes, books, prisms, prime trees, certain families of windmills, and other families of graphs are total prime.</description>

      <title>Star Decompositions of a Cyclic Polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a set of vertices on a circumference in the plane. Let $E$ be a set of directed line segments linking two vertices of $V$. If $E$ forms a set of closed cycles and for all two adjacent edges $uv$ and $vw$, the vertices $u$, $v$, $w$ are arranged in anti-clockwise order, we call $P(V,E)$ a cyclic polygon. A star decomposition $\mathcal{S}$ of a cyclic polygon $P$ is a set of star polygons partitioning the region of $P$ with some additional diagonals. A star decomposition $\mathcal{S}$ is called maximal if there is no other star decomposition $\mathcal{S}'$ such that a set of diagonals of $\mathcal{S}$ is a proper subset of that of $\mathcal{S}'$.
  In this paper, it is shown that for any two maximal star decompositions $\mathcal{S}_1$ and $\mathcal{S}_2$ of a common cyclic polygon, $\mathcal{S}_1$ can be transformed into $\mathcal{S}_2$ by a finite sequence of diagonal flips. It is also shown that if a cyclic polygon $P$ admits a star decomposition, the number of diagonals contained in a maximal star decomposition of $P$ is $p - (n-2r)(n-2r-1)/2$, where $p$ is the number of all possible diagonals of $P$, $n$ is the number of vertices of $P$, and $r$ is the rotation number of $P$.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Submodular Functions over Hierarchical Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers submodular function minimization (SFM) restricted to a family of subsets. We show that SFM over complements of families with certain hierarchical structures can be solved in polynomial-time. This yields a polynomial-time algorithm for SFM over complements of various families, such as intersecting families, crossing families, and the unions of lattices. Moreover, this tractability result partially settles the open question posed by N\"agele, Sudakov, and Zenklusen on polynomial-solvability of SFM over the intersection of parity families. Furthermore, our tractability result implies that for a constant positive integer k, the k-th smallest value of a submodular function can be obtained in polynomial-time.</description>

      <title>Approval Ballot Triangles and Strict-Sense Ballots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a family of binary triangular arrays, called approval ballot triangles (ABTs), that are in bijection with totally symmetric self-complementary plane partitions (TSSCPPs). These triangles correspond to a ballot process in which voters select their collection of approved candidates rather than voting for a single person. We situate ABTs within the ballot problem literature and then show that a strict-sense ballot can be decomposed into a list of sequentially compatible ABTs.</description>

      <title>On the maximum density of a matrix and a transcendental Tur\'an-type density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the inducibility of $P_4$ in ordered monotone balanced bipartite graphs is $2/e^2$, establishing the smallest known graph with transcendental Tur\'an-type density. Moreover, the limit object is a binary graphon, so it generates a deterministic model. This is a special case of a more general framework addressed here -- the asymptotic maximum density of a constant matrix over an arbitrary symbol set, in a large, possibly monotone, matrix. We solve all $2 \times 2$ monotone cases (one of which corresponds to the aforementioned $P_4$) and all but one of the $2 \times 2$ unrestricted cases.
  While $(h!/h^h)^2$ is a lower bound for the asymptotic maximum density of an $h \times h$ matrix, we explicitly construct, for all $h \ge 1$, an $h \times h$ minimizer, i.e., a matrix for which this bound is attained. We also sketch how known results on the inducibility of graphs can be modified to show that, as $h$ grows, almost all $h \times h$ $0/1$ matrices are minimizers.</description>

      <title>Decomposing Determinantal Varieties from Statistics via Matroid Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study determinantal varieties from conditional independence models with hidden variables, focusing on their irreducible decompositions, dimensions, degrees, and Gr\"obner bases. Each variety encodes a collection of matroids, whose flats capture algebraic dependencies among variables. Using this approach, we provide a systematic description of the components, their dimensions, and defining equations, and introduce a combinatorial framework for computing the degree of the determinantal variety. Our approach highlights the central role of matroidal structures in the study of determinantal varieties and extends beyond the reach of current computational techniques.</description>

      <title>Upper Bounds on Covering Minima of Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two new upper bounds on the covering minima of convex bodies, depending on covering minima of certain projections and intersections with linear subspaces. We show one bound to be sharp for direct sums of two convex bodies, generalizing previous results on the covering radius and lattice width of direct sums. We apply our results to standard terminal simplices, reducing the gap between the upper and lower bounds in a conjecture of Gonzal\'ez Merino and Schymura (2017), which gives insight on a conjecture of Codenotti, Santos and Schymura (2021) on the maximal covering radius of a non-hollow lattice polytope.</description>

      <title>An update on multicolor Ramsey lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon previous works by Conlon-Ferber and Wigderson, Sawin showed a few years ago that upper bounds on the minimum density of independent sets in a $K_t$-free $G$ can be used to provide lower bounds for multicolor Ramsey numbers.
  In this note, we observe how a further improved upper bound on this parameter directly follows from a recent spherical random geometric graph construction of Ma-Shen-Xie. As a consequence, we derive a small exponential improvement over the best known lower bounds for multicolor Ramsey numbers.</description>

      <title>Coloring small locally sparse degenerate graphs and related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classic upper bound on the chromatic number of $d$-degenerate graphs is $d+1$, shown to be tight by complete graphs. A natural question is whether this bound remains tight if one forbids large cliques. Classic constructions of Tutte and Zykov from the early 50s show that there exist $d$-degenerate $(d+1)$-chromatic graphs that are triangle-free, however these constructions grow rapidly with $d$. Motivated by this and addressing a problem posed by the second author at the Oberwolfach Graph Theory workshop, we prove that the minimum order $f(d)$ of a $d$-degenerate triangle-free graph of chromatic number $d+1$ satisfies $e^{\Omega(d)}\le f(d)\le e^{O(d^2\log d)}.$ The lower bound follows from a novel upper bound on the chromatic number of triangle-free graphs: Every triangle-free $d$-degenerate graph $G$ on $n \le e^{O(d)}$ vertices satisfies $$\chi(G)\le O\left(\frac{d}{\log\left(d/\log n\right)}\right).$$ We extend this to a more general result about degenerate graphs with sparse neighborhoods, which has applications to many graph coloring problems: For example, we prove that every counterexample to Hadwiger's conjecture with parameter $t$ must have a complete bipartite subgraph with one exponentially large side ($K_{a,b}$ where $a=(\log t)^{1/2-o(1)}$ and $b=e^{t^{1-o(1)}}$) or a small and very dense subgraph (of order $\le t$ with $t^{2-o(1)}$ edges) in some neighborhood.
  For the upper bound on $f(d)$ we establish a surprising connection between $f(d)$ and the on-line-chromatic number $g(n)$ of $n$-vertex triangle-free graphs. We also give an asymptotic improvement of the previous best upper bound for $g(n)$ due to Lov\'{a}sz, Saks and Trotter from 1989.
  Along the way we disprove a generalization of Harris' fractional coloring conjecture to graphs of bounded clique number and raise numerous problems which open up interesting directions to explore for future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15276v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For distinct real numbers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and distinct real numbers $b_1, \ldots, b_n$, consider the sum $S=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_{\pi(i)}$ as $\pi$ ranges over the permutations of $[n]$. We show that this sum always assumes at least $\Omega(n^3)$ distinct values, which is optimal. This ``support'' bound complements recent work of Do, Nguyen, Phan, Tran, and Vu, and of Hunter, Pohoata, and Zhu on the anticoncentration properties of $S$ when $\pi$ is chosen uniformly at random.</description>

Abstract: A holographic entropy inequality (HEI) is a linear inequality obeyed by Ryu-Takayanagi holographic entanglement entropies, or equivalently by the minimum cut function on weighted graphs. We establish a new combinatorial framework for studying HEIs, and use it to prove several properties they share, including two majorization-related properties as well as a necessary and sufficient condition for an inequality to be an HEI. We thereby resolve all the conjectures presented in [arXiv:2508.21823], proving two of them and disproving the other two. In particular, we show that the null reduction of any superbalanced HEI passes the majorization test defined in [arXiv:2508.21823], thereby providing strong new evidence that all HEIs are obeyed in time-dependent holographic states.</description>

      <title>Fractal transference principles for subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$ of positive density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a multidimensional fractal transference principle for digit-restricted sets associated with subsets of $\mathbb{N}^d$, extending the one-dimensional framework of Nakajima--Takahasi, Adv. Math. (2025). We develop general Hausdorff-dimension tools via the singular value potential $\phi^s(\mathbf a)$ and the multivariate Dirichlet series $\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma}) =\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\prod_{j=1}^d a_j^{-\sigma_j}$. Let $s_\ast:=\inf\{s&gt;0:\sum_{\mathbf a\in S}\phi^s(\mathbf a)&lt;\infty\}$ and $\Lambda_S:=\inf\{\sigma_1+\cdots+\sigma_d:\zeta_S(\boldsymbol{\sigma})&lt;\infty\}$. We obtain $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)\le s_\ast$, where $\mathcal E_S\subset(0,1)^d$ denotes the set of points whose continued-fraction digit vectors lie in $S$ and whose coordinates escape (i.e.\ $a_n(x_j)\to\infty$ for each $j$), and $s_\ast=\tfrac12\Lambda_S$ for uniformly $K$--balanced $S$. In particular, if $S\subset\mathbb{N}^d$ has positive upper (or upper Banach) density then $\dim_H(\mathcal E_S)=d/2$. On the combinatorial side, the transference principle ensures that translation-invariant configurations forced at positive density, including multidimensional Szemer\'edi patterns, persist inside the induced fractal digit sets.</description>

      <title>Optimising Cylindrical Algebraic Coverings for use in SMT by Solving a Set Covering Problem with Reasons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Conflict-Driven Cylindrical Algebraic Covering algorithm has proven well suited for performing theory validation checks in the satisfiability modulo theories paradigm for non-linear real arithmetic. CDCAC repurposes the theory underpinning classical cylindrical algebraic decomposition for SMT solving and is implemented in the SMT solvers cvc5 and SMT-RAT, as well as the computer algebra system Maple. It was previously observed that when using cylindrical algebraic decomposition for an SMT theory call, the output can be optimised by solving a single set covering problem instance that minimises the conflict clause. In this paper we consider the corresponding optimisation for CDCAC and observe that CDCAC naturally gives rise to multiple such optimisations within a single call. Each time a covering is generalised in one dimension, the resulting cell in the next dimension is labelled with theory constraints that cannot be satisfied together. We seek the smallest subset of constraints whose union covers all labels from the cells in the current covering. We call this optimisation problem a set covering problem with reasons. To simplify this problem, we introduce a data reduction step that generalises Beasley reduction for the classical set covering problem and show that this step alone solves many of the instances arising from SMT-LIB benchmarks. We then propose an exact solver based on linear programming to efficiently solve the remaining cases. Integrating these techniques into CDCAC has the potential to significantly improve SMT solver performance for non-linear real arithmetic problems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-pq$ for distinct primes $q&gt;p\geq 5$. This together with previous classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-2p,-3p$ and $-p^2$ completes the classification of regular maps with Euler characteristic $-pq$ for two primes $p$ and $q$. An interesting consequence is that, for every pair of twin primes $p$ and $q$ greater than $5$, there exist three regular maps with solvable automorphism groups and Euler characteristic $-pq$, up to duality and isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Random infinite ideal angled graphs and ideal hyperbolic polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to develop the uniformization and boundary theory of random infinite ideal hyperbolic polyhedra (abbr. IHP) and their dual 1-skeleton, i.e., ideal angled graphs (abbr. IAG) from multiple perspectives, including combinatorics, geometry, analysis and random walks. For unimodular random IAG, we establish an ICP analog of the dichotomy theorem of Angel-Hutchcroft-Nachmias-Ray [4,5]. Specifically, the character $T(\rho):=\sum_{e\ni\rho}\Theta_e$ of an IAG, introduced in [40], determines its ICP type: the graph is a.s. ICP-parabolic if and only if $\mathbb{E}[T(\rho)]=2\pi$. In the ICP-hyperbolic case, the simple random walk converges a.s. to $\partial\mathbb{D}$ with positive hyperbolic speed. Moreover, the geometric, Poisson, Martin, and Gromov boundaries coincide, extending the boundary theory of Angel-Barlow-Gurevich-Nachmias [3] and Hutchcroft-Peres [37] beyond triangulations to cellular decompositions. As a corollary of the aforementioned IHP/IAG duality, we obtain the systematic characterizations of the random IHP. To develop our theory, we strengthen and refine the Ring Lemma of Ge-Yu-Zhou [27] for ICP, which provides quantitative local control of the packing geometry. This key estimate makes it possible to extend the boundary theory beyond triangulations.</description>

      <title>Fractional Diffusion on Graphs: Superposition of Laplacian Semigroups and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subdiffusion on graphs is often modeled by time-fractional diffusion equations, yet its structural and dynamical consequences remain unclear. We show that subdiffusive transport on graphs is a memory-driven process generated by a random time change that compresses operational time, produces long-tailed waiting times, and breaks Markovianity while preserving linearity and mass conservation. We prove that Mittag-Leffler graph dynamics admit an exact convex, mass-preserving representation as a superposition of classical heat semigroups evaluated at rescaled times, revealing fractional diffusion as ordinary diffusion acting across multiple intrinsic time scales. This framework uncovers heterogeneous, vertex-dependent memory effects and induces transport biases absent in classical diffusion, including algebraic relaxation, degree-dependent waiting times, and early-time asymmetries between sources and neighbors. These features define a subdiffusive geometry on graphs enabling particles to locally discover global shortest paths while favoring high-degree regions. Finally, we show that time-fractional diffusion arises as a singular limit of multi-rate diffusion.</description>

      <title>A height-based metaconcept for rooted tree balance and its implications for the $B_1$ index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree balance has received considerable attention in recent years, both in phylogenetics and in other areas. Numerous (im)balance indices have been proposed to quantify the (im)balance of rooted trees. A recent comprehensive survey summarized this literature and showed that many existing indices are based on similar underlying principles. To unify these approaches, three general metaconcepts were introduced, providing a framework to classify, analyze, and extend imbalance indices. In this context, a metaconcept is a function $\Phi_f$ that depends on another function $f$ capturing some aspect of tree shape. In this manuscript, we extend this line of research by introducing a new metaconcept based on the heights of the pending subtrees of all inner vertices. We provide a thorough analysis of this metaconcept and use it to answer open questions concerning the well-known $B_1$ balance index. In particular, we characterize the tree shapes that maximize the $B_1$ index in two cases: (i) arbitrary rooted trees and (ii) binary rooted trees. For both cases, we also determine the corresponding maximum values of the index.
  Finally, while the $B_1$ index is induced by a so-called third-order metaconcept, we explicitly introduce three new (im)balance indices derived from the first- and second-order height metaconcepts, respectively, thereby demonstrating that pending subtree heights give rise to a variety of novel (im)balance indices.</description>

      <title>Koszul Binomial Edge Ideals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the binomial edge ideal of a graph is always generated by homogeneous quadratic polynomials corresponding to the edges of the graph, the question of when a binomial edge ideal defines a Koszul algebra has been studied by many authors ever since the class of ideals was first defined. Several partial results are known, including a characterization of those binomial edge ideals that possess a quadratic Gr\"obner basis. However, a complete characterization of the graphs determining Koszul binomial edge ideals has remained elusive. Inspired by our recent work characterizing when the graded M\"obius algebras of graphic matroids are Koszul, we answer the question once and for all by proving that a graph defines a Koszul binomial edge ideal if and only if it is strongly chordal and claw-free.</description>

Abstract: Using PET and quantitative concatenation techniques, we establish box-norm control with the "expected" directions for counting operators for general multidimensional polynomial progressions, with at most polynomial losses in the parameters. Such results are often useful first steps towards obtaining explicit upper bounds on sets lacking instances of given such progressions. In the companion paper arXiv:2407.08637, we complete this program for sets in $[N]^2$ lacking nondegenerate progressions of the form $(x, y), (x + P(z), y), (x, y + P(z))$, where $P \in \mathbb{Z}[z]$ is any fixed polynomial with an integer root of multiplicity $1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $r$-colour Ramsey number $R_r(k)$ is the minimum $n \in \mathbb{N}$ such that every $r$-colouring of the edges of the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices contains a monochromatic copy of $K_k$. We prove, for each fixed $r \geqslant 2$, that $$R_r(k) \leqslant e^{-\delta k} r^{rk}$$ for some constant $\delta = \delta(r) &gt; 0$ and all sufficiently large $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For each $r \geqslant 3$, this is the first exponential improvement over the upper bound of Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres from 1935. In the case $r = 2$, it gives a different (and significantly shorter) proof of a recent result of Campos, Griffiths, Morris and Sahasrabudhe.</description>

Abstract: We develop novel methods for constructing nearly Hamilton cycles in sublinear expanders with good regularity properties, as well as new techniques for finding such expanders in general graphs. These methods are of independent interest due to their potential for various applications to embedding problems in sparse graphs. In particular, using these tools, we make substantial progress towards a twenty-year-old conjecture of Verstra\"ete, which asserts that for any given graph $F$, nearly all vertices of every $d$-regular graph $G$ can be covered by vertex-disjoint $F$-subdivisions. This significantly extends previous work on the conjecture by Kelmans, Mubayi and Sudakov, Alon, and K\"uhn and Osthus. Additionally, we present applications of our methods to two other problems.</description>

      <title>Tie-breaking in self interest cumulative subtraction games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subtraction games have a rich literature as normal-play combinatorial games (e.g., Berlekamp, Conway, and Guy, 1982). Recently, the theory has been extended to zero-sum scoring play (Cohensius et al. 2019). Here, we take the approach of cumulative self-interest games, as introduced in a recent framework preprint by Larsson, Meir, and Zick. By adapting standard Pure Subgame Perfect Equilibria (PSPE) from classical game theory, players must declare and commit to acting either ``friendly'' or ``antagonistic'' in case of indifference. Whenever the subtraction set has size two, we establish a tie-breaking rule monotonicity: a friendly player can never benefit by a deterministic deviation to antagonistic play. This type of terminology is new to both ``economic'' and ``combinatorial'' games, but it becomes essential in the self-interest cumulative setting. The main result is an immediate consequence of the tie-breaking rule's monotonicity; in the case of two-action subtraction sets, two antagonistic players are never better off than two friendly players, i.e., their PSPE utilities are never greater. For larger subtraction sets, we conjecture that the main result continues to hold, while tie-breaking monotonicity may fail, and we provide empirical evidence in support of both statements.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjectured spectral upper bound on the chromatic number of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges with chromatic number $\chi$, and let $\lambda_n$ denote the least adjacency eigenvalue. Solving a conjecture of Fan, Yu and Wang~[Electron. J. Combin., 2012], we prove that when $3\le \chi\le n-1$, the chromatic number satisfies the following upper bound: $$ \chi \le \left(\frac{n}{2}+1+\lambda_n\right) + \sqrt{\left(\frac{n}{2}+1+\lambda_n\right)^{2}-4(\lambda_n+1)\left(\lambda_n+\frac{n}{2}\right)}, $$ with equality if and only if $G \cong \left(K_{\frac{\chi}{2}}\cup\tfrac{n-\chi}{2}K_1\right) \vee \left(K_{\frac{\chi}{2}}\cup\tfrac{n-\chi}{2}K_1\right)$, where both $n$ and $\chi$ are even. This extends the validity of the Fan--Yu--Wang bound from the range $3\le \chi\le \frac{n}{2}$ to the full range $3\le \chi\le n-1$.
  We also compare this bound with the well-known bound due to Wilf that $\chi \le 1 + \lambda_1$, where $\lambda_1$ denotes the largest eigenvalue. In particular we show that while Wilf's bound is an upper bound for some parameters larger than $\chi$, this bound using $\lambda_n$ is not an upper bound for these parameters. We conclude with a similar conjectured upper bound for $\chi(G)$, which uses $m$ in place of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following Ramsey-theoretic question: given a $q$-coloring of the edges of a tournament, how long of a directed path can we guarantee whose edges avoid one of the colors? Questions of this type have applications in many areas, such as vector sequences, convex geometry, and extremal hypergraph theory, and have been extensively studied over the past 50 years.
  We prove that if $\varepsilon&gt;0$ is fixed and $q$ is sufficiently large, then every $q$-edge-colored $N$-vertex tournament contains a color-avoiding directed path of length $N^{1-\varepsilon}$. This answers a question of Gowers and Long, strengthens several of their results, and extends earlier work of Loh.</description>

We study the bipartite Tur\'an problem restricted to cographs: for fixed integers $s \leq t$, what is the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex cograph that does not contain $K_{s,t}$ as a subgraph? This problem falls within the framework of induced Tur\'an numbers $\text{ex}(n, \{K_{s,t}, P_4\text{-ind}\})$ introduced by Loh, Tait, Timmons, and Zhou.
  Our main result is a Pumping Theorem: for every $s\le t$ there exists a period $R$ and core cographs such that for all sufficiently large $n$ an extremal cograph is obtained by repeatedly pumping one designated pumping component inside the appropriate core (depending on $n\bmod R$). We determine the linear coefficient of $\text{ex}(n, \{K_{s,t}, P_4\text{-ind}\})$ to be $s-1 + \frac{t-1}{2}$. Moreover, the pumping components are $(t-1)$-regular and have $s-1$ common neighbours in the respecitve core graphs, giving the extremal cographs a particularly rigid extremal star-like shape.
  Motivated by the rarity of complete classification of extremal configurations, we completely classify all $K_{3,3}$-free extremal cographs by proof. We also develop a dynamic programming algorithm for enumerating extremal cographs for small $n$.</description>

      <title>Generalizing two families of scattered quadrinomials in $\mathbb{F}_{q^{2t}}[X]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, several efforts have focused on identifying new families of scattered polynomials. Currently, only three families in $\mathbb{F}_{q^n}[X]$ are known to exist for infinitely many values of $n$ and $q$: (i) pseudoregulus-type monomials, (ii) Lunardon-Polverino-type binomials, and (iii) a family of quadrinomials studied in a series of papers. In this work, we provide sufficient conditions under which these quadrinomials, denoted by $\psi_{m,h,s}$, are scattered. Our results both include and generalize those obtained in previous studies. We also investigate the equivalences between the previously known families of scattered polynomials and those in this new class.</description>

      <title>On Some Properties of Matrices with Entries Defined by Products of $k$-Fibonacci and $k$-Lucas Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a structured family of matrices whose entries are given by products of $k$-Fibonacci and $k$-Lucas numbers. For this family, we obtain explicit and unified formulas for several classical matrix invariants, including the determinant, inverse, trace, and matrix powers, revealing nontrivial algebraic patterns induced by the underlying recurrence relations. In addition, we determine the spectral radius and the energy of the graphs naturally associated with these matrices. Finally, we establish connections between the resulting formulas and certain integer sequences recorded in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS).</description>

      <title>On the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A bi-Cayley graph over a cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ is called a bicirculant graph. Let
  $\Gamma=BC(\mathbb{Z}_n; R,T,S)$ be a bicirculant graph with $R=R^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $T=T^{-1}\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$. In this paper, using Chebyshev polynomials, we obtain a closed formula
  for the number of spanning trees of bicirculant graph $\Gamma$, investigate some arithmetic properties of the number of spanning trees of $\Gamma$, and find its asymptotic behaviour as $n$ tends infinity. In addition,
  we show that $F(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\tau(\Gamma)x^n$ is a rational function with integer coefficients.</description>

      <title>Positroid Links and Braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.13948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study braid varieties and their relation to open positroid varieties. We discuss four different types of braids associated to open positroid strata and show that their associated Legendrian links are all Legendrian isotopic. In particular, we prove that each open positroid stratum can be presented as the augmentation variety for four different Legendrian fronts described in terms of either permutations, juggling patterns, cyclic rank matrices or Le diagrams. We also relate braid varieties to open Richardson varieties and brick manifolds, showing that the latter provide projective compactifications of braid varieties, with normal crossing divisors at infinity.</description>
