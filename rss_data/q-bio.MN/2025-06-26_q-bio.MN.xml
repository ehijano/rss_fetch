      <title>GPU-accelerated Modeling of Biological Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complex regulatory dynamics of a biological network can be succinctly captured using discrete logic models. Given even sparse time-course data from the system of interest, previous work has shown that global optimization schemes are suitable for proposing logic models that explain the data and make predictions about how the system will behave under varying conditions. Considering the large scale of the parameter search spaces associated with these regulatory systems, performance optimizations on the level of both hardware and software are necessary for making this a practical tool for in silico pharmaceutical research. We show here how the implementation of these global optimization algorithms in a GPU-computing environment can accelerate the solution of these parameter search problems considerably. We carry out parameter searches on two model biological regulatory systems that represent almost an order of magnitude scale-up in complexity, and we find the gains in efficiency from GPU to be a 33%-43% improvement compared to multi-thread CPU implementations and a 33%-1866% increase compared to CPU in serial. These improvements make global optimization of logic model identification a far more attractive and feasible method for in silico hypothesis generation and design of experiments.</description>

      <title>ProCaliper: functional and structural analysis, visualization, and annotation of proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding protein function at the molecular level requires connecting residue-level annotations with physical and structural properties. This can be cumbersome and error-prone when functional annotation, computation of physico-chemical properties, and structure visualization are separated. To address this, we introduce ProCaliper, an open-source Python library for computing and visualizing physico-chemical properties of proteins. It can retrieve annotation and structure data from UniProt and AlphaFold databases, compute residue-level properties such as charge, solvent accessibility, and protonation state, and interactively visualize the results of these computations along with user-supplied residue-level data. Additionally, ProCaliper incorporates functional and structural information to construct and optionally sparsify networks that encode the distance between residues and/or annotated functional sites or regions. The package ProCaliper and its source code, along with the code used to generate the figures in this manuscript, are freely available at https://github.com/PNNL-Predictive-Phenomics/ProCaliper.</description>

      <title>Quantifying cellular autonomy in multi-cue environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cell routinely responds to one of many competing environmental cues. A fundamental question is whether the cell follows the cue prioritized by its internal signaling network or the cue that carries the most external information. We introduce a theoretical framework to answer this question. We derive information limits for four types of directional cues: external and self-generated chemical gradients, fluid flow, and contact inhibition of locomotion. When the cues compete as pairs, these limits predict which cue a cell should follow if its decision is based on environmental information alone. We compare these predicted decision boundaries with data from our and others' cell migration experiments, finding cases where the boundary is obeyed and cases where it is violated by orders of magnitude. Both outcomes are informative, and we find that they rationalize known properties, or predict putative properties, of cells' internal signaling networks. Our work introduces a physical framework to quantify the degree to which a cell acts like an autonomous agent, rather than a passive detector, favoring a cue even when it is less informative.</description>
