      <title>An evolutionary medicine and life history perspective on aging and disease: Trade-offs, hyperfunction, and mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise in chronic diseases over the last century presents a significant health and economic burden globally. Here we apply evolutionary medicine and life history theory to better understand their development. We highlight an imbalanced metabolic axis of growth and proliferation (anabolic) versus maintenance and dormancy (catabolic), focusing on major mechanisms including IGF-1, mTOR, AMPK, and Klotho. We also relate this axis to the hyperfunction theory of aging, which similarly implicates anabolic mechanisms like mTOR in aging and disease. Next, we highlight the Brain-Body Energy Conservation model, which connects the hyperfunction theory with energetic trade-offs that induce hypofunction and catabolic health risks like impaired immunity. Finally, we discuss how modern environmental mismatches exacerbate this process. Following our review, we discuss future research directions to better understand health risk. This includes studying IGF-1, mTOR, AMPK, and Klotho and how they relate to health and aging in human subsistence populations, including with lifestyle shifts. It also includes understanding their role in the developmental origins of health and disease as well as the social determinants of health disparities. Further, we discuss the need for future studies on exceptionally long-lived species to understand potentially underappreciated trade-offs and costs that come with their longevity. We close with considering possible implications for therapeutics, including (1) compensatory pathways counteracting treatments, (2) a Goldilocks zone, in which suppressing anabolic metabolism too far introduces catabolic health risks, and (3) species constraints, in which therapeutics tested in shorter lived species with greater anabolic imbalance will be less effective in humans.</description>

      <title>Enhancing U.S. swine farm preparedness for infectious foreign animal diseases with rapid access to biosecurity information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The U.S. launched the Secure Pork Supply (SPS) Plan for Continuity of Business, a voluntary program providing foreign animal disease (FAD) guidance and setting biosecurity standards to maintain business continuity amid FAD outbreaks. The role of biosecurity in disease prevention is well recognized, yet the U.S. swine industry lacks knowledge of individual farm biosecurity plans and the efficacy of existing measures. We describe a multi-sector initiative that formed the Rapid Access Biosecurity (RAB) app consortium with the swine industry, government, and academia. We (i) summarized 7,625 farms using RABapp, (ii) mapped U.S. commercial swine coverage and areas of limited biosecurity, and (iii) examined associations between biosecurity and occurrences of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV).
  RABapp, used in 31 states, covers ~47% of U.S. commercial swine. Of 307 Agricultural Statistics Districts with swine, 78% (238) had &lt;50% of those animals in RABapp. We used a mixed-effects logistic regression model, accounting for production company and farm type (breeding vs. non-breeding). Requiring footwear/clothing changes, having multiple carcass disposal locations, hosting other businesses, and greater distance to swine farms reduced infection odds. Rendering carcasses, manure pit storage or land application, multiple perimeter buffer areas, and a larger animal housing area increased risk. This study leveraged RABapp to assess U.S. swine farm biosecurity, revealing gaps in SPS plan adoption that create vulnerable regions. Some biosecurity practices (e.g., footwear changes) lowered PRRSV/PEDV risk, while certain disposal and manure practices increased it. Targeted biosecurity measures and broader RABapp adoption can bolster industry resilience against foreign animal diseases.</description>

      <title>Failure and Success in Single-Drug Control of Antimicrobial Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a mathematical model of Antimicrobial Resistance in the host to predict the failure of two antagonists of bacterial growth: the immune response and a single-antibiotic therapy. After characterising the initial bacterial load that cannot be cleared by the immune system alone, we define the success set of initial conditions for which an infection-free equilibrium can be reached by a viable single-antibiotic therapy, and we provide a rigorously defined inner approximation of the set. Finally, we propose an optimal control approach to design and compare successful single-drug therapies.</description>

      <title>Can genomic analysis actually estimate past population size?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomic data can be used to reconstruct population size over thousands of generations, using a new class of algorithms (SMC methods). These analyses often show a recent decline in $N_e$ (effective size), which at face value implies a conservation or demographic crisis: a population crash and loss of genetic diversity. This interpretation is frequently mistaken. Here we outline how SMC methods work, why they generate this misleading signal, and suggest simple approaches for exploiting the rich information produced by these algorithms. In most species, genomic patterns reflect major changes in the species' range and subdivision over tens or hundreds of thousands of years. Consequently, collaboration between geneticists, palaeoecologists, palaeoclimatologists, and geologists is crucial for evaluating the outputs of SMC algorithms.</description>

      <title>Impact of network assortativity on disease lifetime in the SIS model of epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To accurately represent disease spread, epidemiological models must account for the complex network topology and contact heterogeneity. Traditionally, most studies have used random heterogeneous networks, which ignore correlations between the nodes' degrees. Yet, many real-world networks exhibit degree assortativity - the tendency for nodes with similar degrees to connect. Here we explore the effect degree assortativity (or disassortativity) has on long-term dynamics and disease extinction in the realm of the susceptible-infected-susceptible model on heterogeneous networks. We derive analytical results for the mean time to extinction (MTE) in assortative networks with weak heterogeneity, and show that increased assortativity reduces the MTE and that assortativity and degree heterogeneity are interchangeable with regard to their impact on the MTE. Our analytical results are verified using the weighted ensemble numerical method, on both synthetic and real-world networks. Notably, this method allows us to go beyond the capabilities of traditional numerical tools, enabling us to study rare events in large assortative networks, which were previously inaccessible.</description>

      <title>A geometric analysis of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect in an economic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a fast-slow version of the Bazykin-Berezovskaya predator-prey model with Allee effect evolving on two timescales, through the lenses of Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (GSPT). The system we consider is in non-standard form. We completely characterize its dynamics, providing explicit threshold quantities to distinguish between a rich variety of possible asymptotic behaviors. Moreover, we propose numerical results to illustrate our findings. Lastly, we comment on the real-world interpretation of these results, in an economic framework and in the context of predator-prey models.</description>

      <title>Inferring genotype-phenotype maps using attention models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting phenotype from genotype is a central challenge in genetics. Traditional approaches in quantitative genetics typically analyze this problem using methods based on linear regression. These methods generally assume that the genetic architecture of complex traits can be parameterized in terms of an additive model, where the effects of loci are independent, plus (in some cases) pairwise epistatic interactions between loci. However, these models struggle to analyze more complex patterns of epistasis or subtle gene-environment interactions. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly attention-based models, offer a promising alternative. Initially developed for natural language processing, attention-based models excel at capturing context-dependent interactions and have shown exceptional performance in predicting protein structure and function. Here, we apply attention-based models to quantitative genetics. We analyze the performance of this attention-based approach in predicting phenotype from genotype using simulated data across a range of models with increasing epistatic complexity, and using experimental data from a recent quantitative trait locus mapping study in budding yeast. We find that our model demonstrates superior out-of-sample predictions in epistatic regimes compared to standard methods. We also explore a more general multi-environment attention-based model to jointly analyze genotype-phenotype maps across multiple environments and show that such architectures can be used for "transfer learning" - predicting phenotypes in novel environments with limited training data.</description>

      <title>Dynamical stability of evolutionarily stable strategy in asymmetric games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) is the defining concept of evolutionary game theory. It has a fairly unanimously accepted definition for the case of symmetric games which are played in a homogeneous population where all individuals are in same role. However, in asymmetric games, which are played in a population with multiple subpopulations (each of which has individuals in one particular role), situation is not as clear. Various generalizations of ESS defined for such cases differ in how they correspond to fixed points of replicator equation which models evolutionary dynamics of frequencies of strategies in the population. Moreover, some of the definitions may even be equivalent, and hence, redundant in the scheme of things. Along with reporting some new results, this paper is partly indented as a contextual mini-review of some of the most important definitions of ESS in asymmetric games. We present the definitions coherently and scrutinize them closely while establishing equivalences -- some of them hitherto unreported -- between them wherever possible. Since it is desirable that a definition of ESS should correspond to asymptotically stable fixed points of replicator dynamics, we bring forward the connections between various definitions and their dynamical stabilities. Furthermore, we find the use of principle of relative entropy to gain information-theoretic insights into the concept of ESS in asymmetric games, thereby establishing a three-fold connection between game theory, dynamical system theory, and information theory in this context. We discuss our conclusions also in the backdrop of asymmetric hypermatrix games where more than two individuals interact simultaneously in the course of getting payoffs.</description>

      <title>Optimization hardness constrains ecological transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. In high-dimensional biological networks like ecosystems, long transients arise from the separate timescales of interactions within versus among subcommunities. Here, we use tools from computational complexity theory to frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in an ecosystem produce difficult, ill-conditioned problems, which physically manifest as transient chaos. We find that the recent success of dimensionality reduction methods in describing ecological dynamics arises due to preconditioning, in which fast relaxation decouples from slow solving timescales. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state species diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using scaling relations originally derived for numerical analysis of complex optimization problems. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Electrical networks and data analysis in phylogenetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A classic problem in data analysis is studying the systems of subsets defined by either a similarity or a dissimilarity function on $X$ which is either observed directly or derived from a data set. For an electrical network there are two functions on the set of the nodes defined by the resistance matrix and the response matrix either of which defines the network completely. We argue that these functions should be viewed as a similarity and a dissimilarity function on the set of the nodes moreover they are related via the covariance mapping also known as the Farris transform or the Gromov product. We will explore the properties of electrical networks from this point of view. It has been known for a while that the resistance matrix defines a metric on the nodes of the electrical networks. Moreover for a circular electrical network this metric obeys the Kalmanson property as it was shown recently. We will call such a metric an electrical Kalmanson metric. The main results of this paper is a complete description of the electrical Kalmanson metrics in the set of all Kalmanson metrics in terms of the geometry of the positive Isotropic Grassmannian whose connection to the theory of electrical networks was discovered earlier. One important area of applications where Kalmanson metrics are actively used is the theory of phylogenetic networks which are a generalization of phylogenetic trees. Our results allow us to use in phylogenetics the powerful methods of reconstruction of the minimal graphs of electrical networks and possibly open the door into data analysis for the methods of the theory of cluster algebras.</description>
