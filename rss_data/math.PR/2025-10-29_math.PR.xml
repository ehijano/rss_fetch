      <title>Computing extreme singular values of free operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent development in random matrix theory, the intrinsic freeness principle, establishes that the spectrum of very general random matrices behaves as that of an associated free operator. This reduces the study of such random matrices to the deterministic problem of computing spectral statistics of the free operator. In the self-adjoint case, the spectral edges of the free operator can be computed exactly by means of a variational formula due to Lehner. In this note, we provide variational formulas for the largest and smallest singular values in the non-self-adjoint case.</description>

      <title>Multiscale analysis of the conductivity in the mirrors model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the mirrors model in $d$ dimensions on an infinite slab and with unit density. This is a deterministic dynamics in a random environment. We argue that the crossing probability of the slab goes like $\kappa/(\kappa+N)$ where $N$ is the width of the slab. We are able to compute $\kappa$ perturbatively by using a multiscale approach. The only small parameter involved in the expansion is the inverse of the size of the system. This approach rests on an inductive process and a closure assumption adapted to the mirrors model. For $d=3$, we propose the recursive relation for the conductivity $\kappa_n$ at scale $n$ : $\kappa_{n+1}=\kappa_n(1+\frac{\kappa_n}{2^{n}}\alpha)$, up to $o(1/2^n)$ terms and with $\alpha\simeq 0.0374$. This sequence has a finite limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A stochastic Lie system on a manifold $M$ is a stochastic differential equation whose dynamics is described by a linear combination with functions depending on $\mathbb{R}^\ell$-valued semi-martigales of vector fields on $M$ spanning a finite-dimensional Lie algebra. We analyse new examples of stochastic Lie systems and Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems, and review and extend the coalgebra method for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. We apply the theory to biological and epidemiological models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Riccati equations, coronavirus models, stochastic Ermakov systems, etc.</description>

      <title>Denseness in total variation and the class of rational-infinitely divisible distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new class of so-called rational-infinitely (or quasi-infinitely) divisible probability laws on the real line. The characteristic functions of these distributions are ratios of the characteristic functions of classical infinitely divisible laws and they admit L\'evy--Khinchine type representations with ``signed spectral measures''. This class is rather wide and it has a lot of nice properties. For instance, this class is dense in the family of all (univariate) probability laws with respect to weak convergence. In this paper, we consider the questions concerning a denseness of this class with respect to convergence in total variation. The problem is considered separately for different types of probability laws taking into account the supports of the distributions. A series of ``positive'' and ``negative'' results are obtained.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of Markov shifts: part II-LLT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Local Central Limit Theorems (LLT) for partial sums of the form $S_n=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f_j(...,X_{j-1},X_j,X_{j+1},...)$, where $(X_j)$ is a Markov chains with equicontinuous conditional probabilities satisfying contraction conditions close in spirit to Dobrushin's, and some ``physicality" assumptions and $f_j$ are equicontinuous functions. Our conditions will always be in force when the chain takes values on a metric space and have uniformly bounded away from $0$ backward transition densities with respect to a measure which assigns uniform positive mass to certain ``balls".
  This paper complements \cite{MarShif1} where Berry-Esseen theorems, were proven for (not necessarily continuous) functions satisfying certain approximation conditions. Our results address a question posed by D. Dolgopyat and O. Sarig in \cite[Section 1.5]{DS}.</description>

      <title>On the effect of randomization on supercritical heat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, in \cite{glogic2025non}, it has been shown that the focusing power nonlinearity heat equation \begin{equation}\label{Eq:Heat_abstract}\tag{NLH}
  \partial_t u -\Delta u = |u|^{p-1}u, \quad p&gt;1, \end{equation} in dimensions $d \geq 3$ has non-unique local solutions in $L^q(\mathbb{R}^d)$ for $q &lt; d(p-1)/2$ provided that $p &lt; p_{JL}$, where $p_{JL}$ denotes the Joseph-Lundgren exponent. In this paper we investigate the effect of different randomizations on the well-posedness of the equation. First we show that adding a forcing term white in time and colored in space in \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} is not sufficient to improve the solution theory: namely, we prove non-uniqueness for local-in-time mild solutions of \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} with additive noise. Second, we discuss how randomizing the initial conditions of \eqref{Eq:Heat_abstract} affects its well-posedness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of the Fourier coefficients of Gaussian multiplicative chaos (GMC) recently initiated by Garban and Vargas. We show that the Fourier coefficients $c_n$ of critical GMC on the unit interval converge to zero in probability as the frequency $n$ tends to infinity, by establishing tightness for $\{(\log n)|c_n|\}_{n\geq 1}$.</description>

      <title>Non-coincidence of critical points for directed polymers on supercritical percolation clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the model of a directed polymer in a random environment defined on the infinite cluster of supercritical Bernoulli bond percolation in dimensions $d \geq 3$. For this model, it was proved in arXiv:2205.06206 that for almost every realization of the cluster, the polymer is in a strong disorder regime for any positive inverse temperature. Here, we show for almost every realization of the cluster the existence of a non-empty sub-phase of the strong disorder regime, consisting of positive inverse temperatures in which very strong disorder does not hold. This is in contrast to the recently established sharpness of the phase transition for the directed polymer on the full lattice, see arXiv:2402.02562, arXiv:2502.04113.</description>

      <title>Hard wall repulsion for the discrete Gaussian free field in random environment on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrete Gaussian free field (harmonic crystal) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 3$, with uniformly elliptic and bounded random conductances sampled according to a sufficiently mixing environment measure. We consider the hard wall event that the field is non-negative on the discrete blow-up of a bounded regular domain $V\subseteq\mathbb{R}^d$, and establish a quenched large deviation asymptotic for its probability. The asymptotic rate is characterized by the essential supremum of the on-site variances and the homogenized capacity of $V$, which arises from a quenched invariance principle. We then analyze the law of the field conditioned on the hard wall event. We determine the first-order asymptotic profile for its expectation and demonstrate that an entropic push-away of the field from the origin occurs. Furthermore, we characterize the field pathwise behavior under the constraint, showing that, when properly recentered, the field converges weakly to the (quenched) discrete Gaussian free field. A major challenge is the lack of translation invariance in the model. We exploit the superharmonicity of the conditioned expectation of the field to obtain a sharp uniform lower bound for it. We then use this bound to estimate the harmonicity defect of the conditioned expectation. This is a key step that allows us to prove a corresponding sharp upper bound and establish a pathwise entropic repulsion phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Recurrence, transience and anti-concentration of Rademacher random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rademacher random walk associated with a deterministic sequence $(a_n)_{n \geq 1}$ is the walk which starts at zero and, at step $i$, independently steps either up or down by $a_i$ with equal probability. We continue the study begun by Bhattacharya and Volkov in 2023 into the transience or recurrence of one-dimensional Rademacher random walks. In particular, we show that if the sequence of step sizes is bounded, the walk is weakly recurrent, meaning that it returns infinitely often to a random finite interval, while if the step sizes tend to infinity arbitrarily slowly the walk may be transient. On the other hand, we show that the step sizes may grow arbitrarily fast and still give a weakly recurrent random walk, and this is still true even if we restrict to non-decreasing step sizes. However, if $a_n = n^{\alpha + o(1)}$ for some $\alpha &gt; 1/2$, we show that the walk is transient. We also show that the bound on $\alpha$ is tight by giving an example where $a_n = \Theta(n^{1/2})$ and the walk is weakly recurrent.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion on spaces of discrete regular curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study Brownian motion on spaces of discrete regular curves in Euclidean space equipped with discrete Sobolev-type metrics. It has been established that these spaces of discrete regular curves are geodesically complete if and only if the Sobolev-type metric is of order two or higher. By relying on a general result by Grigor'yan and controlling the volume growth of geodesic balls, we show that all spaces of discrete regular curves that are geodesically complete are also stochastically complete, that is, the associated Brownian motion exists for all times. This provides a rigorous footing for performing data statistics, such as data inference and data imputation, on these spaces. Our result is the first stochastic completeness result in shape analysis that applies to the full shape space of interest. For illustrative purposes, we include simulations for sample paths of Brownian motion on spaces of discrete regular curves. For the space of triangles in the plane modulo rotation, translation and scaling, we further provide heuristics which suggest that this space remains stochastically complete even for Sobolev-type metrics of order zero and one.</description>

Abstract: The problem of estimating the probability of a random process reaching a certain level is well known. In this article, two-sided estimates are established for the probability that a regenerative process reaches a high level. Two auxiliary results for geometric sums with delay will play an important role. Examples of application to random processes describing queue lengths in queueing theory are also given.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Randomness, Exchangeability, and the Principal Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework uniting algorithmic randomness with exchangeable credences to address foundational questions in philosophy of probability and philosophy of science. To demonstrate its power, we show how one might use the framework to derive the Principal Principle -- the norm that rational credence should match known objective chance -- without circularity. The derivation brings together de Finetti's exchangeability, Martin-L\"of randomness, Lewis's and Skyrms's chance-credence norms, and statistical constraining laws (arXiv:2303.01411). Laws that constrain histories to algorithmically random sequences naturally pair with exchangeable credences encoding inductive symmetries. Using the de Finetti representation theorem, we show that this pairing directly entails the Principal Principle of this framework. We extend the proof to partial exchangeability and provide finite-history bounds that vanish in the infinite limit. The Principal Principle thus emerges as a mathematical consequence of the alignment between nomological constraints and inductive learning. This reveals how algorithmic randomness and exchangeability can illuminate foundational questions about chance, frequency, and rational belief.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study large deviations from the invariant measure for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with colored noises on determining modes. The proof is based on a new abstract criterion, inspired by [V. Jak\v{s}i\'{c} et al., Comm. Pure Appl. Math., 68 (2015), 2108-2143]. To address the difficulty caused by fixed squeezing rate, we introduce a bootstrap argument to derive Lipschitz estimates for Feynman-Kac semigroups. This criterion is also applicable to wave equations and Navier-Stokes system.</description>

Abstract: We consider random walks on a tree $G=(V,E)$ with stationary distribution $\pi_v = \mathrm{deg}(v)/2|E|$ for $v \in V$. Let the hitting time $H(v,w)$ denote the expected number of steps required for the random walk started at vertex $v$ to reach vertex $w$. We characterize the extremal tree structures for the best meeting time $T_{\mathrm{bestmeet}}(G) = \min_{w \in V} \sum_{v \in V} \pi_v H(v,w)$ for trees of order $n$ with diameter $d$. The best meeting time is maximized by the balanced double broom graph, and it is minimized by the balanced lever graph.</description>

      <title>Kemeny's constant minimization for reversible Markov chains via structure-preserving perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kemeny's constant measures the efficiency of a Markov chain in traversing its states. We investigate whether structure-preserving perturbations to the transition probabilities of a reversible Markov chain can improve its connectivity while maintaining a fixed stationary distribution. Although the minimum achievable value for Kemeny's constant can be estimated, the required perturbations may be infeasible. We reformulate the problem as an optimization task, focusing on solution existence and efficient algorithms, with an emphasis to the problem of minimizing Kemeny's constant under sparsity constraints.</description>

      <title>Attribute network models, stochastic approximation, and network sampling and ranking algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze dynamic random network models where younger vertices connect to older ones with probabilities proportional to their degrees as well as a propensity kernel governed by their attribute types. Using stochastic approximation techniques we show that, in the large network limit, such networks converge in the local weak sense to limiting infinite random trees with an explicit description in terms of randomly stopped multi-type branching processes. This allows for the derivation of asymptotics for a wide class of network functionals implying, for example, that while degree distribution tail exponents depend on the attribute type (already derived by Jordan (2013)), PageRank centrality scores have the same tail exponent across attributes. The limit results also give explicit formulae for the performance of various network sampling mechanisms. One surprising consequence is the efficacy of PageRank and walk based network sampling schemes for directed networks in the setting of rare minorities.</description>

      <title>Bicausal optimal transport for SDEs with irregular coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve constrained optimal transport problems in which the marginal laws are given by the laws of solutions of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). We consider SDEs with irregular coefficients, making only minimal regularity assumptions. We show that the so-called synchronous coupling is optimal among bicausal couplings, that is couplings that respect the flow of information encoded in the stochastic processes. Our results provide a method to numerically compute the adapted Wasserstein distance between laws of SDEs with irregular coefficients. We show that this can be applied to quantifying model uncertainty in stochastic optimisation problems. Moreover, we introduce a transformation-based semi-implicit numerical scheme and establish the first strong convergence result for SDEs with exponentially growing and discontinuous drift.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, uniform in time quantitative propagation of chaos in $L^1$-Wasserstein distance for mean field interacting particle system is derived, where the diffusion coefficient is allowed to be interacting and the drift is assumed to be partially dissipative. The main tool relies on reflection coupling, the gradient estimate of the decoupled SDEs, and the Duhamel formula for two semigroups associated to two time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes on $(\R^d)^N$.</description>

      <title>Network evolution with mesoscopic delay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Owing to the influence of real-world networks both in science and society, numerous mathematical models have been developed to understand the structure and evolution of these systems, particularly in a temporal context. Recent advancements in fields like distributed cyber-security and social networks have spurred the creation of probabilistic models of evolution, where individuals make decisions based on only partial information about the network's current state. This paper seeks to explore models incorporating network delay, where new participants receive information from a time-lagged snapshot of the system. In the context of mesoscopic network delays, we develop probabilistic tools built on stochastic approximation to understand asymptotics of both local functionals, such as local neighborhoods and degree distributions, as well as global properties, such as the evolution of the degree of the network's initial founder. A companion paper explores the regime of macroscopic delays in the evolution of the network.</description>

      <title>Size of chaos for Gibbs measures of mean field interacting diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate Gibbs measures for diffusive particles interacting through a two-body mean field energy. By identifying a gradient structure for the conditional law, we derive sharp bounds on the size of chaos, providing a quantitative characterization of particle independence. To handle interaction forces that are unbounded at infinity, we study the concentration of measure phenomenon for Gibbs measures via a defective Talagrand inequality, which may hold independent interest. Our approach provides a unified framework for both the flat semi-convex and displacement convex cases. Additionally, we establish sharp chaos bounds for the quartic Curie-Weiss model in the sub-critical regime, demonstrating the generality of this method.</description>

      <title>A two-size Wright--Fisher model: asymptotic analysis via uniform renewal theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a population with two types of individuals, distinguished by the resources required for reproduction: type-$0$ (small) individuals need a fractional resource unit of size $\vartheta \in (0,1)$, while type-$1$ (large) individuals require $1$ unit. The total available resource per generation is $R$. To form a new generation, individuals are sampled one by one, and if enough resources remain, they reproduce, adding their offspring to the next generation. The probability of sampling an individual whose offspring is small is $\rho_{R}(x)$, where $x$ is the proportion of small individuals in the current generation. We call this discrete-time stochastic model a two-size Wright--Fisher model, where the function $\rho_{R}$ can represent mutation and/or frequency-dependent selection. We show that on the evolutionary time scale, i.e. accelerating time by a factor $R$, the frequency process of type-$0$ individuals converges to the solution of a Wright--Fisher-type SDE. The drift term of that SDE accounts for the bias introduced by the function $\rho_{R}$ and the consumption strategy, the latter also inducing an additional multiplicative factor in the diffusion term. To prove this, the dynamics within each generation are viewed as a renewal process, with the population size corresponding to the first passage time $\tau(R)$ above level $R$. The proof relies on methods from renewal theory, in particular a uniform version of Blackwell's renewal theorem for binary, non-arithmetic random variables, established via $\varepsilon$-coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We first study crossing statistics in random connection models (RCM) built on marked Poisson point processes on $\mathbb R^d$. Under general assumptions, we show exponential tail bounds for the number of crossings of a box contained in the infinite cluster for supercritical intensity of the point process, and percolation in slabs, in analogy with the Grimmett-Marstrand theorem. We then present several applications to transport and diffusion phenomena. In particular, we prove the non-degeneracy of the effective homogenized matrix arising in the large-scale limit of random walks, exclusion processes, and resistor networks on the RCM, and the non-degeneracy of the effective diffusion constant for one-dimensional diffusion operators on the Euclidean graph associated with the RCM. As examples, we apply our results to Poisson-Boolean models and Mott variable range hopping random resistor network, providing a fundamental ingredient used in the derivation of Mott's law.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a spatial stochastic model for a pathogen population growing inside a host that attempts to eliminate the pathogens through its immune system. The pathogen population is divided into different types. A pathogen can either reproduce by generating a pathogen of its own type or produce a pathogen of a new type that does not yet exist in the population. Pathogens with living ancestral types are protected against the host's immune system as long as their progenitors are still alive. Each pathogen type without living ancestral types is eliminated by the immune system after a random period, independently of the other types. When a pathogen type is eliminated from the system, all pathogens of this type die simultaneously. In this paper, we determine the conditions on the set of model parameters that dictate the survival or extinction of the pathogen population when the dynamics unfold on graphs with an infinite tree structure.</description>

      <title>Representation of forward performance criteria with random endowment via FBSDE and its application to forward optimized certainty equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of forward performance criteria to settings with random endowment in incomplete markets. Building on these results, we introduce and develop the novel concept of \textit{forward optimized certainty equivalent (forward OCE)}, which offers a genuinely dynamic valuation mechanism that accommodates progressively adaptive market model updates, stochastic risk preferences, and incoming claims with arbitrary maturities.
  In parallel, we develop a new methodology to analyze the emerging stochastic optimization problems by directly studying the candidate optimal control processes for both the primal and dual problems. Specifically, we derive two new systems of forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) and establish necessary and sufficient conditions for optimality, and various equivalences between the two problems. This new approach is general and complements the existing one for forward performance criteria with random endowment based on backward stochastic partial differential equations (backward SPDEs) for the related value functions. We, also, consider representative examples for both forward performance criteria with random endowment and for forward OCE. Furthermore, for the case of exponential criteria, we investigate the connection between forward OCE and forward entropic risk measures.</description>

      <title>Boundary-preserving weak approximation for some semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a boundary-preserving numerical scheme for the weak approximation for some stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with bounded state-space. We impose regularity assumptions on the drift and diffusion coefficients only locally on the state-space. In particular, the drift and diffusion coefficients may be non-globally Lipschitz continuous and superlinearly growing. The scheme consists of a finite difference discretisation in space and a Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration in time. The proposed scheme converges in the weak sense of order $1/4$ in time and of order $1/2$ in space, for globally Lipschitz continuous test functions. We prove the weak convergence order in time by proving strong convergence towards a strong solution driven by a different noise process. The convergence order in space follows from known results. The boundary-preserving property is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the practical advantages of the proposed Lie--Trotter-Exact (LTE) scheme compared to existing schemes for SPDEs.</description>

Abstract: We find a large solution to a semilinear Dirichlet problem in a bounded $C^{1,1}$ domain for a non-local operator $\phi(-\Delta\vert_{D})$, an extension of the infinitesimal generator of a subordinate killed Brownian motion. The setting covers and extends the case of the spectral fractional Laplacian. The upper bound for the explosion rate of the large solution is obtained, and is given in terms of the renewal function, distance to the boundary, and the Keller-Osserman-type transformation of the nonlinearity. Additionally, we prove interior higher regularity results for this operator.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Limiting Spectral Distribution of High-dimensional Multivariate Kendall-$\tau$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multivariate Kendall-$\tau$ statistic, denoted by $K_n$, plays a significant role in robust statistical analysis. This paper establishes the limiting properties of the empirical spectral distribution (ESD) of $K_n$. We demonstrate that the ESD of $\frac{1}{2}pK_n$ converges almost surely to the Mar\v{c}enko--Pastur law with variance parameter $\frac{1}{2}$, analogous to the classical result for sample covariance matrices.
  Using Stieltjes transform techniques, we extend these results to the independent component model, deriving a fixed-point equation that characterizes the limiting spectral distribution of $\frac{1}{2}tr\Sigma K_n$. The theoretical findings are validated through comprehensive simulation studies.</description>
