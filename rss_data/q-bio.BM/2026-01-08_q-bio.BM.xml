      <title>Roadmap for Condensates in Cell Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates govern essential cellular processes yet elude description by traditional equilibrium models. This roadmap, distilled from structured discussions at a workshop and reflecting the consensus of its participants, clarifies key concepts for researchers, funding bodies, and journals. After unifying terminology that often separates disciplines, we outline the core physics of condensate formation, review their biological roles, and identify outstanding challenges in nonequilibrium theory, multiscale simulation, and quantitative in-cell measurements. We close with a forward-looking outlook to guide coordinated efforts toward predictive, experimentally anchored understanding and control of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Investigating Knowledge Distillation Through Neural Networks for Protein Binding Affinity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.</description>

      <title>Assessment of scoring functions for computational models of protein-protein interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16580v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A goal of computational studies of protein-protein interfaces (PPIs) is to predict the binding site between two monomers that form a heterodimer. The simplest version of this problem is to rigidly re-dock the bound forms of the monomers, which involves generating computational models of the heterodimer and then scoring them to determine the most native-like models. Scoring functions have been assessed previously using rank- and classification-based metrics, however, these methods are sensitive to the number and quality of models in the scoring function training set. We assess the accuracy of seven PPI scoring functions by comparing their scores to a measure of structural similarity to the x-ray crystal structure (i.e. the DockQ score) for a non-redundant set of heterodimers from the Protein Data Bank. For each heterodimer, we generate re-docked models uniformly sampled over DockQ and calculate the Spearman correlation between the PPI scores and DockQ. For some targets, the scores and DockQ are highly correlated; however, for many targets, there are weak correlations. Several physical features can explain the difference between difficult- and easy-to-score targets. For example, strong correlations exist between the score and DockQ for targets with highly intertwined monomers and many interface contacts. We also develop a new score based on only three physical features that matches or exceeds the performance of current PPI scoring functions. These results emphasize that PPI prediction can be improved by focusing on correlations between the PPI score and DockQ and incorporating more discriminating physical features into PPI scoring functions.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Computational Intelligence Framework with Metaheuristic Optimization for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score (RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance, studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.</description>
