      <title>Generalized diffusion process with nonlocal interactions: Continuous time random walk model and stochastic resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A space fractional diffusion-like equation is introduced, which embodies the nonlocality in time, represented by the memory kernel and the non-locality in space. A specific example of the nonlocal term is considered in combination with three different forms of the memory kernel. To analyse the probability density function, we utilize the subordination approach. Subsequently, the corresponding continuous time random walk model is presented. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of the stochastic resetting on the dynamics of the process and we showed that in the long time limit the system approaches a nonequilibrium stationary state.</description>

      <title>Topological Invariants in Invasion Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on bond percolation theory, a method is presented here to calculate the relationship between capillary pressure and saturation in porous media from first principles. The governing equations are formulated on the undirected graph of the pore network. The graph is a simplified mathematical object that accounts for the topology of the pore structure. Thus, the calculation is extremely computationally efficient since it is mesh-free and voxel-free. Two topological invariants are identified: The bond percolation threshold and the residual saturation. Bond percolation theory is used to obtain a closed-form pressure-saturation relation in terms of the geometry of the pores (pore throat distribution) and material parameters (contact angle and interfacial tension), universal exponents, and topological invariants, based on scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Efficiency in Shear-Loaded Brownian Gyrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Brownian gyrator is a system in which a particle experiences thermal noise from two distinct heat baths. This nonequilibrium setup inherently generates a nonzero torque, leading to gyrating motion around a potential energy minimum. As a minimal model for a heat engine, the Brownian gyrator provides valuable insights into energy conversion and nonequilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of an externally imposed shear flow on a Brownian gyrator, treating it as a mechanical load. The shear flow introduces a tunable mechanism that allows the system to operate either as a heat engine, extracting work from the temperature gradient, or as a refrigerator, transferring heat from the colder to the hotter bath. Focusing on the heat engine regime, we analytically derive the steady-state probability distribution to compute the average torque exerted by the gyrator and quantify the mechanical power extracted from the shear. Our results show a remarkable increase in efficiency compared to the standard Brownian gyrator without shear, approaching Carnot efficiency at maximum power. Surprisingly, we also find that while the system can operate efficiently as a heat engine, it may become unstable before reaching the stall condition, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and stability in shear-driven microscopic engines.</description>

      <title>Thermalization in a simple spin-chain model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the common spin-1/2 XX-model in one dimension with open boundary conditions and a large but finite number of spins. The system is in thermal equilibrium at times t&lt;0, and is subject to a weak local perturbation (quantum quench) at t=0. Focusing mainly on single-spin perturbations and observables, we show that the system re-thermalizes for sufficiently large times t&gt;0 without invoking any unproven assumptions besides the basic laws of quantum mechanics. Moreover, the time-dependent relaxation behavior is obtained in quantitative detail and is found to exhibit a wealth of interesting features.</description>

      <title>Optimal neutralization of negative space charges in photon-enhanced thermionic emission devices under bidirectional discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we innovatively modeled photon-enhanced thermionic emission (PETE) devices, incorporating positive ion injection and bidirectional discharge's effects on the space charge barrier simultaneously. Compared to previous models, our model allows the positive ion distribution function to be compatible with scenarios in which the anode motive is either higher or lower than the cathode motive, and also adapts to significant anode discharge. Through numerical simulations and parametric analyses, we found that: (1) As the ratio of the positive ion increases, the capability for space charge neutralization becomes stronger. (2) The lower the electron affinity is, the smaller the ratio of positive ions are required. (3) When the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is lower, the impact of reverse discharge on the net current density is more pronounced. Conversely, when the anode temperature is higher or the anode work function is greater, the ratio of positive ions required to achieve complete space charge neutralization increases. This study further elucidates the mechanisms and characteristics of space charge neutralization effects in PETE devices, providing a theoretical foundation for optimizing their design. Additionally, the accompanying theory and algorithm possess the potential to spark innovative research across diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Robust Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Near-Jamming Suspensions Employing Deep Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper studies the possible work extraction via coupling the thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermion, or topological types, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Though the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source to couple to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum engines.</description>

      <title>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>

Abstract: Random walks with a disordered self-interaction potential may be used to model charged polymers. In this paper we consider a one-dimensional and directed version of the charged polymer model that was introduced by Derrida, Griffiths and Higgs. We prove new results for the associated quenched free energy, including a variational formula based on a quenched large deviation principle established by Birkner, Greven and den Hollander. We also take the occasion to (i) provide detailed proofs for state-of-the-art results pointing towards the existence of a freezing transition and (ii) proceed with minor corrections for two results previously obtained by the present author with Caravenna, den Hollander and P{\'e}tr{\'e}lis for the undirected model.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Hamiltonian anyons with applications to quantum heat engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The behavior of a collection of identical particles is intimately linked to the symmetries of their wavefunction under particle exchange. Topological anyons, arising as quasiparticles in low-dimensional systems, interpolate between bosons and fermions, picking up a complex phase when exchanged. Recent research has demonstrated that similar statistical behavior can arise with mixtures of bosonic and fermionic pairs, offering theoretical and experimental simplicity. We introduce an alternative implementation of such statistical anyons, based on promoting or suppressing the population of symmetric states via a symmetry generating Hamiltonian. The scheme has numerous advantages: anyonic statistics emerge in a single particle pair, extending straightforwardly to larger systems; the statistical properties can be dynamically adjusted; and the setup can be simulated efficiently. We show how exchange symmetry can be exploited to improve the performance of heat engines, and demonstrate a reversible work extraction cycle in which bosonization and fermionization replace compression and expansion strokes. Additionally, we investigate emergent thermal properties, including critical phenomena, in large statistical anyon systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the concept of temperature in non-equilibrium steady states. Using the D3-D5 model of gauge/gravity duality, we investigate spontaneous symmetry breaking in a relativistic (2+1)-dimensional defect moving at constant velocity within a (3+1)-dimensional heat bath. We find that the dependence of the order parameter on both the heat bath temperature and the defect velocity can be captured by a single variable -- the proper effective temperature -- for the moving defect. Our results suggest that the proper effective temperature is an essential parameter for a class of relativistic non-equilibrium steady states.</description>

      <title>U-Net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion Analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME) in particle-tracking data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophysical processes within living systems rely on encounters and interactions between molecules in complex environments such as cells. They are often described by anomalous diffusion transport. Recent advances in single-molecule microscopy and particle-tracking techniques have yielded an abundance of data in the form of videos and trajectories that contain critical information about these biologically significant processes. However, standard approaches for characterizing anomalous diffusion from these measurements often struggle in cases of practical interest, e.g. due to short, noisy trajectories. Fully exploiting this data therefore requires the development of advanced analysis methods -- a core goal at the heart of the recent international Anomalous Diffusion Challenges. Here, we introduce a novel machine-learning framework, U-net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME), that applies a U-Net 3+ based neural network alongside Gaussian mixture models to enable highly accurate characterisation of single-particle tracking data. In the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge, U-AnD-ME outperformed all other participating methods for the analysis of two-dimensional anomalous diffusion trajectories at both single-trajectory and ensemble levels. Using a large dataset inspired by the Challenge, we further characterize the performance of U-AnD-ME in segmenting trajectories and inferring anomalous diffusion properties.</description>

      <title>Measurements of extreme first passage times in photon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photon transport through turbid media has typically been modeled through diffusion or telegraph equations. These models describe behavior of the average, or typical, photon with remarkable accuracy, however, we show here that they fail to capture the Extreme First Passage Times (EFPTs) of photon transport. By sending ultra-fast bursts of photons through a scattering medium and timing the arrival of the first passage photon, we measure the distribution of these EFPTs of photons in a random environment. Our measured EFPTs differ from those predicted by both the diffusion approximation and telegraph equation. Instead, we observe the EFPT as the time expected for light to travel through an index-averaged medium. These results reveal flaws in both models and invite a re-examining of their underlying assumptions.</description>

      <title>Towards a robust approach to infer causality in molecular systems satisfying detailed balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to distinguish between correlation and causation of variables in molecular systems remains an interesting and open area of investigation. In this work, we probe causality in a molecular system using two independent computational methods that infer the causal direction through the language of information transfer. Specifically, we demonstrate that a molecular dynamics simulation involving a single Tryptophan in liquid water displays asymmetric information transfer between specific collective variables, such as solute and solvent coordinates. Analyzing a discrete Markov-state and Langevin dynamics on a 2D free energy surface, we show that the same kind of asymmetries can emerge even in extremely simple systems, undergoing equilibrium and time-reversible dynamics. We use these model systems to rationalize the unidirectional information transfer in the molecular system in terms of asymmetries in the underlying free energy landscape and/or relaxation dynamics of the relevant coordinates. Finally, we propose a computational experiment that allows one to decide if an asymmetric information transfer between two variables corresponds to a genuine causal link.</description>

      <title>Work and heat exchanged during sudden quenches of strongly coupled quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly? We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.</description>

      <title>Evidence for simple "arrow of time functions" in closed chaotic quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08007v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through an explicit construction, we assign to any infinite temperature autocorrelation function $C(t)$ a set of functions $\alpha^n(t)$. The construction of $\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal derivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\alpha^n(t)$ that (almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions" (AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically observe the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless the the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a variation of some system parameter. All $\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the respective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\alpha^n(t) \geq C^2(t)$. Thus the implication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem, as it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that our numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth hypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called recursion method.</description>

      <title>Mean first-passage time at the origin of a run-and-tumble particle with periodic forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11601v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a run-and-tumble particle on a half-line with an absorbing target at the origin. The particle has an internal velocity state that switches between two opposite values at Poisson-distributed times. The position of the particle evolves according to an overdamped Langevin dynamics with a spatially-periodic force field such that every point in a given period interval is accessible to the particle. The survival probability of the particle satisfies a backward Fokker--Planck equation, whose Laplace transform yields systems of equations for the moments of the first-passage time of the particle at the origin. The mean first-passage time has already been calculated assuming that the particle exits the system almost surely. We calculate the probability that the particle reaches the origin in a finite time, given its initial position and velocity. We obtain an integral condition on the force, under which the particle has a non-zero survival probability. The conditional average of the first-passage time at the origin over the trajectories that reach the origin) is obtained in closed form. As an application, we consider a piecewise-constant force field that alternates periodically between two opposite values. In the limit where the period is short compared to the mean free path of the particle, the mean first-return time to the origin coincides with the value obtained in the case of an effective constant drift, which we calculate explicitly.</description>

      <title>Hallmarks of Deception in Asset-Exchange Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the transient and steady-state dynamics of the Bennati-Dragulescu-Yakovenko money game in the presence of probabilistic cheaters, who can misrepresent their financial status by claiming to have no money. We derive the steady-state wealth distribution per player analytically, and show how the presence of hidden cheaters can be inferred from the relative variance of wealth per player. In scenarios with a finite number of cheaters amidst an infinite pool of honest players, we identify a critical probability of cheating at which the total wealth owned by the cheaters experiences a second-order discontinuity. Below this point, the transition probability to lose money is larger than the probability to gain; conversely, above this point, the direction is reversed. We further establish a threshold cheating probability at which cheaters collectively possess half of the total wealth in the game. Lastly, we provide bounds on the rate at which both cheaters and honest players can gain or lose wealth, contributing to a deeper understanding of deception in asset exchange models.</description>

      <title>Behavior of Ising spins and ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many ecological populations are known to display a cyclic behavior with period 2. Previous work has shown that when a metapopulation (group of coupled populations) with such dynamics is allowed to interact via nearest neighbor dispersal in two dimensions, it undergoes a phase transition from disordered (spatially asynchronous) to ordered (spatially synchronous) that falls under the 2-D Ising universality class. While nearest neighbor dispersal may satisfactorily describe how most individuals migrate between habitats, we should expect a small fraction of individuals to venture on a journey to further locations. We model this behavior by considering ecological oscillators on dynamically rewired small-world networks, in which at each time step a fraction $p$ of the nearest neighbor interactions is replaced by a new interaction with a random node on the network. We measure how this connectivity change affects the critical point for synchronizing ecological oscillators. Our results indicate that increasing the amount of long-range interaction (increasing $p$) favors the ordered regime, but the presence of memory in ecological oscillators leads to quantitative differences in how much long-range dispersal is needed to order the network, relative to an analogous network of Ising spins. We also show that, even for very small values of $p$, the phase transition falls into the mean-field universality class, and argue that ecosystems where dispersal can occasionally happen across the system's length scale will display a phase transition in the mean-field universality class.</description>

      <title>Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov, A. Borisov, Particles 2021, 2 (2021)]. Such a behavior is observed for both non-chiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction branching: when you can't tell pure states from mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04494v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a definition of wavefunction "branchings": quantum superpositions which can't be feasibly distinguished from the corresponding mixed state, even under time evolution. Our definition is largely independent of interpretations, requiring only that it takes many more local gates to swap branches than to distinguish them. We give several examples of states admitting such branch decompositions. Under our definition, we argue that attempts to get relative-phase information between branches will fail without frequent active error correction, that branches are effectively the opposite of good error-correcting codes, that branches effectively only grow further apart in time under natural evolution, that branches tend to absorb spatial entanglement, that branching is stronger in the presence of conserved quantities, and that branching implies effective irreversibility. Identifying these branch decompositions in many-body quantum states could shed light on the emergence of classicality, provide a metric for experimental tests at the quantum/ classical boundary, and allow for longer numerical time evolution simulations. We see this work as a generalization of the basic ideas of environmentally-induced decoherence to situations with no clear system/ environment split.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds on the highest phonon frequency and superconducting temperature from fundamental physical constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fundamental physical constants govern key effects in high-energy particle physics and astrophysics, including the stability of particles, nuclear reactions, formation and evolution of stars, synthesis of heavy nuclei and emergence of stable molecular structures. Here, we show that fundamental constants also set an upper bound for the frequency of phonons in condensed matter phases, or how rapidly an atom can vibrate. This bound is in agreement with \textit{ab initio} simulations of atomic hydrogen and high-temperature hydride superconductors, and implies an upper limit to the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in condensed matter. Fundamental constants set this limit to the order of 10$^2-10^3$ K. This range is consistent with our calculations of $T_c$ from optimal Eliashberg functions. As a corollary, we observe that the very existence of the current research of finding $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ at and above $300$ K is due to the observed values of fundamental constants. We finally discuss how fundamental constants affect the observability and operation of other effects and phenomena including phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Emergence of the Gibbs ensemble as a steady state in Lindbladian dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18041v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct unique non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of Lindblad master equation characterized by a Gibbs ensemble $\rho_{\text{NESS}} \propto e^{-\beta \tilde{H}}$, where the effective hamiltonian $\tilde{H}$ is an element in the center of the commutant algebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the original hamiltonian. Specifically, if $\mathcal{C}$ is Abelian, then $\tilde{H}$ consists only of $U(1)$ conserved charges of the original Hamiltonian. When the original Hamiltonian has multiple charges, it is possible to couple them with bathes at different temperature respectively, but still leads to an equilibrium state. Multiple steady states arise if the number of bathes is less than the number of charges. To access the Gibbs NESS, the jump operators need to be properly chosen to fulfill quantum detailed balance condition (qDBC). These jump operators are ladder operators for $\tilde{H}$ and jump process they generate form a vertex-weighted directed acyclic graph (wDAG). By studying the XX model and Fredkin model, we showcase how the Gibbs state emerges as an equilibrium steady state.</description>

Abstract: Multifractal analysis is a powerful tool for characterizing the localization properties of wave functions. Despite its utility, this tool has been predominantly applied to disordered Hermitian systems. Multifractal statistics associated with the non-Hermitian skin effect remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that the tree geometry induces multifractal statistics for the single-particle skin states on the Cayley tree by deriving the analytical expression of multifractal dimensions. This sharply contrasts with the absence of multifractal properties for conventional single-particle skin effects in crystalline lattices. Our work uncovers the unique feature of the skin effect on the Cayley tree and provides a novel mechanism for inducing multifractality in open quantum systems without disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential disorder in 1D leads to Anderson localization of the entire spectrum. Upon sacrificing hermiticity by adding non-reciprocal hopping, the non-Hermitian skin effect competes with localization. We find another route for delocalization, which involves imaginary potential disorder. While an entirely random potential generally still leads to localization, imposing minimal spatial structure to the disorder can protect delocalization: it endows the concomitant transfer matrix with an SU(2) structure, whose compactness in turn translates into an infinite localization length. The fraction of delocalized states can be tuned by the choice of boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</description>

      <title>Global symmetries of quantum lattice models under non-invertible dualities</title>

Abstract: Non-invertible dualities/symmetries have become an important tool in the study of quantum field theories and quantum lattice models in recent years. One of the most studied examples is non-invertible dualities obtained by gauging a discrete group. When the physical system has more global symmetries than the gauged symmetry, it has not been thoroughly investigated how those global symmetries transform under non-invertible duality. In this paper, we study the change of global symmetries under non-invertible duality of gauging a discrete group $G$ in the context of (1+1)-dimensional quantum lattice models. We obtain the global symmetries of the dual model by focusing on different Hilbert space sectors determined by the $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We provide general conjectures of global symmetries of the dual model forming an algebraic ring of the double cosets. We present concrete examples of the XXZ models and the duals, providing strong evidence for the conjectures.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A universal route from avalanches in mean-field models with random fields to stochastic Poisson branching events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08526v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Avalanches in mean-field models can be mapped to memoryless branching processes defining a universality class. We present a reduced expression mapping a broad family of critical and subcriticial avalanches in mean-field models at the thermodynamic limit to rooted trees in a memoryless Poisson branching processes with random occurrence times. We derive the exact mapping for the athermal random field Ising model and the democratic fiber bundle model, where avalanche statistics progress towards criticality, and as an approximation for the self-organized criticality in slip mean-field theory. Avalanche dynamics and statistics in the three models differ only on the evolution of the field density, interaction strength, and the product of both terms determining the branching number.</description>
