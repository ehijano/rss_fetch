      <title>Formal Verification of Parameterized Systems based on Induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterized systems play a crucial role in the computer field, and their security is of great significance. Formal verification of parameterized protocols is especially challenging due to its "parameterized" feature, which brings complexity and undecidability. Existing automated parameterized verification methods have limitations, such as facing difficulties in automatically deriving parameterized invariants constrained by mixed Forall and Exists quantifiers, or having challenges in completing the parameterized verification of large and complex protocols. This paper proposes a formal verification framework for parameterized systems based on induction, named wiseParaverifier. It starts from small concretizations of protocols, analyzes inductive counterexamples, and constructs counterexample formulas to guide the entire process of parameterized verification. It also presents a heuristic Generalize method to quickly find auxiliary invariants, a method for promoting complex mixed quantifiers and merging parameterized invariants, and uses symmetric reduction ideas to accelerate the verification process. Experimental results show that wiseParaverifier can successfully complete automatic inductive verification on 7 cache coherence protocols and 10 distributed protocols. It has strong verification capabilities and migration capabilities, and can provide concise and readable verification results, which is helpful for learners to understand protocol behaviors.</description>

      <title>The Scott space of lattice of closed subsets with supremum operator as a topological semilattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present several equivalent conditions of the continuity of the supremum function $\Sigma C(X)\times\Sigma C(X)\rightarrow\Sigma C(X)$ under mild assumptions, where $C(X)$ denotes the lattice of closed subsets of a $T_0$ topological space.
  We also provide an example of a non-monotone determined space $X$ such that $\eta=\lambda x.{\downarrow}x\colon X\rightarrow\Sigma C(X)$ is continuous. Additionally, we show that a $T_0$ space is quasicontinuous (quasialgebraic) iff the lattice of its closed subsets is a quasicontinuous (quasialgebraic) domain by using $n$-approximation. Furthermore, we provide a necessary condition for when a topological space possesses a Scott completion. This allows us to give more examples which do not have Scott completions.</description>

      <title>Constructive Limits of Cantor's Diagonal Method: Countability, Enumerability, and the Impossibility of Exhausting the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cantor's diagonal method is traditionally used to prove the uncountability of the set of all infinite binary sequences. This paper analyzes the expressive limits of this method. It is shown that under any constructive application -- including generalizations with computable permutations and infinite hierarchies of diagonal extensions -- the resulting set remains countable. Thus, the method demonstrates the incompleteness of countable coverage but is unable to generate an uncountable set. This highlights its limitations as a constructive tool and reveals the boundary between constructive enumerability and the completeness of the continuum.</description>

      <title>Relating Reversible Petri Nets and Reversible Event Structures, categorically</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14195v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal nets (CNs) are Petri nets where causal dependencies are modelled via inhibitor arcs. They play the role of occurrence nets when representing the behaviour of a concurrent and distributed system, even when reversibility is considered. In this paper we extend CNs to account also for asymmetric conflicts and study (i) how this kind of nets, and their reversible versions, can be turned into a category; and (ii) their relation with the categories of reversible asymmetric event structures.</description>

      <title>Commutative N-polyregular functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies which functions computed by $\mathbb{Z}$-weighted automata can be realized by $\mathbb{N}$-weighted automata, under two extra assumptions: commutativity (the order of letters in the input does not matter) and polynomial growth (the output of the function is bounded by a polynomial in the size of the input). We leverage this effective characterization to decide whether a function computed by a commutative $\mathbb{N}$-weighted automaton of polynomial growth is star-free, a notion borrowed from the theory of regular languages that has been the subject of many investigations in the context of string-to-string functions during the last decade.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Word Equations over Partially Commutative Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:1603.02966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M(A,I)$ be a free partially commutative monoid with involution and $G(A,I)$ be its quotient group, e.g. a right-angled Artin or Coxeter group. Given a system of word equations over $M(A,I)$ with recognizable constraints with input size $n$ we show the structural result about the solution set of the system: the set of all solutions in $M(A,I)$ or in the group $G(A,I)$ is an EDT0L language. That is, it is given by an NFA $\mathcal{A}$ recognizing endomorphisms over some extended monoid. Moreover, $\mathcal{A}$ is effectively constructible by an NSPACE(n log n)-transducer. This implies that Satisfiability: `Is the system is solvable?' and Finiteness: `Are there infinitely many solutions?' can be decided in NSPACE(n log n). In the uniform version, these problems are PSPACE-complete, but for a suitable subclass of constraints we have more precise complexities and we conjecture that the decision problems above are NP-complete in this setting. Our results apply also to word equation over free monoids in the classical case where the involution is reading words right-to-left. This allows to specify that solutions are restricted to be palindromes.</description>

      <title>Exponential Resolution Lower Bounds for Weak Pigeonhole Principle and Perfect Matching Formulas over Sparse Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.00534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show exponential lower bounds on resolution proof length for pigeonhole principle (PHP) formulas and perfect matching formulas over highly unbalanced, sparse expander graphs, thus answering the challenge to establish strong lower bounds in the regime between balanced constant-degree expanders as in [Ben-Sasson and Wigderson '01] and highly unbalanced, dense graphs as in [Raz '04] and [Razborov '03, '04]. We obtain our results by revisiting Razborov's pseudo-width method for PHP formulas over dense graphs and extending it to sparse graphs. This further demonstrates the power of the pseudo-width method, and we believe it could potentially be useful for attacking also other longstanding open problems for resolution and other proof systems.</description>

      <title>Existential Notation3 Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into Notation3 Logic (N3), an extension of RDF, which empowers users to craft rules introducing fresh blank nodes to RDF graphs. This capability is pivotal in various applications such as ontology mapping, given the ubiquitous presence of blank nodes directly or in auxiliary constructs across the Web. However, the availability of fast N3 reasoners fully supporting blank node introduction remains limited. Conversely, engines like VLog or Nemo, though not explicitly designed for Semantic Web rule formats, cater to analogous constructs, namely existential rules.
  We investigate the correlation between N3 rules featuring blank nodes in their heads and existential rules. We pinpoint a subset of N3 that seamlessly translates to existential rules and establish a mapping preserving the equivalence of N3 formulae. To showcase the potential benefits of this translation in N3 reasoning, we implement this mapping and compare the performance of N3 reasoners like EYE and cwm against VLog and Nemo, both on native N3 rules and their translated counterparts. Our findings reveal that existential rule reasoners excel in scenarios with abundant facts, while the EYE reasoner demonstrates exceptional speed in managing a high volume of dependent rules.
  Additionally to the original conference version of this paper, we include all proofs of the theorems and introduce a new section dedicated to N3 lists featuring built-in functions and how they are implemented in existential rules. Adding lists to our translation/framework gives interesting insights on related design decisions influencing the standardization of N3.</description>

      <title>A semantic approach to mapping the Provenance Ontology to Basic Formal Ontology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) is a World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommended ontology used to structure data about provenance across a wide variety of domains. Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a top-level ontology ISO/IEC standard used to structure a wide variety of ontologies, such as the OBO Foundry ontologies and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). To enhance interoperability between these two ontologies, their extensions, and data organized by them, a mapping methodology and set of alignments are presented according to specific criteria which prioritize semantic and logical principles. The ontology alignments are evaluated by checking their logical consistency with canonical examples of PROV-O instances and querying terms that do not satisfy the alignment criteria as formalized in SPARQL. A variety of semantic web technologies are used in support of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles.</description>

      <title>An Introduction to Categorical Proof Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These expanded lecture notes are based on a tutorial on categorical proof theory presented at the summer school associated with the conference "Topology, Algebra, and Categories in Logic 2021-2022." The chapter delves into various applications of categorical methods in proof theory. It is designed to be accessible, with no prior familiarity with category theory required. The necessary categorical background is introduced gradually, with a focus on the philosophical and informal aspects of proof. The only prerequisites are a basic understanding of logic, computability theory, topology, and ordered structures.</description>

      <title>Verifying Equilibria in Finite-Horizon Probabilistic Concurrent Game Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-horizon probabilistic multiagent concurrent game systems, also known as finite multiplayer stochastic games, are a well-studied model in computer science due to their ability to represent a wide range of real-world scenarios involving strategic interactions among agents over a finite amount of iterations (given by the finite-horizon). The analysis of these games typically focuses on evaluating (verifying) and computing (synthesizing/realizing) which strategy profiles (functions that represent the behavior of each agent) qualify as equilibria. The two most prominent equilibrium concepts are the Nash equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium, with the latter considered a conceptual refinement of the former. However, computing these equilibria from scratch is often computationally infeasible. Therefore, recent attention has shifted to the verification problem, where a given strategy profile must be evaluated to determine whether it satisfies equilibrium conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verification problem for subgame perfect equilibria lies in PSPACE, while for Nash equilibria, it is EXPTIME-complete. This is a highly counterintuitive result since subgame perfect equilibria are often seen as a strict strengthening of Nash equilibria and are intuitively seen as more complicated.</description>
