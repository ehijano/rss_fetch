      <title>Kan extendable subcategories and fibrewise topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use pointwise Kan extensions to generate new subcategories out of old ones. We investigate the properties of these newly produced categories and give sufficient conditions for their cartesian closedness to hold. Our methods are of general use. Here we apply them particularly to the study of the properties of certain categories of fibrewise topological spaces. In particular, we prove that the categories of fibrewise compactly generated spaces, fibrewise sequential spaces and fibrewise Alexandroff spaces are cartesian closed provided that the base space satisfies the right separation axiom.</description>

      <title>Weak Waldhausen categories and a localization theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waldhausen categories were introduced to extend algebraic $K$-theory beyond Quillen's exact categories. In this article, we modify Waldhausen's axioms so that it matches better with the theory of extriangulated categories, introducing a weak Waldhausen category and defining its Grothendieck group. Examples of weak Waldhausen categories include any extriangulated category, hence any exact or triangulated category, and any Waldhausen category. A key feature of this structure is that it allows for "one-sided" extriangulated localization theory, and thus enables us to extract right exact sequences of Grothendieck groups that we cannot obtain from the theory currently available.
  To demonstrate the utility of our Weak Waldhausen Localization Theorem, we give three applications. First, we give a new proof of the Extriangulated Localization Theorem proven by Enomoto--Saito, which is a generalization at the level of $K_0$ of Quillen's classical Localization Theorem for exact categories. Second, we give a new proof that the index with respect to an $n$-cluster tilting subcategory $\mathscr{X}$ of a triangulated category $\mathscr{C}$ induces an isomorphism between $K_0^{\mathsf{sp}}(\mathscr{X})$ and the Grothendieck group of an extriangulated substructure of $\mathscr{C}$. Last, we produce a weak Waldhausen $K_0$-generalization of a localization construction due to Sarazola that involves cotorsion pairs but allows for non-Serre localizations. We show that the right exact sequences of Grothendieck groups obtained from our Sarazola construction and the Extriangulated Localization Theorem agree under a common setup.</description>

      <title>Diagram categories of Brauer type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces monoidal (super)categories resembling the Brauer category. For all categories, we can construct bases of the hom-spaces using Brauer diagrams. These categories include the Brauer category, its deformation the BWM-category, the periplectic Brauer category, and its deformation the periplectic $q$-Brauer category but also some new exotic categories. We show that the BWM-category is the unique deformation of the Brauer category in this framework, while the periplectic Brauer category has two deformations, which are each other monoidal opposite.</description>

      <title>The Hopf category of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the universal measuring coalgebras between Frobenius algebras turn the category of Frobenius algebras into a Hopf category (in the sense of \cite{BCV}), and the universal comeasuring algebras between Frobenius algebras turn the category Frobenius algebras into a Hopf opcategory. We also discuss duality and compatibility results between these structures.
  Our theory vastly generalizes the well-known fact that any homomorphism beween Frobenius algebras is an isomorphism, but also allows to go beyond classical (iso)morphisms between Frobenius algebras, especially in finite characteristic, as we show by some explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Functor String Diagrams: A Novel Approach to Flexible Diagrams for Applied Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of abstraction and composition - the focus of category theory - naturally leads to sophisticated diagrams which can encode complex algebraic semantics. Consequently, these diagrams facilitate a clearer visual comprehension of diverse theoretical and applied systems. Complex algebraic structures - otherwise represented by a forest of symbols - can be encoded into diagrams with intuitive graphical rules. The prevailing paradigm for diagrammatic category theory are monoidal string diagrams whose specification reflects the axioms of monoidal categories. However, such diagrams struggle in accurately portraying crucial categorical constructs such as functors or natural transformations, obscuring central concepts such as the Yoneda lemma or the simultaneous consideration of hom-functors and products. In this work, we introduce functor string diagrams, a systematic approach for the development of categorical diagrams which allows functors, natural transformations, and products to be clearly represented. We validate their practicality in multiple dimensions. We show their usefulness for theoretical manipulations by proving the Yoneda lemma, show that they encompass monoidal string diagrams and hence their helpful properties, and end by showing their exceptional applied utility by leveraging them to underpin neural circuit diagrams, a method which, at last, allows deep learning architectures to be comprehensively and rigorously expressed.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Negative Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The flow of information through a complex system can be readily understood with category theory. However, negative information (e.g., what is not possible) does not have an immediately evident categorical representation. The formalization of nategories using unconventional composition addresses this issue, and lets imposed limitations on categories be considered. However, traditional nategories abandon core categorical constructs and rely on extensive mathematical development. This creates a divide between the consideration of positive and negative information composition. In this work, we show that negative information can be considered in a natural categorical manner. This is aided by functor string diagrams, a novel flexible diagrammatic approach that can intuitively show the operation of hom-functors and natural transformations in expressions. This insight reveals how to consider the composition of negative information with foundational categorical constructs without relying on enrichment. We present diagrammatic means to consider not only nategories, but preorders more broadly. This paper introduces diagrammatic methods for the consideration of triangle inequalities and co-designs $\mathbf{DP/Feas_{Bool}}$, showing how important cases of negative information composition can be categorically and diagrammatically approached. In particular, we develop systematic tools to rigorously consider imposed limitations on systems, advancing our mathematical understanding, and present intuitive diagrams which motivate widespread adoption and usage for various applications.</description>
