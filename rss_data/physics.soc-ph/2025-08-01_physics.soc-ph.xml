      <title>A Statistical Physics perspective on fairness in shared expenses: The bar bill analogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social contexts where individuals consume varying amounts, such as shared meals or bar gatherings, splitting the total bill equally often yields surprisingly fair outcomes. In this work, we develop a statistical physics framework to explain this emergent fairness by modeling individual consumption as stochastic variables drawn from a realistic distribution, specifically the gamma distribution. Introducing a Boltzmann-like weighting factor, we derive exact analytical expressions for the partition function, average consumption, variance, and entropy under economic or social penalization constraints. Numerical simulations, performed using the Marsaglia-Tsang algorithm, confirm the analytical results with high precision. Drawing a direct parallel between individual consumption and ideal gas particle energy in the canonical ensemble, we show how the law of large numbers, mutual compensation, and the effective ordering induced by penalization combine to make equal cost-sharing statistically robust and predictable. These findings reveal that what appears to be an informal social convention is, in fact, grounded in the same fundamental principles that govern the collective behavior of particles in thermodynamic systems, highlighting the interdisciplinary power of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Contest Dynamics Between Cooperation and Exploitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation and competition are fundamental forces shaping both natural and human systems, yet their interplay remains poorly understood. The Prisoner's Dilemma Game (PDG) has long served as a foundational framework in Game Theory for studying cooperation and defection, yet it overlooks explicit competitive interactions. Contest Theory, in turn, provides tools to model competitive dynamics, where success depends on the investment of resources. In this work, we bridge these perspectives by extending the PDG to include a third strategy, fighting, governed by the Tullock contest success function, where success depends on relative resource investments. This model, implemented on a square lattice, examines the dynamics of cooperation, defection, and competition under resource accumulation and depletion scenarios. Our results reveal a rich phase diagram in which cooperative and competitive strategies coexist under certain critical resource investments, expanding the parameter space for cooperation beyond classical limits. Fighters delay the dominance of defectors by mediating interactions, expanding the conditions under which cooperation persists. This work offers new insights into the evolution of social behaviors in structured populations, bridging cooperation and competition dynamics.</description>

      <title>Long-Time and Short-Time Dynamics in a Weighted-Median Opinion Model on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social interactions influence people's opinions. In some situations, these interactions eventually yield a consensus opinion; in others, they can lead to opinion fragmentation and the formation of different opinion groups in the form of ``echo chambers''. Consider a social network of individuals with continuous-valued scalar opinions, and suppose that they can change their opinions when they interact with each other. In many models of the opinion dynamics of individuals in a network, it is common for opinion updates to depend on the mean opinion of interacting individuals. As an alternative, which may be more realistic in some situations, we study an opinion model with an opinion-update rule that depends on the weighted median of the opinions of interacting individuals. Through numerical simulations of our median-update opinion model, we investigate how the final opinion distribution depends on network structure. For configuration-model networks, we also derive a mean-field approximation for the asymptotic dynamics of the opinion distribution when there are infinitely many individuals. We numerically investigate its accuracy for short-time opinion dynamics on various networks.</description>

      <title>When Common Law Ages: Two Centuries of Growing Inertia in US Judicial Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Judicial opinions once considered sound can lose relevance over time. Yet, little has been known, both systematically and at scale, about how judicial reasoning has evolved. Here, we analyze four million US court decisions from 1800 to 2000, quantifying each rulings' disruptiveness, i.e., the extent to which it breaks from established citation pathways. We find that such pathbreaks have declined over time, indicating that courts have become increasingly constrained by precedent. This growing inertia appears to be driven by two structural factors. The first is precedent overload, evidenced by the volume of case law outpacing population growth (scaling exponent of 1.7). The second is the rise of ideological polarization within the judiciary, which introduces institutional uncertainty that prompts greater deference to established precedent. Despite this overall tendency toward path dependence, we find that a relatively small number of high-authority courts continue to shape legal discourse through top-down interventions. Our findings recast legal reasoning as an evolutionary process shaped by structural growth, institutional memory, and hierarchical structure, incorporating broader theories of innovation and organizational adaptation into the study of law.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Are EU low-carbon structural funds efficient in reducing emissions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of low-carbon expenditures from the European Structural and Investment Funds in reducing greenhouse gas emissions across EU regions. Using trend and cycle decomposition of two indicators -- per capita emissions and emissions intensity -- we find highly heterogeneous effects. In less developed regions, investments are linked to long-term increases in per capita emissions, while in transition and developed regions, effects are weak or not significant. Instrumental variable estimates confirm this pattern. When disaggregated by gas type, results remain inconsistent. Overall, our findings highlight the limited climate effectiveness of EU funding and the need for region-specific strategies.</description>
