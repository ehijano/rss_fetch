      <title>Insights on the Cosmic Origin of Matter from Proton Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a model in which the proton is rendered absolutely stable by an IR mechanism that remains robust against unknown quantum gravity effects. A linear combination of baryon number and lepton flavors is gauged and spontaneously broken to a residual $\mathbb{Z}_9$ discrete gauge symmetry enforcing a strict selection rule: $\Delta B = 0\,(\mathrm{mod}\,3)$. Despite its minimal field content, the model successfully accounts for established empirical evidence of physics beyond the SM. High-scale symmetry breaking simultaneously provides a seesaw mechanism explaining the smallness of neutrino masses, minimal thermal leptogenesis, and a viable phenomenology of the majoron as dark matter. Any cosmic string-wall network remaining after inflation is unstable for numerous charge assignments. Lepton flavor non-universality, central to the construction, leads to predictive neutrino textures testable via oscillation experiments, neutrinoless double beta decay, and cosmology. The model motivates searches in $X$- and $\gamma$-ray lines, neutrino telescopes, and predicts CMB imprints.</description>

      <title>A 3D Monte Carlo calculation of the inverse Compton emission from the Sun and stars in presence of magnetic and electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar steady emission in gamma rays is due to the interactions of Galactic cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere and with the low-energy solar photon field via inverse Compton scattering. The emission is sensitive to the magnetic field nearby the Sun and to the cosmic-ray transport in the magnetic field in the inner solar system. Modeling the inverse Compton emission in the presence of a magnetic field is therefore crucial to better interpret the observations. In a previous work we have presented a comprehensive calculation of the secondary productions due to the collision of cosmic rays with the solar atmosphere in presence of magnetic fields. In this paper, we present a general approach to calculate the (anisotropic) inverse Compton scattering in a 3D Monte Carlo simulation, also in presence of magnetic and electric fields. After a short review of the scattering process of photons with electrons, examples of inverse Compton emission are presented, including the predictions for the Sun.</description>

      <title>Extending the LCSR method to the electromagnetic pion form factor at low momenta using QCD renormalization-group summation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain the electromagnetic pion form factor (emFF) $F_\pi$ for spacelike mid-range of momentum transfer in QCD. We use renormalization group summation within the light cone sum rules (LCSRs) to obtain the QCD radiative corrections to the $F_\pi$ and involve contributions of the leading twist 2 and twists 4, 6. The strong coupling constants in this approach are free of Landau singularities, which allows one to go down to the lower transferred momentum $Q^2$. The prediction of the calculations performed reproduces the experimental data below/around $Q^2= 1$ GeV$^2$ significantly better than analogous predictions based on a fixed-order power-series expansion in the standard QCD.</description>

      <title>Subthreshold poles in electron-positron annihilation. DD final states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ${\psi(2\mathrm S)}$ subthreshold pole influences the cross section of the electron-positron annihilation into the ${\mathrm D\bar\mathrm D}$ final states. We make the fits to the BESIII data \cite{besiii2024} on ${\mathrm D^0\bar\mathrm D^0}$ and ${\mathrm D^+\mathrm D^-}$ final states, and also two common fits to both processes. The statistical significance of the subthreshold pole is greater than 4$\sigma$ in all cases.</description>

      <title>Radiative B to tensor meson decays at NLO in SCET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18624v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiative $B$ to tensor $\left(K_2^*(1430),\; f_2(1270),\; a_2(1230)\right)$ meson decays are studied at next-to-leading order (NLO) in soft-collinear effective theory (SCET). The SCET allows the systematic treatment of factorizable and non-factorizable contributions along with the resummation of large perturbative logarithms. We performed a two step matching and determined the soft-overlap function $\zeta^\perp_{T}$ and branching ratios for these $B$ to tensor meson decays. In the case of $B\to K_2^*(1430)\gamma$, the numerical value of the branching ratio lies close to its experimental measurements. The estimated values of the branching ratios of CKM suppressed decays $B \to \left(a_2(1230),\; f_2(1270)\right)\gamma$ are significant small compared to that of $B\to K_2^*(1430)\gamma$, but still could be measured in some ongoing and future $B$ physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Investigating charmed hybrid baryons via QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent interpretations of the $\eta_1(1855)$ and $X(2370)$ as a hybrid meson and a glueball, respectively, the possible existence of hybrid baryons has become a subject of considerable interest. In this letter, we investigate charmed hybrid baryons using the QCD sum rule method within the framework of heavy quark effective theory. We construct twenty-eight interpolating currents for charmed hybrid baryons, seven of which are employed in QCD sum rule analyses of nineteen states with quark-gluon configurations $qqcg$, $qscg$, and $sscg$ ($q = u/d$). The masses of the lowest-lying charmed hybrid baryons in the $SU(3)$ flavor $\mathbf{6}_F$ representation are calculated to be $M_{\Sigma_{cg}(1/2^+)} = 3.46^{+0.33}_{-0.21}~\rm{GeV}$, $M_{\Xi^\prime_{cg}(1/2^+)} = 3.60^{+0.48}_{-0.16}~\rm{GeV}$, and $M_{\Omega_{cg}(1/2^+)} = 3.77^{+0.31}_{-0.16}~\rm{GeV}$. We propose that future experiments search for these states via their $P$-wave decay channels $ND^{(*)}$, $\Lambda D^{(*)}$, and $\Xi D^{(*)}$, respectively. Such investigations would provide valuable insight into the role of gluonic excitations in hadron structure.</description>

      <title>The mass of the lightest gluelump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the most up-to-date determinations of the normalization of the leading renormalons of the pole mass, the singlet static potential, the octet static potential, and the gluelump energy. They read $Z^{\rm MS}_m=-Z^{\rm MS}_{V_s}/2=\{0.604(17),0.551(20)\}$, $Z^{\rm MS}_{V_o}=\{0.136(8),0.121(13)\}$, and $Z^{\rm MS}_A=\{-1.343(36),-1.224(43)\}$, for $n_f=0$ and $n_f=3$ respectively. We obtain two independent renormalization group invariant and renormalization scale independent determinations of the energy of the ground state gluelump in the principal value summation scheme: $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.47(9)r_0^{-1}$ and $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.38(11)r_0^{-1}$. They combine in $\Lambda_{B}^{\rm PV}=2.44(7)r_0^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Estimating of CP Violation in $B_{c}\rightarrow B K^{0}+B {\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow B \pi^{\pm} e^{\mp} \nu_{e}$ Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the CP asymmetries ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$ in $B_{c}^{\pm}\rightarrow B^{\pm} K^{0}+B^{\pm} {\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow B^{\pm} \pi^{\pm} e^{\mp} \nu_{e}$ and $B_{c}^{\pm}\rightarrow B^{\pm} K^{0}+B^{\pm} {\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow B^{\pm} \pi^{\mp} e^{\pm} \nu_{e}$ decays, both of them consist of three parts: the indirect CP violations in $K^0 -\bar{K}^0$ mixing $A_{CP,mix}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,mix}^{mp}$, the direct CP violations in $B_{c}$ decay $A_{CP,dir}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,dir}^{mp}$, the new CP violation effects $A_{CP,int}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,int}^{mp}$, which originate from the interference between the amplitude of the $B_{c}^{-}\rightarrow B^{-} K^{0} ({\bar{K}}^0) \rightarrow B^{-} \pi^{-} e^{+} \nu_{e}(\pi^{+} e^{-} \bar{\nu}_{e})$ decay with the difference between the oscillating effect of $K^0\rightarrow {\bar{K}}^0$ and that of ${\bar{K}}^0\rightarrow K^0 $. The strong phase differences of the direct CP asymmetries $A_{CP,dir}^{pm}$ and $A_{CP,dir}^{mp}$ arising from $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing parameters. ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$ are of the order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, respectively. The new CP violation effect ${\mathcal A}_{CP,int}^{pm}$ plays a dominant role in ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$, the CP asymmetry ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$ is dominated by the indirect CP violation ${\mathcal A}_{CP,mix}^{mp}$, so the CP asymmetry ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$ provides an ideal place to study the new CP violation effect. We derive another two asymmetry observables ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pp}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mm}$, which are dominated by $K^0-\bar{K}^0$ mixing. The observables ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pm}$, ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mp}$, ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{pp}$ and ${\mathcal A}_{CP}^{mm}$ are hopefully to be marginally observed at the LHC experiment and the HL-LHC experiment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic gauge symmetry and UV extension of the nonperturbative coupling in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend our recent analytic study of the strong coupling $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ in the nonperturbative and near-perturbative regimes~\cite{deTeramond:2024ikl} by imposing rigorous renormalization-group results from asymptotically free gauge theories at $Q^2 \to \infty$. The asymptotic boundary conditions modify the scaling properties of $\alpha_{\rm eff}$ at large values of the momentum transfer $Q^2$, and lead to a scale-dependent confinement strength $\kappa(Q^2)$. This requires that both $\kappa(Q^2)$ and $\alpha_{\rm eff}\left(Q^2, \kappa(Q^2)\right)$ remain holomorphic in the complex $Q^2$ plane, except at the physical cuts associated with the heavy-quark thresholds and the singularity flow trajectory studied in~\cite{deTeramond:2024ikl}. For color $SU(3)$, a precise connection is found between the scaling exponent of $\kappa(Q^2)$ in the ultraviolet, the value of the infrared fixed point of the strong coupling, and the number of flavors in agreement with observations. The nonperturbative analytic model gives an accurate description of the strong coupling at all scales, up to the highest available data.</description>

      <title>The Bubble Wall Velocity in Local Thermal Equilibrium with Full Effective Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cosmological phase transitions, the bubble wall velocity is essential for electroweak baryogenesis and gravitational wave predictions. We develop a computational framework that directly determines the velocity within the local thermal equilibrium approximation, utilizing the full one-loop finite-temperature effective potential. This approach mitigates the errors introduced by using simplified bag model. We estimate the errors by comparing the results obtained using derived velocities-with kinetic energy fractions calculated from hydrodynamic integration-against those using fixed velocities, where kinetic energy fractions are derived from fitting formulas. We find that the fitting formulas retain reasonable accuracy when the assumed velocities align with the computed values. However, deviations grow as the velocity discrepancies increase, particularly in the deflagration regime, where relative errors reach 48% in peak frequency and 90% in peak value of gravitational wave spectrum. In contrast, the detonation regime exhibits significantly smaller discrepancies, with maximum deviations limited to 6% in peak frequency and 18% in peak spectrum.</description>

      <title>The nonleptonic decays $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{(\prime)+}\pi^{+}$ within the nonrelativistic quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the nonleptonic decays $\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{(\prime)+}\pi^{+}$ with considering $\Xi_{c}-\Xi_{c}^{\prime}$ mixing. The relevant decay amplitudes are evaluated within the framework of nonrelativistic quark model, combining the baryon spatial wave functions adopted from solving the Schr\"{o}dinger equation with a nonrelativistic potential. With the mixing angle ranging $\theta\in(-18.2^{\circ},-14.3^{\circ})$, we successfully reproduce the measured ratio $R=\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+}]/\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+}]$ reported by the LHCb Collaboration. Furthermore, we estimate the branching fractions as $\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+}]=(3.36\sim3.92)\%$ and $\mathcal{B}[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+}]=(4.74\sim5.40)\%$, and the asymmetry parameters as $\alpha[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+}]=(-0.80\sim-0.81)$ and $\alpha[\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+}]=(-0.61\sim-0.62)$. The measurements of absolute branching fractions and asymmetry parameters by the ongoing LHCb and Belle II experiments will be helpful for further testing our numerical results and confirming the mixing angle.</description>

      <title>Gauge symmetry breaking with $S^2$ extra dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider symmetry breaking of arbitrary gauge groups on a six-dimensional space-time which consists of a four-dimensional Minkowski space-time $M^4$ and a two-dimensional sphere $S^2$. We expand the gauge fields in the presence of a non-trivial background unique to $S^2$. We analyze Kaluza-Klein(KK) modes of the gauge fields and derive the mass spectrum of the KK modes. We found that the gauge fields (not) commuting with the background fields (do not) remain symmetry operators in four dimensions. We also discuss the mass spectrum of the extra-dimensional components of the gauge fields and identify a physical scalar $\phi$ and a Nambu-Goldstone mode $\chi$. As a result, we obtain a method to break gauge symmetry due to the nontrivial solution for gauge fields which is a unique feature of $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Flavor Model and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a supersymmetric flavor model based on the symmetries $SU(2)_L \times A_4 \times Z_3 \times U(1)_R$, which extends the original Altarelli and Feruglio construction by introducing flavon and driving superfields responsible for the spontaneous breaking of the flavor symmetry in order to obtain non-zero reactor angle. The vacuum alignments of flavon fields are achieved through the minimization of the scalar potential derived from the superpotential. This setup leads to specific mass matrices for the charged leptons and neutrinos that are consistent with current experimental data, including the measured values of the lepton mixing angles and neutrino mass squared differences. We investigate whether the model can simultaneously accommodate successful thermal leptogenesis. In particular, we analyze the CP asymmetry generated in the decay of heavy Majorana neutrinos, the resulting lepton asymmetry, and its conversion to the baryon asymmetry through the electroweak sphalerons. However the CP asymmetry is zero, since the Dirac neutrino mass matrix is simple texture in the leading order for our model. Then we consider the next-leading order in Yukawa interactions of the Dirac neutrinos. Therefor, we can realize the baryon asymmetry of the universe at the present universe. By numerically scanning the parameter space, we identify the regions consistent with both neutrino oscillation data and the observed baryon asymmetry. The range of the Majorana phases may be tested in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Classical Analysis of Noncoherent Dark Matter to Photon Conversions in a Resonant Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both axion and dark photon dark matter are among the most promising candidates of dark matter. What we know with some confidence is that they exhibit a small velocity distribution $\delta v\lesssim v\sim 10^{-3}$c. In addition, their mass is small, resulting in a long de Broglie wavelength and a high particle number density. Their phase space distribution has many uncertainties thus could give rise to a coherent or noncoherent wave on the laboratory scale. In this paper, we demonstrated that a resonant cavity can enhance the noncoherent axion-to-photon or dark photon-to-photon transitions. The reason in a classical picture is that a cavity can resonantly respond to many different resonant sources at the same time. This is consistent with the quantum perspective. The induced signals, however, are noncoherent and therefore may need a single-photon readout.</description>

      <title>Kira 3: integral reduction with efficient seeding and optimized equation selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present version 3 of Kira, a Feynman integral reduction program for high-precision calculations in quantum field theory and gravitational-wave physics. Building on previous versions, Kira 3 introduces optimized seeding and equation selection algorithms, significantly improving performance for multi-loop and multi-scale problems. New features include convenient numerical sampling, symbolic integration-by-parts reductions, and support for user-defined additional relations. We demonstrate its capabilities through benchmarks on two- and three-loop topologies, showcasing up to two orders of magnitude improvement over Kira 2.3. Kira 3 is publicly available and poised to support ambitious projects in particle physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for neutrino charge assignments in $U(2)_F$ Flavor Models: Implications for LFV processes and leptonic anomalous magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build upon a simple $U(2)_F$ model of flavor, in which all fermion masses and mixing hierarchies arise from powers of two small parameters controlling $U(2)_F$ breaking. In the original formulation, an isomorphism to the discrete $D_6\times U(1)_F$ symmetry was invoked to generate a Majorana neutrino mass term. Here, we retain the successful features of that model for the charged leptons and quarks, while exploring alternative neutrino charge assignments within the $U(2)_F$ framework. This approach allows us to generate Majorana neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism without introducing any additional symmetries nor invoking any isomorphism. We further examine the implications of our models for Lepton Flavor Violating (LFV) decays, analyzing the processes $\mu\rightarrow e\gamma$, $\tau\rightarrow\mu\gamma$ and $\tau\rightarrow e\gamma$ and their connection with the leptonic anomalous magnetic moments. We show that within the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) approach the current limits on the branching ratios of LFV decays obtained in our $U(2)_F$ models are not compatible with the anomaly observed for $(g-2)_\mu$, thereby suggesting that either $(g-2)_\mu$ must be very close to the Standard Model predictions or the invoked flavor symmetry is not appropriate to describe the current anomalies.</description>

      <title>The isotropy, anisotropies and non-Gaussianity of the scalar-induced gravitational-wave background: diagrammatic approach for primordial non-Gaussianity up to any order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) produced nonlinearly by the enhanced cosmological curvature perturbations can serve as a potentially powerful probe of primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) in the early Universe. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the imprints of local-type PNG on the SIGW background beyond the widely used quadratic and cubic approximations. We develop a diagrammatic approach capable of analyzing SIGWs for PNG up to any order. Utilizing this approach, we derive semi-analytic formulas for the energy-density fraction spectrum of the isotropic background, the angular power spectrum of the energy-density anisotropies, as well as the angular bispectrum and trispectrum of the energy-density non-Gaussianity. Specializing to PNG up to quartic approximation (parameterized by $f_\mathrm{NL}$, $g_\mathrm{NL}$, and $h_\mathrm{NL}$), we numerically compute all contributions to these SIGW spectra. We find that PNG can significantly alter the amplitude of the energy-density spectrum and generate substantial anisotropies through the initial inhomogeneities. Furthermore, we observe that the angular bispectrum and trispectrum always vanish when the primordial curvature perturbations are Gaussian; otherwise, they do not, indicating their potential utility as probes of PNG. Therefore, we anticipate that both the isotropic background and the anisotropies of the SIGW background will provide essential information about the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Evolutions in Globular Clusters and Dwarf Galaxies: Conduction Fluid Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new two-fluid conduction scheme to simulate the evolution of an isolated, self-gravitating, equilibrium cluster of stars and collisionless dark matter on secular (gravothermal) timescales. We integrate the equations in Lagrangian coordinates via a second-order, semi-implicit algorithm, which is unconditionally stable when the mass of the lighter species is much less than that of the heavier species. The method can be straightforwardly generalized to handle a multi-species system with a population of stars or components beyond collisionless dark matter and stars. We apply the method to simulate the dynamical evolution of stellar-dark matter systems, exploring the consequences of mass segregation and gravothermal core collapse, and assessing those effects for observed globular clusters and dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume.</description>

      <title>Minimal Plateau Inflation in light of ACT DR6 Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a class of minimal plateau inflationary models constrained by the latest cosmological observations from ACT DR6, Planck 2018, BICEP/Keck 2018, and DESI, collectively referred to as P-ACT-LB-BK18. These models, characterized by a non-polynomial potential, are analyzed using both inflationary and post-inflationary reheating dynamics, and the limits on the viable model parameter space are obtained. Our results show that the minimal model with matter-like post inflationary reheating phase remains consistent with current data at both $1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ levels. The inflaton potential's exponent $n$ and reheating epoch are intertwined in that upon its increase, corresponding to the stiffer reheating equation of state, the viable model parameter space in accordance with ACT shrinks, which is further facilitated by the primordial gravitational waves (PGWs) overproduction. We further explored a supergravity-inspired extension of the model under study with similar results, but with tighter constraints on the model parameters. These results emphasize the importance of jointly analyzing CMB data and reheating physics to test inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Benchmark of Proton Helicity and Flavor-Dependent Unpolarized TMDPDFs at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculations of the isovector helicity transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) and the flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs for up and down quarks in the proton. Our computations utilize domain-wall fermion discretization with physical quark masses. Employing Coulomb-gauge-fixed bilocal quark correlation functions within the large-momentum effective theory framework, we access nonperturbative transverse quark separations $b_T$ up to approximately 1~fm, corresponding to low transverse momentum scales. We present renormalization and factorization scale-independent ratios of these TMDPDFs as functions of $b_T$ and longitudinal momentum fraction $x$, allowing direct comparisons with phenomenological parameterizations from global experimental fits. Our results demonstrate remarkably similar $b_T$ dependence between helicity and unpolarized TMDPDFs at moderate $x$, in agreement with phenomenology. In contrast to certain phenomenological models, we observe mild flavor dependence in the $b_T$ distributions at moderate values of $x$.</description>

      <title>Bridging reaction theory and nuclear structure in $\pi^\pm$-${}^{48}$Ca scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the pion-nucleus multiple-scattering framework to include detailed second-order rescattering dynamics for nuclei with non-zero isospin. To account for intermediate charge-exchange and nucleon spin-flip effects, we develop a scattering potential that depends on the one- and two-body densities of the target nucleus. We compute one-body densities from coupled-cluster theory and two-body densities within the Hartree-Fock approximation. To estimate theoretical uncertainties, we employ modern nuclear Hamiltonians derived from chiral effective field theory. While the sensitivity to nuclear structure details is mild, second-order corrections are found to be sizeable and essential for accurately reproducing differential cross sections measured in $\pi^\pm$-${}^{48}$Ca elastic scattering within the $\Delta(1232)$-resonance region</description>

      <title>Constraints on maximum neutron star mass from proto-neutron star evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proto-neutron star (PNS) gets formed after a successful supernova when the stellar remnant decouples from the ejecta. In this study, we explore a relativistic framework for the finite-temperature $\beta$-equilibrium limit of equation of state (EOS), constrained via a Bayesian inference methodology. The EOS is constrained by minimal approximations on a few nuclear saturation properties, low-density pure neutron matter constraints from chiral effective field theory, and a neutron star (NS) maximum mass greater than 2.0 $M_{\odot}$. Two sets of EOS derived from the relativistic mean field model for nucleonic and hyperonic matter constrained by a Bayesian inference calculation at the zero temperature limit are used. The thermal adiabatic index ($\Gamma_{\rm Th}$) is calculated as a function of the baryonic density across several temperatures for both the sets. Our results suggest that the maximum NS mass is of the order of 2.15 $M_\odot$ if hyperons are present. In addition, the present study suggests that an observation of NS with mass larger than $2.2\ M_{\odot}$ can indirectly indicates the absence of hyperons in its core. The deleptonization of hyperonic PNS reduces the stellar maximum mass rendering the PNS exceeding the zero temperature maximum stellar (baryonic) mass limit becomes metastable which is prone to collapse into a black hole while PNS below such a mass threshold evolves to a stable NS.</description>

      <title>Microscopic constraints for the equation of state and structure of neutron stars: a Bayesian model mixing framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian model mixing (BMM) is a statistical technique that can combine constraints from different regions of an input space in a principled way. Here we extend our BMM framework for the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting matter from symmetric nuclear matter to asymmetric matter, specifically focusing on zero-temperature, charge-neutral, $\beta$-equilibrated matter. We use Gaussian processes (GPs) to infer constraints on the neutron star matter EOS at intermediate densities from two different microscopic theories: chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) at baryon densities around nuclear saturation, $n_B \sim n_0$, and perturbative QCD at asymptotically high baryon densities, $n_B \geqslant 20 n_0$. The uncertainties of the $\chi$EFT and pQCD EOSs are obtained using the BUQEYE truncation error model. We demonstrate the flexibility of our framework through the use of two categories of GP kernels: conventional stationary kernels and a non-stationary changepoint kernel. We use the latter to explore potential constraints on the dense matter EOS by including exogenous data representing theory predictions and heavy-ion collision measurements at densities $\geqslant 2n_0$. We also use our EOSs to obtain neutron star mass-radius relations and their uncertainties. Our framework, whose implementation will be available through a GitHub repository, provides a prior distribution for the EOS that can be used in large-scale neutron-star inference frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We examine data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration which has implications for the nature of dark energy. We consider classes of models that manifestly obey the null energy condition, with a focus on quintessence models. We find that hilltop potentials and exponential potentials provide modest improvement compared to a cosmological constant, but the statistical evidence is only marginal at this stage. We correct some analyses in the existing literature which attempted to compare some quintessence models to the data, giving an overly positive result.</description>

      <title>On the Pipeline Dependence of DESI Dynamical Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue scientific scrutiny of the DESI dynamical dark energy (DE) claim by explicitly demonstrating that the result depends on the analysis pipeline. Concretely, we define a likelihood that converts the $w_0 w_a$CDM model back into the flat $\Lambda$CDM model, which we fit to DESI constraints on the flat $\Lambda$CDM model from DR1 Full-Shape (FS) modelling and BAO. We further incorporate CMB constraints. Throughout, we find that $w_0$ and $w_a$ are within $1 \sigma$ of the flat $\Lambda$CDM Model. Our work makes it explicit that, in contrast to DR1 and DR2 BAO, there is no dynamical DE signal in FS modelling, even when combined with BAO and CMB. Moreover, one confirms late-time accelerated expansion today $(q_0 &lt; 0)$ at $ \gtrsim 3.4 \sigma$ in FS modelling+BAO. On the contrary, DR1 and DR2 BAO fail to confirm $q_0 &lt; 0$ under similar assumptions. Our analyses highlight the fact that trustable scientific results should be independent of the analysis pipeline.</description>

      <title>Testing cosmological principle under Copernican principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observational analyses have revealed potential evidence for a preferred spatial direction in cosmological data. Such directional parameterization inherently places observers at a privileged spatial position, thereby conflicting with the Copernican principle and suffering from the look-elsewhere effect. To restore the Copernican principle which is the foundation of modern astronomy, we propose a stochastic framework for cosmological principle violations. The almost uniform temperature of cosmic microwave background suggests that the deviation of isotropy is negligible ($\lesssim 10^{-5}$ level) on the last scattering surface, which can be used as a zero boundary condition to construct an orthogonal basis below the redshift of recombination. The relative deviation from Hubble diagram of isotropic ($\Lambda$CDM or $w_0w_a$CDM) models is expanded with the orthogonal basis with a hierarchy of increasing resolution. Using this new approach, we test cosmological principle with type Ia supernovae, strong lens time delay, and gravitational-wave standard siren. The data sets are consistent with statistical isotropy on large scales.</description>

Abstract: The paper titled "An implementation of neural simulation-based inference for parameter estimation in ATLAS" by the ATLAS collaboration (arXiv:2412.01600v1 [hep-ex]) describes the implementation of neural simulation-based inference for a measurement analysis performed by ATLAS. The uncertainties in the analysis arising from the finiteness of the simulated datasets are estimated using a novel double-bootstrapping technique described in that work. In the present comment, it is claimed and demonstrated, using a toy example, that the double-bootstrapping technique does not actually capture the aforementioned uncertainties.</description>

      <title>The Gauge Theory Bootstrap: Predicting pion dynamics from QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gauge Theory Bootstrap [arXiv:2309.12402, arXiv:2403.10772] computes the strongly coupled pion dynamics by considering the most general scattering matrix, form factors and spectral densities and matching them with perturbative QCD at high energy and with weakly coupled pions at low energy. In this work, we show that further constraints on the spectral densities significantly reduce the possible solutions to a small set of qualitatively similar ones. Quantitatively, the precise solution is controlled by the asymptotic value of the form factors and SVZ sum rules. We also introduce an iterative procedure that, starting from a generic feasible point, converges to a unique solution parameterized by the UV input. For the converged solution we compute masses and widths of resonances that appear, scattering lengths and effective ranges of partial waves, low energy coefficients in the effective action. Additionally, we use these results to discuss the thermodynamics of a pion gas including pair correlations of pions with same and opposite charge.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversions in QCD phase-transition supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae undergoing a first-order quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phase transition experience the collapse of the central proto-neutron star that leads to a second bounce. This event is accompanied by the release of a second neutrino burst. Unlike the first stellar core bounce neutrino burst which consists exclusively of electron neutrinos, the second burst is dominated by electron antineutrinos. Such a condition makes QCD supernovae an ideal site for the occurrence of fast neutrino flavor conversion (FFC), which can lead to rapid flavor equilibration and significantly impact the related neutrino signal. In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of the conditions for fast flavor instability (FFI) around and after the second neutrino burst in a QCD phase transition supernova model launched from a 25~$M_\odot$ progenitor mass. We evaluate the relevant instability criteria and find two major phases of FFC. The first phase is closely associated with the collapse and the rapidly expanding shock wave, which is a direct consequence of the proto-neutron star collapse due to the phase transition. The second phase takes place a few milliseconds later when electron degeneracy is restored near the proto-neutron star surface. We also characterize the growth rate of FFI and estimate its impact on the evolution of the neutrino flavor content. The potential observational consequences on neutrino signals are evaluated by comparing a scenario assuming complete flavor equipartition with other scenarios without FFC. Finally, we investigate how FFC may influences $r$-process nucleosynthesis associated with QCD phase transition driven supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Study of $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential radial flow in blast-wave model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transverse momentum-differential radial flow observable $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$, recently proposed and measured by the ATLAS and ALICE collaborations, provides a novel tool to probe radial expansion dynamics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. In this work, we conduct a detailed study of $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$ using a blast-wave model that incorporates hydrodynamic-like expansion and thermal emission. We introduce event-by-event fluctuations in the transverse expansion velocity and kinetic freeze-out temperature using Gaussian probability distributions. Our results show that increasing the mean expansion velocity leads to a clear mass ordering in $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$, while fluctuations in both expansion velocity and freeze-out temperature significantly enhance the magnitude of $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$, particularly at higher $p_\mathrm{T}$. We fit blast-wave model calculations for identified hadrons ($\pi$, K, and p) to recent ALICE data from Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV using a Bayesian parameter estimation framework. The extracted mean transverse expansion velocity decreases, while the kinetic freeze-out temperature increases, from central to peripheral collisions. Additionally, the freeze-out temperatures inferred from $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$ are systematically higher than those obtained from conventional $p_\mathrm{T}$-spectra fits, likely due to the reduced sensitivity of $v_0(p_\mathrm{T})$ to resonance decay contributions.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry and Spinor-Vector Duality: A Top-Down Approach to the Swampland Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mirror symmetry is one of the celebrated developments in pure mathematics that arose from an initial observation in worldsheet string constructions. The profound implications of mirror symmetry in the Effective Field Theory (EFT) limit of string compactifications was subsequently understood. In particular, it proved to be an exceptionally useful tool in the field of enumerative geometry. Spinor-Vector Duality (SVD) is an extension of mirror symmetry that can be readily understood in terms of the moduli parameters of toroidal heterotic-string compactifications, which include the metric, the anti-symmetric ternsor field and the Wilson-line moduli. While mirror symmetry corresponds to maps of the internal moduli parameters, {\i.e.} the metric and the anti-symmetric tensor field, SVD corresponds to maps of the Wilson-line moduli. Similar to mirror symmetry the imprint of SVD in the EFT limit can serve as a tool to study the properties of complex manifolds with vector-bundles. Spinor-Vector Duality motivates a top--down approach to the "Swampland" program, by studying the imprint of the symmetries of the worldsheet ultra-violet complete string constructions in the EFT limit. It is conjectured that SVD provides a demarcation line between (2,0) EFTs that possess an ultra-violet complete embedding in string theory versus those that do not.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of the strong backreaction regime in axion inflation: the effect of the potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent works have demonstrated the necessity of capturing the local inhomogeneous physics in axion inflation, and showed new genuine features, most notably the extension of the inflationary period dictated by an electromagnetic slow-roll phase. In this work, we further investigate the model by performing a systematic study of the effect of the inflationary potential in the dynamics during the strong backreaction regime. The results indicate that the novel features associated with the local backreaction are universal and intrinsic to the model, hence independent on the choice of inflationary potential. We find that the main quantitative differences between the different choices manifest in the lengthening of inflation. We discuss the possible observational impact of this. Finally, we assess the possible reconciliation of the homogeneous backreaction method with fully inhomogeneous lattice techniques, and obtain that the former fails to provide a correct description for the regime studied in this work.</description>

      <title>A frequentist view on the two-body decaying dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decaying dark matter (DDM) has emerged as an interesting framework to extend the Lambda-cold-dark-matter (LCDM) model, as many particle physics models predict that dark matter may not be stable over cosmic time and can impact structure formation. In particular, a model in which DM decays at a rate $\Gamma$ and imprints a velocity kick $v$ onto its decay products leads to a low amplitude of fluctuations, as quantified by the parameter $S_8$, in better agreement with that measured by some past weak lensing surveys. Bayesian analyses have provided mixed conclusions regarding its viability, with a reconstructed clustering amplitude only slightly below the standard LCDM value. In this paper, we perform a frequentist analysis of Planck+BAO data. We find $1\sigma$ constraints on the half-life of $6.93^{+7.88}_{-2.85}$Gyr and a velocity kick of $1250^{+1450}_{-1000}$km/s which differ from their Bayesian counterparts, indicating the presence of volume effects. Moreover, we find that under the DDM model, the frequentist analysis predicts lower values of $S_8$, in agreement with those found by KiDS-1000 and DES-Y3 at $1.5\sigma$. We further show that previously derived KiDS-1000 constraints that appeared to exclude the best-fit model from Planck data were driven by priors on the primordial parameters $A_s$ and $n_s$. When those are removed from the analysis, KiDS-1000 constraints on the DDM parameters are fully relaxed. It is only when applying Planck-informed priors on $A_s$ and $n_s$ to the KiDS-1000 analysis that one can constrain the model. We further highlight that in the absence of such priors, the region of scales best-measured by KiDS-1000 does not exactly match the $S_8$ kernel, but rather a slightly smaller range of scales centered around $k\sim 0.3\, h/$Mpc. One must thus be careful in applying $S_8$ constraints to a model instead of the full data likelihood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are classical oscillatory solutions with very long but finite lifetimes in real scalar field theories with appropriate potentials. An interesting feature is that resonances appear in the lifetimes of the oscillon for the initial size of the oscillon core $R_0$, which was discovered by Honda and Choptuik in the case of Minkowski space. In a previous work, oscillons in the global anti-de Sitter (AdS) space have been constructed, which we abbreviate as AdS oscillons. We present new resonance structures for the curvature radius $L$ and the core size $R_0$ in the lifetime of the AdS oscillon. We then compute exponents associated with the resonance peaks. Finally, we observe the bifurcation of the peaks due to the reflected waves.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Local Canonicalization: How to Make Any Network Lorentz-Equivariant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentz-equivariant neural networks are becoming the leading architectures for high-energy physics. Current implementations rely on specialized layers, limiting architectural choices. We introduce Lorentz Local Canonicalization (LLoCa), a general framework that renders any backbone network exactly Lorentz-equivariant. Using equivariantly predicted local reference frames, we construct LLoCa-transformers and graph networks. We adapt a recent approach to geometric message passing to the non-compact Lorentz group, allowing propagation of space-time tensorial features. Data augmentation emerges from LLoCa as a special choice of reference frame. Our models surpass state-of-the-art accuracy on relevant particle physics tasks, while being $4\times$ faster and using $5$-$100\times$ fewer FLOPs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Flavor Symmetry Landscape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09503v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore flavor dynamics in the broad scenario of a strongly interacting light Higgs (SILH). Our study focuses on the mechanism of partial fermion compositeness, but is otherwise as systematic as possible. Concretely, we classify the options for the underlying flavor (and CP) symmetries, which are necessary in order to bring this scenario safely within the range of present or future explorations. Our main goal in this context is to provide a practical map between the space of hypotheses (the models) and the experimental ground that will be explored in the medium and long term, in both indirect and direct searches, in practice at HL-LHC and Belle II, in EDM searches and eventually at FCC-hh. Our study encompasses scenarios with the maximal possible flavor symmetry, corresponding to minimal flavor violation (MFV), scenarios with no symmetry, corresponding to the so-called flavor anarchy, and various intermediate cases that complete the picture. One main result is that the scenarios that allow for the lowest new physics scale have intermediate flavor symmetry rather than the maximal symmetry of MFV models. Such optimal models are rather resilient to indirect exploration via flavor and CP violating observables, and can only be satisfactorily explored at a future high-energy collider. On the other hand, the next two decades of indirect exploration will significantly stress the parameter space of a large swath of less optimal but more generic models up to mass scales competing with those of the FCC-hh.</description>

The experimental facility allows for the effective probing of dark photons even in the off-shell regime, i.e., when the dark photon mass exceeds the driving frequency of the emitter cavity, which is pumped by an electromagnetic mode.
  We compare the sensitivity of two specific setup configurations: (i) two adjacent cylindrical cavities placed end-to-end with an end-cap separating them, and (ii) a nested geometry in which the cylindrical receiver is encapsulated within the emitter. We demonstrate that, for a certain range of dark photon masses, the nested configuration with the $\mbox{TM}_{010}$ pump mode can provide enhanced sensitivity compared to an adjacent emitter setup.
  Remarkably, for the $\mbox{TE}_{011}$ pump mode, both the nested and adjacent cavity configurations can yield comparable expected reaches for the specific geometry type.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Dark Photon Dark Matter with the James Webb Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17140v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose an investigation into dark photon dark matter (DPDM) within the infrared frequency band, utilizing highly sensitive infrared light detectors commonly integrated into space telescopes, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The presence of DPDM induces electron oscillations in both the reflectors and the interior of the detectors. Consequently, these oscillating electrons can emit monochromatic electromagnetic waves with a frequency almost equivalent to the mass of DPDM. By estimating the signal generated by DPDM inside the detector and comparing with observation data, we establish constraints on the kinetic mixing between the photon and dark photon within the range [10, 500] THz. Despite JWST not being optimized for DPDM searches, our findings reveal constraints comparable to those obtained from the XENON1T experiment in the laboratory, as well as astrophysical constraints from solar emission. Additionally, we propose to modify the configuration of JWST optical elements to focus the DPDM induced signal onto the detector. By employing the stationary phase approximation, we can demonstrate that when the size of the reflector significantly exceeds the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave, the contribution to the electromagnetic wave field at a given position primarily stems from the surface unit perpendicular to the relative position vector. This simplification results in the reduction of electromagnetic wave calculations to ray optics. We show that by rearranging the position of reflectors, JWST can achieve a sensitivity stronger than the existing limits by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles produced via thermal freeze-out evade many of the strong constraints on heavier DM candidates but at the same time face a multitude of new constraints from laboratory experiments, astrophysical observations and cosmological data. In this work we combine all of these constraints in order to perform frequentist and Bayesian global analyses of fermionic and scalar sub-GeV DM coupled to a dark photon with kinetic mixing. For fermionic DM, we find viable parameter regions close to the dark photon resonance, which expand significantly when including a particle-antiparticle asymmetry. For scalar DM, the velocity-dependent annihilation cross section evades the strongest constraints even in the symmetric case. Using Bayesian model comparison, we show that both asymmetric fermionic DM and symmetric scalar DM are preferred over symmetric fermionic DM due to the reduced fine-tuning penalty. Finally, we explore the discovery prospects of near-future experiments both in the full parameter space and for specific benchmark points. We find that the most commonly used benchmark scenarios are already in tension with existing constraints and propose a new benchmark point that can be targeted with future searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been proposed as an alternative to multilayer perceptrons, suggesting advantages in performance and interpretability. We study a typical binary event classification task in high-energy physics including high-level features and comment on the performance and interpretability of KANs in this context. Consistent with expectations, we find that the learned activation functions of a one-layer KAN resemble the univariate log-likelihood ratios of the respective input features. In deeper KANs, the activations in the first layer differ from those in the one-layer KAN, which indicates that the deeper KANs learn more complex representations of the data, a pattern commonly observed in other deep-learning architectures. We study KANs with different depths and widths and we compare them to multilayer perceptrons in terms of performance and number of trainable parameters. For the chosen classification task, we do not find that KANs are more parameter efficient. However, small KANs may offer advantages in terms of interpretability that come at the cost of only a moderate loss in performance.</description>

      <title>Resonant Forbidden CP Asymmetry from Soft Leptons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To explain the baryon asymmetry in the early universe via leptogenesis, quantum corrections to new particles are commonly invoked to generate the necessary CP asymmetry. We demonstrate, however, that a large CP asymmetry can already arise from Standard Model leptons. The mechanism relies on resummation of soft leptons at finite temperatures. The CP asymmetry, which is kinematically forbidden in vacuum, can be resonantly enhanced from thermally resummed leptons by seven orders of magnitude. Contrary to the resonance from exotic particles, we show that the resonant enhancement from soft leptons is protected by controlled widths under finite-temperature perturbation theory. We quantify such CP asymmetries in leptogenesis with secluded flavor effects and comment on the significance and application. The mechanism exploits the maximal role of leptons themselves, featuring low-scale leptogenesis, minimal model buildings and dark matter cogenesis.</description>

      <title>Constraining the isotropic CPT-odd coefficients of the Standard Model Extension by a combined DUNE and ESSnuSB analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on an analysis that considers the isotropic CPT-odd Standard Model Extension (SME) coefficients, we find new constraints for them coming from a combined DUNE and ESSnuSB fit. Furthermore, we investigate the correlations of the standard oscillation parameters, the leptonic CP-violating phase, $\delta_{CP}$, and the atmospheric mixing angle, $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$, with respect to the SME coefficients $(a_L)^T$. The combination of DUNE and ESSnuSB may establish the strongest limit on the diagonal coefficient $(a_L)_{\mu \mu}^T$ compared to the existing limits in the literature. We also consider the possible effect of the SME coefficient $(a_L)^Z$ on neutrino propagation and discuss how this can affect DUNE limits on the coefficient $(a_L)^T$ found elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of charm mixing parameters and determination of the CKM angle $\gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an updated global analysis of beauty decays sensitive to the angle $\gamma$ of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix and of $D$-meson mixing data in the framework of approximate universality, in which CP violation in $D-\overline{D}$ mixing is described in terms of two universal weak phases corresponding to dispersive and absorptive contributions. We extract the fundamental theoretical parameters determining absorptive and dispersive contributions to $D$ meson mixing and CP violation, together with the angle $\gamma$. The results for the charm mixing parameters are $x_{12} \simeq x = (0.401 \pm 0.043)\%$ and $y_{12} \simeq y = (0.610 \pm 0.017)\%$, while the two CP-violating phases are given by $\phi_2^M = (0.13 \pm 0.70)^{\circ}$ and ${\phi}_2^{\Gamma} = (2.1 \pm 1.6)^{\circ}$. The angle $\gamma$ is found to be $\gamma = (65.7 \pm 2.5)^{\circ}$, in excellent agreement with the indirect determination from the Unitarity Triangle analysis.</description>

      <title>A study of pure multi-strange hadrons production in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energies using HYDJET++ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the present work, we have used the HYDJET++ model to explore the production of pure multi$-$strange hadrons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 2.76 TeV and $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV collision energies, respectively. \textcolor{red}{We have performed simulation to investigate transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) spectra and elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) for $\phi-$meson and $\Omega-$baryons, and compared the results with ALICE experimental data as well as predictions from various phenomenological models across different centrality classes. Furthermore, we have calculated the nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$ and $R_{CP}$), which provide a perception of jet quenching phenomena. Hence, our findings enable the study of the energy and system dependence of $\phi$ and $\Omega$ hadrons production over a wide range of ultra-relativistic collision energies. We also present the particle ratios ( $\Omega/\phi$, $\overline{\Omega}^{+}/\Omega^{-}$, $\Omega/\pi$, and $\phi/\pi$ ), offering insights into the strangeness enhancement and chemical properties of the medium at both LHC collision energies. Additionally, we explored the predictions for $\Omega$-baryon in Pb+Pb collisions at$\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 5.02 TeV, focusing on $R_{AA}$, $R_{CP}$, and particle ratios within the HYDJET++ framework, offering insights into future measurements and particle dynamics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Joint polarizations of W pair production at the LHC at NLO QCD+EW accuracy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present new results of next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak corrections to the doubly polarized $W^+W^-$ production cross sections at the LHC, via the full leptonic final state. This calculation has been recently achieved independently by two groups: one in Germany and our group in Vietnam. A comparison of the two results will be presented. We include also the NLO QCD corrections in the numerical analysis since they are dominant and therefore important for comparison with experimental results. New results of integrated cross section for future proton-proton colliders with $\sqrt{s}=$ $27$ TeV, $50$ TeV, $100$ TeV are provided. Moreover, a detailed explanation of the $\sigma_\text{TT}&gt;\sigma_\text{LT}&gt;\sigma_\text{LL}$ hierarchy based on the Born approximation is given.</description>

      <title>Searching for Gluino LSP at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse relevant signals expected at the LHC, assuming that the gluino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the framework of the $\mu\nu$SSM. In this $R$-parity violating model, the presence of couplings involving right-handed neutrinos solves simultaneously the $\mu$ problem and the accommodations of neutrino masses and mixing angles. We study gluino pair production in quark-antiquark and gluon-gluon collisions. The main decay channels for the gluino LSP are the three-body decays to two quarks and a lepton or a neutrino. In both cases, the leading channels occur for the third family of quarks. We compare the predictions of this scenario with LHC searches for prompt and long-lived particles. To analyse the parameter space we sample the $\mu\nu$SSM for a gluino LSP, paying special attention to reproduce the current experimental data on neutrino and Higgs physics, as well as flavour observables. Our results imply a lower limit on the mass of the gluino LSP of about 2600 GeV, and an upper limit for the decay length of about 6 cm.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays in light of the Lorentz Invariance Violation Effects within the Proton Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tiny Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) effects, potentially arising from quantum gravity-induced spacetime structures, may also manifest in the proton sector, offering a plausible pathway to test Planck-scale physics through high-energy cosmic phenomena. Our analysis reveals that even minuscule LIV effects in the proton sector can significantly elevate the photon threshold energy for photopion production to $\cal {O}$(0.1 to $10^3$ eV), orders of magnitude higher than in Lorentz-symmetric scenarios. Consequently, protons in ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) can propagate for very long distances without significant energy loss via photopion interactions with cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons. This suppression of attenuation may provide a plausible explanation for the observed cosmic-ray events exceeding the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff energy. We further demonstrate that when both leading-order and next-to-leading-order LIV effects are considered, higher-order LIV contributions induce discontinuous transitions in the GZK cutoff energy spectrum. Observations of proton-dominated UHECRs beyond the GZK threshold could provide constraints the LIV energy scale. Offering insights into the ultraviolet regime of LIV theories near the Planck scale, UHECRs may serve as a sensitive probe of LIV and provide a means to test quantum gravity predictions by constraining deviations from Lorentz symmetry in extreme-energy regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy physics requires the generation of large numbers of simulated data samples from complex but analytically tractable distributions called matrix elements. Surrogate models, such as normalizing flows, are gaining popularity for this task due to their computational efficiency. We adopt an approach based on Flow Annealed importance sampling Bootstrap (FAB) that evaluates the differentiable target density during training and helps avoid the costly generation of training data in advance. We show that FAB reaches higher sampling efficiency with fewer target evaluations in high dimensions in comparison to other methods.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Dark Matter Mass through the Scattering of a High-Energy Matter Beam</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The traditional methods of estimating the Dark Matter (DM) mass scale crucially depend on the assumptions about the interaction mechanism between the DM and the Standard Model (SM) sectors, making it challenging to achieve precise mass measurements. However, in case of a successful scattering event of a high-energy matter beam on a DM particle, the DM mass can be directly measured without probing the New Physics (NP) interaction. The present chapter discusses a model-independent kinematical analysis to formulate the DM mass as a function of experimentally observable quantities. The approach can be significant to precisely pin-down the exact mass value of the interacting DM particle and offers insights into the DM-SM interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Particle number diffusion in second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics with momentum-dependent relaxation time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article explores particle number diffusion in relativistic hydrodynamics using kinetic theory with a modified collision kernel that incorporates the momentum dependence of the particle relaxation time. Starting from the Boltzmann equation within the extended relaxation time approximation (ERTA), we derive second-order evolution equations for the dissipative number current and calculate the associated transport coefficients. The sensitivity of transport coefficients to the particle momentum dependence of the collision time scale of the microscopic interactions in the hot QCD medium is analyzed. For a conformal, number-conserving system, we compare the ERTA-modified transport coefficients for particle diffusion with exact results derived from scalar field theory. With an appropriate parameterization of the relaxation time, we demonstrate the consistency of our analysis and assess the degree of agreement of the results with the exact solutions from scalar field theory. The relaxation times for the shear and number diffusion evolution equations are seen to be distinct in general when the momentum dependence of the relaxation time is taken into consideration.</description>

      <title>Status of $\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM featuring a light bino-dominated LSP and a light singlet-like scalar under the LZ Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of a light singlet-like scalar, the bino-dominated dark matter (DM) candidate in the $\mathbb{Z}_3$-symmetric next-to-minimal supersymmetric standard model ($\mathbb{Z}_3$-NMSSM) exhibits notable deviations from its counterpart in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM), both in terms of its inherent properties and the mechanisms determining its relic abundance and detection prospects. Motivated by recent progress in experimental particle physics, this study systematically investigates the implications for the \( \mathbb{Z}_3 \)-NMSSM framework featuring a light bino-dominated DM particle and a light singlet-like scalar, ensuring theoretical consistency with empirical observations. Of particular significance are the latest results from the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) direct detection experiment, supersymmetry (SUSY) searches at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), and precision measurements of the Muon g-2 anomaly at Fermilab, which collectively impose complementary constraints on the model's viable parameter space. A comprehensive parameter scan was conducted using the MultiNest algorithm, incorporating constraints from LZ-2022 data, LHC Higgs analyses, Muon g-2 measurements, and B-physics observables. The analysis reveals that current experimental limits -- particularly those on spin-independent (SI) and spin-dependent (SD) DM-nucleon scattering cross-sections and LHC constraints on electroweakinos -- severely restrict the model. Nevertheless, the framework remains capable of naturally accommodating the observed Z boson and standard model-like Higgs boson masses, accounting for the Muon g-2 anomaly, and inducing sizable corrections to the W boson mass. These results are distinctive to the NMSSM and emerge from the interplay of bino-dominated DM and singlino components, with essential contributions from higgsino.</description>

      <title>Search for CP Violations in the Production and Decay of the Hyperon-Antihyperon Pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a complete joint angular distribution analysis for the process $e^{+}e^{-}\to J/\psi\to B(\to B_1\pi)\bar{B}(\to \bar{B}_1\pi)$ with polarized beams, where $B$ and $B_{1}$ are hyperons. We consider both transverse and longitudinal beam polarization and analyze CP violation in the production and decay of hyperons. We present the complete Fisher information matrix for the sensitivities of the weak decay parameters $\alpha_{-},~\alpha_{+},~\phi_{\Xi}$ and $\bar{\phi}_{\Xi}$, the P-violating term $F_{A}$, and the EDM $d_{B}$ (derived from the CP-violating term $H_{T}$), under the BESIII and STCF statistics. We find that polarization enhances the sensitivity of the parameters. Specifically, longitudinal polarization provides a more significant improvement compared to transverse polarization, with the enhancement being more pronounced for single-step decays than for multi-step decays. With the expected statistics from the BESIII experiment, the estimated EDM sensitivities for $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^{+}$ are on the order of $10^{-19}~e~\rm cm$, while those for $\Xi^{-}$ and $\Xi^{0}$ are $10^{-18}~e~\rm cm$. Furthermore, the STCF experiment is expected to improve these estimates by $1\sim2$ orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>TRANSIT your events into a new mass: Fast background interpolation for weakly-supervised anomaly searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new model for conditional and continuous data morphing called TRansport Adversarial Network for Smooth InTerpolation (TRANSIT). We apply it to create a background data template for weakly-supervised searches at the LHC. The method smoothly transforms sideband events to match signal region mass distributions. We demonstrate the performance of TRANSIT using the LHC Olympics R\&amp;D dataset. The model captures non-linear mass correlations of features and produces a template that offers a competitive anomaly sensitivity compared to state-of-the-art transport-based template generators. Moreover, the computational training time required for TRANSIT is an order of magnitude lower than that of competing deep learning methods. This makes it ideal for analyses that iterate over many signal regions and signal models. Unlike generative models, which must learn a full probability density distribution, i.e., the correlations between all the variables, the proposed transport model only has to learn a smooth conditional shift of the distribution. This allows for a simpler, more efficient residual architecture, enabling mass uncorrelated features to pass the network unchanged while the mass correlated features are adjusted accordingly. Furthermore, we show that the latent space of the model provides a set of mass decorrelated features useful for anomaly detection without background sculpting.</description>

      <title>A Classical Interpretation of the Nonrelativistic Quark Potential Model: Color Charge Definition and the Meson Mass-Radius Relationship</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is the fundamental theory describing quark interactions, and various quark models based on QCD have been widely used to study the properties of hadrons, including their structures and mass spectra. However, unlike Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) and the Bohr model of the hydrogen atom, there is no direct classical analogy for hadronic structures.This paper presents a classical interpretation of the nonrelativistic quark potential model, providing a more intuitive and visualizable description of strong interactions through the quantitative formulation of color charge and color flux.Furthermore, we establish the relationship between meson mass and its structural radius in the nonrelativistic framework and estimate the key parameters of our model using available data from $\eta_b(1S)$ and $\Upsilon(1S)$. We then extend this relationship to a broader range of excited meson states, obtaining structural radii that show good agreement with the root mean square (RMS) radius or charge radius predicted by QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>More about quark Yukawa textures from selection rules without group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the coupling selection rules associated with non-group symmetries, i.e., $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We clarify which Yukawa textures can be derived by our selection rules for $M=3, 4$, and 5, and obtain various textures including the the nearest neighbor interaction type and its extension. Some of them cannot be realized by a conventional group-like symmetry. They lead to interesting phenomenology such as a solution to the strong CP problem without axion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Asymptotic grand unification models can be constructed in five dimensions compactified on an orbifold. We demonstrate that the parameter space of such models admit solutions that naturally achieve the baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis, these solutions indicating that the scale of the extra dimensions is much higher than the TeV scale.</description>

      <title>The role of chiral symmetry and the non-ordinary $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ nature in $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the use of realistic $\pi K$ interactions, obtained from a dispersive analysis of scattering data, as well as relativistic corrections, are essential to describe recently observed $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations. We demonstrate that the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking dynamics and the non-ordinary features of the $\kappa/K^*_0(700)$ resonance, together with large cancellations between isospin channels, produce a large suppression of $\pi^\pm K_S$ femtoscopic correlations compared to widely used models. Within an improved version of the standard on-shell factorization formalism, we illustrate that compensating for this interaction suppression leads to source radii smaller than 1 fm, contrary to usual expectations, as well as larger correlation strengths. The relation between these two parameters cannot be accommodated within naive models describing the nature of the resonances. This may raise concerns about the applicability of popular but too simple approaches for systems with light mesons. However, the correlation-suppression effects we demonstrate here will be relevant in any formalism, and substantial corrections may be expected for other femtoscopic systems involving light mesons.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}}$ helicity amplitudes and transition form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently reported new results on the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to \Delta(1700)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition form factors using a symmetry-preserving treatment of a vector$\,\otimes\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) within a coupled formalism based on the Dyson-Schwinger, Bethe-Salpeter, and Faddeev equations. In this work, we extend our investigation to the $\gamma^{(*)} + N(940)\frac{1}{2}^+ \to N(1520)\frac{3}{2}^{-}$ transition. Our computed transition form factors show reasonable agreement with experimental data at large photon virtualities. However, deviations emerge at low $Q^2$, where experimental results exhibit a sharper variation than theoretical predictions. This discrepancy is expected, as these continuum QCD analyses account only for the quark-core of baryons, while low photon virtualities are dominated by meson cloud effects. We anticipate that these analytical predictions, based on the simplified SCI framework, will serve as a valuable benchmark for more refined studies and QCD-based truncations that incorporate quark angular momentum and the contributions of scalar and vector diquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the phenomenology of choosing a minimal set of effective operators simultaneously generating the dark matter relic density and matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. Neutrino masses are obtained in a specific case of baryogenesis via leptogenesis. We find that only two new particles -- a heavy unstable fermion and a light dark matter scalar -- need to be included in addition to the Standard Model particle content.</description>

Abstract: Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy Problem is not a formal problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation -- the explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson. Without the solution to this problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic fluctuations of momentum and angular momentum of heavy quarks in the pre-equilibrium stage of pA collisions at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate the real-time evolution of the $SU(3)$-glasma generated in the early stages of high-energy proton-nucleus collisions, employing classical lattice gauge theory techniques. Our setup incorporates a realistic modeling of the proton's internal structure and includes longitudinal fluctuations in the initial state, enabling the study of genuinely non-boost-invariant collision dynamics. Focusing on the momentum and angular momentum anisotropies of heavy quarks in the infinite mass limit, we find that the system retains significant anisotropy well beyond the characteristic timescale $\tau = 1/Q_s$. This persistence of anisotropy is further confirmed in the more realistic, non-boost-invariant scenario, across a range of fluctuation amplitudes. These findings pave the way for future investigations involving dynamical heavy quarks and more quantitative initializations of the glasma.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the WIMP quality problem and R-parity violation in natural supersymmetry with all axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In supersymmetric models where the mu problem is solved via discrete R-symmetries, then both the global U(1)_{PQ} (Peccei-Quinn, needed to solve the strong CP problem) and R-parity conservation (RPC, needed for proton stability) are expected to arise as accidental, approximate symmetries. Then in some cases, SUSY dark matter is expected to be all axions since the relic lightest SUSY particles (LSPs) can decay away via small R-parity violating (RPV) couplings. We examine several aspects of this {\it all axion} SUSY dark matter scenario. 1. We catalogue the operator suppression which is gained from discrete R-symmetry breaking via four two-extra-field base models. 2. We present exact tree-level LSP decay rates including mixing and phase space effects and compare to results from simple, approximate formulae. 3. Natural SUSY models are characterized by light higgsinos with mass ~100-350 GeV so that the dominant sparticle production cross sections at LHC14 are expected to be higgsino pair production which occurs at the 10^2-10^4 fb level. Assuming nature is natural, the lack of an RPV signal from higgsino pair production in LHC data translates into rather strong upper bounds on nearly all trilinear RPV couplings in order to render the SUSY signal (nearly) invisible. Thus, in natural SUSY models with light higgsinos, the RPV-couplings must be small enough that the LSP has a rather high quality of RPC.</description>

      <title>Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT): An innovative framework for yielding scale and scheme invariant observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Scale Factorized-Quantum Field Theory (SF-QFT), a framework that performs path-integral factorization of ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR) momentum modes at a physical scale $Q^*$ before perturbative expansion. This approach yields a UV-finite effective action whose Wilson coefficients $C_i(Q)$ and coupling $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ are fixed by matching to experiment. Because the two-loop $\beta$-function is universal in massless QCD, $a_{\mathrm{eff}}(Q)$ evolves with a scheme-independent equation, with higher-order $\beta$-coefficients absorbed into the $C_i$. Applying SF-QFT to the inclusive ratio $R_{e^{+}e^{-}}$ gives $R^{\mathrm{SF-QFT}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV}) = 1.05221 \pm 0.0007$, in excellent agreement with experiment ($R^{\mathrm{exp}}(31.6\,\mathrm{GeV})= 1.0527 \pm 0.005$) while requiring orders of magnitude fewer calculations than a conventional four-loop $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ approach. We find universal algebraic recursion relations that generate all higher-order contributions without additional Feynman diagrams, yielding scheme-invariant predictions with remarkable convergence with a closed-form solution. SF-QFT provides a rigorous proof for the existence of a positive mass gap in Yang-Mills theory, resolving one of the Millennium Prize Problems by demonstrating how non-perturbative effects emerge naturally from the path-integral factorization. For QED, the same formalism integrates out high-energy modes above $Q^*$, producing scheme-independent predictions for the electron anomalous magnetic moment with unprecedented precision ($a_e^{\text{theory}} = 0.001\,159\,652\,180\,61(76))$). SF-QFT heralds a paradigm shift in quantum field theory, replacing the pursuit of ever-higher loop orders with a unified framework that handles both perturbative and non-perturbative physics while maintaining manifest gauge invariance and eliminating renormalization ambiguities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11234v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our investigation of the effective string model for the triply heavy quark system, mimicking that in pure $SU(3)$ gauge theory. We present analytical and numerical studies of the three-quark potential for isosceles and collinear geometries. In the general case, we derive the asymptotic expression of the potential in the infrared limit. Here we also demonstrate the universality of the string tension and interpret the transition between two distinct regimes, occurring when one of the triangle's angles formed by the quarks is equal to $\frac{2}{3}\pi$, as a breaking of permutational symmetry. This symmetry breaking implies the emergence of a heavy quark dressed by gluons, transforming in the two-index antisymmetric representation. Additionally, we discuss various aspects of the $Y$- and $\Delta$-laws, diquarks, and connections to lattice QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extension of the standard model to include a single scalar or vector leptoquark has been shown to account for the observed deviations in the lepton flavor universality ratios in the $b \to c \ell \nu_{\ell}$ and $b \to s \ell \ell$ transitions. Exploring new physics in the $b \to c \tau \nu_{\tau}$ decays, in this work we analyze the baryonic decay channels $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_{c}^{*}(2595,2625) \tau^- \bar{\nu}_\tau$ beyond the standard model. Specifically, we investigate the role of leptoquarks in these decays, focusing on the $U_1$ vector leptoquark and the $S_1$ scalar leptoquark. Employing recent lattice QCD results for the $\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_{c}^{*}$ form factors, the helicity amplitudes for all possible four-fermion interactions are worked out explicitly and presented here. Utilizing the current $b \to c \ell \nu_{\ell}$ experimental data, we impose constraints on the leptoquark couplings and test new physics sensitivity of various observables for the decay processes under consideration. Our analysis demonstrates the significance of testing the lepton flavor universality ratio $R_{\Lambda_{c}^{*}}$ as it is observed to be particularly sensitive to these leptoquarks.</description>

Abstract: The dynamical diquark model describes multiquark exotic hadrons in terms of diquark components nucleated by heavy quarks, and successfully explains multiple features of hidden-charm and -bottom exotics. Here we apply the model to the marginally heavy case of hidden-strange states to probe whether mesons near 2 GeV with peculiar properties, such as $\phi(2170)$, $f_2(2340)$, and X(2370), are possible tetraquark candidates. We calculate spin-multiplet average masses using potentials obtained through lattice simulations and quark models, and we also describe the detailed spectra of the expected multiplets as a diagnostic to discern the nature of future hadrons likely to be discovered in this mass region by experiments at facilities such as BESIII, JLab, and the EIC.</description>

      <title>SU(3) flavor symmetry analysis of hyperon non-leptonic two body decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper present a systematic study of hyperon non-leptonic two-body decays induced by light quark transitions, particularly the $s \rightarrow u\bar{u}d$ process, within the framework of SU(3) flavor symmetry. The effective weak Hamiltonian is decomposed into irreducible SU(3) representations, including the 27-plet and octet components, and applied to analyze decays of octet and decuplet baryons and charmed baryons. Both the irreducible representation amplitude (IRA) approach and the topological diagrammatic analysis (TDA) are employed to construct decay amplitudes and constrain the parameter space. SU(3) symmetry-breaking effects arising from the strange quark mass are incorporated systematically. A global fit to current experimental data allows us to extract form factors and predict branching ratios and asymmetry parameters for several decay channels, including $\Lambda^0 \rightarrow p\pi^-$, $\Sigma^+ \rightarrow p\pi^0$, and $\Omega^- \rightarrow \Xi^0\pi^-$. Our results demonstrate the predictive power of SU(3) flavor symmetry while highlighting significant symmetry-breaking effects, especially in amplitudes related to the 27-plet. Notably, the $\Sigma^+ \rightarrow p\pi^0$ decay channel exhibits a deviation exceeding $1\sigma$ from experimental measurements, suggesting the possible presence of new decay mechanisms or contributions beyond the Standard Model. This work provides a systematic framework for future tests of the Standard Model and the search for new physics in hyperon decays.</description>

      <title>Modified Kerr black holes surrounded by dark matter spike</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study supermassive black holes (SMBH), surrounded by a dark matter (DM) spike, that can be found at the centers of Milky Way and $\text{M87}$ galaxies and are accompanied by a specific kind of topological defect. The investigation is developed within the framework of Bumblebee Gravity with a global monopole (BGGM). The dark matter spike is described by a power-law density profile. Our main objective is to assess how the background arising from spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking and the presence of a global monopole influence the properties of the Kerr BH within the region affected by the spike. Using a spherically symmetric static BH with BGGM properties as the seed metric, we construct a non-rotating spacetime with a DM spike, resulting in a BGGM-motivated Schwarzschild-like BH by solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations (TOV). Next, we extend this approach to the case of a rotating spacetime resulting in the BGGM-motivated Kerr-like BH (BGMKLBH). This approach allows us to explore the spacetime structure, and the BGMKLBH shadows. Then, using available observational data for the DM spike density and considering the effects of BGGM on $\text{Sgr A}^{*}$ and $\text{M87}^{*}$ SMBHs, we analyse the shapes of their shadows and put constraints on the BGGM parameter. Thus, we infer that the BGMKLBHs could be reliable candidates for the astrophysical BHs.</description>

      <title>Cosmology of Quasi-Dilaton Massive Gravity with Non-minimal Kinetic Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce an extension of the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory and derive the field equations by varying the action with respect to the metric. This extension elucidates the dynamics of the system and demonstrates how it can encompass and recover previous cosmological models through different parameter values. We present the cosmological background equations to analyze self-accelerating solutions that can explain the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe, driven by an effective cosmological constant arising from massive gravity. Besides, we apply the quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling to a Type Ia Supernovae (SNIa) data set to test its viability. Our findings indicate that the theory is able to account for the observed acceleration of the expansion of the universe without invoking dark energy. In addition, we carry out a comprehensive perturbation analysis examining tensor, vector, and scalar perturbations independently. We derive the dispersion relation of gravitational waves in a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmology and determine the stability conditions of the system. Such an analysis results in a sharper quasi-dilaton massive gravity theory with non-minimal kinetic coupling by ensuring the stability conditions of the system are maintained and that strong constraints on theory parameters are provided.</description>

      <title>Berry Curvature and Spin-One Color Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay between Berry curvature and topological properties in single-flavor color superconductors, where quarks form spin-one Cooper pairs. By deriving a new relation, we connect the topological nodal structure of the gap function in momentum space to the (nonabelian) Berry flux associated with paired quarks. This generalizes the early work by Li and Haldane [Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 067003 (2018)] to systems with additional internal quantum numbers, such as color. In the ultrarelativistic limit, we uncover rich topological structures driven by the interplay of spin, chirality, and color. Specifically, we identify chirality-induced topological nodes in the transverse (opposite chirality pairing) polar and A phases. In contrast, the color-spin-locking phase lacks these nodes due to a nontrivial color Berry flux, which in turn induces gapless excitations with total Berry monopole charges of $\pm 3/2-$differing from conventional Weyl fermions. Our findings can be potentially extended to other fermionic systems carrying additional internal degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Classical Observables from Causal Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of classical observables from causal response functions, following up on recent work by Caron-Huot at al. [JHEP 01 (2024) 139]. We derive a formula to compute asymptotic in-in observables from a particular soft limit of five-point amputated response functions. Using such formula, we re-derive the formulas by Kosower, Maybee and O'Connell (KMOC) for the linear impulse and radiated linear momentum of particles undergoing scattering, and we present an unambiguous calculation of the radiated angular momentum at leading order. Then, we explore the consequences of manifestly causal Feynman rules in the calculation of classical observables by employing the causal (Keldysh) basis in the in-in formalism. We compute the linear impulse, radiated waveform and its variance at leading and/or next-to-leading order in the causal basis, and find that all terms singular in the $\hbar \to 0$ limit cancel manifestly at the integrand level. We also find that the calculations simplify considerably and classical properties such as factorization of six-point amplitudes are more transparent in the causal basis.</description>

      <title>Unitarity constrains the quantum information metrics for particle interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unitarity provides mathematical and physical constraints on quantum information systems. e.g., in entanglement swapping, unitarity requires the same von Neumann entanglement entropy generation for either a particle interaction or an act of measurement. For the first time, the language of non-relativistic quantum mechanics is presented to derive the density matrix for hard scattering. We show that unitarity allows for finding the latter's cross section without using the scattering amplitude or the Lippmann-Schwinger equation plus Green's function. We also show the language of relativistic quantum mechanics can be used to derive the momentum entropy or Sackur-Tetrode equation for the inelastic scattering of an electron from a proton. The latter entropy derives from a Shannon entropy and an additional entropy that evokes the uncertainty principle. This article's presentation allows particle physicists to readily begin calculating quantum information metrics such as correlations and mutual information for any particle interaction.</description>

      <title>The nucleon properties in finite temperature and density with Gaussian fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of nucleons at finite temperature and density using a two-flavor quark meson model with Gaussian fluctuations that extend beyond the mean-field approximation. Our findings suggest that Gaussian fluctuations lead to a non-monotonic behavior of the nucleon mass as a function of temperature and density, which may play an important role in the study of the hadronization process of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Moreover, we observe an increase in the nucleon radius due to Gaussian fluctuations, suggesting an effective repulsive force akin to the Casimir effect, as observed in the gold-bromobenzene-silica system. This study offers new insights into how temperature, density, and quantum fluctuations affect the structure and properties of nucleons under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used ("classic") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as "special trajectories." Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For several independent reasons, the idea that notorious sources of entropy could exist in the Universe has been recently revived. Taking advantage of a new framework accounting for non-equilibrium processes in cosmology, we explicitly investigate the cosmological dynamics as a function of the entropy production, focusing on the stability of the system. An exhaustive investigation is performed. As the main physical conclusion, we show that for a wide class of entropy source terms, the fluid dynamics converges towards an effective cosmological constant. Constraints on the associated entropic force are also obtained.</description>

      <title>First Axion-Like Particle Results from a Broadband Search for Wave-Like Dark Matter in the 44 to 52 $\mu$eV Range with a Coaxial Dish Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results from the first axion-like particle search conducted using a dish antenna. The experiment was conducted at room temperature and sensitive to axion-like particles in the $44-52\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ range ($10.7 - 12.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$). The novel dish antenna geometry was proposed by the BREAD collaboration and previously used to conduct a dark photon search in the same mass range. To allow for axion-like particle sensitivity, the BREAD dish antenna was placed in a $3.9\,\mathrm{T}$ solenoid magnet at Argonne National Laboratory. In the presence of a magnetic field, axion-like dark matter converts to photons at the conductive surface of the reflector. The signal is focused onto a custom coaxial horn antenna and read out with a low-noise radio-frequency receiver. No evidence of axion-like dark matter was observed in this mass range and we place the most stringent laboratory constraints on the axion-photon coupling strength, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}$, in this mass range at 90\% confidence.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes as cosmic expansion accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel and natural mechanism for cosmic acceleration driven by primordial black holes (PBHs) exhibiting repulsive behavior. Using a new ``Swiss Cheese'' cosmological approach, we demonstrate that this cosmic acceleration mechanism is a general phenomenon by examining three regular black hole spacetimes - namely the Hayward, Bardeen and Dymnikova spacetimes - as well as the singular de Sitter-Schwarzschild spacetime. Interestingly, by matching these black hole spacetimes with an isotropic and homogeneous expanding Universe, we obtain a phase of cosmic acceleration that ends at an energy scale characteristic to the black hole parameters or due to black hole evaporation. This cosmic acceleration mechanism can be relevant either to an inflationary phase with a graceful exit and reheating or to an early dark energy type of contribution pertinent to the Hubble tension. Remarkably, we find that ultra-light PBHs with masses $m&lt;5\times 10^8\mathrm{g}$ dominating the energy content of the Univese before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, can drive a successful inflationary expansion era without the use of an inflaton field. Additionally, PBHs with masses $m \sim 10^{12}\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $0.107 &lt; \Omega^\mathrm{eq}_\mathrm{PBH}&lt; 0.5$, slightly before matter-radiation equality, can produce a substantial amount of early dark energy, helping to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter heating in planets has been proposed as a potential probe for dark matter detection. Assuming near-equilibrium conditions, we find that the energy input from dark matter raises planetary temperatures and accelerates rotation. The distribution of energy between heating and rotational acceleration depends on both planetary properties and external inputs, suggesting that previous studies may have overestimated the heating contribution. At high dark matter densities, planetary rotation stabilizes earlier and becomes primarily governed by dark matter effects.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Emerges from Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a dynamical dark energy component predicted by massive gravity gives rise to a distinctive evolution of the equation of state. This scenario is favoured over the standard $\Lambda$CDM model when confronted with the latest combined datasets from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and supernova observations. The model stands out as a rare example of a healthy, self-consistent theory that accommodates phantom dark energy while maintaining a technically natural, small asymptotic cosmological constant. Our analysis indicates a preferred graviton mass of approximately $4.0 \times 10^{-33} \text{eV}$, suggesting the emergence of a new cosmological length scale. This leads to a maximal deviation of the equation of state around $z \sim 3$, a prediction that will be robustly tested by upcoming, deeper surveys of baryon acoustic oscillations.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial scalar perturbations that reenter the horizon after inflation may induce a second-order Gravitational Wave spectrum with information about the primordial Universe on scales inaccessible to Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. In this work, we develop a general framework for the study of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves in Palatini $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that was proven to successfully realise inflation and quintessence, and consider the case of the Starobinsky-like model as an example. A regime of radiation domination with a subdominant matter component is assumed, allowing for a well-motivated perturbative approach to the gravity modifications. We calculate the kernel function and the density spectrum numerically and find accurate analytical expressions. The spectral density, which may be tested across a wide range of frequencies by upcoming Gravitational Wave experiments, is shown to differ from the General Relativity and metric $f(R)$ gravity predictions under certain conditions. We comment on previous results in the literature regarding the metric formulation and make special emphasis on the potential of these distinctive features of the spectrum to probe the two formalisms of gravity.</description>
