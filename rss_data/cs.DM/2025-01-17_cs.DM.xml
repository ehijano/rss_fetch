      <title>Block Designs and K-Geodetic Graphs: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: K-geodetic graphs (K capital) are defined as graphs in which each pair of nonadjacent vertices has at most K paths of minimum length between them. A K-geodetic graph is geodetic if K=1, bigeodetic if K=2 and trigeodetic if K=3. K-geodetic graphs are applied effectively to the solution of several practical problems in distinct areas of computer science, hence the importance of their study. Four problems are central to the study of K-geodetic graphs, namely, characterization, construction, enumeration and classification. The problems of finding the general classification of K-geodetic graphs for each of their classes K=1,2,3 are open. The present paper is a survey dedicated to the construction of K-geodetic graphs for K=1,2,3 using balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs). To this purpose, we use block designs as combinatorial structures defined in terms of completely predetermined parameters, which is essential for the easy construction of the K-geodetic graphs described in this survey.</description>

      <title>On a Variant of the Minimum Path Cover Problem in Acyclic Digraphs: Computational Complexity Results and Exact Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Minimum Path Cover (MPC) problem consists of finding a minimum-cardinality set of node-disjoint paths that cover all nodes in a given graph. We explore a variant of the MPC problem on acyclic digraphs (DAGs) where, given a subset of arcs, each path within the MPC should contain at least one arc from this subset. We prove that the feasibility problem is strongly NP-hard on arbitrary DAGs, but the problem can be solved in polynomial time when the DAG is the transitive closure of a path.
  Given that the problem may not always be feasible, our solution focuses on covering a maximum number of nodes with a minimum number of node-disjoint paths, such that each path includes at least one arc from the predefined subset of arcs. This paper introduces and investigates two integer programming formulations for this problem. We propose several valid inequalities to enhance the linear programming relaxations, employing them as cutting planes in a branch-and-cut approach. The procedure is implemented and tested on a wide range of instances, including real-world instances derived from an airline crew scheduling problem, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Obstructions and dualities for matroid depth parameters</title>

Abstract: Contraction$^*$-depth is considered to be one of the analogues of graph tree-depth in the matroid setting. In this paper, we investigate structural properties of contraction$^*$-depth of matroids representable over finite fields and rationals. In particular, we prove that the obstructions for contraction$^*$-depth for these classes of matroids are bounded in size. From this we derive analogous results for related notions of contraction-depth and deletion-depth. Moreover, we define a dual notion to contraction$^*$-depth, named deletion$^*$-depth, for $\mathbb{F}$-representable matroids, and by duality extend our results from contraction$^*$-depth to this notion.</description>

      <title>Composable Constraint Models for Permutation Enumeration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17581v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Constraint programming (CP) is a powerful tool for modeling mathematical concepts and objects and finding both solutions or counter examples. One of the major strengths of CP is that problems can easily be combined or expanded. In this paper, we illustrate that this versatility makes CP an ideal tool for exploring problems in permutation patterns.
  We declaratively define permutation properties, permutation pattern avoidance and containment constraints using CP and show how this allows us to solve a wide range of problems. We show how this approach enables the arbitrary composition of these conditions, and also allows the easy addition of extra conditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques by modelling the containment and avoidance of six permutation patterns, eight permutation properties and measuring five statistics on the resulting permutations. In addition to calculating properties and statistics for the generated permutations, we show that arbitrary additional constraints can also be easily and efficiently added.
  This approach enables mathematicians to investigate permutation pattern problems in a quick and efficient manner. We demonstrate the utility of constraint programming for permutation patterns by showing how we can easily and efficiently extend the known permutation counts for a conjecture involving the class of $1324$ avoiding permutations. For this problem, we expand the enumeration of $1324$-avoiding permutations with a fixed number of inversions to permutations of length 16 and show for the first time that in the enumeration there is a pattern occurring which follows a unique sequence on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences.</description>

      <title>On the generalized coloring numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{coloring number} $\mathrm{col}(G)$ of a graph $G$, which is equal to the \emph{degeneracy} of $G$ plus one, provides a very useful measure for the uniform sparsity of $G$. The coloring number is generalized by three series of measures, the \emph{generalized coloring numbers}. These are the \emph{$r$-admissibility} $\mathrm{adm}_r(G)$, the \emph{strong $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{col}_r(G)$ and the \emph{weak $r$-coloring number} $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)$, where $r$ is an integer parameter. The generalized coloring numbers measure the edge density of bounded-depth minors and thereby provide an even more uniform measure of sparsity of graphs. They have found many applications in graph theory and in particular play a key role in the theory of bounded expansion and nowhere dense graph classes introduced by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez. We overview combinatorial and algorithmic applications of the generalized coloring numbers, emphasizing new developments in this area. We also present a simple proof for the existence of uniform orders and improve known bounds, e.g., for the weak coloring numbers on graphs with excluded topological minors.</description>

      <title>Pattern Avoidance for Fibonacci Sequences using $k$-Regular Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two $k$-ary Fibonacci recurrences are $a_k(n) = a_k(n-1) + k \cdot a_k(n-2)$ and $b_k(n) = k \cdot b_k(n-1) + b_k(n-2)$. We provide a simple proof that $a_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n] = \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that avoid patterns $\{121, 123, 132, 213\}$ when using base cases $a_k(0) = a_k(1) = 1$ for any $k \geq 1$. This was previously proven by Kuba and Panholzer in the context of Wilf-equivalence for restricted Stirling permutations, and it creates Simion and Schmidt's classic result on the Fibonacci sequence when $k=1$, and the Jacobsthal sequence when $k=2$. We complement this theorem by proving that $b_k(n)$ is the number of $k$-regular words over $[n]$ that avoid $\{122, 213\}$ with $b_k(0) = b_k(1) = 1$ for any~$k \geq 2$. Finally, we conjecture that $|Av^{2}_{n}(\underline{121}, 123, 132, 213)| = a_1(n)^2$ for $n \geq 0$. That is, vincularizing the Stirling pattern in Kuba and Panholzer's Jacobsthal result gives the Fibonacci-squared numbers.</description>

      <title>The Identity Problem in virtually solvable matrix groups over algebraic numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Tits alternative states that a finitely generated matrix group either contains a nonabelian free subgroup $F_2$, or it is virtually solvable. This paper considers two decision problems in virtually solvable matrix groups: the Identity Problem (does a given finitely generated subsemigroup contain the identity matrix?), and the Group Problem (is a given finitely generated subsemigroup a group?). We show that both problems are decidable in virtually solvable matrix groups over the field of algebraic numbers $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. Our proof also extends the decidability result for nilpotent groups by Bodart, Ciobanu, Metcalfe and Shaffrir, and the decidability result for metabelian groups by Dong (STOC'24). Since the Identity Problem and the Group Problem are known to be undecidable in matrix groups containing $F_2 \times F_2$, our result significantly reduces the decidability gap for both decision problems.</description>
