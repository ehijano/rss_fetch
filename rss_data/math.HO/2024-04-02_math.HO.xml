      <description>arXiv:2404.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this expository paper is to present the basics of geometric control theory suitable for advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate students with a solid background in advanced calculus and ordinary differential equations.</description>

      <title>Some mathematical and geometrical interpretations of the Sator Square</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1738, the King of Naples and future King of Spain, Carlos III, commissioned the Spanish military engineer Roque Joaqu\'in de Alcubierre to begin the excavations of the ruins of the ancient Roman city of Pompeii and its surroundings, buried by the terrible explosion of Vesuvius in AD 79. Since that time, archaeologists have brought to light wonderful treasures found in the among ruins. Among them, the Sator Square is one of the most peculiar, apparently simple but mysterious. Supernatural and medicinal powers have been attributed to this object and its use was widespread during the Middle Age. Studies to explain its origin and meaning have been varied. There are theories that relate it to religion, the occult, medicine and music. However, no explanation has been convincing beyond pseudo-scientific sensationalism. In this study, the author intends to eliminate the mystical character of the Sator Square and suggests considering it as a simple palindrome or a game of words with certain symmetrical properties. However, these properties are not exclusive to the Sator Suare but are present in various mathematical and geometric objects.</description>

      <title>The Brioschi Formula for the Gaussian Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Brioschi formula expresses the Gaussian curvature $K$ in terms of the functions $E, F$ and $G$ in local coordinates of a surface $S$. This implies the Gauss' theorema egregium, which says that the Gaussian curvature just depends on angles, distances, and their rates of change.
  In most of the textbooks, the Gauss' theorema egregium was proved as a corollary to the derivation of the Gauss equations, a set of equations expressing $EK, FK$ and $GK$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols can be expressed in terms of $E$, $F$ and $G$. In principle, one can derive the Brioschi formula from the Gauss equations after some tedious calculations.
  In this note, we give a direct elementary proof of the Brioschi formula without using Christoffel symbols. The key to the proof are properties of matrices and determinants.</description>

      <title>Leveraging guidelines for ethical practice of statistics and computing to develop standards for ethical mathematical practice: A White Paper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.09311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of our NSF-funded project in which we alpha- and beta- tested a survey comprising all aspects of the ethical practice standards from two disciplines with relevance to mathematics, the American Statistical Association (ASA) and Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). Items were modified so that text such as "A computing professional should..." became, "The ethical mathematics practitioner...". We also removed elements that were duplicates or were deemed unlikely to be considered relevant to mathematical practice even after modification. Starting with more than 100 items, plus 10 demographic questions, the final survey included 52 items (plus demographics), and 142 individuals responded to our invitations (through listservs and other widespread emails and announcements) to participate in this 30-minute survey. This white paper reports the project methods and findings regarding the community perspective on the 52 items, specifically, which rise to the level of ethical obligations, which do not meet this level, and what is missing from this list of elements of ethical mathematical practice. The results suggest that the community of mathematicians perceives a much wider range of behaviors to be subject to ethical practice standards than is currently represented.</description>

      <title>Linear Algebra In A Jiffy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every $n$-tuple in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ has a first non-zero entry and a last non-zero entry. What do the positions of such entries in the elements of a subspace W of $\mathbb{F}^{n}$ reveal about W? It turns out, a great deal! This insight offers a beeline to the fundamental results on general bases and dimension (including dimensions of complements, rank of a transpose, Rank-Nullity Theorem, Full Rank Factorization, and existence/uniqueness of RREF), bypassing some of the traditional stumbling blocks and time sinks.</description>
