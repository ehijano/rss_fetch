      <title>How to Build an Empirical Speed Distribution for Dark Matter in the Solar Neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter flux in a direct detection experiment depends on its local speed distribution. This distribution has been inferred from simulations of Milky Way-like galaxies, but such models serve only as proxies given that no simulation directly captures the detailed evolution of our own Galaxy. This motivates alternative approaches which obtain this distribution directly from observations. In this work, we utilize 98 Milky Way analogues from the IllustrisTNG50 simulation to develop and validate a procedure for inferring the dark matter speed distribution using the kinematics of nearby stars. We find that the dark matter that originated from old mergers, plus that from recent non-luminous accretions, is well described by a Maxwell-Boltzmann speed distribution centered at the local standard-of-rest velocity. Meanwhile, recently accreted dark matter from massive mergers has speeds that can be traced from the associated stellar debris of these events. The stellar populations systematically underestimate the velocity dispersion of their dark matter counterparts, but a simple kinematic boost brings the two into good alignment. Using the TNG50 host galaxies, we demonstrate that combining these two contributions provides an accurate reconstruction of the local dark matter speeds. As an application of the procedure to our own Galaxy, we utilize stellar kinematic data from Gaia to quantify how the dark matter remnants from the Milky Way's last major merger impact its speed distribution in the Solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Shadows of the Colossus: Hierarchical Black Hole Mergers in a 10-million-body Globular Cluster Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO/Virgo/Kagra (LVK) Collaboration has detected numerous binary black hole mergers with properties that challenge standard binary evolution scenarios, such as component masses above the pair-instability gap and high spin magnitudes. Dense stellar environments such as globular clusters provide a natural channel for producing such systems through hierarchical mergers, where black hole remnants formed in earlier mergers are retained in the cluster and undergo successive mergers. However, gravitational-wave recoil kicks often eject merger remnants from typical globular clusters, which limits hierarchical growth. Massive clusters with deeper potential wells, such as those found in giant elliptical galaxies like M87, may overcome this barrier, but direct simulations of such massive globular clusters remains computationally challenging. In this study, we present a 10-million-body cluster simulation performed with the $\texttt{Cluster Monte Carlo}$ ($\texttt{CMC}$) code, referred to as $\texttt{colossus}$, which serves as a proxy for the most massive low-metallicity globular clusters observed in the local Universe. This simulation demonstrates that extended chains of hierarchical mergers can occur in massive globular clusters, producing black holes up to fifth generation with masses approaching $250\,M_\odot$, comparable to the most massive LVK events observed to date (e.g., GW231123). Combining the $\texttt{colossus}$ simulation with the previous $\texttt{CMC Cluster Catalog}$, we develop a framework to extrapolate binary black hole merger predictions for the thousands of globular clusters seen in the Virgo Supercluster.</description>

      <title>The velocity dispersion profile of nine open clusters in the solar neighborhood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the velocity dispersion profiles of nine open clusters in the solar neighborhood using kinematic data from Gaia DR 3, aiming to identify potential dynamical signatures of stellar-mass black holes through a comparison of theoretical and observed dispersion profiles. The selected clusters include LP2373 gp4, NGC 1980, NGC 2451A, NGC 2516, NGC 3532, NGC 6475, UBC 7, Praesepe, and Pleiades. We refine the center positions of the clusters with the Meanshift algorithm. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we calculate the velocity dispersion for each cluster and construct one-dimensional velocity dispersion profiles. NGC 2516, NGC 3532, and NGC 6475 show potential central cusps in their radial velocity dispersion profiles, which may indicate the presence of stellar-mass black holes. LP2373 gp4, NGC 6475, and Praesepe all display a negative correlation between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, indicating these clusters are approaching energy equipartition or expanding. NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit a positive dependence between velocity dispersion and stellar mass, which may be attributed to the preferential ejection of massive stars following dynamical interactions involving binaries or black holes. These two clusters are the only two that are dynamical not relaxed and are closest to virial equilibrium. We compare the observations with N-body simulations of star clusters. A comparison of observed and simulated velocity dispersion profiles reveals that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 exhibit lower proper motion dispersions than model clusters. Better agreement with the observed profiles is achieved for model clusters with larger ages. This suggests that the observed clusters may have undergone rapid dynamical evolution. Our results suggest that NGC 2516 and NGC 3532 may host at least two stellar-mass black holes each.</description>

      <title>Under Pressure: Decoding the Effect of High Densities on Derived Nebular Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations have uncovered a population of compact, high-redshift ($z&gt;6$) galaxies exhibiting extreme nebular conditions and enhanced nitrogen abundances that challenge standard chemical evolution paradigms. We present a joint UV and optical abundance analysis using a new suite of $\texttt{Cloudy}$ photoionization models covering a wide density range ($n_e=10^2-10^9$ cm$^{-3}$), combined with HST and JWST spectroscopy for a sample of star-forming galaxies across $0.0\lesssim z \lesssim10.6$. We find that assuming uniform, low-density conditions ($n_e\sim10^2$ cm$^{-3}$) in high-density environments ($n_e\sim10^5$ cm$^{-3}$) can bias nebular diagnostics by overestimating $T_e$ (up to 1800 K), overpredicting $\log U$ (by $&gt;1$ dex), and underestimating O/H (up to 0.67 dex), while only modestly inflating N/O. Therefore, robust abundance determinations at high-$z$ require a multi-phase density model. Using this model, we recalculate O/H and N/O abundances for our sample and present the first $\log U$ diagnostics and ICFs for high-ionization UV N lines. We find that the UV tracers systematically overestimate N/O by $\sim0.3-0.4$ dex relative to the optical benchmark. We find that N/O increases with redshift, correlating with both $n_e$ and star formation rate surface density ($\rm\Sigma_{SFR}$), suggesting that N/O is temporarily enhanced in compact, high-pressure environments. However, the $n_e$ evolution with $z$ is more gradual than the $(1+z)^3$ scaling of virial halo densities, suggesting that $n_e$evolution is shaped by both cosmological structure growth and baryonic processes. These trends point to prompt N/O enrichment potentially driven by very massive stars, with key implications for interpreting UV emission and determining reliable chemical abundances from JWST observations of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Tracing The Start and End of Cosmic Reionization - Exploring The Role of Ionizing Sources as drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the Epoch of Cosmic Reionization (EoR), a key period in the early Universe when the first luminous sources formed and their radiation transformed the intergalactic medium (IGM) from neutral to ionized. Understanding this process reveals how the first stars and galaxies formed, influenced their surroundings, and shaped large-scale structures. The work traces both hydrogen and helium reionization by identifying the sources that produced ionizing radiation and examining how this radiation affected the thermal and ionization history of the IGM. Using the SPICE cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulations, the first part analyzes the ultraviolet luminosity function (UVLF) of high-redshift galaxies. It shows that different supernova feedback models drive distinct UVLF variability across mass and redshift, potentially alleviating the bright-galaxy tension seen by JWST. The second part explores how spectra from ionizing sources i.e. single and binary stars, X-ray binaries, emission from the interstellar medium, and active galactic nuclei impact the timing, topology, and thermal history of hydrogen reionization and the Lyman-alpha forest. At lower redshifts, radiative-transfer simulations reveal how helium reionization driven by quasars progressed and how the timing and temperature of the IGM relate to quasar luminosity functions and He II Ly-alpha observations. Finally, predictions for the 3.5 cm hyperfine transition of singly ionized helium-3 offer a novel probe of the post-reionization IGM. Together, these studies combine galaxy formation, radiative processes, and IGM evolution to provide a coherent picture of cosmic reionization and its observable signatures.</description>

      <title>The variability angular diameter distance and the intrinsic brightness temperature of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. It has recently been suggested that angular diameter distances derived from comparing the variability timescales of blazars to angular size measurements with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) may provide an alternative method to study the cosmological evolution of the Universe. Once the intrinsic brightness temperature ($T_{\rm int}$) is known, the angular diameter distance may be found without knowledge of the relativistic Doppler factor, opening up the possibility of a single rung distance measurement method from low $(z_{\rm cos}\ll1)$ to high $(z_{\rm cos}&gt;4)$ redshifts. Aims. We aim to verify whether the variability-based estimates of the intrinsic brightness temperature of multiple active galactic nuclei (AGNs) converges to a common value. We also investigate whether the intrinsic brightness temperature changes as a function of frequency. Methods. We estimated the $T_{\rm int}$ of AGNs based on the flux variability of the radio cores of their jets. We utilized radio core light curves and size measurements of 75 sources at 15 GHz and of 37 sources at 43 GHz. We also derived $T_{\rm int}$ from a population study of the brightness temperatures of VLBI cores using VLBI survey data of more than $100$ sources at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Results. Radio core variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ constrain upper limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$&lt;11.56$ at 15~GHz and $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$&lt;11.65$ at 43 GHz under a certain set of geometric assumptions. The population analysis suggests lower limits of $\log_{10}T_{\rm int}$ [K]$&gt;9.7$, $9.1$, and $9.3$ respectively at 24, 43, and 86 GHz. Even with monthly observations, variability-based estimates of $T_{\rm int}$ appear to be cadence-limited. Conclusions. Methods used to constrain $T_{\rm int}$ are more uncertain than previously thought. However, with improved datasets, the estimates should converge.</description>

      <title>A great diversity of spectral shapes in the ionising spectra of z ~ 0.6 - 1 galaxies revealed by HST/COS and possible detection of nebular LyC emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of eleven compact star-forming galaxies in the redshift range z = 0.6145 - 1.0053, with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We aim to spectroscopically measure for the first time the Lyman continuum (LyC) over a wider rest-frame wavelength range of ~ 600 - 900A compared to ~ 850 - 900A in previous studies of galaxies at z ~ 0.3 - 0.4. The HST data are supplemented by SDSS spectra of all galaxies and by a VLT/Xshooter spectrum of one galaxy, J0232+0025. These data are used to derive the spectral energy distribution in the entire UV and optical range, the stellar mass, and the chemical composition from the nebular emission lines. We detect stellar LyC emission in seven out of eleven galaxies with escape fractions, f_esc(LyC), in the range of ~ 2 - 60%, and establish upper limits for f_esc(LyC) in the remaining galaxies. We discover for the first time nebular LyC emission as a bump just bluewards of the LyC limit at 912A in two galaxies, J0232+0025 and J1021+0436. We find a similar bump among our earlier studies in a less distant galaxy J1243+4646 with z = 0.4317. We conclude that the use of the LyC continuum in the wavelength range close to the LyC limit, which contains both the stellar and nebular continua, requires special consideration to not overestimate the observed f_esc(LyC).</description>

      <title>Living with Neighbors. V. Better-aligned Spiral+Spiral Galaxy Pairs Show Stronger Star Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced star formation (SF) with star-forming neighboring galaxies bolsters hydrodynamical contributions during paired interactions. Although the relative spin orientation between interacting galaxies can influence this effect, it has not been comprehensively explored. In this study, using a curated sample of nearby (0.02 &lt; z &lt; 0.06) spiral-spiral pairs and an isolated control sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7, coupled with Galaxy Zoo 2, and a method to estimate spin-spin alignment (SSA), we systematically compare the impact of the relative orientation, $\cos\xi$, on interaction-induced SF. We find that SSA is a key factor alongside the conventional parameters of projected separation and the SF of neighboring galaxies. The SF enhancement increases as configurations transition from perpendicular ($\cos\xi \sim 0$) to well aligned ($\cos\xi &gt; 0.7$). The effect is strongest when neighboring galaxies have higher SF, indicating a hydrodynamical origin. The trend is consistent with increased hydrodynamical friction via stronger ram pressure and a higher likelihood of prograde orbits in well-aligned pairs.</description>

      <title>K-DRIFT: Unveiling New Imagery of the Hidden Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-surface-brightness (LSB) structures play a crucial role in understanding galaxy evolution by providing significant insights into galaxy interactions, the histories of mass assembly, and the distribution of dark matter. Nevertheless, their inherently faint nature, coupled with observational difficulties such as stray light interference and variations in the sky background, has significantly impeded comprehensive studies of LSB features. The KASI Deep Rolling Imaging Fast Telescope (K-DRIFT) project aims to address these observational challenges by developing off-axis freeform three-mirror telescopes and observational strategies specifically designed for LSB imaging surveys. The first generation of the K-DRIFT (K-DRIFT G1) has been successfully completed, and the forthcoming survey, scheduled to commence shortly, is expected to yield novel insights into the LSB universe. This paper outlines the scientific motivations of the project, discusses the technical challenges encountered, highlights the innovative solutions devised, and describes the future trajectory of the K-DRIFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SWIFTGalaxy is an open-source astrophysics module that extends SWIFTSimIO to analyses of particles belonging to individual galaxies simulated with SWIFT. It inherits from and extends the functionality of SWIFTSimIO's SWIFTDataset class. It understands the content of halo catalogues and therefore which particles belong to a galaxy or other group of particles, and its integrated properties. The particles occupy a coordinate frame that is enforced to be consistent, such that particles loaded on-the-fly will match e.g.~rotations and translations of particles already in memory. Intuitive masking of particle datasets is also enabled. Utilities to make working in cylindrical and spherical coordinate systems more convenient are also provided. Finally, tools to iterate efficiently over multiple galaxies are provided.</description>

      <title>SHELLQs-JWST: Revealing the Spectra of Extended Emission in 12 z &gt; 6 Quasar Host Galaxies using the JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the rest frame optical JWST NIRSpec Fixed Slit spectra of extended host galaxy emission in 12 quasars from the Subaru High-z Exploration of Low-Luminosity Quasars (SHELLQs) sample at redshifts 6.0 &lt; z &lt; 6.4. The spatial point spread function is modeled primarily by a sum of two Gaussians as a function of wavelength and is used to fit and subtract the quasar from the 2D spectra, leaving only extended galaxy emission which we analyze. Ten of 12 systems show spatially extended line emission and five of 12 systems show an extended stellar continuum. From the extended [OIII]5008 emission line, we measure a 132 ${\pm}$ 19 km/s ionized outflow in one system and 52 ${\pm}$ 12 km/s rotation, suggesting a coherent disk, in another. From the extended narrow H${\alpha}$ emission, which we hypothesize is ionized by star-forming regions rather than the quasar, we measure star formation rates ranging from ${\sim}$ 7 to 111 M${_\odot}$/yr, the majority of which are consistent with the star-forming main sequence at z ${\approx}$ 6. The positions of our host galaxies on the log10[OIII]5008/H${\beta}$ vs. log10[NII]6584/H${\alpha}$ (R3N2) Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram indicate ionization rates typical of AGN activity in the low-redshift universe, but are consistent with the placement of similar z ${\approx}$ 6 quasar host galaxies, suggesting that the R3N2 line ratios cannot distinguish AGN and star-formation powered line emission at high redshifts. We conclude from the consistency between our quasar host sample with z ${\sim}$ 6 galaxies that the presence of a low-luminosity AGN causes little significant change in the properties of galaxies at z ${\approx}$ 6 on 10 Myr timescales.</description>

      <title>Introducing the Seyfert-LINER Index (SLI): High Resolution (&lt;100pc) Ionization Structures in the ISM of AGN ESO~137-G34</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed, spatially resolved Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) analysis of ESO 137-G034, a Compton-thick Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), based on narrowband {\it HST} imaging in [O III], [S II], H$\alpha$, and H$\beta$ emission lines. We dissect the Interstellar Medium (ISM) into Seyfert-, LINER-, and H II-dominated regions with a resolution of $\sim0.1^{\prime\prime}$ ($\sim20$ pc at $z=0.009$). To characterize the fine spatial structure of the { different excitation mechanism}, we introduce a new parameter: the Seyfert/LINER Index (SLI), defined as the perpendicular distance of each point in the BPT diagram from the Seyfert/LINER division line. The narrowband optical emission exhibits a bi-conical morphology and traces the diffuse X-ray emission observed with \textit{Chandra}. Most of the emission within the bi-cones is Seyfert-like, with SLI values consistent with AGN photoionization. The North-West Seyfert cone is surrounded by a $\sim100$--$200$ pc thick LINER cocoon with a smooth, monotonic SLI profile, shaped by either AGN wind-ISM interactions, and/or obscured AGN radiation; three radial SLI peaks suggest episodic nuclear outbursts, with estimated timescales of a few $10^3$ yrs and $&lt;100$ yrs duration. The South-East cone shows inhomogeneous excitation, with a higher SLI region in its inner part, coinciding with a wider region of enhanced soft emission and the radio lobe inner edge. This region is characterized by line ratios consistent with fast shocks ($&gt;1000$ km s$^{-1}$) induced excitation. The LINER cocoon in the SE cone appears more irregular, with inter-cone LINER points likely shaped by both local ISM structure and shocks. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of different AGN feedback mechanisms in the ISM.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Local Group - I: Cosmic Filaments Govern the Spatial Alignments of Galaxy Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a large observational sample from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we investigate the spatial alignment between galaxy pairs and their local cosmic filaments. Focusing on pairs with stellar masses and separations comparable to the Milky Way-Andromeda (MW-M31) system, we measure the angle between the pair connecting line and the orientation of the host filament, determined using a filament catalog constructed via the Bisous model. Our analysis reveals a statistically significant tendency of galaxy pairs to align their connecting lines along their host filaments, manifesting as an overall $\sim$7\% excess of alignment angles smaller than the MW-M31 case compared to a random distribution. Crucially, the strength of this alignment exhibits a strong dependence on the distance to the filament spine. Pairs located within 0.2 Mpc from the filament spine show the strongest alignment, while those beyond 1 Mpc display no significant alignment. Furthermore, we identify a bimodal distribution of alignment angles near filament cores, suggesting distinct dynamical populations potentially associated with infall and interaction processes. Our results provide robust observational support for theoretical models in which anisotropic accretion and tidal forces within the cosmic web drive galaxy pair evolution. They also position the MW-M31 system as a representative filament-aligned pair, offering insights into Local Group assembly. This study demonstrates the cosmic web's critical role in dictating pair orientations and motivates future work with kinematic data to unravel galaxy-environment interplay.</description>

      <title>Radio Follow-Up Observations of a Weak-Line Quasar Exhibiting Remarkable X-ray Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SDSSJ1539+3954 ($z\approx 1.935$), a radio-quiet weak-line quasar (WLQ), exhibited exceptional X-ray variability in 2019$-$2020, with its X-ray flux increasing by over 20 times from 2013 to 2019 and subsequently dropping by at least a factor of nine in 2020. Motivated by the empirical correlations between X-ray and radio emission in AGN cores, we carried out a follow-up radio study in the 0.3$-$10 GHz range using GMRT (2020, 2022, 2024) and VLA (2022), and analyzed archival VLASS 3 GHz data (2017-2023) to investigate the source's radio properties and potential connection with the X-ray behavior. Our observations reveal a compact radio source with a spectral index of -0.65$\pm$0.15 in the frequency range of 0.3$-$1.4 GHz and -1.09$\pm$0.16 in 3$-$10 GHz. While the source was undetected in VLA-FIRST (1994) and VLASS epochs, the GMRT and VLA observations show no statistically significant variability over the monitored period. The absence of detectable changes in the radio flux, despite strong X-ray variability, suggests no direct connection between the X-ray variability and the radio emission, consistent with the Thick-Disk plus Outflow (TDO) model for WLQs. However, the sensitivity limit of the surveys prevents us from drawing definitive conclusions regarding longer timescale variability between the VLA-FIRST and GMRT epochs. We further explore possible mechanisms driving the radio emission from this source. Our analysis rules out small-scale jets and coronal emission as the primary drivers of the radio emission, suggesting that extended emission from AGN winds and star formation is the more plausible mechanism.</description>

      <title>HI Content of Group Galaxies from the FAST All Sky HI Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the atomic gas (HI) content of galaxies in groups using early data from the FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI). Taking advantage of FAST's blind, wide-area coverage and uniform sensitivity, we assemble a sample of $230$ group galaxies and a matched control sample of isolated systems, and apply censored-data modeling to include both detections and non-detections. At fixed stellar mass and color, we find that the global median HI fraction of group galaxies differs from that of controls by only $-0.04$ dex ($95\%$ CI [$-0.18,\ 0.16$]), indicating at most a mild average offset. The signal is not uniform across populations: satellites are HI-poor (median $\Delta f_{\mathrm{HI}}=-0.12$ dex), whereas centrals are consistent with normal to mildly HI-rich (median $\Delta f_{\mathrm{HI}}=0.13$ dex). Group galaxies located within $0.5R_{180}$ and in denser systems (richness $&gt;10$ or local density $\Sigma&gt;10\ \mathrm{gal\ Mpc^{-2}}$) show stronger negative offsets, whereas galaxies in the outskirts are statistically indistinguishable from the controls. These results refine earlier reports of global group HI deficiency: with deeper blind data and uniform treatment of upper limits, we show that HI depletion is primarily confined to satellites and compact cores rather than being ubiquitous across groups.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the 150 MHz Radio Luminosity Function of Star-Forming Galaxies with LOFAR Deep Fields through a Refined Statistical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the 150~MHz radio luminosity function (LF) of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using deep observations from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey in the ELAIS-N1, Bo\"{o}tes, and Lockman Hole fields. Our sample comprises $\sim$56,000 SFGs over $0 &lt; z &lt; 5.7$. We first analyze the deepest field (ELAIS-N1), then jointly model all three fields while accounting for their distinct flux limits and selection functions. Using adaptive kernel density estimation (KDE), we reconstruct the LF continuously across redshift and luminosity without binning or parametric assumptions. The KDE results reveal clear signatures of joint luminosity and density evolution (LADE). Motivated by this, we construct and fit three parametric models--pure luminosity evolution (PLE) and two LADE variants--using a full maximum-likelihood method that includes completeness corrections and constraints from the local radio LF and Euclidean-normalized source counts (SCs). Model selection using Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria strongly favors LADE over PLE. For ELAIS-N1, the more flexible LADE model (Model C) provides the best fit, while for the combined fields, the simpler Model B balances fit quality and complexity more effectively. Both LADE models reproduce the observed LFs and SCs across luminosity and flux density ranges, whereas PLE underperforms. We also identify a mild excess at the bright end of the LF, likely due to residual AGN contamination. This study demonstrates that combining KDE with parametric modeling offers a robust framework for quantifying the evolving radio LF of SFGs, paving the way for future work with next-generation surveys like the SKA.</description>

      <title>Detecting Intermediate-Mass Black Holes out to 20 Mpc with ELT/HARMONI: The Case of FCC 119</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs; $M_{BH} \approx 10^{3-5} M_\odot$) play a critical role in understanding the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe. In this study, we expand on Nguyen et al. simulated measurements of IMBH masses using stellar kinematics, which will be observed with the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral (HARMONI) field spectrograph on the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) up to the distance of 20 Mpc. Our sample focuses on both the Virgo Cluster in the northern sky and the Fornax Cluster in the southern sky. We begin by identifying dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters, which are thought to be nurseries for IMBHs in the local universe. As a case study, we conduct simulations for FCC 119, the second faintest dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster at 20 Mpc, which is also fainter than most of Virgo Cluster members. We use the galaxy's surface brightness profile from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging, combined with an assumed synthetic spectrum, to create mock observations with the {\tt HSIM} simulator and Jeans Anisotropic Models (JAM). These mock HARMONI datacubes are analyzed as if they were real observations, employing JAM within a Bayesian framework to infer IMBH masses and their associated uncertainties. We find that ELT/HARMONI can detect the stellar kinematic signature of an IMBH and accurately measure its mass for $M_{BH} \gtrsim 10^5 M_\odot$ out to distances of $\sim$20 Mpc.</description>

      <title>The Velocity Map Asymmetry of Ionized Gas in MaNGA II. Correlation between Velocity Map Morphology, Star Formation, and Metallicity in Regular Disk Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The morphology of ionized gas velocity maps provides a direct probe of the internal gas kinematics of galaxies. Using integral field spectroscopy from SDSS-IV MaNGA, we analyze a sample of 528 low-inclination, regular disk galaxies to investigate the correlations between velocity map morphology, star formation rate, and gas-phase metallicity. We quantify velocity map morphology using harmonic expansion and adopt two complementary diagnostics: the global kinematic asymmetry, which traces non-axisymmetric perturbations, and the first-order term ratio, which captures axisymmetric radial motions. We find that galaxies with higher kinematic asymmetry are more likely to deviate from the scaling relations, typically lying either above or below the star formation main sequence and systematically below the mass-metallicity relation. In contrast, the first-order term ratio shows only a correlation with gas-phase metallicity in the low-mass range and no significant dependence on star formation rate. Moreover, galaxies below the mass-metallicity relation generally exhibit higher HI gas fractions. These results suggest that external gas accretion is the primary driver of the observed phenomena: inflowing metal-poor gas increases velocity map asymmetry in disk galaxies, dilutes the metallicity, and triggers enhanced star formation. Feedback-driven outflows, bar- and spiral-driven inflows, and galaxy mergers may also contribute, but likely play a secondary role.</description>

      <title>Spatially Resolved, Multiphase Mass Outflows of the Seyfert 1 Galaxy NGC 3227</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved mass outflow rates of the ionized and molecular gas in the narrow line region of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 3227. Using long-slit spectroscopy and [O III] imaging from from Hubble Space Telescope's Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph and Apache Point Observatory's Kitt Peak Ohio State Multi-Object Spectrograph, in conjunction with Cloudy photoionization models and emission line diagnostics, we find a peak ionized mass outflow rate of $\dot M_{\text{ion}} =$ $19.9\pm9.2$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $47\pm6$ pc from the supermassive black hole (SMBH). Using archival data from the Gemini-North Near-infrared Field Spectrograph measuring H$_2$ $\lambda2.1218$ $\mu$m emission, we find a maximum peak warm molecular outflow rate of $\dot M_{\mathrm{H_2}} \le 9 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ at a distance of $36\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. Using archival data from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array measuring CO(2-1) emission, we find a maximum peak cold molecular gas mass outflow rate of $\dot M_{\mathrm{CO}} \le$ $23.1$ M$_\odot$ year$^{-1}$ at a distance of $57\pm6$ pc from the SMBH. For the first time, we calculate spatially resolved gas evacuation timescales for the cold molecular gas reservoirs ostensibly sourcing the outflows, and find that evacuating gas to $\sim$400 pc from the SMBH occurs on timescales of $10^{6.0} - 10^{7.6}$ years. These results indicate that the multi-phase AGN outflows are effective in clearing the inner few hundred parsecs of NGC 3227's gas content on timescales that may set the AGN duty cycle of $10^5 - 10^8$ years.</description>

      <title>QUEST (Quasar Unsupervised Encoder and Synthesis Tool): A machine learning framework to generate quasar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasars at the redshift frontier (z &gt; 7.0) are fundamental probes of black hole (BH) growth and evolution but notoriously difficult to identify. At these redshifts, machine learning-based selection methods have proven to be efficient, but require appropriate training sets to express their full potential. Here, we present QUEST, a Variational Auto-Encoder capable of generating realistic quasar spectra that can be post-processed for generating synthetic photometry and for spectral imputation. We start from the SDSS DR16Q catalogue, pre-process the spectra, and vet the sample to obtain a clean data set. After training the model, we investigate the properties of its latent space to understand whether it has learnt relevant physics. We provide a pipeline to generate photometry from the sampled spectra, compare it with actual quasar photometry, and showcase the capabilities of the model in reconstructing and extending quasar spectra. The trained network faithfully reproduces the input spectrum, both in terms of sample median and variance. By examining the latent space, we find correlations with continuum and bolometric luminosity, BH mass, redshift, continuum slope, and emission line properties. When used to generate photometry, we find results in excellent agreement with the control sample. The model provides satisfactory results in reconstructing emission lines: estimates of the BH mass from the reconstructed spectra are in good agreement with those from the original spectra. Furthermore, when spectra with broad absorption line features are reconstructed, the model successfully interpolates over the absorption systems. Compared with previous work, we find excellent agreement between the spectra sampled from our model and the output of their results. However, QUEST does not require any ad-hoc tuning, and is capable of reproducing the full variety of spectra available in the training set.</description>

      <title>Using Type-II Cepheids as Extragalactic Standard Candles: Distances to M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several standard candles have been tested and used to measure accurate extragalactic distances over the past decades. There have been discussions regarding the possibility of using Type-II Cepheids (T2Cs) as an alternative tool, but rarely was this ever implemented. The aim of this project is to assert the use of T2Cs as a new avenue for calibrating the extragalactic distance scale, by using M31 as a benchmark galaxy. Since Ordinary Least Squares regression methods are not immune to outliers and offer an incomplete treatment of the uncertainties, we favor a Bayesian robust regression model to compute new Period--Luminosity (PL) and Period--Wesenheit (PW) relations calibrated using $\sim$100 T2Cs, $\sim$1000 fundamental-mode and $\sim$750 first-overtone classical Cepheids (CCs) in the LMC. Using these relations, we employ a classification routine based on Bhattacharyya distances to filter out any contaminants from the M31 sample. We validate our method by verifying that we retrieve an accurate distance for the LMC. We find a distance to M31 of $24.487\pm0.001$ (statistical) $\pm0.052$ (systematic) mag using CCs and of $24.409\pm0.025$ (statistical) $\pm0.156$ (systematic) mag using T2Cs. Both values are in excellent agreement with literature values derived from meta-analyses, from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of CCs, from the Tip of the Red Giant Branch method, and from HST observations of RR Lyrae. In almost all cases, we reach a relative accuracy better than 98\%, although the archival ground-based data we use cannot compare with HST photometry. We demonstrate that T2Cs can also be used as accurate tracers for determining extragalactic distances, thereby making them excellent candidates for JWST, LSST, and ELT observations. These stars allow us to probe galaxies deprived of young populations and are beyond the reach of the fainter RR Lyrae.</description>

      <title>Automated Exploration of Radical-Molecule Chemistry: The Case of Oxirane + CH in the ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry provides accurate and reliable methods to investigate reaction pathways of reactive molecular systems relevant to the interstellar medium. However, the exhaustive exploration of a reactive network is often a daunting task, resulting in unexplored reactive channels that affect kinetic outcomes and branching ratios. Here, an automated workflow for exploring reactive potential energy surfaces (PESs) is employed for the first time to study the oxirane (C$_2$H$_4$O) plus methylidyne ($^.$CH) reaction. The ultimate goal is to comprehensively map its PES and, subsequently, derive rate constants for the most important reaction channels. In addition to its astrochemical relevance, this reaction has been considered because it is a challenging test case, its network being very extended, with 60 exothermic bimolecular products lying below the reactant's energy. Kinetic simulations indicate that the main product of the reaction is the HCO radical plus ethene (C$_2$H$_4$), while formation of s-trans-propenal (acrolein) and 2H-oxene is also possible, but to a lesser extent. Based on the present study and other references in the literature, we suggest that the slightly higher relative abundance of s-trans-propenal compared to methyl ketene in the interstellar medium is a gas-phase kinetic effect, s-trans-propenal being a more easily accessible product on the C$_3$H$_5$O$^.$ PES.</description>

      <title>The spatial distribution of dwarf and giant galaxies in and around Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Virgo cluster is one of the closest clusters to us where we can further study the evolution of galaxies, with several infalling substructures and several filaments around it have been reported. Therefore, it makes this cluster and its surrounding an interesting place to study the spatial distribution of the population of dwarf and bright giant galaxies. We analyse the dwarf fraction (DF) in different regions of the cluster, inside the virial radius, in its surrounding area, and in the filamentary structure surrounding it using available catalogues with the aim of measuring whether the DF changes in different environments. Although the total dwarf fraction within the cluster is $\sim$ 0.8, significant local variations are measured throughout the cluster; there are regions with a relatively higher concentration of giant or dwarf galaxies. The fact that Virgo is embedded in a rich environment surrounded by several filaments that feed the cluster with new substructures could imply changes in the DF locally. When we analyse the DF variation at further distances from the cluster we observe some regions with few or no giant galaxies at all, with a locally DF ranging from 0.8 - 1.0. Additionally, when comparing the dwarf fraction in different environments, overall, the DF is larger in regions further away from denser regions such as the Virgo cluster and its filamentary structure surrounding it. When comparing the filament and the cluster area, the dwarf fraction is slightly higher in the filaments, but from filament to filament, the DF changes depending on the presence of groups.</description>

      <title>The First Star-by-star $N$-body/Hydrodynamics Simulation of Our Galaxy Coupling with a Surrogate Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major goal of computational astrophysics is to simulate the Milky Way Galaxy with sufficient resolution down to individual stars. However, the scaling fails due to some small-scale, short-timescale phenomena, such as supernova explosions. We have developed a novel integration scheme of $N$-body/hydrodynamics simulations working with machine learning. This approach bypasses the short timesteps caused by supernova explosions using a surrogate model, thereby improving scalability. With this method, we reached 300 billion particles using 148,900 nodes, equivalent to 7,147,200 CPU cores, breaking through the billion-particle barrier currently faced by state-of-the-art simulations. This resolution allows us to perform the first star-by-star galaxy simulation, which resolves individual stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. The performance scales over $10^4$ CPU cores, an upper limit in the current state-of-the-art simulations using both A64FX and X86-64 processors and NVIDIA CUDA GPUs.</description>

      <title>Alma Luminous Star catalogue IV: A Massive star census in the Magellanic Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fourth part of the Alma Luminous Star catalogue (ALS IV) aims to create the most comprehensive sample of massive stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs). By combining Gaia DR3 with Simbad and complementing this information with other photometric and spectroscopic catalogues, we select the massive stars in this region. To achieve this, we apply filters in photometry, combining different bands, as well as in variability and spectral types from the literature. With this approach, we will obtain one of the most complete samples of massive stars in the MCs, which can be used both to study the Clouds and the Magellanic Bridge, as well as the massive stars they contain.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Baryon Cycle in IllustrisTNG: flows of mass, energy, and metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure and analyze the inflows and outflows of mass, energy, and metals through the interstellar medium (ISM) and circumgalactic medium (CGM) of galaxies in the IllustrisTNG100 simulations. We identify the dominant feedback mechanism in bins of halo virial mass and redshift by computing the integrated energy input from SNe and the ``kinetic'' and ``thermal'' mode of AGN feedback. We measure all quantities in a shell at the virial radius (``halo scale'') and one chosen to be approximately at the interface of the CGM and the interstellar medium (ISM; ``ISM scale''). We find that galaxies have strong net positive inflows on halo scales, and weaker but still net positive inflows on ISM scales, at $z\gtrsim 2$. At later times, partially due to the onset of kinetic AGN feedback in massive halos, inflows and outflows nearly balance one another, leading to the familiar effects of the slow-down of galaxy growth and the onset of quenching. Halos dominated by SN feedback show only weak evidence of preventative feedback on halo scales, and we see excess ISM scale accretion indicative of rapid gas recycling. Wind mass loadings decrease with increasing halo mass, and with increasing redshift, while energy loadings are nearly independent of both mass and redshift. The detailed catalogs of these mass, metal, and energy inflow and outflow rates on galaxy and halo scales can be used to guide empirical and semi-analytic models, and provide deeper insight into how galaxy growth and quenching is regulated in the IllustrisTNG simulations.</description>

      <title>The MiMO Catalog: Physical Parameters and Stellar Mass Functions of 1,232 Open Clusters from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous catalog of 1,232 open clusters with precisely determined ages, metallicities, distances, extinctions, and stellar mass function (MF) slopes, derived from Gaia DR3 data. The parameters are inferred using the Mixture Model for Open clusters (MiMO), a novel Bayesian framework for modeling clusters in the color-magnitude diagram. By explicitly accounting for field-star contamination as a model component, MiMO removes the conventional need for stringent membership preselection, allowing for a more complete inclusion of member stars and thereby enhancing both precision and robustness. Our results broadly agree with existing catalogs but offer improved precision. For each cluster, we provide the best-fit age, metallicity, distance, extinction, and MF slope, along with their full likelihood chains and photometric membership probabilities for individual stars. We further identify an ``MF Prime'' subsample of 163 clusters with high-quality data, for which the MF estimates are considered most reliable. The catalog and an open-source implementation of MiMO are made publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Validating Open Cluster Candidates with Photometric Bayesian Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thousands of open cluster (OC) candidates identified by the Gaia mission are significantly contaminated by false positives from field star fluctuations, posing a major validation challenge. Based on the Mixture Model for OCs (MiMO), we present a Bayesian framework for validating OC candidates in the color--magnitude diagram. The method compares the Bayesian evidence of two competing models: a single stellar population with field contamination versus a pure field population. Their ratio, the Bayes factor (BF), quantifies the statistical support for cluster existence. Tests on confirmed clusters and random fields show that a threshold of BF &gt; 100 effectively distinguishes genuine clusters from chance field overdensities. This approach provides a robust, quantitative tool for OC validation and catalog refinement. The framework is extendable to multi-dimensional validation incorporating kinematics and is broadly applicable to other resolved stellar systems, including candidate moving groups, stellar streams, and dwarf satellites.</description>

      <title>MIGHTEE-HI: The HI mass-stellar mass relation of massive galaxies and the HI mass function at 0.25&lt;z&lt;0.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between the already formed stellar mass in a galaxy and the gas reservoir of neutral atomic hydrogen, is a key element in our understanding of how gas is turned into stars in galaxy haloes. In this paper, we measure the $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ relation based on a stellar-mass selected sample at $0.25 &lt; z &lt; 0.5$ and the MIGHTEE-HI DR1 spectral data. Using a powerful Bayesian stacking technique, for the first time we are also able to measure the underlying bivariate distribution of HI mass and stellar mass of galaxies with $M_\star &gt; 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$, finding that an asymmetric underlying HI distribution is strongly preferred by our complete samples. We define the concepts of the average of the logarithmic HI mass, $\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$, and the logarithmic average of the HI mass, $\log_{10}(\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle)$, and find that the difference between $\langle\log_{10}(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$ and $\log_{10}(\langle M_{\rm HI}\rangle)$ can be as large as $\sim$0.5 dex for the preferred asymmetric HI distribution. We observe shallow slopes in the underlying $M_{\rm HI}-M_{\star}$ scaling relations, suggesting the presence of an upper HI mass limit beyond which a galaxy can no longer retain further HI gas. From our bivariate distribution we also infer the HI mass function at this redshift and find tentative evidence for a decrease of 2-10 times in the co-moving space density of the most HI massive galaxies up to $z\sim 0.5$.</description>

      <title>A targeted radio survey of infrared-selected bow shock candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bow shocks around massive stars have primarily been detected in IR emission, but radio detections are becoming more frequent with the commissioning of sensitive and large field-of-view interferometers. Radio data probes both thermal and non-thermal emission, thereby constraining the relativistic electron population. We undertook a radio survey for bow shocks based on IR catalogues of candidates, using the VLA and the 100-m Effelsberg Telescope, aiming for new detections and to better characterise the multi-wavelength emission. We used Gaia DR3 to re-calculate spatial motion of the driving stars with respect to the surrounding stellar population. We studied the radio emission from bow shocks using emission maps and spectral-index measurements, and compared our results with data from catalogues and multi-wavelength emission. Of the 24 targets observed with the VLA in the 4-12 GHz band, six were clearly detected (including two previously reported) and 5 possibly detected. A subset of these were also observed and detected with Effelsberg at 4-8 GHz. The VLA-derived spectral index maps indicate non-thermal emission for most sources, but the statistical uncertainties are large for most sources and all Effelsberg observations indicate thermal emission. Assuming thermal emission, we obtain upper limits on the electron density within the shocked layer. We obtained upper limits on radio emission from the bow shock of Zeta Oph at a similar flux level to predictions from MHD simulations. Our survey marks a significant addition to the ca. 10 previously known radio-emitting bow shocks in the literature, and demonstrates that deep, targeted radio surveys can effectively detect IR-selected bow shocks. Follow-up observations of these targets at lower and higher frequencies are encouraged to determine whether any are non-thermal emitters like the bow shocks of BD+43, BD+60 and LS2355.

      <title>Galactic bars and active galactic nucleus fuelling in the second half of cosmic history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of galactic bars in fuelling and triggering Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) in disc galaxies up to $z\sim 0.8$. We utilise a Deep Learning model, fine-tuned on Galaxy Zoo volunteer classifications, to identify (strongly and weakly) barred and unbarred disc galaxies in Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program $i$-band images. We select AGN using three independent diagnostics: mid-infrared colours, X-ray detections, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. The SED analysis, performed using CIGALE, quantifies the relative AGN contribution to the total galaxy luminosity ($f_{\rm AGN}$) and the AGN luminosity ($L_{\rm disc}$). We assess the impact of bars by comparing AGN incidence and properties in barred galaxies against carefully constructed redshift-, stellar mass-, and colour-matched unbarred control samples. Our binary AGN classification experiment demonstrates that barred disc galaxies host a statistically detectable higher fraction of AGN compared to their unbarred counterparts, suggesting a contributing role for bars in the global AGN budget. The contribution of bars to AGN fuelling appears confined to systems where the AGN has a lower relative contribution to the host galaxy's emission ($f_{\rm AGN} &lt; 0.75$). Crucially, we find a significant dearth of barred disc galaxies hosting AGN with $f_{\rm AGN} &gt; 0.75$, independent of bar strength. Consistent with this, the fraction of barred galaxies among AGN hosts decreases with increasing $L_{\rm disc}$. Combined with previous results, we suggest that bars contribute to fuelling the population of low-to-moderate luminosity AGN, but major mergers are the principal mechanism for triggering the most powerful and dominant accretion events.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the collision between molecular outflows: observational evidence and hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an unexplored scenario for interpreting the outflows in the EGO G338.92+0.55 (b) region (hereafter, EGO G338). Within this framework, we investigate the hypothesis that the interaction between two outflows is responsible for the observed morphology and kinematics of this astrophysical object. To explore this possibility, we reanalyse the region using observational molecular line data. We base our analysis on maps of moments 0, 1, and 2 of the CO emission associated with the molecular outflows. Additionally, we conduct three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations to examine the presence or absence of a collision between two jets. From our numerical results, we produce synthetic CO images to facilitate a direct comparison with observations. The findings of this study provide compelling evidence that the observed morphology and kinematics in the EGO G338 region are the result of a likely collision between two molecular outflows.</description>

      <title>The MandelZoom project II: the impact of stellar feedback on black hole accretion through an $\alpha$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a suite of high-resolution simulations to study how different stellar feedback channels regulate the growth of central intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) in dwarf galaxies hosting nuclear star clusters (NSCs). We employ a super-Lagrangian refinement scheme to resolve the self-gravity radius of the $\alpha$-accretion disc ($&lt;0.01$~pc) and follow the gas inflows from the interstellar medium (ISM) to the black hole (BH), allowing for the self-consistent emergence of circumnuclear discs (CNDs). In the absence of stellar feedback, as expected, the galactic disc fragments excessively, producing a massive CND. When radiative stellar feedback is included, fragmentation is suppressed, with even more massive CNDs forming and feeding the IMBH. With supernova (SN) feedback only, clustered SNe strongly heat the ISM, yielding both the lowest CND masses and BH accretion rates. When both radiative stellar feedback and SNe are included, the CND becomes intermittent: it survives for $10$--$100$~Myr, and is then destroyed by feedback before being replenished by fresh galactic inflows, while substantial BH growth still takes place. These results highlight the critical importance of accurately modelling the combined effects of key stellar feedback processes to understand IMBH growth. Our simulation suite brackets the likely range of CND states, with IMBHs exhibiting significant growth and systematic spin-up in all dwarf galaxy models explored. These findings bode well for the detection of IMBHs with future observational facilities such as SKA, the Rubin Observatory, and LISA, and make them highly relevant progenitor candidates of the high-redshift supermassive BHs observed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Vine: High abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster at z=3.44</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Vine is a massive protocluster at z=3.44 in the JWST CEERS field, offering an ideal laboratory for studying the early phases of cluster formation. Using the data from the DAWN JWST Archive, we conduct a comprehensive study on the large-scale structure, stellar mass function (SMF), quiescent members, and dark matter halos in the Cosmic Vine. First, we spectroscopically confirm 136 galaxies in the Vine at z=3.44, and an additional 47 galaxies belonging to a diffuse foreground structure at z=3.34 which we dub the Leaf. We identify four subgroups comprising the Cosmic Vine and two subgroups within the Leaf. Second, we identified 11 quiescent members with log(M*/Msun)=9.5-11.0, the largest sample of quiescent galaxies in overdense environments at z&gt;3, which gives an enhanced quiescent galaxy number density 2x10^(-4)cMpc^(-3) that is three times above the field level at log(M*/Msun) &gt; 10. Notably, these quiescent members form a tight red sequence on the color-magnitude diagram, making it one of the earliest red sequences known to date. Third, by constructing the SMFs for both star-forming and quiescent members, we find that both SMFs are top-heavy, with a significantly enhanced quiescent fraction at log(M*/Msun)&gt;10.5 compared to field counterparts. The stellar mass-size analysis reveals that star-forming members are more compact at higher masses than their field counterparts. Finally, we estimate a halo mass of log(Mh/Msun)=13.2+-0.3 for the protocluster core, and log(Mh/Msun)=11.9-12.4 for satellite subgroups. The phase-space analysis indicates that three subgroups are likely infalling to the core. This work reveals a high abundance of massive galaxies and dark matter halos in a forming cluster, demonstrating the accelerated assembly of massive galaxies in massive halos when the Universe was less than 2 billion years old.</description>

      <title>XRISM constraints on the velocity power spectrum in the Coma cluster</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The velocity field of intracluster gas in galaxy clusters contains key information on the virialization of infalling material, the dissipation of AGN energy into the surrounding medium, and the validity of the hydrostatic hypothesis. The statistical properties of the velocity field are characterized by its fluctuation power spectrum, which is usually expected to be well described by an injection scale and a turbulent cascade. Here we propose a simulation-based inference technique to retrieve the properties of the velocity power spectrum from X-ray micro-calorimeter data by generating simulations of Gaussian random fields from a parametric power spectrum model. We forward model the measured bulk velocities and velocity dispersions by including the most relevant observational effects (projection, emissivity weighting, PSF smearing). We then train a neural network to learn the mapping between the power spectrum parameters and the generated data vectors. Considering a three-parameter model describing turbulent energy injection on large scales and a power-law cascade, we found that two XRISM/Resolve pointings are sufficient to accurately determine the turbulent Mach number and set interesting constraints on the injection scale. Applying our method to the Coma cluster data, we obtain a model that is characterized by a large injection scale that rivals the size of the cluster ($\ell_{inj}=2.2_{-1.0}^{+2.0}$ Mpc). When this power spectrum model is integrated over the cluster scales ($0&lt;\ell&lt;R_{500}=1.4 $Mpc), the Mach number of the gas motions is $\mathcal{M}_{3D,500}=0.45_{-0.13}^{+0.18}$, which exceeds the value derived from the velocity dispersions only. Further observations covering a wider area are required to decrease the cosmic variance and constrain the slope of the turbulent cascade.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood. LV. M Dwarf Twin Binaries -- One in Five Twin Sibling Pairs Are Mismatched in Activity and/or Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a study of 36 pairs of `twin' M dwarfs in wide binaries and assess how similarly the stars behave. Stars in each twin pair have BP, RP, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ differing by $&lt;$0.10 mag, mass estimates matching within $&lt;$3%, and presumably the same age and composition. We utilize short-- and long-term photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and archival data to measure rotation periods, photometric activity levels, and H$\alpha$ equivalent widths for many systems. Speckle imaging, radial velocities, and long-term astrometry are used to identify unresolved companions, yielding three systems with unseen components. Among the 33 remaining twin systems, numerous remarkable pairs show nearly identical rotation rates and activity levels between their twin components, including cases throughout the lower main sequence and across a broad range of rotation-activity parameter space. In contrast, mismatches with $&gt;$25% differences exist in rotation period for $21\%_{-7\%}^{+14\%}$ of twin pairs, in rotation amplitude for $67\%_{-15\%}^{+10\%}$ of pairs, in multi-year photometric variability for $33\%_{-9\%}^{+12\%}$ of pairs, and in H$\alpha$ activity for $21\%_{-6\%}^{+9\%}$ of pairs, with fully convective systems generally mismatched more often. Thus, roughly one out of five M dwarf twin sets does not match in rotation and/or activity despite otherwise identical fundamental parameters. Furthermore, we compile three key systems showing larger relative active/inactive H$\alpha$ mismatches. We propose the various mismatches likely stem from factors such as dynamo stochasticity, activity cycles, formative disk aspects, and/or star-planet interactions, depending on the system. These well-vetted twins offer ripe targets for many future investigations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoders for Learning Image-Spectrum Associations for Galaxy Evolution and Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Upcoming surveys will produce billions of galaxy images but comparatively few spectra, motivating models that learn cross-modal representations. We build a dataset of 134,533 galaxy images (HSC-PDR2) and spectra (DESI-DR1) and adapt a Multi-Modal Masked Autoencoder (MMAE) to embed both images and spectra in a shared representation. The MMAE is a transformer-based architecture, which we train by masking 75% of the data and reconstructing missing image and spectral tokens. We use this model to test three applications: spectral and image reconstruction from heavily masked data and redshift regression from images alone. It recovers key physical features, such as galaxy shapes, atomic emission line peaks, and broad continuum slopes, though it struggles with fine image details and line strengths. For redshift regression, the MMAE performs comparably or better than prior multi-modal models in terms of prediction scatter even when missing spectra in testing. These results highlight both the potential and limitations of masked autoencoders in astrophysics and motivate extensions to additional modalities, such as text, for foundation models.</description>

      <title>Cosmic magnification on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weak lensing magnification probes the correlation between galaxies and the underlying matter field in a similar fashion to galaxy-galaxy lensing shear. Although it has long been sidelined in favor of the latter on the grounds of a poorer performance in terms of statistical significance, the provision of a large sample of high-redshift submillimeter galaxies by the \emph{Herschel} observatory has transformed the landscape of cosmic magnification due to their optimal physical properties for magnification analyses. This review aims to summarize the core principles and unique advantages of cosmic magnification on high-redshift submillimeter galaxies and discuss recent results applied for cosmological inference. The outlook and challenges of this observable are also outlined, with a focus on the ample scope for exploration and its potential to emerge as a competitive independent cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>The MDW H{\alpha} Sky Survey: Data Release 1</title>

Abstract: The Mittelman-di Cicco-Walker (MDW) H$\alpha$ Sky Survey is an autonomously-operated all-sky narrow-band (3nm) H$\alpha$ imaging survey. The survey was founded by amateur astronomers and the northern sky (Decl. $\geq$ 0$^\circ$) is presented here in its second stage of refinement for academic use. Each 3.6$\times$3.6 sq. deg MDW field has 12 20-minute individual exposures with a pixel scale of 3.6", a typical PSF of 6", and a stack point source depth of 16-17 magnitudes. The northern MDW Survey Data Release 1 (DR1) includes: calibrated and raw mean and individual images, star-removed mean fields, and point source catalogs for all images matched to Data Release 1 of the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS1) and the INT Galactic Plane Survey (IGAPS). Our initial study of H$\alpha$ filament widths finds a typical FWHM of 30-45" in the Lyra region. The matched catalogs (with a median match distance of ~0.5"), combined with our distinctive narrow-band photometry, are used to identify H$\alpha$ variable and excess sources. These initial studies highlight some of the many scientific uses of the MDW H$\alpha$ survey.</description>

      <title>The role of supercluster filaments in shaping galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a hierarchical $\Lambda$CDM Universe, cosmic filaments serve as the primary channels for matter accretion into galaxy clusters, influencing the shape of their dark matter halos. We investigate whether the elongation of galaxy clusters correlates with the orientation of surrounding filaments, providing the first observational test of this relationship in large supercluster regions. We identified and characterized cosmic filaments in two dimensions within the two superclusters that are part of the low-redshift sub-survey of the Chilean Cluster Galaxy Evolution Survey (CHANCES): the Shapley supercluster and the Horologium-Reticulum supercluster. We analyzed the alignment between filament directions --traced by galaxy distributions- and the triaxiality of cluster gravitational potentials --traced by X-ray emission- using publicly available optical and X-ray data. We have found that most (82%) of the X-ray clusters are associated with and interconnected by the optically detected filaments. The clusters-filaments alignment analysis shows that the elongation of most clusters is well aligned with nearby filaments, providing observational confirmation of theoretical predictions, with the alignment progressively reducing at larger cluster-centric distances ($&gt; 1.6 r_{200}$). Overall, our results support the notion that filaments are the main source of galaxy accretion at redshift below 0.1 and additionally provide evidence that matter accretion through filaments shapes the gravitational potential of galaxy clusters. We propose this measurement as a simple observational proxy to determine the direction of accretion in clusters, which is key to understanding both galaxy evolution and the merger history of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>COMAP Pathfinder -- Season 2 results IV. A stack on eBOSS/DESI quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a stack of data from the second season of the CO Mapping Array Project (COMAP) Pathfinder on the positions of quasars from eBOSS and DESI. COMAP is a Line Intensity Mapping (LIM) experiment targeting dense molecular gas via CO(1--0) emission at $z\sim3$. COMAP's Season 2 represents a $3\times$ increase in map-level sensitivity over the previous Early Science data release. We do not detect any CO emission in the stack, instead finding an upper limit of $10.0\times 10^{10}\ \mathrm{K\ km\ s^{-1}\ pc^2}$ at 95\% confidence within an $\sim 18\ \mathrm{cMpc}$ box. We compare this upper limit to models of the CO emission stacked on quasars and find a tentative ($\sim 3 \sigma$) tension between the limit and the brightest stack models after accounting for a suite of additional sources of experimental attenuation and uncertainty, including quasar velocity uncertainty, pipeline signal loss, cosmic variance, and interloper emission in the LIM data. The COMAP-eBOSS/DESI stack is primarily a measurement of the CO luminosity in the quasars' wider environment and is therefore potentially subject to environmental effects such as feedback. With our current simple models of the galaxy-halo connection, we are thus unable to confidently rule out any models of cosmic CO with the stack alone. Conversely, the stack's sensitivity to these large-scale environmental effects has the potential to make it a powerful tool for galaxy formation science, once we are able to constrain the average CO luminosity via the auto power spectrum (a key goal of COMAP).</description>

      <title>The Compressed 3D Lyman-Alpha Forest Bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological studies of the Lyman-Alpha (Lya) forest typically constrain parameters using two-point statistics. However, higher-order statistics, such as the three-point function (or its Fourier counterpart, the bispectrum) offer additional information and help break the degeneracy between the mean flux and power spectrum amplitude, albeit at a significant computational cost. To address this, we extend an existing highly informative compression of the bispectrum, the skew spectra, to the Lya forest. We derive the tree-level bispectrum of Lya forest fluctuations in the framework of effective field theory (EFT) directly in redshift space and validate our methodology on synthetic Lya forest data. We measure the anisotropic cross-spectra between the transmitted flux fraction and all quadratic operators arising in the bispectrum, yielding a set of 26 skew spectra. Using idealized 3D Gaussian smoothing (R=10 Mpc/h), we find good agreement (1-2 sigma level based on the statistical errors of the mocks) with the theoretical tree-level bispectrum prediction for monopole and quadrupole up to k &lt;= 0.17 h/Mpc. To enable the cosmological analysis of Lya forest data from the currently observing Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), where we cannot do 3D smoothing, we use a line-of-sight smoothing and introduce a new statistic, the shifted skew spectra. These probe non-squeezed bispectrum triangles and avoid locally applying quadratic operators to the field by displacing one copy of the field in the radial direction. Using a fixed displacement of 40 Mpc/h (and line-of-sight smoothing of 10 Mpc/h) yields a similar agreement with the theory prediction. For the special case of correlating the squared (and displaced) field with the original one, we analytically forward model the window function making this approach readily applicable to DESI data.</description>

      <title>GaiaUnlimited: The old stellar disc of the Milky Way as traced by the Red Clump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exploration of the Milky Way's structural parameters using an all-sky sample of RC giants to map the stellar density from the Galactic disc beyond 3 kpc. These evolved giants are considered to be standard candles due to their low intrinsic variance in their absolute luminosities, allowing us to estimate their distances with reasonable confidence. We exploit all-sky photometry from the AllWISE mid-infrared survey and the Gaia survey, along with astrometry from Gaia Data Release 3 and recent 3D extinction maps, to develop a probabilistic scheme in order to select with high confidence RC-like stars. Our curated catalogue contains about 10 million sources, for which we estimate photometric distances based on the WISE W1 photometry. We then derive the selection function for our sample, which is the combined selection function of sources with both Gaia and AllWISE photometry. Using the distances and accounting for the full selection function of our observables, we are able to fit a two-disc, multi-parameter model to constrain the scale height (hz), scale-length (rd), flaring, and the relative mass ratios of the two disc components. We illustrate and verify our methodology using mock catalogues of RC stars. We find that the RC population is best described by a flared disc with scale length rd=$4.24\pm0.32$ kpc and scale height at the Sun of hz(at Sun)=$0.18\pm0.01$ kpc, and a shorter and thicker disc with rd=$2.66\pm0.11$ kpc, hz(at Sun)=$0.48\pm0.11$ kpc, with no flare. The thicker disc constitutes 66\% of the RC stellar mass beyond 3 kpc, while the flared disc shows evidence of being warped beyond 9 kpc from the Galactic center. The residuals between the predicted number density of RC stars from our axisymmetric model and the measured counts show possible evidence of a two-armed spiral perturbation in the disc of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of the Young Massive Star Cluster Westerlund 1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16755v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a structural analysis of the young massive star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). With multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations, we measure the proper motions of $10346$ stars and determine their kinematic memberships by fitting a Gaussian mixture model to their proper motions. After correcting for extinction and completeness, we model the stellar density distribution and confirm the presence of an elongation with an eccentricity of $0.71$. The eccentricity decreases slightly with increasing mass. We fit the radial profile with the Elson, Fall, and Freeman model, observing a decrease in the core radius with increasing mass, indicative of weak but detectable mass segregation. This finding is further supported by a measured mass segregation ratio of $\Lambda_\mathrm{\rm MSR}=1.11\pm0.11$, only above $1$ by $1\sigma$, and slightly shorter minimum spanning tree length for higher mass bins. The cluster has a 1D velocity dispersion of $3.42 \pm 0.10~\mathrm{km}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, suggesting it is subvirial. The subvirial state implies either exceptionally high star formation efficiency or inefficient stellar feedback caused by local gas expulsion before stars reach the cluster. The crossing time is $0.30$ Myr and the relaxation time is $0.26$ Gyr. Given the age of Wd 1 of $10.7$ Myr, we expect evident mass segregation for stars more massive than $10~M_\odot$, which accounts for the minor mass segregation found in the mass range of $1.00\unicode{x2013}12.14~M_\odot$ in this work. This suggests the overall mass segregation in Wd 1 is not primordial.</description>

      <title>Radio signatures of AGN-wind-driven shocks in elliptical galaxies: From simulations to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the synchrotron emission signatures of shocks driven by active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind in elliptical galaxies based on our two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic MACER numerical simulations. Using these simulation data, we calculate the synchrotron radiation produced by nonthermal electrons accelerated at shocks, adopting reasonable assumptions for the magnetic field and relativistic electron distribution (derived from diffusive shock acceleration theory), and predict the resulting observational signatures. In our fiducial model, shocks driven by AGN winds produce synchrotron emission with luminosities of approximately $10^{29}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}\,Hz^{-1}}$ in the radio band (0.5-5 GHz), with spectral indices of $\alpha \approx -0.4$ to $-0.6$ during the strongest shock phases, gradually steepening to about $-0.8$ to $-1.4$ as the electron population ages. Spatially, the emission is initially concentrated in regions of strong shocks, later expanding into more extended, diffuse structures. We also apply our model to the dwarf elliptical galaxy Messier 32 (M32), and find remarkable consistency between our simulated emission and the observed nuclear radio source, suggesting that this radio component likely originates from hot-wind-driven shocks. Our results indicate that AGN winds not only influence galaxy gas dynamics through mechanical energy input but also yield direct observational evidence via nonthermal radiation. With the advent of next-generation radio facilities such as the FAST Core Array, SKA, and ngVLA, these emission signatures serve as important probes for detecting and characterizing AGN feedback.</description>

      <title>Fractality of open clusters in singles, pairs, and groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the global structural properties and fractality of 1,876 open clusters (OCs) in different environments, including 1,145 singles, 392 pairs, and 339 groups. We analyze cluster mass, age, size, concentration, and fractal structure using the Q parameter and the fractal dimension fdim, and examine their correlations with key physical parameters. Our results reveal systematic environmental trends: clusters in groups are generally younger, less massive, slightly larger, and less centrally concentrated than those in pairs or singles. Fractality is more pronounced in clusters within pairs and groups, with 44% of group clusters exhibiting fractal substructure compared to 38.5% for pairs and 33.2% for singles. Similarly, median fdim values increase from singles (1.13) to pairs (1.16) to groups (1.25), reflecting greater substructure in denser environments. These findings indicate that both intrinsic cluster properties and environmental context significantly influence cluster evolution. More massive clusters tend to evolve toward centrally concentrated, radially symmetric configurations, while less massive clusters retain fractal features for longer periods. Overall, our study demonstrates that open clusters do not evolve in isolation: interactions with the environment play a critical role in shaping their structural evolution and dynamical state.</description>

      <title>The GECKOS Survey: Resolved, multiphase observations of mass-loading and gas density in the galactic wind of NGC 4666</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17560</link>

Abstract: We present a multiphase, resolved study of the galactic wind extending from the nearby starburst galaxy NGC 4666. For this we use VLT/MUSE observations from the GECKOS program and HI data from the WALLABY survey. We identify both ionised and HI gas in a biconical structure extending to at least $z\sim$8 kpc from the galaxy disk, with increasing velocity offsets above the midplane in both phases, consistent with a multiphase wind. The measured electron density, using [SII], differs significantly from standard expectations of galactic winds. We find electron density declines from the galaxy centre to $\sim2$ kpc, then rises again, remaining high ($\sim100-300$ cm$^{-3}$) out to $\sim$5 kpc. We find that HI dominates the mass loading. The total HI mass outflow rate (above $z~&gt;2$ kpc) is between $5-13~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, accounting for uncertainties from disk-blurring and group interactions. The total ionised mass outflow rate (traced by H$\alpha$) is between $0.5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$ and $5~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$, depending on $n_e(z)$ assumptions. From ALMA/ACA observations, we place an upper-limit on CO flux in the outflow which correlates to $\lesssim2.9~M_{\odot}~\rm yr^{-1}$. We also show that the entire outflow is not limited to the bicone, but a secondary starburst at the edge generates a more widespread outflow, which should be included in simulations. The cool gas in NGC 4666 wind has insufficient velocity to escape the halo of a galaxy of its mass, especially because most of the mass is present in the slower atomic phase. This strong biconical wind contributes to gas cycling around the galaxy.</description>

      <title>MEGATRON: the impact of non-equilibrium effects and local radiation fields on the circumgalactic medium at cosmic noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three cosmological radiation-hydrodynamic zoom simulations of the progenitor of a Milky Way-mass galaxy from the MEGATRON suite. The simulations combine on-the-fly radiative transfer with a detailed non-equilibrium thermochemical network (81 ions and molecules), resolving the cold and warm gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM) on spatial scales down to 20 pc and on average 200 pc at cosmic noon. Comparing our full non-equilibrium calculation with local radiation to traditional post-processed photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models assuming a uniform UV background (UVB), we find that non-equilibrium physics and local radiation fields fundamentally impact the thermochemistry of the CGM. Recombination lags and local radiation anisotropy shift ions away from their PIE+UVB values and modify covering fractions (for example, HI damped Ly$\alpha$ absorbers differ by up to 40%). In addition, a resolution study with cooling-length refinement allows us to double the resolution in the cold and warm CGM gas, reaching 120 pc on average. When refining on cooling length, the mass of the lightest cold clumps decreases tenfold to $\approx 10^4\,M_\odot$, their boundary layers develop sharper ion stratification, and the warm gas is better resolved, boosting the abundance of warm gas tracers such as CIV and OIII. Together, these results demonstrate that non-equilibrium thermochemistry coupled to radiative transfer, combined with physically motivated resolution criteria, is essential to predict circumgalactic absorption and emission signatures and to guide the design of targeted observations with existing and upcoming facilities.</description>

      <title>Galactic Positrons from Thermonuclear Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) may originate from a wide variety of explosion scenarios and progenitor channels. They exhibit a factor of about 10 difference in brightness and, thus, a differentiation in the mass of 56Ni-&gt;56Co-&gt;56 Fe. We present a study on the fate of positrons within SNe Ia in order to evaluate their escape fractions and energy spectra. Our detailed Monte Carlo transport simulations for positrons and gamma-rays include both beta + decay of 56 Co and pair production. We simulate a wide variety of explosion scenarios, including the explosion of white dwarfs (WD) close to the Chandrasekhar mass, M(Ch), He-triggered explosions of sub-M Ch WDs, and dynamical mergers of two WDs. For each model, we study the influence of the size and morphology of the progenitor magnetic field between 1 and 1E13 G. Population synthesis based on the observed brightness distribution of SNe Ia was used to estimate the overall contributions to Galactic positrons due to escape from SN Ia. We find that this is dominated by normal-bright SNe Ia, where variations in the distribution of emitted positrons are small. We estimate a total SNe Ia contribution to the Galactic positrons of &lt; 2% and, depending on the magnetic field morphology, less than 6...20% for M(Ch) and sub-M(Ch), respectively.</description>

      <title>Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04178v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which accounts for loss cone events through a sink term and can be orbit-averaged. It can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. We test our formulation by computing the relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space, that has a simple analytic form and agrees with the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption predicted by non-averaged models. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions -- that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation and might cause the tension between the observed vs theoretically predicted population of tidal disruptions.</description>

      <title>The Route to Unveil the Cosmic Genealogy of Supermassive Black Hole Binaries Using Nano-Hertz Gravitational Waves and Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05387v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nano-hertz (nHz) stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), generated by unresolved supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), provides a unique probe of their population and its cosmic evolution. In this work, we explore the potential of uncovering the SMBHB population and its redshift dependence by combining the SGWB signal and its anisotropies with galaxy distribution through cross-correlation analyses. Using a Fisher analysis technique, we show that the SGWB power spectrum alone can not provide any information on the evolutionary history of SMBHBs, whereas the inclusion of the angular power spectrum of the SGWB and its cross-correlation with the galaxy distribution substantially improves constraints on the redshift evolution parameters. Assuming pulsar timing array (PTA) configurations achievable in the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) era, we find that the combined use of isotropic and anisotropic SGWB signals, together with galaxy surveys, can provide valuable measurements of the redshift evolution of the SMBH-galaxy connection and the frequency distribution of SMBHBs. These results highlight the potential of joint GW-galaxy studies to address the long-standing open question of SMBH growth and evolution across cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Search for Past Stellar Encounters and the Origin of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity. To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion Development of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe pre-perihelion optical observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken during July - September 2025 using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.</description>
