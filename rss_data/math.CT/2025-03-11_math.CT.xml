      <title>The snail lemma and the long homology sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we establish an homotopical version of the snail lemma (which is a generalization of the classical snake lemma). In the second part, we introduce the category $\mathbf{Seq}(\mathcal A)$ of sequentiable families of arrows in a category $\mathcal A$ and we compare it with the category of chain complexes in $\mathcal A.$ We apply the homotopy snail lemma to a morphism in $\mathbf{Seq}(\mathcal A)$ obtaining first a six-term exact sequence in $\mathbf{Seq}(\mathcal A)$ and then, unrolling the sequence in $\mathbf{Seq}(\mathcal A),$ a long exact sequence in $\mathcal A.$ When $\mathcal A$ is abelian, this sequence subsumes the usual long homology sequence obtained from an extension of chain complexes.</description>

      <title>Categories meet semigroups in various ways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper touches on several interaction points of semigroups and constructions from category theory: An adjunction is established between categories with selected arrows and semigroups. Regular semigroups are characterized by split epi - split mono factorization of the Karoubi envelope. We investigate how semigroupads (monads without requirement of unit transformation) map semigroups to semigroups and ensure certain properties provided they hold on meta level.</description>

      <title>Abelian versus triangulated quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that any localisation of triangulated categories induces (up to an equivalence) a localisation of abelian categories when one passes to their abelianisations. From this one obtains for any enlargement of Grothendieck universes an example of an abelian category and a Serre subcategory within the smaller universe such that the corresponding quotient does only exist within the bigger universe. The second part of this note provides an analogue for the abelian hull of an arbitrary category.</description>

      <title>2-Coherent Internal Models of Homotopical Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The program of internal type theory seeks to develop the categorical model theory of dependent type theory using the language of dependent type theory itself. In the present work we study internal homotopical type theory by relaxing the notion of a category with families (cwf) to that of a wild, or precoherent higher cwf, and determine coherence conditions that suffice to recover properties expected of models of dependent type theory. The result is a definition of a split 2-coherent wild cwf, which admits as instances both the syntax and the "standard model" given by a universe type. This allows us to give a straightforward internalization of the notion of a 2-coherent reflection of homotopical type theory in itself: namely as a 2-coherent wild cwf morphism from the syntax to the standard model. Our theory also easily specializes to give definitions of "low-dimensional" higher cwfs, and conjecturally includes the container higher model as a further instance.</description>

      <title>Proto-exact and parabelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proto-exact and parabelian categories serve as non-additive analogues of exact and quasi-abelian categories, respectively. They give rise to algebraic K-theory and Hall algebras similarly to the additive setting. We show that every parabelian category admits a canonical proto-exact structure and we study several classes of parabelian categories, including categories of normed and Euclidean vector spaces, pointed closure spaces and pointed matroids, Hermitian vector bundles over rings of integers. We also examine finitary algebraic categories arising in Arakelov geometry and provide a criterion for determining when such a category is parabelian. In particular, we prove that the categories of pointed convex spaces and absolutely convex spaces are parabelian.</description>

      <title>On the category of Hopf braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hopf braces are the quantum analogues of skew braces and, as such, their cocommutative counterparts provide solutions to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We investigate various properties of categories related to Hopf braces. In particular, we prove that the category of Hopf braces is accessible while the category of cocommutative Hopf braces is even locally presentable. We also show that functors forgetting multiple antipodes and/or multiplications down to coalgebras are monadic. Colimits in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces are described explicitly and a free cocommutative Hopf brace on an arbitrary cocommutative Hopf algebra is constructed.</description>

      <title>Eulerian magnitude homology: diagonality, injective words, and regular path homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the algebraic structure and combinatorial properties of eulerian magnitude homology. First, we analyze the diagonality conditions of eulerian magnitude homology, providing a characterization of complete graphs. Then, we construct the regular magnitude-path spectral sequence as the spectral sequence of the (filtered) injective nerve of the reachability category, and explore its consequences. Among others, we show that such spectral sequence converges to the complex of injective words on a digraph, and yields characterization results for the regular path homology of diagonal directed graphs.</description>

      <title>On the Representation Categories of Weak Hopf Algebras Arising from Levin-Wen Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their study of Levin-Wen models [Commun. Math. Phys. 313 (2012) 351-373], Kitaev and Kong proposed a weak Hopf algebra associated with a unitary fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ and a unitary left $\mathcal{C}$-module $\mathcal{M}$, and sketched a proof that its representation category is monoidally equivalent to the unitary $\mathcal{C}$-module functor category $\mathrm{Fun}^{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M},\mathcal{M})^\mathrm{rev}$. We give an independent proof of this result without the unitarity conditions. In particular, viewing $\mathcal{C}$ as a left $\mathcal{C} \boxtimes \mathcal{C}^{\mathrm{rev}}$-module, we obtain a quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra whose representation category is braided equivalent to the Drinfeld center $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. In the appendix, we also compare this quasi-triangular weak Hopf algebra with the tube algebra $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ when $\mathcal{C}$ is pivotal. These two algebras are Morita equivalent by the well-known equivalence $\mathrm{Rep}(\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}})\cong\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C})$. However, we show that in general there is no weak Hopf algebra structure on $\mathrm{Tube}_{\mathcal{C}}$ such that the above equivalence is monoidal.</description>

      <title>Quantum Supermaps are Characterized by Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09844v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new characterisation of quantum supermaps in terms of an axiom that refers only to sequential and parallel composition. Consequently, we generalize quantum supermaps to arbitrary monoidal categories and operational probabilistic theories. We do so by providing a simple definition of locally-applicable transformation on a monoidal category. The definition can be rephrased in the language of category theory using the principle of naturality, and can be given an intuitive diagrammatic representation in terms of which all proofs are presented. In our main technical contribution, we use this diagrammatic representation to show that locally-applicable transformations on quantum channels are in one-to-one correspondence with deterministic quantum supermaps. This alternative characterization of quantum supermaps is proven to work for more general multiple-input supermaps such as the quantum switch and on arbitrary normal convex spaces of quantum channels such as those defined by satisfaction of signaling constraints.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories and shows that they form lattices under certain conditions, including all semisimple tensor categories. Furthermore, it extends Watatani's theorem on the finiteness of intermediate subfactors, proving that these lattices are finite under weak positivity constraints, encompassing all semisimple tensor categories as well. The primary tools employed in this paper are semisimplification and a concept of formal angle. Additionally, we have broadened several intermediate results, such as the exchange relation theorem and Landau's theorem, to apply to abelian monoidal categories. Key applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>
