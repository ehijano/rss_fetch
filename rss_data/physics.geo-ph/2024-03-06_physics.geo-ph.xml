      <title>Intelligent Traffic Monitoring with Distributed Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is promising for traffic monitoring, but its extensive data and sensitivity to vibrations, causing noise, pose computational challenges. To address this, we propose a two-step deep-learning workflow with high efficiency and noise immunity for DAS-based traffic monitoring, focusing on instance vehicle trajectory segmentation and velocity estimation. Our approach begins by generating a diverse synthetic DAS dataset with labeled vehicle signals, tackling the issue of missing training labels in this field. This dataset is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect linear vehicle trajectories from the noisy DAS data in the time-space domain. However, due to significant noise, these trajectories are often fragmented and incomplete. To enhance accuracy, we introduce a second step involving the Hough transform. This converts detected linear features into point-like energy clusters in the Hough domain. Another CNN is then employed to focus on these energies, identifying the most significant points. The inverse Hough transform is applied to these points to reconstruct complete, distinct, and noise-free linear vehicle trajectories in the time-space domain. The Hough transform plays a crucial role by enforcing a local linearity constraint on the trajectories, enhancing continuity and noise immunity, and facilitating the separation of individual trajectories and estimation of vehicle velocities (indicated by trajectory slopes in the Hough domain). Our method has shown effectiveness in real-world datasets, proving its value in real-time processing of DAS data and applicability in similar traffic monitoring scenarios.

      <title>Interannual Magneto-Coriolis modes and their sensitivity on the magnetic field within the Earth's core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear modes for which the Coriolis acceleration is almost entirely in balance with the Lorentz force are called Magneto-Coriolis (MC) modes. These MC modes are thought to exist in Earth's liquid outer core and could therefore contribute to the variations observed in Earth's magnetic field. The background state on which these waves ride is assumed here to be static and defined by a prescribed magnetic field and zero flow. We introduce a new computational tool to efficiently compute solutions to the related eigenvalue problem, and study the affect of a range of both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric background magnetic fields on the MC modes. We focus on a hierarchy of conditions that sequentially partition the numerous computed modes into those which are in principle observable, those which match a proxy for interannual geomagnetic signal over 1999-2023, and those which align with core-flows based on recent geomagnetic data. We found that the background field plays a crucial role in modal structure. In particular, we found no examples of axisymmetric background fields that support modes consistent with recent geomagnetic changes, but that some non-axisymmetric background fields do support consistent modes.</description>

      <title>Fast, Scale-Adaptive, and Uncertainty-Aware Downscaling of Earth System Model Fields with Generative Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our foundation model approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</description>

      <title>High-pressure Phase Transition of Olivine-type Mg$_2$GeO$_4$ to a Metastable Forsterite-III type Structure and their Equation of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11336</link>

Abstract: Germanates are often used as structural analogs of planetary silicates. We have explored the high-pressure phase relations in Mg$_2$GeO$_4$ using diamond anvil cell experiments combined with synchrotron x-ray diffraction and computations based on density functional theory. Upon room temperature compression, forsterite-type Mg$_2$GeO$_4$ remains stable up to 30 GPa. At higher pressures, a phase transition to a forsterite-III type (Cmc21) structure was observed, which remained stable to the peak pressure of 105 GPa. Using a 3rd order Birch Murnaghan fit to the experimental data, we obtained V0 = 305.1 (3) {\AA}3, K0 = 124.6 (14) GPa and K0' = 3.86 (fixed) for forsterite- and V0 = 263.5 (15) {\AA}3, K0 = 175 (7) GPa and K0' = 4.2 (fixed) for the forsterite-III type phase. The forsterite-III type structure was found to be metastable when compared to the stable assemblage of perovskite/post-perovskite + MgO, as observed during laser-heating experiments. Understanding the phase relations and physical properties of metastable phases is crucial for studying the mineralogy of impact sites, understanding metastable wedges in subducting slabs and interpreting the results of shock compression experiments.</description>
