      <title>Adversarial Robustness Guarantees for Quantum Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite their ever more widespread deployment throughout society, machine learning algorithms remain critically vulnerable to being spoofed by subtle adversarial tampering with their input data. The prospect of near-term quantum computers being capable of running {quantum machine learning} (QML) algorithms has therefore generated intense interest in their adversarial vulnerability. Here we show that quantum properties of QML algorithms can confer fundamental protections against such attacks, in certain scenarios guaranteeing robustness against classically-armed adversaries. We leverage tools from many-body physics to identify the quantum sources of this protection. Our results offer a theoretical underpinning of recent evidence which suggest quantum advantages in the search for adversarial robustness. In particular, we prove that quantum classifiers are: (i) protected against weak perturbations of data drawn from the trained distribution, (ii) protected against local attacks if they are insufficiently scrambling, and (iii) protected against universal adversarial attacks if they are sufficiently quantum chaotic. Our analytic results are supported by numerical evidence demonstrating the applicability of our theorems and the resulting robustness of a quantum classifier in practice. This line of inquiry constitutes a concrete pathway to advantage in QML, orthogonal to the usually sought improvements in model speed or accuracy.</description>

      <title>Trapped-Ion Quantum Simulation of Electron Transfer Models with Tunable Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transfer is at the heart of many fundamental physical, chemical, and biochemical processes essential for life. Exact simulation of reactions in these systems is often hindered by the large number of degrees of freedom and by the essential role of quantum effects. In this work, we experimentally simulate a paradigmatic model of molecular electron transfer using a multi-species trapped-ion crystal, where the donor-acceptor gap, the electronic and vibronic couplings, and the bath relaxation dynamics can all be controlled independently. We employ the ground-state qubit of one ion to simulate the electronic degree of freedom and the optical qubit of another ion to perform reservoir engineering on a collective mode encoding a reaction coordinate. We observe the real-time dynamics of the spin excitation, measuring the transfer rate in several regimes of adiabaticity and relaxation dynamics. The setup allows access to the electron transfer dynamics in the non-perturbative regime, where there is no clear hierarchy among the energy scales in the model, as has been suggested to be optimal for many rate phenomena, including photosynthesis. Our results provide a testing ground for increasingly rich models of molecular excitation transfer processes that are relevant for molecular electronics and light-harvesting systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental preparation of multiphoton-added coherent states of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conditional addition of photons represents a crucial tool for optical quantum state engineering and it forms a fundamental building block of advanced quantum photonic devices. Here we report on experimental implementation of the conditional addition of several photons. We demonstrate the addition of one, two, and three photons to input coherent states with various amplitudes. The resulting highly nonclassical photon-added states are completely characterized with time-domain homodyne tomography, and the nonclassicality of the prepared states is witnessed by the negativity of their Wigner functions. We experimentally demonstrate that the conditional addition of photons realizes approximate noiseless quantum amplification of coherent states with sufficiently large amplitude. We also investigate certification of the stellar rank of the generated multiphoton-added coherent states, which quantifies the non-Gaussian resources required for their preparation. Our results pave the way towards the experimental realization of complex optical quantum operations based on combination of multiple photon additions and subtractions.</description>

      <title>Exponential improvements in the simulation of lattice gauge theories using near-optimal techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of quantum systems of a large number of strongly interacting particles persists as one of the most challenging, and computationally demanding, tasks in classical simulation, involving both non-relativistic applications like condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry, as well as relativistic applications like lattice gauge theory simulation. One of the major motivations for building a fault-tolerant quantum computer is the efficient simulation of many-body systems on such a device. While significant developments have been made in the quantum simulation of non-relativistic systems, the simulation of lattice gauge theories has lagged behind, with state-of-the-art Trotterized simulations requiring many orders of magnitude more resources than non-relativistic simulation, in stark contrast to the similar difficulty of these tasks in classical simulation. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the cost of simulating Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in the Kogut-Susskind formulation using simulation methods with near-optimal scaling in system size, evolution time, and error. We provide explicit circuit constructions, as well as T-gate counts and qubit counts for the entire simulation algorithm. This investigation, the first of its kind, leads to up to 25 orders of magnitude improvement over Trotterization in spacetime volume for non-Abelian simulations. Such a dramatic improvement results largely from our algorithm having polynomial scaling with the number of colors, as opposed to exponential scaling in existing approaches. Our work demonstrates that the use of advanced algorithmic techniques leads to dramatic reductions in the cost of ab initio simulations of fundamental interactions, bringing it in step with resources required for first principles quantum simulation of chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Circuit-based erasure conversion of leakage errors in neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leakage out of the computational subspace (predominantly by atom loss) is a major limitation of current state-of-the-art neutral atom quantum computers and a significant challenge for long-term prospects of the platform. We demonstrate proof-of-principle circuit-based conversion of leakage errors to erasure errors in a neutral atom quantum processor via "Leakage Detection Units," (LDUs) which non-destructively map qubit presence information onto the state of an ancilla. We successfully perform conversion of leakage errors via all major leakage pathways with a standard formulation of the LDU, benchmarking the performance of the LDU using a three-outcome low-loss state detection method. The LDU detects atom loss errors with ~93.4% accuracy, limited by technical imperfections of our apparatus. We further propose, compile, and execute a SWAP LDU, wherein the roles of the original data atom and ancilla atom are exchanged under the action of the LDU, providing "free refilling" of atoms in the case of leakage errors. This circuit-based leakage-to-erasure error conversion is a critical component of a neutral atom quantum processor where the quantum information may significantly outlive the lifetime of any individual atom in the quantum register.</description>

      <title>Simulation of feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization for a realistic neutral atom system with an optimized small-angle controlled-phase gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to the classical optimization process required by the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, FALQON, a feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization [A. B. Magann {\it et al.,} {\color{blue}Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf129}, 250502 (2022)}], enables one to obtain approximate solutions to combinatorial optimization problems without any classical optimization effort. In this study, we leverage the specifications of a recent experimental platform for the neutral atom system [Z. Fu {\it et al.,} {\color{blue}Phys. Rev. A {\bf105}, 042430 (2022)}] and present a scheme to implement an optimally tuned small-angle controlled-phase gate with quantum optimal control. By examining the 2- to 4-qubit FALQON algorithms in the Max-Cut problem and considering the spontaneous emission of the neutral atomic system, we have observed that the performance of FALQON implemented with small-angle controlled-phase gates exceeds that of FALQON utilizing CZ gates. This approach has the potential to significantly simplify the logic circuit required to simulate FALQON and effectively address the Max-Cut problem, which may pave a way for the experimental implementation of near-term noisy intermediate-scale quantum algorithms with neutral-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Temporally multiplexed ion-photon quantum interface via fast ion-chain transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-rate remote entanglement between photon and matter-based qubits is essential for distributed quantum information processing. A key technique to increase the modest entangling rates of existing long-distance quantum networking approaches is multiplexing. Here, we demonstrate a temporally multiplexed ion-photon interface via rapid transport of a chain of nine calcium ions across 74 $\mathrm{\mu m}$ within 86 $\mathrm{\mu s}$. The non-classical nature of the multiplexed photons is verified by measuring the second-order correlation function with an average value of $g^{(2)}(0)$ = 0.060(13), indicating negligible crosstalk between the multiplexed modes. In addition, we characterize the motional degree-of-freedom of the ion crystal after transport and find that it is coherently excited to as much as $\bar{n}_\alpha\approx 110$ for the center-of-mass mode. Our proof-of-principle implementation paves the way for large-scale quantum networking with trapped ions, but highlights some challenges that must be overcome.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Logarithmic Derivative Type Lower Bounds for Quantum Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian approach for quantum parameter estimation has gained a renewed interest from practical applications of quantum estimation theory. Recently, a lower bound, called the Bayesian Nagaoka-Hayashi bound for the Bayes risk in quantum domain was proposed, which is an extension of a new approach to point estimation of quantum states by Conlon et al. (2021). The objective of this paper is to explore this Bayesian Nagaoka-Hayashi bound further by obtaining its lower bounds. We first obtain one-parameter family of lower bounds, which is an analogue of the Holevo bound in point estimation. Thereby, we derive one-parameter family of Bayesian logarithmic derivative type lower bounds in a closed form for the parameter independent weight matrix setting. This new bound includes previously known Bayesian lower bounds as special cases.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulation Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital quantum computers promise exponential speedups in performing quantum time-evolution, providing an opportunity to simulate quantum dynamics of complex systems in physics and chemistry. However, the task of extracting desired quantum properties at intermediate time steps remains a computational bottleneck due to wavefunction collapse and no-fast-forwarding theorem. Despite significant progress towards building a Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computer (FTQC), there is still a need for resource-efficient quantum simulators. Here, we propose a hybrid simulator that enables classical computers to leverage FTQC devices and quantum time propagators to overcome this bottleneck, so as to efficiently simulate the quantum dynamics of large systems initialized in an unknown superposition of a few system eigenstates. It features no optimization subroutines and avoids barren plateau issues, while consuming fewer quantum resources compared to standard methods when many time steps are required.</description>

      <title>Light with Even Fock states from Interference of Kerr-squeezed Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the generation of non-classical light by destructive interference of identical Kerr squeezed states. Perfect pair-wise cancellation of amplitudes that contribute to odd Fock states results in light with only even Fock states, independent of the strength of the nonlinearity. The observability of this effect is only limited by the quality of the interferometer. In the low nonlinearity limit, the even-only state resembles a squeezed vacuum state, yet the even-odd oscillations persist when the nonlinearity is strong. The effect is also robust against deviations from the optimum relative phase of the input Kerr-squeezed states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the entanglement dynamics of different subsystems such as atom-atom, atom-field and field-field with radiation field in squeezed coherent thermal states for the intensity-dependent double Jaynes-Cummings model (IDDJCM) and double Jaynes-Cummings model (DJCM) are investigated. The effects of both squeezed photons and thermal photons on entanglement dynamics is observed. The main feature of the double Jaynes-Cummings model - entanglement sudden death is observed for every subsystem. The effects of various interactions such as Ising interaction, single photon exchange interaction and dipole-dipole interaction on entanglement dynamics are studied. The effects of detuning, Kerr-nonlinearity on the entanglement dynamics are investigated for every subsystem. It is noticed that proper choice of the interactions parameters, detuning and Kerr-nonlinearity effectively removes entanglement deaths from the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Variational minimization scheme for the one-particle reduced density matrix functional theory in the ensemble N-representability domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-particle reduced density-matrix (1-RDM) functional theory is a promising alternative to density-functional theory (DFT) that uses the 1-RDM rather than the electronic density as a basic variable. However, long-standing challenges such as the lack of Kohn--Sham scheme and the complexity of the pure $N$-representability conditions are still impeding its wild utilization. Fortunately, ensemble $N$-representability conditions derived in the natural orbital basis are known and trivial, such that almost every functionals of the 1-RDM are actually natural orbital functionals which do not perform well for all the correlation regimes. In this work, we propose a variational minimization scheme in the ensemble $N$-representable domain that is not restricted to the natural orbital representation of the 1-RDM. We show that splitting the minimization into the diagonal and off-diagonal part of the 1-RDM can open the way toward the development of functionals of the orbital occupations, which remains a challenge for the generalization of site-occupation functional theory in chemistry. Our approach is tested on the uniform Hubbard model using the M\"uller and the T\"ows--Pastor functionals, as well as on the dihydrogen molecule using the M\"uller functional.</description>

      <title>Second Law of Entanglement Manipulation with Entanglement Battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central question since the beginning of quantum information science is how two distant parties can convert one entangled state into another. Answers to these questions enable us to optimize the performance of tasks such as quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation, since certain entangled states are more useful than others for these applications. It has been conjectured that entangled state transformations could be executed reversibly in an asymptotic regime, mirroring the reversible nature of Carnot cycles in classical thermodynamics. While a conclusive proof of this conjecture has been missing so far, earlier studies excluded reversible entanglement manipulation in various settings. In this work, we investigate the concept of an entanglement battery, an auxiliary quantum system that facilitates quantum state transformations without a net loss of entanglement. We establish that reversible manipulation of entangled states is achievable through local operations when augmented with an entanglement battery. In this setting, two distant parties can convert any entangled state into another of equivalent entanglement. The rate of asymptotic transformation is quantitatively expressed as a ratio of the entanglement present within the quantum states involved. Different entanglement quantifiers give rise to unique principles governing state transformations, effectively constituting diverse manifestations of a "second law" of entanglement manipulation. Our methods provide a solution to the long-standing open question regarding the reversible manipulation of entangled states and are also applicable to entangled systems involving more than two parties, and to other quantum resource theories, including quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of quantum synchronization from the viewpoint of quantum metrology. By interpreting quantum self-sustained oscillators as dissipative quantum sensors, we develop a framework to characterize several aspects of quantum synchronization. We show that the quantum Fisher information (QFI) serves as a system-agnostic measure of quantum synchronization that also carries a clear operational meaning, viz., it quantifies the precision with which the amplitude of a weak synchronizing drive can be measured. We extend our analysis to study many-body oscillators subjected to multiple drives. We show how the QFI matrix can be used to determine the optimal drive that maximizes quantum synchronization, and also to quantitatively differentiate the synchronization responses induced by different drives. Our work highlights multiple connections between quantum synchronization and quantum metrology, paving a route towards finding quantum technological applications of quantum synchronization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a collision model to investigate the information dynamics of a system coupled to an environment with varying degrees of non-Markovianity. We control the degree of non-Markovianity by applying a depolarising channel to a fixed and rigid reservoir of qubits. We characterise the effect of the depolarising channel and apply the model to study the coherent transport of an excitation on a chain of three interacting qubits. We show how the system-environment coupling strength and the degree of non-Markovianity affect the process. Interestingly, in some cases a Markovian environment is preferable to enhance the coherent transport of the excitation.</description>

Abstract: Based on the adiabatic geometric phase concerning with density matrix[1] , we extend it to the sub-geometric phase in the non-adiabatic case. It is found that whatever the real part or imaginary part of the sub-geometric phase can play an important role in quantum transition. The imaginary part of sub-geometric phase can deviate the resonance peak in the quantum transition, which may bring modification on the level crossing, while the real part of sub-geometric phase will determine the stability of initial state according to the linear stability analysis theory, which can be regarded as somewhat complement on the selection rule of quantum transition. Finally, we illustrate them by two examples: one is the system with time-dependent perturbation, the other is a two-level system. It indicates that both the real and imaginary parts of sub-geometric phase have influence on quantum transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase Transitions in Many-Dipole Light-Matter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A potential phase transition between a normal ground state and a photon-condensed ground state in many-dipole light-matter systems is a topic of considerable controversy, exasperated by conflicting no-go and counter no-go theorems and often ill-defined models. We clarify this long-lasting debate by analyzing two specific arrangements of atoms, including a 3D cubic lattice and a cavity-embedded square lattice layer, which provides a physical model for single-mode cavity QED with coupled dipoles in the thermodynamic limit. These models are shown to significantly differ from the standard Dicke model and, in the thermodynamic limit, give rise to renormalized Hopfield models. We show that a ferroelectric phase transition can (in principle) still occur and the description of the abnormal phase beyond the critical point requires the inclusion of nonlinear terms in the Holstein-Primakoff mapping. We also show how our model agrees with recent experiments.</description>

      <title>High-throughput assessment of defect-nuclear spin register controllability for quantum memory applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum memories play a key role in facilitating tasks within quantum networks and quantum information processing, including secure communications, advanced quantum sensing, and distributed quantum computing. Progress in characterizing large nuclear spin registers coupled to defect electronic spins has been significant, but selecting memory qubits remains challenging due to the multitude of possible assignments. Numerical simulations for evaluating entangling gate fidelities encounter obstacles, restricting research to small registers, while experimental investigations are time-consuming and often limited to well-understood samples. Here we present an efficient methodology for systematically assessing the controllability of defect systems coupled to nuclear spin registers. We showcase the approach by investigating the generation of entanglement links between defects in SiC and randomly selected sets of nuclear spins within the two-species ($^{13}$C and $^{29}$Si) nuclear register. We quantify the performance of entangling gate operations and present the achievable gate fidelities, considering both the size of the register and the presence of unwanted nuclear spins. We find that some control sequences perform better than others depending on the number of target versus bath nuclei. This efficient approach is a guide for both experimental investigation and engineering, facilitating the high-throughput exploration of suitable defect systems for quantum memories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building a scalable universal high-performance quantum processor is a formidable challenge. In particular, the problem of realizing fast high-perfomance two-qubit gates of high-fidelity remains needful. Here we propose a unitary cell for a scalable quantum processor consisting of two transmons and a tunable three-mode coupler allowing for a ZZ interaction control. We experimentally demonstrate the native CZ gate with the pulse duration of 60~ns achieving the two-qubit gate fidelity above 98%, limited mostly by qubit coherence time. Numerical simulations show that by optimizing the gate duration the fidelity can be pushed over 99.97%.</description>

      <title>ZX-calculus is Complete for Finite-Dimensional Hilbert Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ZX-calculus is a graphical language for reasoning about quantum computing and quantum information theory. As a complete graphical language, it incorporates a set of axioms rich enough to derive any equation of the underlying formalism. While completeness of the ZX-calculus has been established for qubits and the Clifford fragment of prime-dimensional qudits, universal completeness beyond two-level systems has remained unproven until now. In this paper, we present a proof establishing the completeness of finite-dimensional ZX-calculus, incorporating only the mixed-dimensional Z-spider and the qudit X-spider as generators. Our approach builds on the completeness of another graphical language, the finite-dimensional ZW-calculus, with direct translations between these two calculi. By proving its completeness, we lay a solid foundation for the ZX-calculus as a versatile tool not only for quantum computation but also for various fields within finite-dimensional quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Entanglement and Quantum Correlations in Condensed Matter: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and certification of entanglement and quantum correlations in materials is of fundamental and far-reaching importance, and has seen significant recent progress. It impacts both our understanding of the basic science of quantum many-body phenomena as well as the identification of systems suitable for novel technologies. Frameworks suitable to condensed matter that connect measurements to entanglement and coherence have been developed in the context of quantum information theory. These take the form of entanglement witnesses and quantum correlation measures.
  The underlying theory of these quantities, their relation to condensed matter experimental techniques, and their application to real materials are comprehensively reviewed. In addition, their usage in e.g. protocols, the relative advantages and disadvantages of witnesses and measures, and future prospects in, e.g., correlated electrons, entanglement dynamics, and entangled spectroscopic probes, are presented. Consideration is given to the interdisciplinary nature of this emerging research and substantial ongoing progress by providing an accessible and practical treatment from fundamentals to application. Particular emphasis is placed on quantities accessible to collective measurements, including by susceptibility and spectroscopic techniques. This includes the magnetic susceptibility witness, one-tangle, concurrence and two-tangle, two-site quantum discord, and quantum coherence measures such as the quantum Fisher information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning low-degree quantum objects up to $\varepsilon$-error in $\ell_2$-distance. We show the following results: $(i)$ unknown $n$-qubit degree-$d$ (in the Pauli basis) quantum channels and unitaries can be learned using $O(1/\varepsilon^d)$ queries (independent of $n$), $(ii)$ polynomials $p:\{-1,1\}^n\rightarrow [-1,1]$ arising from $d$-query quantum algorithms can be classically learned from $O((1/\varepsilon)^d\cdot \log n)$ many random examples $(x,p(x))$ (which implies learnability even for $d=O(\log n)$), and $(iii)$ degree-$d$ polynomials $p:\{-1,1\}^n\to [-1,1]$ can be learned through $O(1/\varepsilon^d)$ queries to a quantum unitary $U_p$ that block-encodes $p$. Our main technical contributions are new Bohnenblust-Hille inequalities for quantum channels and completely bounded~polynomials.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithm Landscape Reconstruction by Low-Rank Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are a broad class of algorithms with many applications in science and industry. Applying a VQA to a problem involves optimizing a parameterized quantum circuit by maximizing or minimizing a cost function. A particular challenge associated with VQAs is understanding the properties of associated cost functions. Having the landscapes of VQA cost functions can greatly assist in developing and testing new variational quantum algorithms, but they are extremely expensive to compute. Reconstructing the landscape of a VQA using existing techniques requires a large number of cost function evaluations, especially when the dimension or the resolution of the landscape is high. To address this challenge, we propose a low-rank tensor-completion-based approach for local landscape reconstruction. By leveraging compact low-rank representations of tensors, our technique can overcome the curse of dimensionality and handle high-resolution landscapes. We demonstrate the power of landscapes in VQA development by showcasing practical applications of analyzing penalty terms for constrained optimization problems and examining the probability landscapes of certain basis states.</description>

      <title>Scalability enhancement of quantum computing under limited connectivity through distributed quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ quantum-volume random-circuit sampling to benchmark the two-QPU entanglement-assisted distributed quantum computing (DQC), and compare it with single-QPU quantum computing. We first specify a single-qubit depolarizing noise model in the random circuit. Based on this error model, we show the one-to-one correspondence of three figures of merits, namely average gate fidelity, heavy output probability, and linear cross-entropy. We derive an analytical approximation of the average gate fidelity under the specified noise model, which is shown to align with numerical simulations. The approximation is calculated based on an allocation matrix obtained from the extended connectivity graph of a DQC device. In numerical simulation, we unveil the scalability enhancement in DQC for the QPUs with limited connectivity. Furthermore, we provide a simple formula to estimate the average gate fidelity, which also provides us with a heuristic method to evaluate the scalability enhancement in DQC, and a guide to optimize the structure of a DQC configuration.</description>

      <title>Topological phases of extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite extensive studies on the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard (SSHH) model, the variant incorporating next-nearest neighbour hopping remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate the ground-state properties of this extended SSHH model using the constrained-path auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (CP-AFQMC) method. We show that this model exhibits rich topological phases, characterized by robust edge states against interaction. We quantify the properties of these edge states by analyzing spin correlation and second-order R\'enyi entanglement entropy. The system exhibits long-range spin correlation and near-zero R\'enyi entropy at half-filling. Besides, there is a long-range anti-ferromagnetic order at quarter-filling. Interestingly, an external magnetic field disrupts this long-range anti-ferromagnetic order, restoring long-range spin correlation and near-zero R\'enyi entropy. Furthermore, our work provides a paradigm studying topological properties in large interacting systems via the CP-AFQMC algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of a cloud of positive vacuum energy around particles created by the excitation of the quantum vacuum in a dynamical cavity. We show that if when one has only one mirror moving in a free space, in the vacuum state, all the energy transferred from the mirror to the field is converted into real particles, on the other hand, when considering a second and static mirror forming a cavity with the first, the same movement of the first mirror can lead to less energy being converted into real particles, with the difference being converted into positive vacuum energy around these particles.</description>

      <title>Observation of Noise Suppression during High-Efficiency Wavelength Doubling of Intense Quasi-Monochromatic Laser Light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-stable, quasi-monochromatic laser light forms the basis for high-precision interferometric measurements, e.g. for observing gravitational waves and for time keeping with optical clocks. Optical frequency conversion enables access to wavelengths at which optical materials have the lowest absorption and the lowest mechanical loss. Here we report a 25 % reduction in relative intensity noise (of technical origin) when converting 1064 nm to 2128 nm for powers far above parametric oscillation threshold. The new wavelength has high potential for improving gravitational wave detection and other ultra-high-precision experiments as well. Our results provide a better understanding of the dynamics of nonlinear optical processes and have great potential for the stabilisation of laser sources in optical sensing and metrology.</description>

      <title>Spectral functions with infinite projected entangled-pair states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infinite projected entangled-pair states (iPEPS) provide a powerful tool to study two-dimensional strongly correlated systems directly in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we extend the iPEPS toolbox by a method to efficiently evaluate non-equal time two-point correlators, enabling the computation of spectral functions. It is based on an iPEPS ansatz of the ground state in a large unit cell, with an operator applied in the center of the cell, which is evolved in real-time using the fast-full update method. At every time step, the two-point correlators within a cell are computed based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group method. Benchmark results for the 2D transverse field Ising model show that the main features of the dynamical structure factor can already be reproduced at relatively small bond dimensions and unit cell sizes. The results for the magnon dispersion are found to be in good agreement with previous data obtained with the iPEPS excitation ansatz.</description>

      <title>A metaplectic perspective of uncertainty principles in the Linear Canonical Transform domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive Heisenberg uncertainty principles for pairs of Linear Canonical Transforms of a given function, by resorting to the fact that these transforms are just metaplectic operators associated with free symplectic matrices. The results obtained synthesize and generalize previous results found in the literature, because they apply to all signals, in arbitrary dimension and any metaplectic operator (which includes Linear Canonical Transforms as particular cases). Moreover, we also obtain a generalization of the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty principle for Linear Canonical Transforms. We also propose a new quadratic phase-space distribution, which represents a signal along two intermediate directions in the time-frequency plane. The marginal distributions are always non-negative and permit a simple interpretation in terms of the Radon transform. We also give a geometric interpretation of this quadratic phase-space representation as a Wigner distribution obtained upon Weyl quantization on a non-standard symplectic vector space. Finally, we derive the multidimensional version of the Hardy uncertainty principle for metaplectic operators and the Paley-Wiener theorem for Linear Canonical Transforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the dynamics of tunable spin-orbit-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates confined within a harmonic trap, focusing on rapid transport, spin manipulation, and splitting dynamics. Using shortcuts to adiabaticity, we design time-dependent trap trajectories and spin-orbit-coupling strength to facilitate fast transport with simultaneous spin flip. Additionally, we showcase the creation of spin-dependent coherent states via engineering the spin-orbit-coupling strength. To deepen our understanding, we elucidate non-adiabatic transport and associated spin dynamics, contrasting them with simple scenarios characterized by constant spin-orbit coupling and trap velocity. Furthermore, we discuss the transverse Zeeman potential and nonlinear effect induced by interatomic interactions using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, highlighting the stability and feasibility of the proposed protocols for the state-of-the-art experiments with cold atoms.</description>

      <title>A coherence sweet spot with enhanced dipolar coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Qubits require a compromise between operation speed and coherence. Here, we demonstrate a compromise-free singlet-triplet (ST) qubit, where the qubit couples maximally to the driving field while simultaneously coupling minimally to the dominant noise sources. The qubit is implemented in a crystal-phase defined double-quantum dot in an InAs nanowire. Using a superconducting resonator, we measure the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) gap, the spin-photon coupling strength and the qubit decoherence rate as a function of the in-plane magnetic-field orientation. We demonstrate a spin qubit sweet spot maximizing the dipolar coupling and simultaneously minimizing the decoherence. Our theoretical description postulates phonons as the most likely dominant noise source. The compromise-free sweet spot originates from the SOI suggesting that it is not restricted to this material platform, but might find applications in any material with SOI. These findings pave the way for enhanced engineering of these nanomaterials for next-generation qubit technologies.</description>

      <title>A wavefront rotator with near-zero mean polarization change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A K-mirror is a device that rotates the wavefront of an incident optical field. It has recently gained prominence over Dove prism, another commonly used wavefront rotator, due to the fact that while a K-mirror has several controls for adjusting the internal reflections, a Dove prism is made of a single glass element with no additional control. Thus, one can obtain much lower angular deviations of transmitting wavefronts using a K-mirror than with a Dove prism. However, the accompanying polarization changes in the transmitted field due to rotation persist even in the commercially available K-mirrors. A recent theoretical work [Applied Optics, 61, 8302 (2022)] shows that it is possible to optimize the base angle of a K-mirror for a given refractive index such that the accompanying polarization changes are minimum. In contrast, we show in this article that by optimizing the refractive index it is possible to design a K-mirror at any given base angle and with any given value for the mean polarization change, including near-zero values. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate a K-mirror with an order-of-magnitude lower mean polarization change than that of the commercially available K-mirrors. This can have important practical implications for OAM-based applications that require precise wavefront rotation control.</description>

      <title>Stochastic inflation and entropy bound in de Sitter spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the entropy behavior of the de Sitter spacetime during the inflationary phase. In the de Sitter spacetime, a cosmological horizon that constrains the causal accessible region of an observer, exhibits thermal properties analogous to the event horizon of a black hole. From the principle of holography, the entropy within the causally connected region for an observer is constrained by the area of its boundary. This entropy bound is violated in the late stage of inflation. To address the issue of entropy bound violation from a perspective of quantum information, we adopt the stochastic approach to cosmic inflation. To reformulate the issue of entropy bound in the inflation, we follow the derivation of the Page curve in the black hole context. By adopting the volume-weighted probability distribution for the inflaton field, we obtain a meaningful entropy behavior in the de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Efficient photon-pair generation in layer-poled lithium niobate nanophotonic waveguides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated photon-pair sources are crucial for scalable photonic quantum systems. Thin-film lithium niobate is a promising platform for on-chip photon-pair generation through spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC). However, the device implementation faces practical challenges. Periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN), despite enabling flexible quasi-phase matching, suffers from poor fabrication reliability and device repeatability, while conventional modal phase matching (MPM) methods yield limited efficiencies due to inadequate mode overlaps. Here, we introduce a layer-poled lithium niobate (LPLN) nanophotonic waveguide for efficient photon-pair generation. It leverages layer-wise polarity inversion through electrical poling to break spatial symmetry and significantly enhance nonlinear interactions for MPM, achieving a notable normalized second-harmonic generation (SHG) conversion efficiency of 4615% W^{-1}cm^{-2}. Through a cascaded SHG and SPDC process, we demonstrate photon-pair generation with a normalized brightness of 3.1*10^6 Hz nm^{-1} mW^{-2} in a 3.3 mm long LPLN waveguide, surpassing existing on-chip sources under similar operating configurations. Crucially, our LPLN waveguides offer enhanced fabrication reliability and reduced sensitivity to geometric variations and temperature fluctuations compared to PPLN devices. We expect LPLN to become a promising solution for on-chip nonlinear wavelength conversion and non-classical light generation, with immediate applications in quantum communication, networking, and on-chip photonic quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Necessary condition for information transfer under simulated parity-time-symmetric evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.13630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parity-time (PT) symmetric quantum theory can broaden the scope of quantum dynamics beyond unitary evolution which may lead to numerous counter-intuitive phenomena, including single-shot discrimination of non-orthogonal states, faster evolution of state than the standard quantum speed limit, and violation of no-signaling principle. On the other hand, PT-symmetric evolution can be realized as reduced dynamics of a subsystem in real experiments within the scope of standard quantum theory. In this experimental setup, if one side of a composite system is evolved according to a PT-symmetric way, a non-trivial information transfer can happen, i.e., the operation performed at one side can be gathered by the other side. By considering an arbitrary shared state between two parties situated in two distant locations and arbitrary measurements, we show that the PT-symmetric evolution of the reduced subsystem at one side is not sufficient for this information transfer to occur. Specifically, we prove that the information transfer can only happen when the density matrix and the corresponding measurements contain complex numbers. Moreover, we connect the entanglement content of the shared state with the efficacy of information transfer. We find evidence that the task becomes more efficient with the increase of dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.10764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the linearity of quantum operations, it is not straightforward to implement nonlinear transformations on a quantum computer, making some practical tasks like a neural network hard to be achieved. In this work, we define a task called nonlinear transformation of complex amplitudes and provide an algorithm to achieve this task. Specifically, we construct a block-encoding of complex amplitudes from a state preparation unitary. This allows us to transform the complex amplitudes by using quantum singular value transformation. We evaluate the required overhead in terms of input dimension and precision, which reveals that the algorithm depends on the roughly square root of input dimension and achieves an exponential speedup on precision compared with previous work. We also discuss its possible applications to quantum machine learning, where complex amplitudes encoding classical or quantum data are processed by the proposed method. This paper provides a promising way to introduce highly complex nonlinearity of the quantum states, which is essentially missing in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Addition and Differentiation of ZX-diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2202.11386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ZX-calculus is a powerful framework for reasoning in quantum computing. It provides in particular a compact representation of matrices of interests. A peculiar property of the ZX-calculus is the absence of a formal sum allowing the linear combinations of arbitrary ZX-diagrams. The universality of the formalism guarantees however that for any two ZX-diagrams, the sum of their interpretations can be represented by a ZX-diagram. We introduce a general, inductive definition of the addition of ZX-diagrams, relying on the construction of controlled diagrams. Based on this addition technique, we provide an inductive differentiation of ZX-diagrams.
  Indeed, given a ZX-diagram with variables in the description of its angles, one can differentiate the diagram according to one of these variables. Differentiation is ubiquitous in quantum mechanics and quantum computing (e.g. for solving optimization problems). Technically, differentiation of ZX-diagrams is strongly related to summation as witnessed by the product rules.
  We also introduce an alternative, non inductive, differentiation technique rather based on the isolation of the variables. Finally, we apply our results to deduce a diagram for an Ising Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced optical phase-insensitive heterodyne detection beyond 3-dB noise penalty of image band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical phase-insensitive heterodyne (beat-note) detection, which measures the relative phase of two beams at different frequencies through their interference, is a key sensing technology for various spatial/temporal measurements, such as frequency measurements in optical frequency combs. However, its sensitivity is limited not only by shot noise from the signal frequency band but also by the extra shot noise from an image band, known as the 3-dB noise penalty. Here, we propose a method to remove shot noise from all these bands using squeezed light. We also demonstrate beyond-3-dB noise reduction experimentally, confirming that our method actually reduces shot noise from both the signal and extra bands simultaneously. Our work should boost the sensitivity of various spatial/temporal measurements beyond the current limitations.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Stabilization of Fock States in an Oscillator against Multiphoton Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fock states with a well-defined number of photons in an oscillator have shown a wide range of applications in quantum information science. Nonetheless, their usefulness has been marred by single and multiple photon losses due to unavoidable environment-induced dissipation. Though several dissipation engineering methods have been developed to counteract the leading single-photon loss error, averting multiple photon losses remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a dissipation engineering method that autonomously stabilizes multi-photon Fock states against losses of multiple photons using a cascaded selective photon-addition operation in a superconducting quantum circuit. Through measuring the photon-number populations and Wigner tomography of the oscillator states, we observe a prolonged preservation of nonclassical Wigner negativities for the stabilized Fock states $\vert N\rangle$ with $N=1,2,3$ for a duration of about 10 ms. Furthermore, the dissipation engineering method demonstrated here also facilitates the implementation of a non-unitary operation for resetting a binomially-encoded logical qubit. These results highlight potential applications in error-correctable quantum information processing against multi-photon-loss errors.</description>

      <title>Topological quantum synchronization of fractionalized spins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gapped symmetric phase of the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model exhibits fractionalized spins at the ends of an open chain. We show that breaking SU(2) symmetry and applying a global spin-lowering dissipator achieves synchronization of these fractionalized spins. Additional local dissipators ensure convergence to the ground state manifold. In order to understand which aspects of this synchronization are robust within the entire Haldane-gap phase, we reduce the biquadratic term which eliminates the need for an external field but destabilizes synchronization. Within the ground state subspace, stability is regained using only the global lowering dissipator. These results demonstrate that fractionalized degrees of freedom can be synchronized in extended systems with a significant degree of robustness arising from topological protection. \rev{A direct consequence is that permutation symmetries are not required for the dynamics to be synchronized, representing a clear advantage of topological synchronization compared to synchronization induced by permutation symmetries.</description>

      <title>Quantum state preparation for bell-shaped probability distributions using deconvolution methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum systems are a natural choice for generating probability distributions due to the phenomena of quantum measurements. The data that we observe in nature from various physical phenomena can be modelled using quantum circuits. To load this data, which is mostly in the form of a probability distribution, we present a hybrid classical-quantum approach. The classical pre-processing step is based on the concept of deconvolution of discrete signals. We use the Jensen-Shannon distance as the cost function to quantify the closeness of the outcome from the classical step and the target distribution. The chosen cost function is symmetric and allows us to perform the deconvolution step using any appropriate optimization algorithm. The output from the deconvolution step is used to construct the quantum circuit required to load the given probability distribution, leading to an overall reduction in circuit depth. The deconvolution step splits a bell-shaped probability mass function into smaller probability mass functions, and this paves the way for parallel data processing in quantum hardware, which consists of a quantum adder circuit as the penultimate step before measurement. We tested the algorithm on IBM Quantum simulators and on the IBMQ Kolkata quantum computer, having a 27-qubit quantum processor. We validated the hybrid Classical-Quantum algorithm by loading two different distributions of bell shape. Specifically, we loaded 7 and 15-element PMF for (i) Standard Normal distribution and (ii) Laplace distribution.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the first minimal and complete equational theory for quantum circuits. Hence, we show that any true equation on quantum circuits can be derived from simple rules, all of them being standard except a novel but intuitive one which states that a multi-control $2\pi$ rotation is nothing but the identity. Our work improves on the recent complete equational theories for quantum circuits, by getting rid of several rules including a fairly impractical one. One of our main contributions is to prove the minimality of the equational theory, i.e. none of the rules can be derived from the other ones. More generally, we demonstrate that any complete equational theory on quantum circuits (when all gates are unitary) requires rules acting on an unbounded number of qubits. Finally, we also simplify the complete equational theories for quantum circuits with ancillary qubits and/or qubit discarding.</description>

Abstract: The rate and security of quantum communications between users placed at arbitrary points of a quantum communication network depend on the structure of the network, on its extension and on the nature of the communication channels. In this work we propose a strategy for the optimization of trusted-relays based networks that intertwines classical network approaches and quantum information theory. Specifically, by suitably defining a quantum communication efficiency functional, we identify the optimal quantum communication connections through the network by balancing security and the quantum communication rate. The optimized network is then constructed as the network of the maximal quantum communication efficiency connections and its performance is evaluated by studying the scaling of average properties as functions of the number of nodes and of the network spatial extension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum signal processing combined with quantum eigenvalue transformation has recently emerged as a unifying framework for several quantum algorithms. In its standard form, it consists of two separate routines: block encoding, which encodes a Hamiltonian in a larger unitary, and signal processing, which achieves an almost arbitrary polynomial transformation of such a Hamiltonian using rotation gates. The bottleneck of the entire operation is typically constituted by block encoding and, in recent years, several problem-specific techniques have been introduced to overcome this problem. Within this framework, we present a procedure to block-encode a Hamiltonian based on its matrix product operator (MPO) representation. More specifically, we encode every MPO tensor in a larger unitary of dimension $D+2$, where $D = \lceil\log(\chi)\rceil$ is the number of subsequently contracted qubits that scales logarithmically with the virtual bond dimension $\chi$. Given any system of size $L$, our method requires $L+D$ ancillary qubits in total, while the number of one- and two-qubit gates decomposing the block encoding circuit scales as $\mathcal{O}(L\cdot\chi^2)$.</description>

We remark that this postulate was proposed only recently to resolve the problem of intersubjectivity of information in RQM. In contrast to RQM for which OIT is a supporting theoretical statement, QBism is challenged by OIT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most promising applications of quantum computers is to simulate physical systems, leveraging their inherent quantum behavior to achieve an advantage over classical computation. In this work, we present a noise-tolerant Hamiltonian simulation algorithm for ground-state energy estimation. Our method surmounts stochastic sampling limitations to estimate expectation values. It is based on an adaptive sequence of fuzzy bisection searches to estimate the ground state energy digit by digit, with a trade-off between increasing the simulation time and decreasing the absolute error rate. It builds upon the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation of Unitary Matrices (QETU) algorithm, and it delivers good approximations in simulations with local, two-qubit gate depolarizing probability up to 1e-3, specifically for Hamiltonians that anti-commute with a Pauli string. To demonstrate the key results in this work, we ran simulations with different system Hamiltonians, system sizes, and time evolution encoding methods on classical computers using Qiskit. We compare the performance with other existing methods and show that we can consistently achieve two to three orders of magnitude improvement in the absolute error rate.</description>

Abstract: The state of the art of quantum circuits using the ripple-carry strategy for the addition and comparison of two n-bit numbers is presented, as well as optimizations in the Clifford+T gate set, both in terms of CNOT-depth and T-depth, or CNOT-count and T-count. In particular, considering the adders presented by Cuccaro et al. and Takahashi et al., circuits with a T-depth of 4n and a CNOT-depth of 8n are obtained, while without optimization of the original circuits, a T-depth of 6n is expected. In addition, a new adder with optimized CNOT-count and T-count is introduced. Note that we have focused here on quantum ripple-carry adders using at most one ancilla, without any approximation of the 3-qubit gates involved (Toffoli, Peres and TR) or any strategy involving a measurement.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Effect of Crosstalk Error on Circuit Fidelity Using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current advancements in technology have focused the attention of the quantum computing community toward exploring the potential of near-term devices whose computing power surpasses that of classical computers in practical applications. An unresolved central question revolves around whether the inherent noise in these devices can be overcome or whether any potential quantum advantage would be limited. There is no doubt that crosstalk is one of the main sources of noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems, and it poses a fundamental challenge to hardware designs. Crosstalk between parallel instructions can corrupt quantum states and cause incorrect program execution. In this study, we present a necessary analysis of the crosstalk error effect on NISQ devices. Our approach is extremely straightforward and practical to estimate the crosstalk error of various multi-qubit devices. In particular, we combine the randomized benchmarking (RB) and simultaneous randomized benchmarking (SRB) protocol to estimate the crosstalk error from the correlation controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. We demonstrate this protocol experimentally on 5-, 7-, \&amp; 16-qubit devices. Our results demonstrate the crosstalk error model of three different IBM quantum devices over the experimental week and compare the error variation against the machine, number of qubits, quantum volume, processor, and topology. We then confirm the improvement in the circuit fidelity on different benchmarks by up to 3.06x via inserting an instruction barrier, as compared with an IBM quantum noisy device which offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice. Finally, we discuss the current system limitation, its tradeoff on fidelity and depth, noise beyond the NISQ system, and mitigation opportunities to ensure that the quantum operation can perform its quantum magic undisturbed.</description>

      <title>Novel Long Distance Free Space Quantum Secure Direct Communication for Web 3.0 Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09108v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the advent of Web 3.0, the swift advancement of technology confronts an imminent threat from quantum computing. Security protocols safeguarding the integrity of Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 are growing more susceptible to both quantum attacks and sophisticated classical threats. The article introduces our novel long-distance free-space quantum secure direct communication (LF QSDC) as a method to safeguard against security breaches in both quantum and classical contexts. Differing from techniques like quantum key distribution (QKD), LF QSDC surpasses constraints by facilitating encrypted data transmission sans key exchanges, thus diminishing the inherent weaknesses of key-based systems. The distinctiveness of this attribute, coupled with its quantum mechanics base, protects against quantum computer assaults and advanced non-quantum dangers, harmonizing seamlessly with the untrustworthy tenets of the Web 3.0 age. The focus of our study is the technical design and incorporation of LF QSDC into web 3.0 network infrastructures, highlighting its efficacy for extended-range communication. LF QSDC is based on the memory DL04 protocol and enhanced with our novel Quantum-Aware Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC), Pointing, Acquisition, and Tracking (PAT) technologies, and Atmospheric Quantum Correction Algorithm (AQCA). Utilizing this method not only bolsters the security of worldwide Web 3.0 networks but also guarantees their endurance in a time when quantum and sophisticated classical threats exist simultaneously. Consequently, LF QSDC stands out as a robust security solution, well-suited for Web 3.0 systems amidst the constantly evolving digital environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Discovery for Fault-Tolerant Logical State Preparation with Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of large-scale quantum computers requires not only quantum error correction (QEC) but also fault-tolerant operations to handle errors that propagate into harmful errors. Recently, flag-based protocols have been introduced that use ancillary qubits to flag harmful errors. However, there is no clear recipe for finding a fault-tolerant quantum circuit with flag-based protocols, especially when we consider hardware constraints, such as qubit connectivity and available gate set. In this work, we propose and explore reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically discover compact and hardware-adapted fault-tolerant quantum circuits. We show that in the task of fault-tolerant logical state preparation, RL discovers circuits with fewer gates and ancillary qubits than published results without and with hardware constraints of up to 15 physical qubits. Furthermore, RL allows for straightforward exploration of different qubit connectivities and the use of transfer learning to accelerate the discovery. More generally, our work opens the door towards the use of RL for the discovery of fault-tolerant quantum circuits for addressing tasks beyond state preparation, including magic state preparation, logical gate synthesis, or syndrome measurement.</description>

      <title>Finite frequentism explains quantum probability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12954v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that frequentism, as an explanation of probability in classical statistical mechanics, can be extended in a natural way to a decoherent quantum history space, the analogue of a classical phase space. The result is a form of finite frequentism, in which the Gibbs concept of an infinite ensemble of gases is replaced by the quantum state expressed as a superposition of a finite number of decohering microstates. It is a form of finite and actual (as opposed to hypothetical) frequentism insofar as all the microstates exist, even though they may differ macroscopically, in keeping with the decoherence-based Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Unitary Synthesis of Clifford+T Circuits with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14865v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning approach for synthesizing unitaries into quantum circuits. Unitary synthesis aims to identify a quantum circuit that represents a given unitary while minimizing circuit depth, total gate count, a specific gate count, or a combination of these factors. While past research has focused predominantly on continuous gate sets, synthesizing unitaries from the parameter-free Clifford+T gate set remains a challenge. Although the time complexity of this task will inevitably remain exponential in the number of qubits for general unitaries, reducing the runtime for simple problem instances still poses a significant challenge. In this study, we apply the tree-search method Gumbel AlphaZero to solve the problem for a subset of exactly synthesizable Clifford+T unitaries. Our approach can synthesize unitaries for up to five qubits generated from the set of randomized quantum circuits with up to 60 gates. Furthermore, our inference times are around 30 seconds on a single GPU on average, surpassing state-of-the-art algorithms QuantumCircuitOpt and MIN-T-SYNTH for higher qubit numbers. Our work provides a competitive baseline for synthesis algorithms to be developed in the upcoming years.</description>

      <title>A SAT Scalpel for Lattice Surgery: Representation and Synthesis of Subroutines for Surface-Code Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is necessary for large-scale quantum computing. A promising quantum error correcting code is the surface code. For this code, fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) can be performed via lattice surgery, i.e., splitting and merging patches of code. Given the frequent use of certain lattice-surgery subroutines (LaS), it becomes crucial to optimize their design in order to minimize the overall spacetime volume of FTQC. In this study, we define the variables to represent LaS and the constraints on these variables. Leveraging this formulation, we develop a synthesizer for LaS, LaSsynth, that encodes a LaS construction problem into a SAT instance, subsequently querying SAT solvers for a solution. Starting from a baseline design, we can gradually invoke the solver with shrinking spacetime volume to derive more compact designs. Due to our foundational formulation and the use of SAT solvers, LaSsynth can exhaustively explore the design space, yielding optimal designs in volume. For example, it achieves 8% and 18% volume reduction respectively over two states-of-the-art human designs for the 15-to-1 T-factory, a bottleneck in FTQC.</description>

      <title>Driven Multiphoton Qubit-Resonator Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general theory for multiphoton qubit-resonator interactions enhanced by a qubit drive. The interactions generate qubit-conditional operations in the resonator when the driving is near $n$-photon cross-resonance, namely, the qubit drive is $n$-times the resonator frequency. We pay special attention to the strong driving regime, where the interactions are conditioned on the qubit dressed states. We consider the specific case where $n=2$, which results in qubit-conditional squeezing (QCS). We propose to use the QCS protocol for amplifying resonator displacements and their superpositions. We find the QCS protocol to generate a superposition of orthogonally squeezed states following a properly chosen qubit measurement. We outline quantum information processing applications for these states, including encoding a qubit in a resonator and performing a quantum non-demolition measurement of the qubit inferred from the resonator's second statistical moment. Next, we employ a two-tone drive to engineer an effective $n$-photon Rabi Hamiltonian in any desired coupling regime. In other words, the effective coupling strengths can be tuned over a wide range, thus allowing for the realization of new regimes that have so far been inaccessible. Finally, we propose a multiphoton circuit QED implementation based on a transmon qubit coupled to a resonator via an asymmetric SQUID. We provide realistic parameter estimates for the two-photon operation regime that can host the aforementioned two-photon protocols. We use numerical simulations to show that even in the presence of spurious terms and decoherence, our analytical predictions are robust.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact Synthesis of Multiqutrit Clifford-Cyclotomic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the unitary matrices that can be exactly represented by a multiqubit circuit over the Toffoli+Hadamard, Clifford+$T$, or, more generally, Clifford-cyclotomic gate set are precisely the unitary matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/2,\zeta_k]$, where $k$ is a positive integer that depends on the gate set and $\zeta_k$ is a primitive $2^k$-th root of unity. In this paper, we establish the analogous correspondence for qutrits. We define the multiqutrit Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ by extending the classical qutrit gates $X$, $CX$, and Toffoli with the Hadamard gate $H$ and the single-qutrit gate $T_k=\mathrm{diag}(1,\omega_k, \omega_k^2)$, where $\omega_k$ is a primitive $3^k$-th root of unity. This gate set is equivalent to the qutrit Toffoli+Hadamard gate set when $k=1$, and to the qutrit Clifford+$T_k$ gate set when $k&gt;1$. We then prove that a $3^n\times 3^n$ unitary matrix $U$ can be represented by an $n$-qutrit circuit over the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set of order $3^k$ if and only if the entries of $U$ lie in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[1/3,\omega_k]$.</description>

Abstract: This article comprehensively explores matrices and their prerequisites for achieving positive semidefiniteness. The study delves into a series of theorems concerning pure quantum states in the context of weighted graphs. The main objective of this study is to establish a graph-theoretic framework for the study of quantum discord and to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions for zero quantum discord states using unitary operators.

      <description>arXiv:2306.11402v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a massive fermionic quantum field localized on a plane in external constant and homogeneous electric and magnetic fields. The magnetic field is perpendicular to the plane and the electric field is parallel. The complete set of solutions to the Dirac equation is presented. As important physical characteristics of the vacuum state, the fermion condensate and the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor are investigated. The renormalization is performed using the Hurwitz function. The results are compared with those previously studied in the case of zero electric field. We discuss the behavior of the vacuum expectation values in different regions for the values of the problem parameters. Applications of the results include the electronic subsystem of graphene sheet described by the Dirac model in the long-wavelength approximation.</description>

      <title>Superfluid weight in the isolated band limit within the generalized random phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superfluid weight of a generic lattice model with attractive Hubbard interaction is computed analytically in the isolated band limit within the generalized random phase approximation. Time-reversal symmetry, spin rotational symmetry, and the uniform pairing condition are assumed. It is found that the relation obtained in [https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.106.014518] between the superfluid weight in the flat band limit and the so-called minimal quantum metric is valid even at the level of the generalized random phase approximation. For an isolated, but not necessarily flat, band it is found that the correction to the superfluid weight obtained from the generalized random phase approximation $D_{\rm s}^{(1)} = D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$ is also the sum of a conventional contribution $D_{\rm s,c}^{(1)}$ and a geometric contribution $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}$, as in the case of the known mean-field result $D_{\rm s}^{(0)}=D_{\rm s,c}^{(0)}+D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$, in which the geometric term $D_{\rm s,g}^{(0)}$ is a weighted average of the quantum metric. The conventional contribution is geometry independent, that is independent of the orbital positions, while it is possible to find a preferred, or natural, set of orbital positions such that $D_{\rm s,g}^{(1)}=0$. Useful analytic expressions are derived for both the natural orbital positions and the minimal quantum metric, including its extension to bands that are not necessarily flat. Finally, using some simple examples, it is argued that the natural orbital positions may lead to a more refined classification of the topological properties of the band structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research study is primarily focus on investigating how the topological effects influence the eigenvalue solutions in the presence of a hot-dense medium. To accomplish this, we employ the non-relativistic Schr\"odinger wave equation, taking into consideration both the quantum flux field and an interaction potential. Through this approach, we determine the energy eigenvalues and their corresponding wave functions using the Nikiforov-Uvarov method. Our findings indicate that when we consider both the topological effects and the magnetic flux, $\Phi$, there is a noticeable reduction in the binding energy within the hot-dense medium. Additionally, we analyze the role of the baryonic potential in shaping the binding energy within the $(T, u_b)$ plane. Interestingly, it is evident that the influence of the baryonic potential becomes more pronounced as its values decrease</description>

      <title>Ab initio simulation of single vibronic level fluorescence spectra of anthracene using Hagedorn wavepackets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence spectroscopy contributes to the understanding of molecular vibrational structures and relaxation processes. Here, we present a practical method for computing SVL fluorescence spectra of polyatomic molecules from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. This method, which combines a time-dependent approach using Hagedorn wavepackets with accurate evaluation of electronic structure, captures both mode distortion and Duschinsky rotation. We apply the method to compute SVL spectra of anthracene by performing wavepacket dynamics on a 66- dimensional harmonic potential energy surface constructed from density functional theory calculations. With the Hagedorn approach, we not only reproduce the previously reported simulation results for singly excited $12^{1}$ and $\overline{11}^{1}$ levels, but also are able to compute SVL spectra from multiply excited levels in good agreement with experiments. All spectra were obtained from the same wavepacket trajectory without any additional propagation beyond what is required for ground-state emission spectra.</description>

      <title>Dual Symmetry Classification of Non-Hermitian Systems and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Point-Gap Topology of a Non-Unitary Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04147v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit richer topological properties compared to their Hermitian counterparts. It is well known that non-Hermitian systems have been classified based on either the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or the symmetry relations for non-unitary time-evolution operators in the context of Floquet topological phases. In this work, we propose that non-Hermitian systems can always be classified in two ways; a non-Hermitian system can be classified using the symmetry relations for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians or time-evolution operator regardless of the Floquet topological phases or not. We refer to this as dual symmetry classification. To demonstrate this, we successfully introduce a new non-unitary quantum walk that exhibits point gaps with a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topological phase applying the dual symmetry classification and treating the time-evolution operator of this quantum walk as the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian.</description>
