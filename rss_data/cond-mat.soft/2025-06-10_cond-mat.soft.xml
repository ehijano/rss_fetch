      <title>Rheological Origin of Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most materials of practical applications age, and their properties change with time. The aging of materials is reflected in their mechanical responses to external stress and strain, which exhibit ubiquity in the form of logarithms and power laws, respectively. Such responses are usually described using complicated phenomenological models, including fractional viscoelastic models, but they lack physical insights. In this Letter, we postulate a linear time-varying rheological property whose constitutive relations are motivated from thermodynamic principles and experimental observations of the stick-slip-induced friction. The property satisfyingly explains the logarithmic relaxation and the three stages of universal creep behavior. Consequently, the fractional Maxwell model and the Mittag-Leffler function gain physical interpretation. Lastly, we show that viscosity emerges as a special case of the proposed property.</description>

      <title>A high -quality and -throughput colloidal lithography by mechanical assembly and ice-based transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal lithography has emerged as a promising alternative to conventional nanofabrication techniques, offering the ability to create nanoscale patterns in a cost-effective and scalable manner. However, it has been so far limited by defects such as empty areas or multilayered regions, hindering its application. We introduce a novel "ice-assisted transfer" technique that combines rubbing-based particle assembly on elastomer substrates with ice-mediated transfer to achieve defect-free, high-quality polycrystalline particle monolayers. This approach eliminates foreign material contamination and enables precise control of particle arrangement and density. By optimizing process parameters, including surfactant concentration and water film thickness, we minimized defects and demonstrated the versatility of this method in fabricating functional nanoscale structures. We highlighted the benefits of this process through two applications: (1) antireflective "moth-eye" coatings, which achieved near-zero reflection in the mid-infrared spectrum due to improved particle monolayer quality; and (2) nanostructured surfaces for ligand-free T-cell activation, whose topography enhanced cell activation, showcasing potential for immunotherapy applications. The process achieves rapid, cost-efficient patterning without requiring specialized equipment, making it suitable for diverse fields requiring scalable nanostructuring. This work represents a significant advancement in colloidal lithography, addressing critical challenges and unlocking its potential for practical applications in optics, biotechnology, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Shear Stress Growth During Relaxation of a Soft Glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show experimentally that multiple soft glassy fluids are capable of storing directional rheological signatures from past shear history, evidenced during stress growth and overall nonmonotonic stress relaxation after small steps in strain. We illustrate theoretically that these responses can be reproduced without requiring thixotropy or shear-banding, which are typically implicated in time-dependent rheological complexities, but by using a simple elastoplastic rheological model with power-law yielding (EP-PLY) that incorporates a distribution of local strain states. Using insight from the model, we suggest a mechanism for the experimentally observed stress increase to be driven by residual anisotropy in strain states that are relaxed at different rates. We demonstrate that these effects persist even after material is stressed beyond the yield stress, indicating that past deformation may have more influence than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Alignment and anisotropy of stresses in disordered granular media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the degeneracy of local stress states is a central challenge in obtaining the complete statistical mechanics of disordered media. Here, we introduce a minimal force-balance model for isolated granular clusters to probe the structure of the stress space through principal stress orientation and stress anisotropy. We further show that when complemented by physically motivated pairwise constraints, the model produces predictions for the stress alignment in packings of repulsive hard spheres. We compare these predictions against simulation data for grains in hopper and simple shear flows, finding quantitative agreement. This demonstrates the promise of modeling bulk athermal disordered systems through the combinatorics of few primitive geometric motifs.</description>

      <title>Acoustic-Driven Surface Cleaning with Millimeter-Sized Bubbles at Translational Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional surface cleaning methods often suffer from drawbacks such as chemical harshness, potential for surface damage, and high energy consumption. This study investigates an alternative approach: acoustic-driven surface cleaning using millimeter-sized bubbles excited at low, sub-cavitation frequencies. We identify and characterize a distinct translational resonance of these bubbles, occurring at significantly lower frequencies (e.g., 50 Hz for 1.3 mm diameter bubbles) than the Minnaert resonance for a bubble of the same size. Experiments reveal that at this translational resonance, stationary bubbles exhibit amplified lateral swaying, while bubbles sliding on an inclined surface display pronounced "stop-and-go" dynamics. The theoretical model treats the bubble as a forced, damped harmonic oscillator, where surface tension provides the restoring force and the inertia is dominated by the hydrodynamic added mass of the surrounding fluid. It accurately predicts the observed resonant frequency scaling with bubble size ($\propto R_0^{-3/2}$). Cleaning efficacy, assessed using protein-based artificial soil on glass slides, was improved by approximately 90\% when bubbles were driven at their translational resonant frequency compared to off-resonant frequencies or non-acoustic conditions. These findings demonstrate that leveraging translational resonance enhances bubble-induced shear and agitation, offering an effective and sustainable mechanism for surface cleaning.</description>

      <title>Colloid-like scale-free cluster-cluster aggregation during polymer collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extended polymer collapses to form a globule when subjected to a quench below the collapse transition temperature. The process begins with the formation of clusters of monomers or ``pearls''. The nascent clusters merge, resulting in growth of the average cluster size $C_s$, eventually leading to a single globule. The aggregation of the clusters are known to be analogous to droplet coalescence. This suggests a striking resemblance between such an aggregation and cluster-cluster aggregation in colloidal self-assembly, which is characterized by a universal dynamic scaling behavior. Motivated by that, here, we verify the presence of such dynamic scaling during the collapse of a polymer with varying bending stiffness $\kappa$, using molecular dynamic simulations. We probe the dynamics via time evolution of the size distribution of clusters $N_s(t)$ and growth of $C_s(t)$. Irrespective of $\kappa$, we observe the power-law scalings $C_s(t)\sim t^z$ and $N_s(t)\sim t^{-w} s^{-\tau}$, of which only the cluster growth is universal with $z\approx 1.65$. Importantly, our results indeed show that $N_s(t)$ exhibits a dynamic scaling of the form $N_s(t)\sim s^{-2}f(s/t^z)$, indicative of a scale-free cluster growth. Interestingly, for flexible and weakly stiff polymers the dynamic exponents obey the relation $w=2z$, as also found in diffusion-controlled cluster-cluster aggregation of particles. For $\kappa \ge 5$, the exponents show deviation from this relation, which grows continuously with $\kappa$. We identify the differences in local structures of the clusters formed, leading to variations in cluster-size dependence of the effective diffusion constant to be the origin of the above deviation. We also discuss potential experimental strategies to directly visualize the observed dynamic scaling in a collapsing polymer.</description>

      <title>Crossover between Solid-like and Liquid-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In supercooled liquids, at a temperature between the glass transition temperature Tg and the melting point Tm, thermodynamic properties remain continuous, while dynamic behavior exhibits anomalies. The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified understanding of polymer cononsolvency: insights from the Flory-Huggins-Potts framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In polymer solutions, the phenomenon of cononsolvency describes when mixing two good solvents creates poor-solvent conditions for the polymer over some specific composition range. Observations of cononsolvency typically relate to either phase separation at the macroscopic level or chain collapse at the microscopic level. Despite its technological and biophysical relevance, the connection between the macroscopic and microscopic observations of cononsolvency and how these differ by mechanism remains unclear. In this work, we distinguish between different mechanisms of cononsolvency using various models and observations derived from a single theoretical framework for polymer solutions. We first use mean-field analysis to identify energetic regimes, which are defined by sets of effective $\chi$ parameters, where changes in solvent/cosolvent composition induce phase separation. Next, to make a connection to the microscopic physics, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations of models with interactions that align with these effective $\chi$ parameters from these different regimes and observe corresponding composition-induced coil-globule transitions. These transitions are elucidated with signatures associated with specific mechanisms of cononsolvency from the literature. Interestingly, systems with identical effective $\chi$ parameters can display different mechanisms at the microscopic level. Ultimately, these results provide new insights into cononsolvency that may help to distinguish amongst mechanisms or inform strategies to control polymer solution behavior.</description>

      <title>Elastic turbulence in highly entangled polymers and wormlike micelles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show theoretically that an initially homogeneous planar Couette flow of a concentrated polymeric fluid is linearly unstable to the growth of two-dimensional (2D) perturbations, within two widely used constitutive models: the Johnson-Segalman model and the Rolie-Poly model. We perform direct nonlinear simulations of both models in 2D to show that this instability leads to a state of elastic turbulence comprising several narrow shear bands that dynamically coalesce, split and interact. Importantly, we show that this 2D instability arises not only in fluids that have a non-monotonic constitutive curve, and therefore show shear banding in 1D calculations, but also in shear thinning fluids with a monotonic constitutive curve, for which an initially homogeneous base state is stable in 1D. For the former category, the high shear branch of the constitutive curve is unstable to 2D instability in both models, so that the high shear band may be turbulent. In the Rolie-Poly model, the low shear branch is also likewise unstable. Our work provides the first simulation evidence for elastic turbulence in highly entangled polymeric fluids. It also potentially explains rheo-chaotic states seen experimentally in shear banding wormlike micelles. We additionally demonstrate elastic turbulence within both models in the planar Poiseuille geometry.</description>

      <title>Dumbbell dimer dynamics in three-dimensional chiral fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergent orientational dynamics of a dumbbell dimer -- two asymmetric monomers connected by a linking spring -- in a three-dimensional chiral environment with odd viscosity. In classical systems with conserved parity symmetry, reciprocal oscillations of a dimer does not lead to rotational motion. Here, through an analytical calculation, we find that the presence of chirality in the system induces rotational dynamics as function of the expansion/contraction of the dimer. By incorporating thermal fluctuations, we further find that the rotational diffusivity is affected by the coupling between conformational fluctuations and rotational motion. Our results provide insights into problems where the parity symmetry is broken and can be used as a building block to study similar models at the collective level. These problems include multi-component molecular machines in odd-viscous fluids and systems with charged polymers where oddity is present through external magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Physics of unraveling and micromechanics of hagfish threads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hagfish slime is a unique biological material composed of mucus and protein threads that rapidly deploy into a cohesive network when deployed in seawater. The forces involved in thread deployment and interactions among mucus and threads are key to understanding how hagfish slime rapidly assembles into a cohesive, functional network. Despite extensive interest in its biophysical properties, the mechanical forces governing thread deployment and interaction remain poorly quantified. Here, we present the first direct in situ measurements of the micromechanical forces involved in hagfish slime formation, including mucus mechanical properties, skein peeling force, thread-mucus adhesion, and thread-thread cohesion. Using a custom glass-rod force sensing system, we show that thread deployment initiates when peeling forces exceed a threshold of approximately 6.8 nN. To understand the flow strength required for unraveling, we used a rheo-optic setup to impose controlled shear flow, enabling us to directly observe unraveling dynamics and determine the critical shear rate for unraveling of the skeins, which we then interpreted using an updated peeling-based force balance model. Our results reveal that thread-mucus adhesion dominates over thread-thread adhesion and that deployed threads contribute minimally to bulk shear rheology at constant flow rate. These findings clarify the physics underlying the rapid, flow-triggered assembly of hagfish slime and inform future designs of synthetic deployable fiber-gel systems.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. While we also observe our predicted instability in discrete-time simulations for small system sizes, discrete-time simulations of large systems show stability in the discrepant region even for long simulation times. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.</description>

      <title>Interface Fragmentation via Horizontal Vibration: A Pathway to Scalable Monodisperse Emulsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable method for producing monodisperse microscale emulsions in a container holding two stably stratified layers of immiscible liquids by applying horizontal vibration. Our experiments and theoretical modelling show that the critical non-dimensional acceleration for regular droplet formation is governed by a shear-dominated breakup mechanism, which scales as $N^{-1/2} \omega^{*3/2}$, where $N$ is the viscosity ratio and $\omega^{*}$ is the frequency of forcing on the viscous-capillary scale. The droplet diameter can be easily controlled by varying the forcing parameters, thus demonstrating this vibrational configuration as a scalable alternative to microfluidics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of domains via phase transitions is ubiquitous across physical systems from metallic alloys to biomolecular condensates in cells. We show that when the boundaries between such domains are forced to move, for example by external electrical fields or concentration gradients, this motion internally generates dipole force fields. This translation-induced polarization leads to emergent dipole-dipole interactions that drive directed coalescence of domains, even in the absence of Brownian motion. We then ask how the stochastic motion of individual condensates is driven by active and passive stresses in viscoelastic media such as the cell cytoplasm. Our analysis reveals that active stirring can suppress or enhance the size dependence of diffusion. Together, these findings shed new light on the dynamics of condensates in viscoelastic media and conserved order parameters in general.</description>

      <title>A Neuronal Model at the Edge of Criticality: An Ising-Inspired Approach to Brain Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neuronal network model inspired by the Ising model, where each neuron is a binary spin ($s_i = \pm1$) interacting with its neighbors on a 2D lattice. Updates are asynchronous and follow Metropolis dynamics, with a temperature-like parameter $T$ introducing stochasticity.
  To incorporate physiological realism, each neuron includes fixed on/off durations, mimicking the refractory period found in real neurons. These counters prevent immediate reactivation, adding biologically grounded timing constraints to the model.
  As $T$ varies, the network transitions from asynchronous to synchronised activity. Near a critical point $T_c$, we observe hallmarks of criticality: heightened fluctuations, long-range correlations, and increased sensitivity. These features resemble patterns found in cortical recordings, supporting the hypothesis that the brain operates near criticality for optimal information processing.
  This simplified model demonstrates how basic spin interactions and physiological constraints can yield complex, emergent behavior, offering a useful tool for studying criticality in neural systems through statistical physics.</description>

      <title>Recoil of a driven tracer in a correlated medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stochastic dynamics of a Brownian particle after it is suddenly released from a harmonic trap moving with constant velocity through a fluctuating correlated medium, described by a scalar Gaussian field with relaxational dynamics and in contact with a thermal bath. We show that, after the release, the particle exhibits recoil, i.e., it moves in the direction opposite to the drag. As expected, this effect vanishes if the field equilibrates instantaneously. The final value of the average position of the particle is reached algebraically in time in the case of conserved dynamics of the field or for non-conserved dynamics at the critical point. Our predictions are expected to be relevant, at least qualitatively, to driven colloidal particles in liquid media close to critical points.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cellular nematic order is a conserved feature of gastrulation in animal embryos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cells undergo dramatic morphological changes during embryogenesis, yet how these changes affect the formation of ordered tissues remains elusive. Here, we show that a phase transition leading to the formation of a nematic liquid crystal state during gastrulation in the development of embryos of fish, frogs, and fruit flies occurs by a common mechanism despite substantial differences between these evolutionarily distant animals. Importantly, nematic order forms early before any discernible changes in the shapes of cells. All three species exhibit similar propagation of the nematic phase, reminiscent of nucleation and growth mechanisms. The spatial correlations in the nematic phase in the notochord region are long-ranged and follow a similar power-law decay (y~$x^{-\alpha}$ ) with $\alpha$ less than unity, indicating a common underlying physical mechanism. To explain the common physical mechanism, we created a theoretical model that not only explains the experimental observations but also predicts that the nematic phase should be disrupted upon loss of planar cell polarity (frog), cell adhesion (frog), and notochord boundary formation (zebrafish). Gene knockdown or mutational studies confirm the theoretical predictions. The combination of experiments and theory provides a unified framework for understanding the potentially universal features of metazoan embryogenesis, in the process shedding light on the advent of ordered structures during animal development.</description>

      <title>Arrested development and traveling waves of active suspensions in nematic liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. An anchoring strength linking the active and passive media tunes the system between active suspension theory in Newtonian fluids in one limit, and active nematic theory in another. For extensile active stresses, beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration, the suspension first comes into alignment, then buckles via a classical bend instability. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, the development is arrested into a steady, flowing state by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber appear at yet larger extensile activity, and a phase transition is identified at finite anchoring strength. If the active particles are motile, the particles can surf along the bent environment of their own creation. More exotic states are also observed, including a oscillatory 'thrashing' mode. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the first arrested state.</description>

      <title>Designed self-assembly of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23784v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To unlock the potential for assembling complex colloidal "molecules", we investigate a minimal binary system of programmable colloidal atom-electron equivalents (PAE-EE), where electron equivalents (EEs) are multivalent linkers with two distinct types of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) ends complementary to those ssDNAs on binary programmable atom equivalents (PAEs). We derive a statistical mechanical framework for calculating the effective interaction between PAEs mediated by EEs with arbitrary valency, which quantitatively agrees with simulations that explicitly include EEs. Our analysis reveals an anomalous dependence of PAE-PAE interactions on the EE valency, showing that EE-mediated interactions converge at the large valency limit. Moreover, we identify an optimal EE valency that maximizes the interaction difference between targeted and non-targeted binding pairs of PAEs. These findings offer design principles for targeted self-assembly in PAE-EE systems.</description>

      <title>Elastic displacements and viscous flows in wedge-shaped geometries with a straight edge: Green's functions for perpendicular forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edges are abundant when elastic solids glide in guiding rails or fluids are contained in vessels. We here address induced displacements in elastic solids or small-scale flows in viscous fluids in the vicinity of one such edge. For this purpose, we solve the governing elasticity equations for linearly elastic, potentially compressible solids, as well as the low-Reynolds-number flow equations for incompressible fluids. Technically speaking, we derive the associated Green's functions under confinement by two planar boundaries that meet at a straight edge. The two boundaries both feature no-slip or free-slip conditions, or one of these two conditions per boundary. Previously, we solved the simpler case of the force being oriented parallel to the straight edge. Here, we complement this solution by the more challenging case of the force pointing into a direction perpendicular to the edge. Together, these two cases provide the general solution. Specific situations in which our analysis may find application in terms of quantitative theoretical descriptions are particle motion in confined colloidal suspensions, dynamics of active microswimmers near edges, or actuated distortions of elastic materials due to activated contained functionalized particles.</description>

      <title>Osmolyte-Modulated Differential Capacitance and Disjoining Pressure for Nanoconfined Electrolytes: A Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study employs modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory to systematically investigate the influence of zwitterionic osmolyte additives to an electrolyte solution on disjoining pressure and electric differential capacitance within charged slit-like nanopores with conductive walls. We demonstrate that increasing concentrations of zwitterionic osmolytes synergistically enhance both disjoining pressure and differential capacitance, highlighting their dual role in the potential improvement of supercapacitor performance. The insights gained underscore the unique capabilities of zwitterionic osmolytes as multifunctional additives for fine-tuning the properties of electric double layers, thereby bridging the gap between capacitive efficiency and microporous electrode longevity.</description>
