      <title>Emergence of Finite-Time Singularities from Accelerated Event Recurrence: Insights into the Mechanism of Catastrophic Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a discrete-event modeling framework that captures the progression of geophysical systems toward catastrophic failure through sequences of distinct damage events. By representing system evolution as a succession of temporally accelerating and amplitude-varying events, the framework reveals how finite-time singularities, both logarithmic and power law types, naturally emerge from the interplay between shrinking interevent intervals and growing event magnitudes. This event-based perspective provides an intuitive physical understanding of rupture processes, highlighting how precursory signals such as accelerating strain rate, event frequency, and energy release can be traced back to simple underlying mechanisms. A mean-field formulation further links the observed power law exponents to the evolving stiffness of the system under constant or time-varying stress. Incorporating stochastic fluctuations, the model captures the inherent randomness of natural systems leading to the emergence of stochastic finite-time singular behavior. Altogether, this unified approach offers a simple conceptual and quantitative tool for interpreting the lead-up to failure in a wide range of geophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Physics-constrained generative machine learning-based high-resolution downscaling of Greenland's surface mass balance and surface temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, high-resolution projections of the Greenland ice sheet's surface mass balance (SMB) and surface temperature are essential for understanding future sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally demanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel physics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model (CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor of up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM is trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and conditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard conservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of SMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust generalization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set, our constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE for the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming interpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial scales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System Model as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to directly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution climate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be readily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve projections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and potentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.</description>

      <title>Can a convecting magma ocean offer a solution to the puzzling case of core convection in early earth?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convective flow in Earth's iron-rich liquid core drives self-sustained dynamo action, generating Earth's magnetic field, which is strongest among all terrestrial planets of the solar system. Rock records show that this magnetic field has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y). However, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core of less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a puzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth and the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core dynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the mantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little attention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO above a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner core days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of several dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh number, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient ratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can easily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately linear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square velocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\Nu_o-1)$, where $\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\Nu_o$ of order 1 to 10 considered. Radial and azimuthal components of the core flow are of similar magnitude, so that, with comparable toroidal and poloidal components, we speculate that the MO-driven core flow could drive an early dynamo.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Pattern Quality on Measurements of Stress Heterogeneity and Geometrically Necessary Dislocation Density by High-Angular Resolution Electron Backscatter Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effect of pattern quality on the output of high-angular resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) analyses. Band contrast, as a proxy for pattern quality, was varied by adjusting the number of frames averaged per electron backscatter pattern during data collection. The same region in a deformed sample of the mineral olivine was mapped six times varying the number of frames averaged between 1 and 30 between each map. Each data set was analyzed with HR-EBSD, producing maps of intragranular stress heterogeneity and geometrically necessary dislocation (GND) density. As the number of frames averaged increased, the noise in stress and GND calculations decreased, revealing more substructure in the mapped region. The worst pixels, with low band contrast, are the most improved by increased frame averaging, whereas those with high band contrast are largely unaffected. Additionally, the probability distribution of stresses narrows as high-stress noise is reduced with increased pattern quality, which also affects estimates of dislocation density from statistical analysis of the stress distributions. As regions with high stress and/or high GND density are typically of interest in HR-EBSD maps and are often associated with low band contrast, frame averaging may be used as a tool to improve the quality of these analyses. Most importantly, however, is that comparisons are made between HR-EBSD datasets with similar mean band contrast to ensure that observed differences are microstructural in origin and not an artefact of data collection.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Historical Climate Fields With Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Historical records of climate fields are often sparse due to missing measurements, especially before the introduction of large-scale satellite missions. Several statistical and model-based methods have been introduced to fill gaps and reconstruct historical records. Here, we employ a recently introduced deep-learning approach based on Fourier convolutions, trained on numerical climate model output, to reconstruct historical climate fields. Using this approach we are able to realistically reconstruct large and irregular areas of missing data, as well as reconstruct known historical events such as strong El Ni\~no and La Ni\~na with very little given information. Our method outperforms the widely used statistical kriging method as well as other recent machine learning approaches. The model generalizes to higher resolutions than the ones it was trained on and can be used on a variety of climate fields. Moreover, it allows inpainting of masks never seen before during the model training.</description>
