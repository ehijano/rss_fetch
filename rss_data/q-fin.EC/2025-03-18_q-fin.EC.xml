      <title>Public Sector Efficiency in Delivering Social Services and Its Impact on Human Development: A Comparative Study of Healthcare and Education Spending in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research investigates the effects of public spending on health and education in shaping the human development in south Asian three countries: India, Pakistan and Bangladesh. The study uses the VAR (Vector Auto regression) model to estimate the effects on government spending on these sectors to evaluate the human development. The findings state that there are different degrees of impact in these three countries. In Bangladesh and India, health spending increases the human development in short term. On the other hand education spending shows the significance on the HDI.Moreover, the study also highlights that there are different levels of effectiveness of government spending across these three countries. In order to maximize the human development an optimum country specific strategies should be adopted.</description>

      <title>Financial Adviser Misconduct and Labor Market Penalties: Uncovering Racial Disparities in the Absence of Gender Gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a comprehensive matched employer-employee dataset for U.S. financial advisers from 2008 to 2018, we revisit established evidence on labor market penalties following financial misconduct. Prior studies report that female advisers are 20% more likely to exit their firms following misconduct and that similar disparities exist for non-white advisers. However, by disaggregating misconduct into distinct disclosure events - differentiating those that nearly always trigger job terminations from those that do not - we show that the apparent gender gap vanishes, while significant racial disparities persist. Specifically, non-white advisers face approximately 24% higher job separation rates than their white counterparts. Robustness checks confirm these findings across alternative specifications, suggesting that race-based differential treatment in the labor market is a distinct phenomenon warranting further investigation.</description>

      <title>Investing in nature: Stakeholder's willingness to pay for Tunisian forest services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the economic value of Aleppo pine forests, a unique and threatened ecosystem in the border region of central Tunisia. These forests play a vital role in supporting small rural communities, but face increasing pressures and restrictions on their use. This research aims to assign a monetary value to forest conservation, considering the region's specific socio-economic context. Strategies for empowering local residents as key actors in developing sustainable cross-border initiatives are further investigated. Employing the contingent valuation method, a survey of 350 local residents and international users was conducted to assess their willigness to pay fo forest conservation efforts. Logistic regression analysis revealed that sociodemographic factors, such as monthly income and preferred payment method, significantly influence both and the likehood of participation. These findingd highlight the feasibility and importance of reconciling economic development with ecological sustainability in this critical region.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Meteorological Factors on Crop Price Volatility in India: Case studies of Soybean and Brinjal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The price volatility of agricultural crops (commodities) is influenced by meteorological variables such as temperature and precipitation (and many other environmental, social and governance factors), which is a critical challenge in sustainable finance, agricultural planning, and policy-making. This paper studies the impact of meteorological variables on price volatility of agricultural crops. As case studies, we choose the two Indian states of Madhya Pradesh (for Soybean) and Odisha (for Brinjal). We employ an Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model to estimate the conditional volatility of the log returns of crop prices from 2012 to 2024. This study further explores the cross-correlations between volatility and the meteorological variables. Further, a Granger-causality test is carried out to analyze the causal effect of meteorological variables on the price volatility. Finally, the Seasonal Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average with Exogenous Regressors (SARIMAX) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models are implemented as simple machine learning models of price volatility with meteorological factors as exogenous variables. We believe that this will illustrate the usefulness of simple machine learning models in agricultural finance, and help the farmers to make informed decisions by considering climate patterns and making beneficial decisions with regard to crop rotation or allocations. In general, implementing meteorological factors to assess agricultural performance could help to understand and reduce price volatility and possibly lead to economic stability.</description>

      <title>Are Men Less Generous to a Smarter Woman? Evidence from a Dictator Game Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although evidence suggests men are more generous to women than to men, it may stem from paternalism and could reverse when women excel in important skills for one's career success, such as cognitive skills. Using a dictator game, this paper studies whether male dictators allocate less to female receivers than to male receivers when these receivers have higher IQs than dictators. By exogenously varying the receivers' IQ relative to the dictators', I do not find evidence consistent with this hypothesis; if anything, male dictators allocate slightly more to female receivers with higher IQs than to male receivers with equivalent IQs. The results hold both in mean and distribution and are robust to the so-called ``beauty premium.'' Also, female dictators' allocations are qualitatively similar to male dictators. These findings suggest that women who excel in cognitive skills may not receive less favorable treatment than equally intelligent men in the labor market.</description>

      <title>Singapore's Role for ASEAN's Portfolio Investment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the elasticity of portfolio investment of ASEAN and OECD members to geographical distance in a gravity model utilizing a bilateral panel of 86 reporting and 241 counterparty countries/territories for 2007-2017. We find that the elasticity is more negative for ASEAN than OECD members. The difference is larger if we exclude Singapore. This indicates that Singapore's behavior is distinct from other ASEAN members. While Singapore tends to invest in distant OECD countries, other ASEAN members tend to invest in nearby countries. Our study sheds light on the role of a regional financial center in global finance.</description>

      <title>Could AI Leapfrog the Web? Evidence from Teachers in Sierra Leone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although 85% of sub-Saharan Africa's population is covered by mobile broadband signal, only 37% use the internet, and those who do seldom use the web. The most frequently cited reason for low internet usage is the cost of data. We investigate whether AI can bridge this gap by analyzing 40,350 queries submitted to an AI chatbot by 469 teachers in Sierra Leone over 17 months. Teachers use AI for teaching assistance more frequently than web search. We compare the AI responses to the corresponding top search results for the same queries from the most popular local web search engine, google.com.sl. Only 2% of results for corresponding web searches contain content from in country. Additionally, the average web search result consumes 3,107 times more data than an AI response. Bandwidth alone costs \$2.41 per thousand web search results loaded, while the total cost of AI is \$0.30 per thousand responses. As a result, AI is 87% less expensive than web search. In blinded evaluations, an independent sample of teachers rate AI responses as more relevant, helpful, and correct than web search results. These findings suggest that AI-driven solutions can cost-effectively bridge information gaps in low-connectivity regions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Diversification and Leverage in a Utility-Based Portfolio Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the problem of optimal portfolio allocation within the framework of utility theory. We apply exponential utility to derive the optimal diversification strategy and logarithmic utility to determine the optimal leverage. We enhance existing methodologies by incorporating compound probability distributions to model the effects of both statistical and non-stationary uncertainties. Additionally, we extend the maximum expected utility objective by including the variance of utility in the objective function, which we term generalized mean-variance. In the case of logarithmic utility, it provides a natural explanation for the half-Kelly criterion, a concept widely used by practitioners.</description>
