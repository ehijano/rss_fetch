      <title>Direct Two-Dimensional Goniometric Steering of Vacuum Electrospray Ion Beams for Angular Time-of-Flight Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a novel method for two-dimensional steering of vacuum electrospray ionization beams to better understand their angular properties. Utilizing an externally wetted tungsten needle with the ionic liquid 1-Ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMI-BF$_4$), we employ a dual-axis goniometer to achieve in-vacuo beam steering in both pitch and yaw. This setup enables detailed angular-dependent time-of-flight (TOF) measurements of molecular species within the ESI plume as a function of plume angle. Our findings reveal significant variations in the relative abundance of monomers, dimers, trimers, and heavy species across different beam angles, with monomers being at a relative minimum and fragments, trimers, and heavy species being at a relative maximum at the beam center. At higher angles, the relative monomer abundance increases, but at the plume extremities heavy species and trimer fragments begin to rise. The ability to accurately aim the ion beam dramatically enhances the signal-to-noise ratio for various diagnostic tools, underscoring the utility of this system for both scientific studies and practical laboratory applications. This two-dimensional steering capability offers a robust framework for future investigations into ESI plume dynamics and composition, enabling more precise characterizations that are critical for optimizing ESI-based propulsion systems and other applications.</description>

      <title>Co-Design of 2D Heterojunctions for Data Filtering in Tracking Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As particle physics experiments evolve to achieve higher energies and resolutions, handling the massive data volumes produced by silicon pixel detectors, which are used for charged particle tracking, poses a significant challenge. To address the challenge of data transport from high resolution tracking systems, we investigate a support vector machine (SVM)-based data classification system designed to reject low-momentum particles in real-time. This SVM system achieves high accuracy through the use of a customized mixed kernel function, which is specifically adapted to the data recorded by a silicon tracker. Moreover, this custom kernel can be implemented using highly efficient, novel van der Waals heterojunction devices. This study demonstrates the co-design of circuits with applications that may be adapted to meet future device and processing needs in high-energy physics (HEP) collider experiments.</description>

      <title>A compact inertial nano-positioner operating at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14725v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-positioning plays a very important role in applications such as scanning probe microscopy and optics. We report the development of a compact inertial nanopositioner along with fully computer interfaced electronics operating down to 2 K, and its use in our fully automated needle-anvil type Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) apparatus. We also present the fully automated operational procedures using LabVIEW interface with our home-built electronics. The point contact spectroscopy probe has been successfully used to perform PCAR measurements on elemental superconductors at low temperatures. The small footprint of our nano-positioner makes it ideally suited for incorporation in low temperature scanning probe microscopes and makes this design versatile for various research and industrial purposes.</description>

      <title>Progress in Fission Fragment Rocket Engine Development and Alpha Particle Detection in High Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we present our recent experiments on fission fragment rocket propulsion, and on an innovative new design for an alpha particle detection system that has been inspired by these rocketry results. Our test platform, which operates within high magnetic fields 3 T over a large cross$\unicode{x2013}$section (approximately 40 cm in diameter), has been used as a test platform to evaluate the containment and thrust within a future fission$\unicode{x2013}$fragment rocket engine (FFRE). This much more efficient nuclear rocket propulsion FFRE design was first proposed in the 1980s with the intent of greatly reducing transit times in long$\unicode{x2013}$duration space travel. Our objective is to enhance the operational efficiency of this nuclear rocket while gaining deeper insights into the behavior of fuel particles and of the fission$\unicode{x2013}$fragment ejecta within strong magnetic fields experimentally. Through a combination of simulations and experimental work, we established a method for the production and detection of alpha particles as a surrogate for fission fragments. To achieve this, we employed Americium$\unicode{x2013}$241 ($^{ 241}$Am) sources, which were situated within a cylindrical vacuum chamber positioned in a 3$\unicode{x2013}$T Siemens MRI superconducting magnet. By simulating, measuring, and analyzing the emitted alpha particle flux, we gained valuable information about the distribution and likelihood of escape of fission fragments in a future FFRE design. This approach could potentially achieve both high specific impulse and power density in advanced nuclear propulsion systems, such as the FFRE. More generally, this work provides a powerful new approach for analyzing ion flux and nuclear particle or nuclear reaction fragments from a wide variety of experimental designs.</description>

      <title>A Hands-on Experience with a Novel Scintillation Detector for Particle Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle physics, when taught in the classroom or lecture theatre, suffers from a lack of practical experience by students. Thus, we describe the construction of a fully working small particle physics detector using state of the art detector technology for demonstration in educational context. Most of our setup can be constructed with relatively moderate effort, given that a home-level 3D-printer, a photosensor and readout electronics (at least an oscilloscope) are available.</description>

      <title>Oscillating Magnetic Effect in BiFeO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of electric vehicles has led to a growing need for more efficient and environmentally friendly batteries. As a result, there is significant interest in researching new materials and techniques to enhance battery efficiency. One such material being explored is bismuth ferrite (BiFeO$_3$ or BFO), a perovskite with versatile properties. Researchers are particularly intrigued by the potential to control its antiferromagnetic magnetization using magnetic or electric fields. Here, a comprehensive analysis of BFO was conducted, with a focus on its behavior when subjected to oscillating magnetic fields. The research revealed that BFO is sensitive to the frequency and shape of these magnetic fields, leading to the discovery of a new effect related to the transmission of electromagnetic signals on its surface. This effect resulted in a significant increase in the power of the electromagnetic signal, representing a major technological breakthrough. According to the findings, this gain in power has not been observed in any system of this kind before. The study also demonstrated that BFO has the ability to detect magnetic fields through electrical output signals and vice versa, which is crucial for assessing the state and efficiency of batteries, thus contributing to significant advancements in energy storage technology.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Reconstruction with Information Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the electric field from the measured voltages in an antenna, unfolding the antenna response, comes with several problems. Due to the noisiness of the signal it is often necessary to disregard part of the bandwidth of the antenna. It is also not guaranteed, that this system of equations can be inverted at all. In any case, the noise of the measurement will be converted into noise on the electric field. This could be solved by Bayesian inference, however, the electric field is continuous, which would lead to an infinite-dimensional latent space. Information field theory (IFT) has been developed to deal with this problem and allow for Bayesian reasoning on fields. It provides a theoretical backbone and effective tools to approach the inference as a discrete problem in the continuum limit, taking the continuous nature of fields into account. We will present a first working signal model that can be used with IFT-based inference algorithms, which can successfully reconstruct the electric field. The model is based on the current understanding of air shower emission physics, modelling geomagnetic and charge-excess emission and their respective polarisation and spectra separately. Since Bayesian inference provides the posterior distribution, this method also gives an estimate on the uncertainty of the measured field. The performance of this method will be demonstrated with Monte-Carlo simulations of air shower radio signals.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the absolute efficiency of the X-ARAPUCA photon detector for the DUNE Far Detector 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Photon Detection System (PDS) of the first DUNE far detector (FD1) is composed of 6000 photon detection units, named X-ARAPUCA. The detection of the prompt light pulse generated by the particle energy release in liquid argon (LAr) will complement and boost the DUNE Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC). It will improve the non-beam events tagging and enable at low energies the trigger and the calorimetry of the supernova neutrinos. The X-ARAPUCA unit is an assembly of several components. Its Photon Detection Efficiency (PDE) depends both on the design of the assembly, on the grade of the individual components and finally on their coupling. The X-ARAPUCA PDE is one of the leading parameters for the Photon Detection System sensitivity, that in turn determines the sensitivity of the DUNE for the detection of core-collapse supernova within the galaxy and for nucleon decay searches. In this work we present the final assessment of the absolute PDE of the FD1 X-ARAPUCA baseline design, measured in two laboratories with independent methods and setups. One hundred sixty units of these X-ARAPUCA devices have been deployed in the NP04 facility at the CERN Neutrino Platform, the 1:20 scale FD1 prototype, and will be operated during the year 2024. The assessed value of the PDE is a key parameter both in the NP04 and in the DUNE analysis and reconstruction studies.</description>

      <title>First studies on cascaded dual-phase liquid hole-multipliers in xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Challenges in scaling up noble-liquid time projection chambers prompted the exploration of new detection concepts. The liquid hole-multiplier (LHM) was introduced as a potential component, enabling the detection of ionization electrons and VUV photons. Prior studies focused on perforated electrodes coated with CsI immersed in the liquid and electroluminescence amplification produced on a bubble trapped underneath. However, the performance was hindered by electron transfer across the liquid-gas interface. Here, we explored a bubble-free variant, placing a CsI-coated Thick Gas Electron Multiplier electrode below the liquid-gas interface to improve the transfer efficiency across it. Results show &gt;5-fold improvement in the S1'/S2 ratio (a proxy for the photon detection efficiency (PDE)) compared to the bubble-assisted LHM. Although the achieved PDE is still below expectation ($\sim$4%), we propose potential improvements to enhance the performance of this detector.</description>

      <title>Searching for $^{76}$Ge neutrinoless double beta decay with the CDEX-1B experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We operated a p-type point contact high purity germanium (PPCGe) detector (CDEX-1B, 1.008 kg) in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory (CJPL) for 500.3 days to search for neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay of $^{76}$Ge. A total of 504.3 kg$\cdot$day effective exposure data was accumulated. The anti-coincidence and the multi/single-site event (MSE/SSE) discrimination methods were used to suppress the background in the energy region of interest (ROI, 1989$-$2089 keV for this work) with a factor of 23. A background level of 0.33 counts/(keV$\cdot$kg$\cdot$yr) was realized. The lower limit on the half life of $^{76}$Ge $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay was constrained as $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}\ &gt; \ {1.0}\times 10^{23}\ \rm yr\ (90\% \ C.L.)$, corresponding to the upper limits on the effective Majorana neutrino mass: $\langle m_{\beta\beta}\rangle &lt; $3.2$-$7.5$\ \mathrm{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Particles from Evaporating Primordial Black Holes via Electron Scattering in the CDEX-10 Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) is a major constituent of the Universe. However, no definite evidence of DM particles (denoted as ``$\chi$") has been found in DM direct detection (DD) experiments to date. There is a novel concept of detecting $\chi$ from evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). We search for $\chi$ emitted from PBHs by investigating their interaction with target electrons. The examined PBH masses range from 1$\times$10$^{15}$ to 7$\times$10$^{16}$ g under the current limits of PBH abundance $f_{PBH}$. Using 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment conducted in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, we exclude the $\chi$--electron ($\chi$--$e$) elastic-scattering cross section $\sigma_{\chi e} \sim 5\times10^{-29}$ cm$^2$ for $\chi$ with a mass $m_{\chi}\lesssim$ 0.1 keV from our results. With the higher radiation background but lower energy threshold (160 eV), CDEX-10 fill a part of the gap in the previous work. If ($m_{\chi}$, $\sigma_{\chi e}$) can be determined in the future, DD experiments are expected to impose strong constraints on $f_{PBH}$ for large $M_{PBH}$s.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Ionization Produced by 254 eVnr Nuclear Recoils in Germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionization produced by low-energy nuclear recoils is among the primary direct signatures of dark matter interactions. Despite the urgency of dark matter detection and the recent measurements of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering, detector response to nuclear recoils is not well characterized in the keVnr and sub-keVnr regime across a variety of materials. We have re-performed a measurement of the ionization produced by monoenergetic 254 eVnr nuclear recoils in Ge with improved digital electronics and additional systematic studies. Our results indicate an ionization yield of 64 +/- 8 eVee corresponding to a quenching factor of 25 +/- 3%, greater than the 14% predicted by the Lindhard model. This ionization enhancement could greatly improve the sensitivity of high-purity Ge detectors in dark matter detection and measurement of neutrinos via coherent scattering.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Synchrotron Radiation Studies in the EIC Experiment</title>

Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is a cutting-edge particle accelerator aimed at investigating the fundamental structure of matter by colliding high-energy polarized electron beams with ions. To explore dense gluon systems and uncover the origins of nucleon mass and spin, the EIC will operate at high beam currents and luminosities. However, this approach raises beam-induced background rates, notably from synchrotron radiation (SR), which poses significant challenges to the performance and longevity of the Electron-Proton/Ion Collider (ePIC) general-purpose spectrometer placed at the interaction point (IP).
  This paper presents a newly developed Monte-Carlo simulation framework for accurately modeling SR backgrounds in the detector, focusing on the reflection of X-ray photons on vacuum-metal interfaces. Utilizing the extensive capabilities of Geant4 for particle-matter interactions and propagation through the geometry, the study provides first estimates of SR rates in ePIC. The results also propose countermeasures to protect sensitive electronics, ensuring stable and reliable detector operation within the EIC environment.</description>

      <title>Undulators are ALP Factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are known to be produced through axion-photon conversion in the presence of a stationary external magnetic field. Devices such as undulators and wigglers, which are used widely for photon production, e.g., in synchrotron radiation facilities, inherently possess strong magnetic fields, making them potential sources for ALP production. In this paper, we establish formalisms and formulas for studying ALP production in the ALP-photon-charged current system based on quantum field theory. We demonstrate that ALP production is inevitable in any undulator with the standard designs due to the electron Coulomb potential as well as a resonance effect depending on the ALP mass. In particular, ALPs are predominantly produced in a direction slightly misaligned with the photons' main direction. We propose placing detectors in the desired directions during operations of the originally planned experiments as an efficient approach to simultaneously probing ALPs. The calculation methods and formulas developed in this study are applicable to ALP production from other environments and productions of other particles beyond the standard model relevant to synchrotron radiations.</description>
