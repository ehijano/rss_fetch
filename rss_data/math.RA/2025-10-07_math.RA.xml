      <title>The Fox algebra, Localization and factorizations of free polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss interrelations between: Cohn localizations of full square matrices; a Leavitt localization of a row; and the Jacobson quasi-inverses of quasi-regular elements. The latter Jacobson localizations appear naturally and easily in rings which are Hausdorff topological spaces with respect to an ideal topology, pointing out also a connection to specific Gabriel localizations. As a main result and an application we develop a factorization theory for free polynomials with non-zero augmentation over a field. This is inspired by a factorization theory given in the joint work with Mantese for polynomials with constant in non-commutative variables. The basic tool of this research is the localization of a free group algebra by a row of free generators, that is, the Fox algebra of a free group. Hence link modules, that is, Sato modules become naturally modules over Fox algebras, proving a uniqueness and inducing a bijective correspondence between factorizations and composition chains. This is a very first step in a structure theory of matrices over either free algebras or group algebras of free groups with coefficients in a field, or more generally in a principal ideal domain.</description>

      <title>Algebras with additional structures and multiplicities bounded by a constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $G$ be a finite group and $A$ a $G$-graded algebra over a field $F$ of characteristic zero. We characterize the varieties of $G$-graded algebras such that the multiplicities $m_{\langle \lambda \rangle}$ appering in the $\langle n \rangle $-cocharacters of $A$ are bounded by a constant, in terms of $G$-identities. If $A$ is endowed with a graded involution $\ast$, i.e. if $A$ is a $(G,\ast)$-algebra, we characterize the varieties of $(G,*)$-algebras whose multiplicities in the sequence of $\langle n\rangle$-cocharacters of $A$ are bounded by $1$ by showing a list of $(G,\ast)$-polynomial identities satisfied by such varieties.</description>

      <title>Noether's normalization in generalized skew polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Noether Normalization Lemma states that if $S$ is a finitely generated algebra over a field $k$, then there are $x_1,\dots,x_n$ which are algebraically independent over $k$ such that $S$ is a finite module over $k[x_1,\dots,x_n]$. This lemma has been studied intensively in different flavours. In 2024, Elad Paran and Thieu N. Vo successfully generalized this lemma for the case when $S$ is a quotient ring of the skew polynomial ring $D[x_1,\dots,x_n;\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_n]$. In this paper, we study this lemma for a more general case when $S$ is a quotient ring of a generalized skew polynomial ring $D[x_1;\sigma_1,\delta_1]\dots[x_n;\sigma_n,\delta_n]$. We generalize a number of results obtained by Elad Paran and Thieu N. Vo to the new context and introduce a new version of Combinatorial Nullsellensantz over division rings.</description>

      <title>Janus-faces of temporal constraint languages: a dichotomy of expressivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04347v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bodirsky-K\'ara classification of temporal constraint languages stands as one of the earliest and most seminal complexity classifications within infinite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs), yet it remains one of the most mysterious in terms of algorithms and algebraic invariants for the tractable cases. We show that those temporal languages which do not pp-construct EVERYTHING (and thus by the classification are solvable in polynomial time) have, in fact, very limited expressive power as measured by the graphs and hypergraphs they can pp-interpret. This limitation yields many previously unknown algebraic consequences, while also providing new, uniform proofs for known invariance properties. In particular, we show that such temporal constraint languages admit $4$-ary pseudo-Siggers polymorphisms -- a result that sustains the possibility that the existence of such polymorphisms extends to the much broader context of the Bodirsky-Pinsker conjecture.</description>

      <title>On Milnor $K$-theory in the imperfect residue case and applications to period-index problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a $(0,p)$-mixed characteristic complete discrete valued field $\mathcal{K}$ we define a class of finite field extensions called pseudo-perfect extensions such that the natural restriction map on the mod-$p$ Milnor $K$-groups is trivial for all $p\neq 2$. This implies that pseudo-perfect extensions split every element in $H^i(\mathcal{K},\mu_p^{\otimes i-1})$ yielding period-index bounds for Brauer classes as well as higher cohomology classes of $\mathcal{K}$. As a corollary, we prove a conjecture of Bhaskhar-Haase that the Brauer $p$-dimension of $\mathcal{K}$ is upper bounded by $n+1$ where $n$ is the $p$-rank of the residue field. When $\mathcal{K}$ is the fraction field of a complete regular ring, we show that any $p$-torsion element in $Br(\mathcal{K})$ that is nicely ramified is split by a pseudo-perfect extension yielding a bound on its index. We then use patching techniques of Harbater, Hartmann and Krashen to show that the Brauer $p$-dimension of semi-global fields of residual characteristic $p$ is at most $n+2$. This bound is sharper than previously known in the work of Parimala-Suresh.</description>

      <title>Additivity of multiplicative (generalized) maps over rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly prove some results on the additivity of maps over rings under certain conditions. First, we discuss a special case of MARTINDALE III's theorem of \cite{1969M} as a bijective map $\varphi$ over a ring $R$ with a non-trivial idempotent satisfying $\varphi(ab)=\varphi(a)\varphi(b)$ for all $a, b\in R$, is additive. Then we prove that a map $D$ on $R$ satisfying $D(ab)=D(a)b+\varphi(a) D(b)$ for all $a,b\in R$, where $\varphi$ is the map mentioned above, is additive. Finally, we establish that if a map $g$ over $R$ satisfies $g(ab)=g(a)b+\varphi(a)D(b),$ for all $a,b\in R$ and the maps $\varphi$ and $D$ are mentioned above, then $g$ is additive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15560v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study graduated orders over completed group rings of $1$-dimensional admissible $p$-adic Lie groups, and verify the equivariant $p$-adic Artin conjecture for such orders. Following Jacobinski and Plesken, we obtain a formula for the conductor of a graduated order into a self-dual order. We also refine Nickel's central conductor formula by determining a hitherto implicit exponent $r_\chi$.</description>

      <title>On convergence of infinite matrix products with alternating factors from two sets of matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06356</link>
      <description>arXiv:1712.06356v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of convergence to zero of matrix products $A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}$ with factors from two sets of matrices, $A_{i}\in\mathscr{A}$ and $B_{i}\in\mathscr{B}$, due to a suitable choice of matrices $\{B_{i}\}$. It is assumed that for any sequence of matrices $\{A_{i}\}$ there is a sequence of matrices $\{B_{i}\}$ such that the corresponding matrix product $A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}$ converges to zero. We show that in this case the convergence of the matrix products under consideration is uniformly exponential, that is, $\|A_{n}B_{n}\cdots A_{1}B_{1}\|\le C\lambda^{n}$, where the constants $C&gt;0$ and $\lambda\in(0,1)$ do not depend on the sequence $\{A_{i}\}$ and the corresponding sequence $\{B_{i}\}$.</description>

      <title>Network Satisfaction Problems Solved by k-Consistency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the problem of deciding for a given finite relation algebra A whether the network satisfaction problem for A can be solved by the k-consistency procedure, for some natural number k, is undecidable. For the important class of finite relation algebras A with a normal representation, however, the decidability of this problem remains open. We show that if A is symmetric and has a flexible atom, then the question whether NSP(A) can be solved by k-consistency, for some natural number k, is decidable (even in polynomial time in the number of atoms of A). This result follows from a more general sufficient condition for the correctness of the k-consistency procedure for finite symmetric relation algebras. In our proof we make use of a result of Alexandr Kazda about finite binary conservative structures.</description>

      <title>F-invariant in cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11438v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider skew-symmetrizable (upper) cluster algebras with a compatible Poisson structure, called $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebras. For any two good elements (e.g., cluster monomials) in a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-upper cluster algebra, we introduce two invariants, called tropical invariant and $F$-invariant. We prove that (i) the product of two cluster monomials is still a cluster monomial if and only if their $F$-invariant is zero; (ii) if two cluster variables are log-canonical, then they are contained in the same cluster; and (iii) the notion of $F$-invariant for a pair of cluster monomials can be defined for any (upper) cluster algebra, regardless of whether it is a $\mathsf{\Lambda}$-(upper) cluster algebra.
  When restricting to cluster monomials, we prove that the tropical invariant and $F$-invariant respectively coincide with the $\Lambda$-invariant and twice $\mathfrak{d}$-invariant in the monoidal cluster categorification using various monoidal subcategories of finite-dimensional modules over quantum affine algebras and quiver Hecke algebras; and we prove that the $F$-invariant coincides with the $E$-invariant in the additive cluster categorification using the theory of quivers with potentials.
  Inspired by $F$-invariant, we introduce the dominant sets for seeds of cluster algebras as a replacement of torsion classes for $\tau$-tilting pairs in $\tau$-tilting theory. With the help of the dominant sets, we prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras are acyclic. In particular, this implies that green mutations induce a partial order on the set of seeds (up to seed equivalence) of cluster algebras. We prove that the oriented exchange graphs of cluster algebras coincide with the Hasse quivers of the above posets of seeds.</description>

      <title>Key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano threefolds defined by Jordan algebras of cubic forms. Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14991v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a $13$-dimensional affine variety $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ associated with $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$-fibrations of relative Picard number $1$. The construction is modelled on the fact that the affine cone over the Segre-embedded $\mathbb{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{P}^{2}$ is the null locus of the $\sharp$-map of the $9$-dimensional nondegenerate quadratic Jordan algebra $J$ of a cubic form. Using three fixed complementary primitive idempotents and the Peirce decomposition, we coordinatize $J$ by $8$ parameters and thereby obtain $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$.
  We then produce complex prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds, anticanonically embedded of codimension $4$, as weighted complete intersections in suitable weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$, in its subvarieties, or in their weighted cones (allowing some coordinates of weight $0$). We refer to $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ and these projectivizations as key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds.
  As an application, we show that a prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-fold of genus $3$ with three $1/2(1,1,1)$-singularities of type No.,5.4 as in \cite{Tak1} arises as a linear section of a weighted projectivization of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ with all coordinates of positive weight, and conversely any such threefold is obtained in this way. Moreover, relating $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ to the $C_{2}$-cluster variety of Coughlan--Ducat \cite{CD1}, we show that weighted projectivizations of $\mathscr{H}_{\mathbb{A}}^{13}$ or of its subvarieties serve as key varieties for prime $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-folds belonging to $108$ classes in the online database \cite{GRDB}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laurent phenomenon algebras, first introduced by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a generalization of cluster algebras that still possess many salient features of cluster algebras. Graph Laurent phenomenon algebras, defined by Lam and Pylyavskyy, are a subclass of Laurent phenomenon algebras whose structure is given by the data of a directed graph. In this paper, we prove that the cluster monomials of a graph Laurent phenomenon algebra form a linear basis, as conjectured by Lam and Pylyavskyy and analogous to a result for cluster algebras by Caldero and Keller. We also prove that, if the graph is a bidirected tree, the coefficients of the expansion of any monomial in terms of cluster monomials are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Invertibility in partially ordered nonassociative rings</title>

Abstract: Invertibility is important in ring theory because it enables division and facilitates solving equations. Moreover, (nonassociative) rings can be endowed with an extra ''structure'' such as order and topology allowing more richness in the theory. The two main theorems of this article are contributions to invertibility in the context of partially ordered nonassociative rings \textit{and} Hausdorff sequentially Cauchy-complete weak-quasi-topological nonassociative rings. Specifically, the first theorem asserts that the interval $]0,1]$ in any suitable partially ordered nonassociative ring consists entirely of invertible elements. The second theorem asserts that if $f$ is a suitably generalized concept of seminorm from a nonassociative ring to a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology, then under certain conditions, the subset of elements such that $f(1-a) &lt; 1$ consists entirely of invertible elements. Part of the assumption of the second theorem is that of Hausdorff sequential Cauchy-completeness of the first ring under the topology induced by the seminorm $f$ (which takes values in a partially ordered nonassociative ring endowed with Frink's interval topology). Frink's interval topology is an example of a coarse locally-convex $T_1$ topology. Moreover, to our knowledge, the topology induced by a seminorm into a partially ordered nonassociative ring has never been introduced. Some additional original facts, such as the fact that the topology on a nonassociative ring $R_1$ induced by a norm into a totally ordered associative division ring $R_2$ endowed with Frink's interval topology (or equivalently, with the order topology, since the order of $R_2$ is total) is a Hausdorff locally convex quasi-topological group with an additional separate continuity property of the product, are dealt with in the second section ''Preliminaries''.</description>

      <title>Improved two-block coordinate descent method for Pose Graph Optimization Problem under $F^*$-norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dual quaternions and dual quaternion matrices are widely used in robotics research, particularly in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem. Using dual quaternion theory and graph-based methods, SLAM can be reformulated as a rank-one dual quaternion Hermitian matrix completion problem, known as the pose graph optimization (PGO) problem. Recently, Qi and Cui introduced a two-block coordinate descent method to solve this reformulated problem. In this paper, we enhance this method by reformulating the PGO problem under the more appropriate and robust F*-norm rather than the conventional Frobenius norm, leading to improved experimental accuracy. We show that under the F*-norm, one block has a closed-form solution and another is the optimal rank-one approximation of dual quaternion Hermitian matrices under the F*-norm. We derive an explicit solution for this approximation and present an efficient algorithm to compute it. To further enhance the two-block coordinate descent method, we introduce proper parameter selection, stagnation-based termination criteria and an effective spectral initialization strategy. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our refinements deliver superior accuracy, faster computation, and higher success rates, particularly in low-observation settings. In particular, using the F*-norm outperforms the traditional F-norm, underscoring its ability to more faithfully capture the magnitude of the dual parts of dual quaternion matrices.</description>

      <title>Quantum Max d-Cut via qudit swap operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20942</link>

Abstract: Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem for systems of qubits is an example of a 2-local Hamiltonian problem, and a prominent paradigm in computational complexity theory. This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb C^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For a large class of complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups and Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.</description>

      <title>Silting reduction, relative AGK's construction and Higgs construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a Calabi--Yau quadruple as a generalization of Iyama--Yang's Calabi--Yau triple. For each $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple, we show that the associated Higgs category is a $d$-Calabi--Yau Frobenius extriangulated category, which moreover admits a canonical $d$-cluster-tilting subcategory. Concrete examples arise from the construction of relative cluster categories and Higgs categories in the setting of ice quivers with potentials, as well as from the singularity category of an isolated singularity. As an application, we prove that both the relative Amiot--Guo--Keller's construction and the Higgs construction of a $(d+1)$-Calabi--Yau quadruple take silting reduction to Calabi--Yau reduction.</description>
