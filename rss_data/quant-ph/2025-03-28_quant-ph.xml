      <title>An Operational Quantum Field Theoretic Model for Gravitationally Induced Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum field-theoretic model of gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two massive objects in spatial superposition. The masses are described as excitations of a scalar field in an external harmonic potential, allowing for a well-defined notion of relativistic coherent states. Using linearized quantum gravity in the static limit, we derive an effective Hamiltonian that induces entanglement between the field modes occupied by the masses. To probe this entanglement, we construct an observable from field operators that corresponds to the probability density of detecting the center of mass of one of these massive objects. Using this, we compute the fringe visibility in the overlap region and find that gravitationally induced entanglement leads to a decrease in visibility, consistent with previous nonrelativistic results. Additionally, we identify relativistic corrections that accelerate the decay of fringe visibility. These results provide a framework for studying weakly relativistic quantum field systems and their gravitational interactions in tabletop experiments.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum magnetism at the frontier of classical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The utility of near-term quantum computers for simulating realistic quantum systems hinges on the stability of digital quantum matter--realized when discrete quantum gates approximate continuous time evolution--and whether it can be maintained at system sizes and time scales inaccessible to classical simulations. Here, we use Quantinuum's H2 quantum computer to simulate digitized dynamics of the quantum Ising model and observe the emergence of Floquet prethermalization on timescales where accurate simulations using current classical methods are extremely challenging (if feasible at all). In addition to confirming the stability of dynamics subject to achievable digitization errors, we show direct evidence of the resultant local equilibration by computing diffusion constants associated with an emergent hydrodynamic description of the dynamics. Our results were enabled by continued advances in two-qubit gate quality (native partial entangler fidelities of 99.94(1)%) that allow us to access circuit volumes of over 2000 two-qubit gates. This work establishes digital quantum computers as powerful tools for studying continuous-time dynamics and demonstrates their potential to benchmark classical heuristics in a regime of scale and complexity where no known classical methods are both efficient and trustworthy.</description>

      <title>Hybrid interfaces at the single quantum level in fluorescent molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate a single fluorescent molecule as a hybrid quantum optical device, in which multiple external laser sources exert control of the vibronic states. In the high-saturation regime, a coherent interaction is established between the vibrational and electronic degrees of freedom, and molecules can simulate several cavity QED models, whereby a specific vibrational mode plays the role of the cavity mode. Focusing on the specific example where the system is turned into an analogue simulator of the quantum Rabi model, the steady state exhibits vibrational bi-modality resulting in a statistical mixture of highly non-classical vibronic cat states. Applying our paradigm to molecules with prominent spatial asymmetry and combining an optical excitation with a THz(IR) driving, the system can be turned into a single photon transducer. Two possible implementations are discussed based on the coupling to a subwavelength THz patch antenna or a resonant metamaterial. In a nutshell, this work assesses the role of molecules as an optomechanical quantum toolbox for creating hybrid entangled states of electrons, photons, and vibrations, hence enabling frequency conversion over very different energy scales.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer Entanglement as a Magic Highway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness is a key resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, yet its interplay with entanglement in dynamical settings remains underexplored. We study a well-controlled, analytically tractable setup that isolates entanglement generation from magic injection. We analytically and numerically demonstrate that stabilizer entanglement functions as a highway that facilitates the spreading of locally injected magic throughout the entire system. Specifically, for an initial stabilizer state with bipartite entanglement $E$, the total magic growth, quantified by the linear stabilizer entropy $Y$, follows $\overline{Y}\propto 2^{-|A|-E}$ under a Haar random unitary on a local subregion $A$. Moreover, when applying a tensor product of local Haar random unitaries, the resulting state's global magic approaches that of a genuine Haar random state if the initial stabilizer state is sufficiently entangled by a system-size-independent amount. Similar results are also obtained for tripartite stabilizer entanglement. We further extend our analysis to non-stabilizer entanglement and magic injection via a shallow-depth brickwork circuit, and find that the qualitative picture of our conclusion remains unchanged.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Topologically Frustrated Spin Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of entanglement and magic properties in topologically frustrated systems suggests that, in the thermodynamic limit, these quantities decompose into two distinct contributions. One is determined by the specific nature of the model and its Hamiltonian, and another arises from topological frustration itself, resulting in being independent of the Hamiltonian's parameters. In this work, we test the generality of this picture by investigating an additional quantum resource, namely quantum coherence, in two different models where topological frustration is induced through an appropriate choice of boundary conditions. Our findings reveal a perfect analogy between the behavior of quantum coherence and that of other quantum resources, particularly magic, providing further evidence in support of the universality of this picture and the topological nature of this source of frustration.</description>

      <title>Quantum advantage for learning shallow neural networks with natural data distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of quantum computers to machine learning tasks is an exciting potential direction to explore in search of quantum advantage. In the absence of large quantum computers to empirically evaluate performance, theoretical frameworks such as the quantum probably approximately correct (PAC) and quantum statistical query (QSQ) models have been proposed to study quantum algorithms for learning classical functions. Despite numerous works investigating quantum advantage in these models, we nevertheless only understand it at two extremes: either exponential quantum advantages for uniform input distributions or no advantage for potentially adversarial distributions. In this work, we study the gap between these two regimes by designing an efficient quantum algorithm for learning periodic neurons in the QSQ model over a broad range of non-uniform distributions, which includes Gaussian, generalized Gaussian, and logistic distributions. To our knowledge, our work is also the first result in quantum learning theory for classical functions that explicitly considers real-valued functions. Recent advances in classical learning theory prove that learning periodic neurons is hard for any classical gradient-based algorithm, giving us an exponential quantum advantage over such algorithms, which are the standard workhorses of machine learning. Moreover, in some parameter regimes, the problem remains hard for classical statistical query algorithms and even general classical algorithms learning under small amounts of noise.</description>

      <title>Solvable Quantum Circuits in Tree+1 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise tractable models of unitary quantum many-body dynamics on tree graphs, as a first step towards a deeper understanding of dynamics in non-Euclidean spaces. To this end, we first demonstrate how to construct strictly local quantum circuits that preserve the symmetries of trees, such that their dynamical light cones grow isotropically. We show that, for trees with coordination number z, such circuits can be built from z-site gates. We then introduce a family of gates for which the dynamics is exactly solvable; these satisfy a set of constraints that we term 'tree-unitarity'. Notably, tree-unitarity reduces to the previously-established notion of dual-unitarity for z=2, when the tree reduces to a line. Among the unexpected features of tree-unitarity is a trade-off between 'maximum velocity' dynamics of out-of-time-order correlators and the existence of non-vanishing correlation functions in multiple directions, a tension absent in one-dimensional dual-unitary models and their Euclidean generalizations. We give various examples of tree-unitary gates, discuss dynamical correlations, out-of-time-order correlators, and entanglement growth, and show that the kicked Ising model on a tree is a physically-motivated example of maximum-velocity tree-unitary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Modelling and optimization of pulsed squeezed state generation in a ring-resonator system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-analytic formalism for calculating the squeezing and antisqueezing spectrum in a channel waveguide side-coupled to a lossy ring resonator. Our approach first uses the semi-analytic evolution of the density matrix inside the ring up to the time where the squeezing is maximized. Then noting that a conservative approximate result for the squeezing can be obtained by ignoring the effect of the pump at later times, we calculate the free evolution of the field operators in the channel waveguide at all later times. We then calculate the quadrature squeezing spectrum in the waveguide, assuming that the measurement starts at the time when the squeezing in the ring is maximized. Using these results, we determine the optimum values for the pump pulse duration and amplitude and the ring-channel coupling for the pump and signal. We find that squeezing above 10 dB can be easily achieved in the channel for antisqueezing levels of less than 22 dB.</description>

      <title>Quantum Max $d$-Cut via qudit swap operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Max Cut (QMC) problem for systems of qubits is an example of a 2-local Hamiltonian problem, and a prominent paradigm in computational complexity theory. This paper investigates the algebraic structure of a higher-dimensional analog of the QMC problem for systems of qudits. The Quantum Max d-Cut (d-QMC) problem asks for the largest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian on a graph with n vertices whose edges correspond to swap operators acting on $(\mathbb{C}^d)^{\otimes n}$. The algebra generated by the swap operators is identified as a quotient of a free algebra modulo symmetric group relations and a single additional relation of degree d. This presentation leads to a tailored hierarchy of semidefinite programs, leveraging noncommutative polynomial optimization (NPO) methods, that converges to the solution of the d-QMC problem. For a large class of complete bipartite graphs, exact solutions for the d-QMC problem are derived using the representation theory of symmetric groups. This in particular includes the d-QMC problem for clique and star graphs on n vertices, for all d and n. Lastly, the paper addresses a refined d-QMC problem focused on finding the largest eigenvalue within each isotypic component (irreducible block) of the graph Hamiltonian. It is shown that the spectrum of the star graph Hamiltonian distinguishes between isotypic components of the 3-QMC problem. For general d, low-degree relations for separating isotypic components are presented, enabling adaptation of the global NPO hierarchy to efficiently compute the largest eigenvalue in each isotypic component.</description>

      <title>Variational Quantum Algorithms in the era of Early Fault Tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing roadmaps predict the availability of 10,000 qubit devices within the next 3-5 years. With projected two-qubit error rates of 0.1%, these systems will enable certain operations under quantum error correction (QEC) using lightweight codes, offering significantly improved fidelities compared to the NISQ era. However, the high qubit cost of QEC codes like the surface code (especially at near-threshold physical error rates) limits the error correction capabilities of these devices. In this emerging era of Early Fault Tolerance (EFT), it will be essential to use QEC resources efficiently and focus on applications that derive the greatest benefit. In this work, we investigate the implementation of Variational Quantum Algorithms in the EFT regime (EFT-VQA). We introduce partial error correction (pQEC), a strategy that error-corrects Clifford operations while performing Rz rotations via magic state injection instead of the more expensive T-state distillation. Our results show that pQEC can improve VQA fidelities by 9.27x over standard approaches. Furthermore, we propose architectural optimizations that reduce circuit latency by ~2x, and achieve qubit packing efficiency of 66% in the EFT regime.</description>

      <title>Selective and efficient quantum state tomography for multi-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a crucial tool for characterizing quantum states. However, QST becomes impractical for reconstructing multi-qubit density matrices since data sets and computational costs grow exponentially with qubit number. In this Letter, we introduce selective and efficient QST (SEEQST), an approach for efficiently estimating multiple selected elements of an arbitrary $N$-qubit density matrix. We show that any $N$-qubit density matrix can be partitioned into $2^N$ subsets, each containing $2^N$ elements. With SEEQST, any such subset can be accurately estimated from just two experiments with only single-qubit measurements. The complexity for estimating any subset remains constant regardless of Hilbert-space dimension, so SEEQST can find the full density matrix using $2^{N+1} - 1$ experiments, where standard methods would use $3^N$ experiments. We provide a circuit decomposition for the SEEQST experiments, demonstrating that their maximum circuit depth scales logarithmically with $N$ assuming all-to-all connectivity. The Python code for SEEQST is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/aniket-ae/SEEQST}{github.com/aniket-ae/SEEQST}.</description>

      <title>Causal consistency requirements for gravity-induced entanglement in near-relativistic systems with internal energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider a thought experiment that employs the entanglement of the gravitational field with position space quantum states as a means for faster-than-light signaling. We present a protocol that includes the excitation to a higher internal energy level to increase sensitivity to gravitational phase shifts. We report that the explanations why previous versions of the thought experiment remain causally consistent are insufficient to avoid any possibility for faster-than-light signals in this case. An alternative resolution to prevent faster-than-light signaling is most reasonably the requirement for a (near) relativistic treatment. One such effect could be a decoherence channel unobserved in a nonrelativistic treatment.</description>

      <title>Covert Entanglement Generation and Secrecy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the covert capacity for entanglement generation over a noisy quantum channel. While secrecy guarantees that the transmitted information remains inaccessible to an adversary, covert communication ensures that the transmission itself remains undetectable. The entanglement dimension follows a square root law (SRL) in the covert setting, i.e., $O(\sqrt{n})$ EPR pairs can be distributed covertly and reliably over n channel uses. We begin with covert communication of classical information under a secrecy constraint. We then leverage this result to construct a coding scheme for covert entanglement generation. Consequently, we establish achievability of the same covert entanglement generation rate as the classical information rate without secrecy, albeit with a larger key.</description>

      <title>Exponential quantum speedups in quantum chemistry with linear depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove classical simulation hardness, under the generalized $\mathsf{P}\neq\mathsf{NP}$ conjecture, for quantum circuit families with applications in near-term quantum chemical ground state estimation. The proof exploits a connection to particle number conserving matchgate circuits with fermionic magic state inputs, which are shown to be universal for quantum computation under post-selection, and are therefore not classically simulable in the worst case, in either the strong (multiplicative) or weak (sampling) sense. We apply this result to quantum multi-reference methods designed for near-term quantum hardware by ruling out certain dequantization strategies for computing the off-diagonal matrix elements. We demonstrate these quantum speedups for two choices of reference state that incorporate both static and dynamic correlations to model the electronic eigenstates of molecular systems: orbital-rotated matrix product states, which are preparable in linear depth, and unitary coupled-cluster with single and double excitations. In each case we discuss the implications for achieving exponential quantum advantage in quantum chemistry on near-term hardware.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum control requires high-precision and robust control pulses to ensure optimal system performance. However, control sequences generated with a system model may suffer from model bias, leading to low fidelity. While model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been developed to avoid such biases, training an RL agent from scratch can be time-consuming, often taking hours to gather enough samples for convergence. This challenge has hindered the broad application of RL techniques to larger and more complex quantum control issues, limiting their adaptability. In this work, we use Reinforcement Learning from Demonstration (RLfD) to leverage the control sequences generated with system models and further optimize them with RL to avoid model bias. By avoiding learning from scratch and starting with reasonable control pulse shapes, this approach can increase sample efficiency by reducing the number of samples, which can significantly reduce the training time. Thus, this method can effectively handle pulse shapes that are discretized into more than 1000 pieces without compromising final fidelity. We have simulated the preparation of several high-fidelity non-classical states using the RLfD method. We also find that the training process is more stable when using RLfD. In addition, this method is suitable for fast gate calibration using reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Dispersive regime of multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dispersive regime of $n$-photon qubit-oscillator interactions is analyzed using Schrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory. Effective Hamiltonians are derived up to the second order in the perturbation parameters. These effective descriptions reveal higher-order qubit-oscillator cross-Kerr and oscillator self-Kerr terms. The cross-Kerr term combines a qubit Pauli operator with an $n$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator, while the self-Kerr term is an $(n-1)$-degree polynomial in the oscillator photon number operator. In addition to the higher-order Kerr terms, a qubit-conditional $2n$-photon squeezing term appears in the effective non-rotating-wave-approximation Hamiltonian. Furthermore, perturbation theory is applied to the case of multiple qubits coupled to a shared oscillator. A photon-number-dependent qubit-qubit interaction emerges in this case, which can be leveraged to tune the effective multiqubit system parameters using the oscillator state. Results for the converse setup of multiple oscillators and a single qubit are also derived. In this case, a qubit-conditional oscillator-oscillator nonlinear interaction is found. The effective descriptions developed here offer a simple and intuitive physical picture of dispersive multiphoton qubit-oscillator interactions that can aid in the design of implementations harnessing their desired nonlinear effects.</description>

      <title>Translation-Invariant Quantum Algorithms for Ordered Search are Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered search is the task of finding an item in an ordered list using comparison queries. The best exact classical algorithm for this fundamental problem uses $\lceil \log_{2}{n}\rceil$ queries for a list of length $n$. Quantum computers can achieve a constant-factor speedup, but the best possible coefficient of $\log_{2}{n}$ for exact quantum algorithms is only known to lie between $(\ln{2})/\pi \approx 0.221$ and $4/\log_{2}{605} \approx 0.433$. We consider a special class of translation-invariant algorithms with no workspace, introduced by Farhi, Goldstone, Gutmann, and Sipser, that has been used to find the best known upper bounds. First, we show that any exact, $k$-query quantum algorithm for ordered search can be implemented by a $k$-query algorithm in this special class. Second, we use linear programming to show that the best exact $5$-query quantum algorithm can search a list of length $7265$, giving an ordered search algorithm that asymptotically uses $5 \log_{7265}{n} \approx 0.390 \log_{2}{n}$ quantum queries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the collective dipole-dipole interactions in atoms coupled to a nanophotonic microring resonator. The atoms can interact with each other through light-induced dipole-dipole interactions mediated by free space and through the resonator whispering-gallery modes. The differing characteristics and mismatched wavenumbers of these modes give rise to complex dynamics and provide new opportunities for controlling light-matter interactions. We explore these phenomena in the context of an experimentally realized atom cloud and study the potential of the proposed sub-wavelength atom arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement distribution is crucial for quantum communication and cryptography but is hindered by channel loss and decoherence. Noiseless linear amplification (NLA) is a probabilistic protocol that supports noiseless amplification without violating the no-cloning theorem, aiding in tasks like entanglement distillation and enhanced metrology. The probabilistic nature of NLA and other quantum repeater elements creates a significant resource overhead, which depends on the success rate of each individual probabilistic step. We experimentally demonstrate a technique to increase NLA success probability while maintaining the amplification gain and the fidelity of the amplified state with a maximally entangled state. We show that symmetrically distributing loss before and after the amplification provides an improved scaling of the success rates of NLA. Our results are a critical step towards scalable quantum repeaters and enable efficient long-distance quantum communication</description>

      <title>On the Utility of Quantum Entanglement for Joint Communication and Instantaneous Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is known to significantly improve the performance (separately) of communication and detection schemes that utilize quantum resources. This work explores the simultaneous utility of quantum entanglement for (joint) communication and detection schemes, over channels that are convex combinations of identity, depolarization and erasure operators, both with perfect and imperfect entanglement assistance. The channel state is binary, rapidly time-varying and unknown to the transmitter. While the communication is delay-tolerant, allowing the use of arbitrarily long codewords to ensure reliable decoding, the channel state detection is required to be instantaneous. The detector is neither co-located with the transmitter, nor able to wait for the decoding in order to learn the transmitted waveform. The results of this work appear in the form of communication-rate vs instantaneous-detection-error tradeoffs, with and without quantum entanglement. Despite the challenges that place the two tasks at odds with each other, the results indicate that quantum entanglement can indeed be simultaneously and significantly beneficial for joint communication and instantaneous detection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution Networks (QKDN) enable secure communication even in the age of powerful quantum computers. In the hands of a network operator, which can offer its service to many users, the economic viability of a QKDN increases significantly. The highly challenging operator-user relationship in a large-scale network setting demands additional requirements to ensure carrier-grade operation. Addressing this challenge, this work presents a carrier-grade QKDN architecture, which combines the functional QKDN architecture with the operational perspective of a network operator, ultimately enhancing the economic viability of QKDN. The focus is on the network and key management aspects of a QKDN while assuming state-of-the-art commercial QKD-Modules. The presented architecture was rolled out within an in-field demonstrator, connecting the cities of Berlin and Bonn over a link distance of 923 km across Germany. We could show, that the proposed network architecture is feasible, integrable, and scalable making it suitable for deployment in real-world networks. Overall, the presented carrier-grade QKDN architecture promises to serve as a blueprint for network operators providing QKD-based services to their customers.</description>

      <title>Bipartite entanglement is sufficient for standard device-independent conference key agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conference key agreement (CKA) aims to establish shared, private randomness among many separated parties in a network. Device-independent (DI) CKA is a variant in which no assumptions are placed on the nature of the source, or the measurements performed by each party. So far, DICKA protocols largely fall into two categories: those that rely on violating a joint Bell inequality using genuinely multi-partite entangled states, and those that concatenate many bipartite protocols. The question of whether a hybrid protocol exists, where a multi-partite Bell inequality can be violated using only bipartite entanglement, was asked by Grasselli et al. in [Quantum 7, 980, (2023)]. We answer this question affirmatively, by constructing an asymptotically secure DICKA protocol achieving the same rate as the concatenation of bipartite DIQKD, yet relying on a single joint Bell violation. Our results prompt further discussion on the benefits of multi-partite entanglement for DICKA over its bipartite alternative, and we give an overview of different arguments for near-term devices.</description>

      <title>Specifying the Intrinsic Back-action of a General Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the invasive nature of quantum measurement and its implications in quantum foundations and information science demands a mathematically rigorous and physically well-grounded characterization of intrinsic back-action in general measurement processes. However, such a framework remains elusive, leaving a critical gap in quantum theory. Here, we address this issue by conceptualizing a general quantum measurement as a reduction of extended projection measurements ensured by Naimark's theorem and, derive a state-updating rule for the concerned measurement as a reduction of the projective measurements postulate. Our framework provides a detailed analysis by explicitly decomposing the disturbance effects into two distinct contributions: those arising from the measurement elements themselves and those resulting from the dilation process. Notably, this formulation naturally recovers the projection postulate in the case of projective measurements. Beyond providing insights into joint measurability, non-disturbance, our rule establishes quantitaive connections between intrinsic disturbance and other fundamental quantum features, such as randomness, uncertainty, and information gain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, has been found to significantly enhance computational capabilities in principle, in some cases beyond classical computing limits. This paper explores quantum computing's potential to address complex, large-scale problems in transportation systems. It focuses on three principal paradigms: Gate-based quantum computing, Quantum annealing, and Quantum machine learning, which, though based on gate-based quantum computing, is treated as distinct due to its unique methods and applications. Each paradigm's foundational concepts, practical applications, and potential impacts on the field are discussed to provide a comprehensive overview of quantum computing strategies and their future implications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a novel multi-layer neuromorphic network. Many groups worldwide have studied this network, including image processing, time series analysis, solving physical problems, and practical applications such as medical use. Therefore, we propose an Adaptive Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (VQKAN) that takes advantage of KAN for Variational Quantum Algorithms in an adaptive manner. The Adaptive VQKAN is VQKAN that uses adaptive ansatz as the ansatz and repeat VQKAN growing the ansatz just like Adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). The scheme inspired by Adaptive VQE is promised to ascend the accuracy of VQKAN to practical value. As a result, Adaptive VQKAN has been revealed to calculate the fitting problem more accurately and faster than Quantum Neural Networks by far less number of parametric gates.</description>

Abstract: Out-of-time order correlators (OTOCs) are crucial tools for studying quantum chaos as they show distinct scrambling behavior for chaotic Hamiltonians. We calculate OTOC and analyze the quantum information scrambling in atom-field and spin-spin interaction models, which are open-system models and exhibit non-Markovian behavior. We also examine the Loschmidt echo for these models and comment on their chaotic nature. The commutator growth of two local operators, which is upper bounded by the Lieb-Robinson bound, is studied for these models, and the patterns of scrambling are investigated.</description>

      <title>Generative Decoding for Quantum Error-correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient and accurate decoding of quantum error-correcting codes is essential for fault-tolerant quantum computation, however, it is challenging due to the degeneracy of errors, the complex code topology, and the large space for logical operators in high-rate codes. In this work, we propose a decoding algorithm utilizing generative modeling in machine learning. We employ autoregressive neural networks to learn the joint probability of logical operators and syndromes in an unsupervised manner, eliminating the need for labeled training data. The learned model can approximately perform maximum likelihood decoding by directly generating the most likely logical operators for $k$ logical qubits with $\mathcal O(2k)$ computational complexity. Thus, it is particularly efficient for decoding high-rate codes with many logical qubits. The proposed approach is general and applies to a wide spectrum of quantum error-correcting codes including surface codes and quantum low-density parity-check codes (qLDPC), under noise models ranging from code capacity noise to circuit level noise. We conducted extensive numerical experiments to demonstrate that our approach achieves significantly higher decoding accuracy compared to the minimum weight perfect matching and belief propagation with ordered statistics on the surface codes and high-rate quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach highlights generative artificial intelligence as a potential solution for the real-time decoding of realistic and high-rate quantum error correction codes.</description>

      <title>Statistics of the Random Matrix Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral form factor of random matrix theory plays a key role in the description of disordered and chaotic quantum systems. While its moments are known to be approximately Gaussian, corrections subleading in the matrix dimension, $D$, have recently come to attention, with conflicting results in the literature. In this work, we investigate these departures from Gaussianity for both circular and Gaussian ensembles. Using two independent approaches -- sine-kernel techniques and supersymmetric field theory -- we identify the form factor statistics to next leading order in a $D^{-1}$ expansion. Our sine-kernel analysis highlights inconsistencies with previous studies, while the supersymmetric approach backs these findings and suggests an understanding of the statistics from a complementary perspective. Our findings fully agree with numerics. They are presented in a pedagogical way, highlighting new pathways (and pitfalls) in the study of statistical signatures at next leading order, which are increasingly becoming important in applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of superradiance on relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent interest in the studies of structured states obtained in relativistic electron beams has highlighted the use of two alternative descriptions, each based on a different wavefunction and the related space-time density. Although both wavefunctions obey the Dirac equation (one directly and the other through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation) they lead to different dynamics and properties, such as the presence or absence of spin-orbit interactions. In this work we investigate wavepacket dynamics for the Klein-Gordon equation, which displays the same ambiguity regarding the choice of different densities, in a setting involving Klein tunneling across a series of supercritical potential barriers. Relying on the superradiant character of this setting, we obtain solutions to the wavepacket dynamics indicating that the density based on a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wavefunction can be locally amplified outside the light-cone. In principle, the exponential increase of the charge due to the field inhomogeneities can lead to an arbitrarily large amplification over macroscopic distances. These results might lead to question the descriptions based on Foldy-Wouthuysen densities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving systems of linear equations is a key subroutine in many quantum algorithms. In the last 15 years, many quantum linear solvers (QLS) have been developed, competing to achieve the best asymptotic worst-case complexity. Most QLS assume fault-tolerant quantum computers, so they cannot yet be benchmarked on real hardware. Because an algorithm with better asymptotic scaling can underperform on instances of practical interest, the question of which of these algorithms is the most promising remains open. In this work, we implement a method to partially address this question. We consider four well-known QLS algorithms which directly implement an approximate matrix inversion function: the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd algorithm, two algorithms utilizing a linear combination of unitaries, and one utilizing the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). These methods, known as functional QLS, share nearly identical assumptions about the problem setup and oracle access. Their computational cost is dominated by query calls to a matrix oracle encoding the problem one wants to solve. We provide formulas to count the number of queries needed to solve specific problem instances; these can be used to benchmark the algorithms on real-life instances without access to quantum hardware. We select three data sets: random generated instances that obey the assumptions of functional QLS, linear systems from simplex iterations on MIPLIB, and Poisson equations. Our methods can be easily extended to other data sets and provide a high-level guide to evaluate the performance of a QLS algorithm. In particular, our work shows that HHL underperforms in comparison to the other methods across all data sets, often by orders of magnitude, while the QSVT-based method shows the best performance.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Entanglement Phase Transition in Free Fermion Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of measurement-induced entanglement phase transition in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.</description>

      <title>Higher-order exceptional points in a non-reciprocal waveguide beam splitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have attracted significant interest because of their intriguing and useful properties, including exceptional points (EPs), where eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenstates of non-Hermitian operators become degenerate. In particular, quantum photonic systems with EPs exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to external perturbations, which increases with the order of the EP. As a result, higher-order EPs hold significant potential for advanced sensing applications, but they are challenging to achieve due to stringent symmetry requirements. In this work, we study the dynamics of a generalized lossy waveguide beam splitter with asymmetric coupling by introducing non-reciprocity as a tunable parameter to achieve higher-order EPs even without dissipation. Using the Schwinger representation, we analytically derive eigenvalues and numerically demonstrate the formation of EPs. Moreover, we analyze the evolution of NOON states under activated non-reciprocity, highlighting its impact on quantum systems. Our results open new pathways for realizing higher-order EPs in non-reciprocal open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantisations of exactly solvable ghostly models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an exactly solvable two-dimensional Lorentzian coupled quantum system that in a certain parameter regime can be transformed to a higher time derivative theory (HTDT) with preserved symplectic structure. By transforming the system's Lagrangian, we explicitly map it onto the standard Pais-Uhlenbeck formulation, revealing a direct correspondence in their dynamical and Poisson bracket structures. We quantise the model in two alternative ways. First we derive the eigensystem of the Hamiltonian by solving the Schr\"odinger equation through an Ansatz that leads to a set of coupled three-term recurrence relations, that we solve exactly, identifying normalisable wavefunctions and their associated energy spectra. We compare our results with a Fock space construction, finding exact agreement. On the basis of the exact solutions we report several specific physical properties of the ghost model investigated with a focus on the localisation properties of the system.</description>

      <title>Quantum umlaut information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Evaluation of Quantum/Classical Neural Network Using a Game Solver Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To evaluate the performance of quantum computing systems relative to classical counterparts and explore the potential for quantum advantage, we propose a game-solving benchmark based on Elo ratings in the game of tic-tac-toe. We compare classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs), quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), and hybrid classical-quantum models by assessing their performance against a random-move agent in automated matches. Additionally, we implement a QCNN integrated with quantum communication and evaluate its performance to quantify the overhead introduced by noisy quantum channels. Our results show that the classical-quantum hybrid model achieves Elo ratings comparable to those of classical CNNs, while the standalone QCNN underperforms under current hardware constraints. The communication overhead was found to be modest. These findings demonstrate the viability of using game-based benchmarks for evaluating quantum computing systems and suggest that quantum communication can be incorporated with limited impact on performance, providing a foundation for future hybrid quantum applications.</description>

      <title>How Likely Are You to Observe Non-locality with Imperfect Detection Efficiency and Random Measurement Settings?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imperfect detection efficiency remains one of the major obstacles in achieving loophole-free Bell tests over long distances. At the same time, the challenge of establishing a common reference frame for measurements becomes more pronounced as the separation between parties increases. In this work, we tackle both of these issues by examining the impact of limited detection efficiency on the probability of Bell inequality violation with Haar random measurement settings. We derive analytical lower bounds on the violation probability for a two-qubit maximally entangled state, which is tight for correlation inequalities and perfect detection efficiencies. We further investigate it numerically for more qubits and settings using two detection efficiency models and an original method based on linear programming. Beyond that, we show that the so-called typicality of Bell inequality violation, i.e., almost certain violation of local realism with sufficiently many particles or random measurement directions, holds even if the detection efficiency is limited. Our findings reveal that increasing the number of measurement settings can compensate for efficiency losses above the critical threshold. We determine critical detection efficiencies for both two-party and three-party scenarios. For two parties, we recover previously established results, while for three parties, we derive a symmetric critical efficiency of $\eta_{crit} = 2/3$ for the W and GHZ states within the binning model. In cases involving the no-detection outcome, we present a modified inequality using a pair of orthogonal observables for each party with $\eta_{crit} \approx 0.7208$, which is notably less than 0.75 for the GHZ state. These results offer deeper insights into the limitations and possibilities for certifying non-locality in the presence of limited detection efficiency, shedding light on its robustness in practical Bell tests.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the first experimental observation of the long-lived prethermal phases with tunable heating rates in many-body systems, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by the $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and the subsystem entanglement entropy, we trace out the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and confirm the existence of the prethermal plateau. Its lifetime grows algebraically with the driving frequency and the scaling exponent is approximately $2n{+}1$, tunable by the multipolar order. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from the area-law to the volume-law entanglement scaling. We utilize all 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, and their entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work underscores superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physical nature of the D-Wave annealers remains a subject of active investigation. In this study, we analyze the sampling behavior of these systems and explore whether their results can be replicated using quantum and Markovian models. Employing the standard and the fast annealing protocols, we observe that the D-Wave annealers sample states with frequencies matching the Gibbs distribution for sufficiently long annealing times. Using Bloch equation simulations for single-qubit problems and Lindblad and Markovian master equations for two-qubit systems, we compare experimental data with theoretical predictions. Our results provide insights into the role of quantum mechanics in these devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication necessitates the use of quantum repeaters, which typically include highly coherent quantum memories. We provide a theoretical analysis of the secret key rates for a quantum repeater system incorporating bosonic error correction and memory components. Specifically, we focus on the application of Binomial codes for two repeater segments. Using these codes, our investigation aims to suppress memory loss errors that commonly affect systems such as atoms and microwave cavities, in contrast to dephasing errors in single-spin memories. We further discuss a physical implementation of such a quantum repeater comprising a microwave cavity and a superconducting transmon, capable of state engineering with high fidelities ($&gt;97\%$) and logical Bell state measurements for successful entanglement swapping. As an alternative approach, we also discuss a realization in the all-optical domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comparative analysis of three quantum thermal engines utilizing a two-qubit Heisenberg XXZ chain as the working substance. A novel generalized quantum Otto cycle (GQOC) is introduced, featuring two distinct coupling configurations to thermal reservoirs. The GQOC exhibits the potential for 100\% efficiency, surpassing the efficiency of the conventional quantum Otto cycle. Essential conditions for positive work extraction and achieving maximum unity efficiency are derived. An experimental implementation using Quantum Electrodynamic circuits and Transmon qudit is proposed. This work contributes to the advancement of quantum heat engines, highlighting the benefits of non-equilibrium processes and asymmetric coupling for enhanced work extraction and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Classical bounds on correlation-type Bell expressions and linear prepare-and-measure witnesses: efficient computation in parallel environments such as graphics processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented program aims at speeding up the brute force computation of the $L_d$ norm of a matrix $M$ using graphics processing units (GPUs). Alternatives for CPUs have also been implemented, and the algorithm is applicable to any parallel environment. The $n\times m$ matrix $M$ has real elements which may represent coefficients of a bipartite correlation-type Bell expression or those of a linear prepare-and-measure (PM) witness. In this interpretation, the $L_1$ norm is the local bound of the given Bell expression, and the $L_d$ norm for $d\ge 2$ is the classical $d$-dimensional bound of the given PM witness, which is associated with the communication of $d$-level classical messages in the PM scenario. In both scenarios, the output is assumed to be binary. The code for GPUs is written in CUDA C and can utilize one NVIDIA GPU in a computer. To illustrate the performance of our implementation, we refer to Brierley et al. [arXiv:1609.05011] who needed approximately three weeks to compute the local bound on a Bell expression defined by a $42\times 42$ matrix on a standard desktop using a single CPU core. In contrast, our efficient implementation of the brute force algorithm allows us to reduce this to three minutes using a single NVIDIA RTX 6000 Ada graphics card on a desktop. For CPUs, the algorithm was implemented with OpenMP and MPI according to the shared and distributed memory models, respectively, and achieves a comparable speedup at a number of CPU cores around 100.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate a hardware vulnerability in quantum computing systems by exploiting cross-talk effects on an available commercial quantum computer (IBM). Specifically, based on the cross-talk produced by certain quantum gates, we implement a row hammer attack that ultimately allows us to flip a qubit. Both single-qubit and two-qubit operations are performed and analyzed. Our findings reveal that two-qubit operations applied near the target qubit significantly influence it through cross-talk, effectively compromising its state.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Transformer model, renowned for its powerful attention mechanism, has achieved state-of-the-art performance in various artificial intelligence tasks but faces challenges such as high computational cost and memory usage. Researchers are exploring quantum computing to enhance the Transformer's design, though it still shows limited success with classical data. With a growing focus on leveraging quantum machine learning for quantum data, particularly in quantum chemistry, we propose the Molecular Quantum Transformer (MQT) for modeling interactions in molecular quantum systems. By utilizing quantum circuits to implement the attention mechanism on the molecular configurations, MQT can efficiently calculate ground-state energies for all configurations. Numerical demonstrations show that in calculating ground-state energies for H_2, LiH, BeH_2, and H_4, MQT outperforms the classical Transformer, highlighting the promise of quantum effects in Transformer structures. Furthermore, its pretraining capability on diverse molecular data facilitates the efficient learning of new molecules, extending its applicability to complex molecular systems with minimal additional effort. Our method offers an alternative to existing quantum algorithms for estimating ground-state energies, opening new avenues in quantum chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Solvability of N-level Systems under the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA) and Dipole Selection Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamics of an N-level system under the Rotating Wave Approximation and dipole selection rules. Such systems can be solved straightforwardly if the Hamiltonian can be transformed into a time-independent form. The condition under which a unitary transformation can be used to render time-dependent Hamiltonians into a time-independent form, thereby making the solution, is examined. After case-by-case analysis of different four and five-level systems, we conclude that systems having only one odd or even parity level are solvable. In contrast, the others must satisfy a condition of laser detuning for solvability.</description>

      <title>Numerically efficient quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral approach with two independent non-commuting baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path integral methods, like the quasi-adiabatic propagator path integral (QUAPI), are widely used in general-purpose and highly accurate numerical benchmark simulations of open quantum systems, particularly in regimes inaccessible to perturbative methods. Nevertheless, the applicability of the QUAPI method to realistic systems of interest is restricted by the exponentially growing computer memory requirements with respect to the size of the quantum system and the time range of non-Markovian correlation effects. This exponential ''wall'' becomes even more severe for multiple non-commuting fluctuating environments. In the present work, we address the numerical efficiency and accuracy of approximations that have been introduced for the QUAPI method with a single general environment, for the case of two independent non-commuting environments where one of them is considered as a pure dephasing environment. Specifically, we consider a sharply defined cut-off of the memory time, path filtering and mask assisted coarse graining of influence functional coefficients (MACGIC-QUAPI) as approximations. We demonstrate that commonly applied numerical techniques such as path filtering cannot be straightforwardly transferred to the two bath case even in the weak-coupling and quasi-Markovian limits. On the other hand, the sharply defined memory cut-off can be accurately handled with the mask assisted coarse graining (MACGIC-QUAPI) approach. Our findings demonstrates that if system coupling operators to different baths do not commute, the additive nature of the statistically independent environments may be misleading. Particularly, the quasi-Markovian nature of a pure dephasing bath is lost, once there simultaneously exists another non-commuting source of fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic quantum state preparation in integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose applying the adiabatic algorithm to prepare high-energy eigenstates of integrable models on a quantum computer. We first review the standard adiabatic algorithm to prepare ground states in each magnetization sector of the prototypical XXZ Heisenberg chain. Based on the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz, we show that the algorithm circuit depth is polynomial in the number of qubits $N$, outperforming previous methods explicitly relying on integrability. Next, we propose a protocol to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of integrable models that satisfy certain conditions. For a given target eigenstate, we construct a suitable parent Hamiltonian written in terms of a complete set of local conserved quantities. We propose using such Hamiltonian as an input for an adiabatic algorithm. After benchmarking this construction in the case of the non-interacting XY spin chain, where we can rigorously prove its efficiency, we apply it to prepare arbitrary eigenstates of the Richardson-Gaudin models. In this case, we provide numerical evidence that the circuit depth of our algorithm is polynomial in $N$ for all eigenstates, despite the models being interacting.</description>

      <title>Extracting energy via bosonic Gaussian operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics is often formulated as a theory with constrained access to operations and resources. In this manuscript, we find a closed formula for the Gaussian ergotropy, i.e. the maximum energy that can be extracted from bosonic systems governed by quadratic Hamiltonians by means of Gaussian unitaries only. This formula resembles the well-known eigenvalue-based expression for the standard ergotropy, but is instead formulated using symplectic eigenvalues. We further prove that the Gaussian ergotropy is additive, indicating that the multiple-copy scenario does not benefit from Gaussian entangling operations. Extending our analysis to the relationship between ergotropic and entropic functions, we establish bounds linking entropic measures of Gaussianity to extractable work. Finally, we generalise our framework to open systems by studying the optimal state preparation that minimises the energy output in a Gaussian channel.</description>

      <title>Quantum enhanced parameter estimation with monitored quantum nonequilibrium systems using inefficient photo detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body quantum systems hosting emergent collective behavior bear the promise to enable quantum enhanced parameter estimation. Formally this means that the variance of the parameter to be estimated decreases faster than $N^{-1}$, where $N$ is the number of particles forming the quantum system. In practice such scaling is challenging to achieve as the underlying many-body correlations are fragile. Moreover, devising the optimal measurements that indeed tap the quantum enhancement is often rather involved. Here we show that the inefficient detection of the photo emission from a dissipative quantum many-body system is sufficient to reach quantum enhanced parameter estimation even when some loss channels remain completely unmonitored. We illustrate our approach by considering the so-called boundary time-crystal, which is a nonequilibrium many-body system that has been realized recently experimentally in cold atomic gases. By analyzing the structure of the temporal correlations of its emission field, we are able to construct a family of near optimal parameter estimation measurements with a simple interferometric setup.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum circuits with restricted quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is one of the most fundamental objectives in quantum information science to understand the boundary between the computational power of classical and quantum computers. One possible avenue to explore this boundary is to identify classes of quantum circuits that can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer. Instead of simulating a general quantum circuit with a classical device, new schemes have recently emerged to simulate them on a quantum device that is restricted in some manner. As such, these techniques allow us to study how the restrictions impact the computational power of the device. One such technique is called quasiprobability simulation (QPS) and it estimates the result of a quantum circuit with a Monte Carlo procedure that randomly replaces circuit elements with ones that can be executed on the restricted quantum device.
  The main focus of this thesis is dedicated to the QPS-based simulation of nonlocal quantum computation using local quantum operations. On the practical side, this enables the simulation of large quantum circuits using multiple smaller quantum devices - a procedure that is sometimes called circuit knitting. We uncover a rich mathematical formalism with many connections to the resource theory of entanglement. We characterize the optimal simulation overhead for a broad range of practically relevant nonlocal states and channels and we explicitly provide achieving protocols. Moreover, we also investigate the utility of classical communication between the local parties. Our results address both the single-shot and asymptotic regime.
  We frame QPS in a quantum resource theoretic framework, which highlights similarities that arise in the different instantiations of the technique. Furthermore, we study the importance of classical side information in the QPS procedure and how it impacts the overhead and expressibility of QPS.</description>

Abstract: It is argued the the idea of a single temperature-like variable, introduced in [1], which enters a generalized second law for Markovian open system in non-equilibrium environment is not sufficient for a consistent and useful thermodynamic formalism. The origin of the Second Law and ``local temperatures'' in Markovian theory of Quantum Open Systems is revisited and illustrated by simple examples.</description>

      <title>Probing cellular activity via charge-sensitive quantum nanoprobes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) based quantum sensors hold great potential for real-time single-cell sensing with far-reaching applications in fundamental biology and medical diagnostics. Although highly sensitive, the mapping of quantum measurements onto cellular physiological states has remained an exceptional challenge. Here we introduce a novel quantum sensing modality capable of detecting changes in cellular activity. Our approach is based on the detection of environment-induced charge depletion within an individual particle that, owing to a previously unaccounted transverse dipole term, induces systematic shifts in the zero-field splitting (ZFS). Importantly, these charge-induced shifts serve as a reliable indicator for lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-mediated inflammatory response in macrophages. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surface modification of our diamond nanoprobes effectively suppresses these environment-induced ZFS shifts, providing an important tool for differentiating electrostatic shifts caused by the environment from other unrelated effects, such as temperature variations. Notably, this surface modification also leads to significant reductions in particle-induced toxicity and inflammation. Our findings shed light on systematic drifts and sensitivity limits of NV spectroscopy in a biological environment with ramification on the critical discussion surrounding single-cell thermogenesis. Notably, this work establishes the foundation for a novel sensing modality capable of probing complex cellular processes through straightforward physical measurements.</description>

      <title>What quantum matter tells about quantisation of gravity in a statistical mechanics context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a "guide" towards quantisation of gravity based on quantum matter in a statistical mechanics context. On one hand, a statistical mechanics model naturally arises from the thermodynamic interpretation of horizons in Rindler space. On the other hand, the path integral formulation of quantum field theory can be interpreted from the point of view of statistical mechanics. From these perspectives, gravity and matter are related to each other in the same way as a gas and its chemical potential are. This statistical mechanics interpretation of gravity and matter suggests that gravity should be quantised in a precise way which is determined by the quantisation of matter. Although, in a first step, quantisation of gravity applies for small perturbations of the metric with respect to the vacuum, the most central and general features of quantisation (quantisation prescription, quantum space dimensions) are supported from statistical mechanics and remain valid non-perturbatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic approach to quantum field theory focuses on the properties of local algebras, whereas the study of (possibly non-invertible) global symmetries emphasizes global aspects of the theory and spacetime. We study connections between these two perspectives by examining how either of two core algebraic properties -- "additivity" or "Haag duality" -- is violated in a 1+1D CFT or lattice model restricted to the symmetric sector of a general global symmetry. For the Verlinde symmetry of a bosonic diagonal RCFT, we find that additivity is violated whenever the symmetry algebra contains an invertible element, while Haag duality is violated whenever it contains a non-invertible element. We find similar phenomena for the Kramers-Wannier and Rep(D$_8$) non-invertible symmetries on spin chains.</description>

      <title>Atomic Josephson Parametric Amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a driven atomic Josephson junction that we propose as a parametric amplifier. By periodically modulating the position of the barrier, we induce a small current across the junction, serving as our input signal. The pump field is implemented by modulating the barrier height at twice the Josephson plasma frequency. The resulting dynamics exhibit parametric amplification of the signal through nonlinear mixing between the signal and pump fields, which is reflected by specific patterns of density waves and phase excitations. We employ a classical-field dynamics method and benchmark our results against driven circuit dynamics. This work paves the way for tunable quantum amplifiers in atomtronic circuits, with potential applications in several fields including precision measurements and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Constraint Generation Framework for Binary Linear Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to utilize quantum computers for binary linear programming (BLP), which can be extended to general integer linear programs (ILP). Quantum optimization algorithms, hybrid or quantum-only, are currently general purpose, standalone solvers for ILP. However, to consider them practically useful, we expect them to overperform the current state of the art classical solvers. That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in classical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different algorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is the approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions. In this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a quantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our problem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for the quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state of the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the initial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce to the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the initial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again, until we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since one can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single step, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum optimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small scale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.</description>

Abstract: We establish an inequality restricting the evolution of states in quantum field theory with respect to the modular flow of a wedge, $\Delta^{is}$, for large $|s|$. Our bound is related to the quantum null energy condition, QNEC. In one interpretation, it can be seen as providing a ``chaos-bound'' $\le 2\pi$ on the Lyapunov exponent with respect to Rindler time, $s$. Mathematically, our inequality is a statement about half-sided modular inclusions of von Neumann algebras.</description>

      <title>A Contextual Approach to Technological Understanding and Its Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological understanding is not a singular concept but varies depending on the context. Building on De Jong and De Haro's (2025) notion of technological understanding as the ability to realise an aim by using a technological artefact, this paper further refines the concept as an ability that varies by context and degree. We extend its original specification for a design context by introducing two additional contexts: operation and innovation. Each context represents a distinct way of realising an aim through technology, resulting in three types (specifications) of technological understanding. To further clarify the nature of technological understanding, we propose an assessment framework based on counterfactual reasoning. Each type of understanding is associated with the ability to answer a specific set of what-if questions, addressing changes in an artefact's structure, performance, or appropriateness. Explicitly distinguishing these different types helps to focus efforts to improve technological understanding, clarifies the epistemic requirements for different forms of engagement with technology, and promotes a pluralistic perspective on expertise.</description>

      <title>Gauging $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries of Narain CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gauging of a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry in lattice conformal field theories (CFTs), also known as Narain CFTs. For prime $N$, we derive a spin selection rule for operators in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ charge-twisted sector of a general bosonic CFT. Using this result, we formulate the gauging procedures in lattice CFTs as modifications of the momentum lattices by a lattice vector that specifies a non-anomalous $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry. Applying this formulation to code CFTs, i.e., Narain CFTs constructed from error-correcting codes, we express the torus partition functions of the orbifolded and parafermionized theories in terms of the weight enumerator polynomials of the underlying codes. As an application, we identify a class of codes that yield self-dual bosonic CFTs under the orbifolding by a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Amplifying solid-state high harmonic generations with momentum k-gaps in band structure engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel amplification mechanism for high harmonic generation (HHG) in solids by leveraging bandgap engineering with momentum k-gaps. By constructing a simple diatomic lattice featuring balanced, alternating gain and loss profiles, facilitated by an array of four-level systems, we explore the physics of k-gap-amplified Bloch oscillations in the intraband channel of solid-state HHG. Through numerical simulations, we elucidate the coexistence of amplification and harmonic radiation processes in a solid. Our finding reveals that advanced bandgap engineering can define k-space optical devices - such as Brillouin cavity, Bloch-Zener oscillator and k-gap amplifier - thereby enabling the coherent manipulation of semiconductor radiation and high harmonic generation in both semiconductor superlattices and artificial materials. Furthermore, we analyze the spectrogram and material realizations required for amplifying solid-state HHG. These results underscore the potential of k-gap band structure engineering to advance coherent light sources at extremely short wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure dimensionality of the quantum-critical ferromagnet YbNi$_4$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is the first known ferromagnetic metal showing a second-order quantum phase transition. Current theoretical understanding rules out second order ferromagnetic quantum criticality in centrosymmetric 2D and 3D metals. Thus, studying the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is of prime fundamental importance. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we experimentally prove the existence of 1D Fermi surface contours. In addition, our results demonstrate that part of the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is made of states of higher dimensionality, thereby bringing into question the fact that ferromagnetic quantum criticality in centrosymmetric crystals, is exclusively found in 1D systems. Our experimental data show that the electronic structure of YbNi$_4$P$_2$ is a playground of mixed dimensionality, electron correlations, strong hybridization and spin-orbit coupling, all of them providing new insights in understanding the origin of ferromagnetic quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Extracting Coupling-Mode Spectral Densities with Two-Dimensional Electronic Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for reconstructing the spectral density of a vibrational environment from experimental data can yield key insights into the impact of the environment on molecular function. Although such experimental methods exist, they generally only access vibrational modes that couple diagonally to the electron system. Here we present a method for extracting the spectral density of modes that couple to the transition between electronic states, using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To demonstrate this, we use a process-tensor method that can simulate two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy measurements in a numerically exact way. To explain how the extraction works, we also derive an approximate analytical solution, which illustrates that the non-Markovianity of the environment plays an essential role in the existence of the simulated signal.</description>

      <title>Dissipative protection of a GKP qubit in a high-impedance superconducting circuit driven by a microwave frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01425v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to generate, protect and control GKP qubits. It employs a microwave frequency comb parametrically modulating a Josephson circuit to enforce a dissipative dynamics of a high impedance circuit mode, autonomously stabilizing the finite-energy GKP code. The encoded GKP qubit is robustly protected against all dominant decoherence channels plaguing superconducting circuits but quasi-particle poisoning. In particular, noise from ancillary modes leveraged for dissipation engineering does not propagate at the logical level. In a state-of-the-art experimental setup, we estimate that the encoded qubit lifetime could extend two orders of magnitude beyond the break-even point, with substantial margin for improvement through progress in fabrication and control electronics. Qubit initialization, readout and control via Clifford gates can be performed while maintaining the code stabilization, paving the way toward the assembly of GKP qubits in a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical information loading is an essential task for many processing quantum algorithms, constituting a cornerstone in the field of quantum machine learning. In particular, the embedding techniques based on Hamiltonian simulation techniques enable the loading of matrices into quantum computers. A representative example of these methods is the Lloyd-Mohseni-Rebentrost protocol, which efficiently implements matrix exponentiation when multiple copies of a quantum state are available. However, this is a quite ideal set up, and in a realistic scenario, the copies are limited and the non-cloning theorem prevents from producing more exact copies in order to increase the accuracy of the protocol. Here, we propose a method to circumvent this limitation by introducing imperfect quantum copies, which significantly improve the performance of the LMR when the eigenvectors are known.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting of circularly accelerated detectors with a reflecting boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of the transition probability for a circularly accelerated detector that interacts with the massless scalar fields in the presence of a reflecting boundary. As the trajectory radius increases, the transition probability may exhibit some peaks under specific conditions, which can lead to the possibility of the identical result for different trajectory radius with the same acceleration and energy gap. These behaviors can be characterized by certain critical values. Furthermore, we analyze the entanglement harvesting phenomenon for two circularly accelerated detectors with a boundary. We consider that the two detectors are rotating around a common axis with the same acceleration, trajectory radius and angular velocity. When the detectors are close to the boundary, there may exist two peaks in entanglement harvesting. Interestingly, as trajectory radius increases, entanglement harvesting in some situations first decreases to zero, then remains zero, and finally increases to a stable value. Our results show that the features observed properties of the detectors are closely related to the vacuum fluctuations of the field and states of the detectors. Under appropriate conditions, circular motion can be used to simulate the results of uniform acceleration.</description>

      <title>General protocols for the efficient distillation of indistinguishable photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14217v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce state-of-the-art protocols to distill indistinguishable photons, reducing distinguishability error rates by a factor of $n$, while using a modest amount of resources scaling only linearly in $n$. Our resource requirements are both significantly lower and have fewer hardware requirements than previous works, making large-scale distillation experimentally feasible for the first time. This efficient reduction of distinguishability error rates has direct applications to fault-tolerant linear optical quantum computation, potentially leading to improved thresholds for photon loss errors and allowing smaller code distances, thus reducing overall resource costs. Our protocols are based on Fourier transforms on finite abelian groups, special cases of which include the discrete Fourier transform and Hadamard matrices. This general perspective allows us to unify previous results on distillation protocols and introduce a large family of efficient schemes. We utilize the rich mathematical structure of Fourier transforms, including symmetries and related suppression laws, to quantify the performance of these distillation protocols both analytically and numerically. Finally, our work resolves an open question concerning suppression laws for the $n$-photon discrete Fourier transform: the suppression laws are exactly characterized by the well-known Zero Transmission Law if and only if $n$ is a prime power.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking the performance of a high-Q cavity qudit using random unitaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-coherence cavity resonators are excellent resources for encoding quantum information in higher-dimensional Hilbert spaces, moving beyond traditional qubit-based platforms. A natural strategy is to use the Fock basis to encode information in qudits. One can perform quantum operations on the cavity mode qudit by coupling the system to a non-linear ancillary transmon qubit. However, the performance of the cavity-transmon device is limited by the noisy transmons. It is, therefore, important to develop practical benchmarking tools for these qudit systems in an algorithm-agnostic manner. We gauge the performance of these qudit platforms using sampling tests such as the Heavy Output Generation (HOG) test as well as the linear Cross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB), by way of simulations of such a system subject to realistic dominant noise channels. We use selective number-dependent arbitrary phase and unconditional displacement gates as our universal gateset. Our results show that contemporary transmons comfortably enable controlling a few tens of Fock levels of a cavity mode. This framework allows benchmarking even higher dimensional qudits as those become accessible with improved transmons.</description>

      <title>Loop Series Expansions for Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) can be a useful tool to approximately contract a tensor network, provided that the contributions from any closed loops in the network are sufficiently weak. In this manuscript we describe how a loop series expansion can be applied to systematically improve the accuracy of a BP approximation to a tensor network contraction, in principle converging arbitrarily close to the exact result. More generally, our result provides a framework for expanding a tensor network as a sum of component networks in a hierarchy of increasing complexity. We benchmark this proposal for the contraction of iPEPS, either representing the ground state of an AKLT model or with randomly defined tensors, where it is shown to improve in accuracy over standard BP by several orders of magnitude whilst incurring only a minor increase in computational cost. These results indicate that the proposed series expansions could be a useful tool to accurately evaluate tensor networks in cases that otherwise exceed the limits of established contraction routines.</description>

      <title>Robust Noise Suppression and Quantum Sensing by Continuous Phased Dynamical Decoupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate experimentally continuous phased dynamical decoupling (CPDD), where we apply a continuous field with discrete phase changes for quantum sensing and robust compensation of environmental and amplitude noise. CPDD does not use short pulses, making it particularly suitable for experiments with limited driving power or nuclear magnetic resonance at high magnetic fields. It requires control of the timing of the phase changes, offering much greater precision than the Rabi frequency control needed in standard continuous sensing schemes. We successfully apply our method to nanoscale nuclear magnetic resonance and combine it with quantum heterodyne detection, achieving microhertz uncertainty in the estimated signal frequency for a 120 s measurement. Our Letter expands significantly the applicability of dynamical decoupling and opens the door for a wide range of experiments, e.g., in nitrogen-vacancy centers, trapped ions, or trapped atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) probe the nonequilibrium evolution of quantum systems, unveiling their geometric and topological characteristics. In this study, we introduce the concepts of parallel quench and dynamic geometrical order parameter (DGOP) for non-band models, where these quantities capture the geometric shifts associated with DQPTs. At zero temperature, the DGOP corresponds to the Pancharatnam geometric phase, while at finite temperatures, it extends to the interferometric geometric phase. We further generalize the dynamic topological order parameter (DTOP) to finite-temperature band models, examining its behavior in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our analysis shows that thermal fluctuations and boundary effects at finite temperatures disrupt the quantization of the DTOP, yet it retains signatures of topological transitions. These findings deepen the understanding of geometric and topological properties in quantum dynamics, illuminating DQPTs across both non-band and band frameworks.</description>

Abstract: We provide a solution for decoherence in spatial superpositions due to scattering/collision with air molecules. This result reproduces the short- and long-wavelength limits known in the literature. We compare the decoherence rate with several existing interpolations in the literature and evaluate the decoherence rate and experimental parameters when creating macroscopic quantum spatial superpositions (i.e., micron-size spheres). Finally, we consider the decoherence rate's time dependence while creating and closing the spatial superposition in an interferometer setup.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02087v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, measurement-induced entanglement transitions (MIET) have attracted significant attention. However, the dynamical transition associated with the feedback-induced skin effect, which exhibits a wealth of intriguing phenomena, has not been fully understood. In this work, we investigate a dynamical phase transition in a tilted free-fermion chain under measurement-feedback protocols, emphasizing particle density and entanglement entropy dynamics. We reveal a feedback-induced skin effect, enhanced by the Wannier-Stark ladder potential, which creates localization at one boundary and generates an effective pseudo-edge under periodic conditions. The observables show a two-stage evolution: a rapid initial logarithmic growth followed by decay into an area-law steady state. Using finite-size scaling analysis, we pinpoint the critical transition and provide an intuitive physical picture linking it to feedback-driven suppression of quantum jump fluctuations. While the Wannier-Stark ladder delays relaxation without changing universality, strong gradients can directly induce area-law entanglement, bypassing the dynamical transition. This work provides a effective supplement to the dynamical transition proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 090401 (2024). It provides valuable references for linking the dynamical understanding of the role feedback plays in MIET.</description>

Abstract: The Stern-Gerlach (SG) experiment is a fundamental experiment for revealing the existence of ``spin''. In such an experiment, beams of silver atoms were sent through inhomogeneous magnetic fields to observe their deflection. Thus, the conventional SG experiment can be actually viewed as a magnetic-type spin effect. In this work, we successfully generalize the SG effect from magnetic-type to electric-type by solving Dirac's equation with a potential barrier, thus revealing an extraordinary spin effect. Beams of Dirac's particles can be regarded as matter waves. Based on Dirac's equation, we obtain the explicit forms of the incident, reflected, and transmitted waves. The electric-type SG effect shows that the reflected and transmitted waves can have notable spatial shifts, which depend on the spin direction and the incident angle of incident wave. The electric-type SG effect has potential applications to separating Dirac's particles with different spin directions and to estimating the spin direction of Dirac's particles. Some discussions related to the interaction between spin and electric field are also made.</description>

Abstract: Uhlmann's theorem states that, for any two quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ and $\sigma_A$, there exists an extension $\sigma_{AB}$ of $\sigma_A$ such that the fidelity between $\rho_{AB}$ and $\sigma_{AB}$ equals the fidelity between their reduced states $\rho_A$ and $\sigma_A$. In this work, we generalize Uhlmann's theorem to $\alpha$-R\'enyi relative entropies for $\alpha \in [\frac{1}{2},\infty]$, a family of divergences that encompasses fidelity, relative entropy, and max-relative entropy corresponding to $\alpha=\frac{1}{2}$, $\alpha=1$, and $\alpha=\infty$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: High-dimensional entanglement in qudit states offers a promising pathway towards the realization of practical, large-scale quantum systems that are highly controllable. These systems can be leveraged for various applications, including advanced quantum information processing, secure communications, computation, and metrology. In this context, quantum frequency combs have a crucial role as they inherently support multiple modes in both temporal and frequency domains, while preserving a single spatial mode. The multiple temporal and frequency modes of quantum frequency combs facilitate the generation, characterization, and control of high-dimensional time-frequency entanglement in extensive quantum systems. In this review article, we provide an overview of recent technological advancements in high-dimensional energy-time entangled quantum frequency combs. We explore how these time-frequency qudits, achieved using scalable telecommunications-wavelength components, can empower the creation of large-scale quantum states. Advances in quantum frequency combs can unlock new capabilities and versatility for promising developments in quantum science and technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive bounds on general quantum error correcting codes against the displacement noise channel. The bounds limit the distances attainable by codes and also apply in an approximate setting. Our main result is a quantum analogue of the classical Cohn-Elkies bound on sphere packing densities attainable in Euclidean space. We further derive a quantum version of Levenshtein's sphere packing bound and argue that Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill (GKP) codes based on the $E_8$ and Leech lattices achieve optimal distances. The main technical tool is a continuous-variable version of the quantum MacWilliams identities, which we introduce. The identities relate a pair of weight distributions which can be obtained for any two trace-class operators. General properties of these weight distributions are discussed, along with several examples.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum thermalizers based on weakly-symmetric nonunitary multi-qubit operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose incorporating multi-qubit nonunitary operations in Variational Quantum Thermalizers (VQTs). VQTs are hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that generate the thermal (Gibbs) state of a given Hamiltonian, with applications in quantum algorithms and simulations. However, current algorithms struggle at intermediate temperatures, where the target state is nonpure but exhibits entanglement. We devise multi-qubit nonunitary operations that harness weak symmetries and thereby improve the performance of the algorithm. Utilizing dissipation engineering, we create these nonunitary multi-qubit operations without the need for measurements or additional qubits. To train the ansatz, we develop and benchmark novel methods for entropy estimation of quantum states, expanding the toolbox for quantum state characterization. We demonstrate that our approach can prepare thermal states of paradigmatic spin models at all temperatures. Our work thus creates new opportunities for simulating open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Observation of the quantum equivalence principle for matter-waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence - in essence, dating back to Galileo - which asserts that, locally, the effect of a gravitational field is equivalent to that of an accelerating reference frame, so that the local gravitational field is eliminated in a freely-falling frame. Einstein's theory enables this principle to extend to a global description of relativistic space-time, at the expense of allowing space-time to become curved, realising a consistent frame-independent description of nature at the classical level. Einstein's theory has been confirmed to great accuracy for astrophysical bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase that is observable if the wavefunction - fundamental to quantum descriptions - allows an object to interfere with itself after being simultaneously at rest in two differently accelerating frames, one being the laboratory (Newtonian) frame and the other in the freely-falling (Einsteinian) frame. To measure this gauge phase we realise a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. We follow the relative-phase evolution of the wave packets in the two frames, confirming the equivalence principle in the quantum domain. Our observation is yet another fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is argued from several points of view that quantum probabilities might play a role in statistical settings. New approaches toward quantum foundations have postulates that appear to be equally valid in macroscopic settings. One such approach is described here in detail, while one other is briefly sketched. In particular, arguments behind the Born rule, which gives the basis for quantum probabilities, are given. A list of ideas for possible statistical applications of quantum probabilities is provided and discussed. A particular area is machine learning, where there exists substantial literature on links to quantum probability. Here, an idea about model reduction is sketched and is motivated from a quantum probability model. Quantum models can play a role in model reduction, where the partial least squares regression model is a special case. It is shown that for certain experiments, a Bayesian prior given by a quantum probability can be motivated. Quantum decision theory is an emerging discipline that can be motivated by this author's theory of quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Error bounds for composite quantum hypothesis testing and a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optimal error exponents of binary composite i.i.d. state discrimination are trivially bounded by the worst-case pairwise exponents of discriminating individual elements of the sets representing the two hypotheses, and in the finite-dimensional classical case, these bounds in fact give exact single-copy expressions for the error exponents. In contrast, in the non-commutative case, the optimal exponents are only known to be expressible in terms of regularized divergences, resulting in formulas that, while conceptually relevant, practically not very useful. In this paper, we develop further an approach initiated in [Mosonyi, Szil\'agyi, Weiner, IEEE Trans. Inf. Th. 68(2):1032--1067, 2022] to give improved single-copy bounds on the error exponents by comparing not only individual states from the two hypotheses, but also various unnormalized positive semi-definite operators associated to them. Here, we show a number of equivalent characterizations of such operators giving valid bounds, and show that in the commutative case, considering weighted geometric means of the states, and in the case of two states per hypothesis, considering weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means, are optimal for this approach. As a result, we give a new characterization of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means as the only $2$-variable operator geometric means that are block additive, tensor multiplicative, and satisfy the arithmetic-geometric mean inequality. We also extend our results to composite quantum channel discrimination, and show an analogous optimality property of the weighted Kubo-Ando geometric means of two quantum channels, a notion that seems to be new. We extend this concept to defining the notion of superoperator perspective function and establish some of its basic properties, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for a universal digital quantum computer with an application to the Grover-Rudolph algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: We present a general framework for generating single- and multimode qubit-conditional operations by extending cross-resonant driving to a generalized multimode scheme. This includes single-mode conditional displacements and squeezing induced by one- and two-photon cross-resonant drives in the presence of one- and two-photon qubit-oscillator interactions, respectively. In the multimode setting, we derive multimode qubit-conditional beamsplitter and two-mode squeezing operations. We highlight their significance for bosonic quantum computing and quantum simulations. We also discuss possible implementations with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>QCPINN: Quantum Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving PDEs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as promising methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural architectures. However, these classical approaches often require large number of parameters for solving complex problems or achieving reasonable accuracy. We investigate whether quantum-enhanced architectures can achieve comparable performance while significantly reducing model complexity. We propose a quantum-classical physics-informed neural network (QCPINN) combining quantum and classical components to solve PDEs with fewer parameters while maintaining comparable accuracy and training convergence. Our approach systematically evaluates two quantum circuit paradigms (e.g., continuous-variable (CV) and discrete-variable (DV)) implementations with four circuit topologies (e.g., alternate, cascade, cross-mesh, and layered), two embedding schemes (e.g., amplitude and angle) on five benchmark PDEs (e.g., Helmholtz, lid-driven cavity, wave, Klein-Gordon, and convection-diffusion equations). Results demonstrate that QCPINNs achieve comparable accuracy to classical PINNs while requiring approximately 10% trainable parameters across different PDEs, and resulting in a further 40% reduction in relative L2 error for the convection-diffusion equation. DV-based circuits with angle embedding and cascade configurations consistently exhibited enhanced convergence stability across all problem types. Our finding establishes parameter efficiency as a quantifiable quantum advantage in physics-informed machine learning. By significantly reducing model complexity while maintaining solution quality, QCPINNs represent a potential direction for overcoming computational bottlenecks in scientific computing applications where traditional approaches require large parameter spaces.</description>

      <title>A Multilevel Framework for Partitioning Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Executing quantum algorithms over distributed quantum systems requires quantum circuits to be divided into sub-circuits which communicate via entanglement-based teleportation. Naively mapping circuits to qubits over multiple quantum processing units (QPUs) results in large communication overhead, increasing both execution time and noise. This can be minimised by optimising the assignment of qubits to QPUs and the methods used for covering non-local operations. Formulations which are general enough to capture the spectrum of teleportation possibilities lead to complex problem instances which can be difficult to solve effectively. This highlights a need to exploit the wide range of heuristic techniques used in the graph partitioning literature. This paper formalises and extends existing constructions for graphical quantum circuit partitioning and designs a new objective function which captures further possibilities for non-local operations via nested state teleportation. We adapt the well-known Fiduccia-Mattheyses heuristic to the constraints and problem objective and explore multilevel techniques which coarsen hypergraphs and partition at multiple levels of granularity. We find that this reduces runtime and improves solution quality of standard partitioning. We place these techniques within a larger framework, through which we can extract full distributed quantum circuits including teleportation instructions. We compare the entanglement requirements and runtimes with state-of-the-art methods, finding that we can achieve the lowest entanglement costs in most cases, while always being close to the best performing method. We achieve an average improvement of 35% over the next best performing method across a wide range of circuits. We also find that our techniques can scale to much larger circuit sizes than state-of-the-art methods, provided the number of partitions is not too large.</description>

Abstract: The realization of quantum networks requires the development of robust low size, weight and power (SWaP) systems suitable for operation under harsh environments in remote and mobile nodes such as satellites. We present a source of polarization-entangled photon-pairs in a folded linear displacement interferometer based on spontaneous parametric down conversion using a Type-0 periodically poled potassium titanyl phosphate crystal. Featuring a compact and stable double-pass geometry using a corner-cube retroreflector, the source has a detected pair rate of 2.5 M pairs/s/mW with a Bell state fidelity of 94.1% +/- 2.1%. The qualities and demonstrated performance of the source make it suitable for deployment in entanglement-based quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: In an isolated quantum many-body system undergoing unitary evolution, the entropy of a subsystem (smaller than half the system size) thermalizes if at long times, it is to leading order equal to the thermodynamic entropy of the subsystem at the same energy. In this paper, we prove entropy thermalization for a nearly integrable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model initialized in a pure product state. The model is obtained by adding random all-to-all $4$-body interactions as a perturbation to a random free-fermion model.</description>

      <title>Deterministic identification over channels with finite output: a dimensional perspective on superlinear rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09117v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following initial work by JaJa, Ahlswede and Cai, and inspired by a recent renewed surge in interest in deterministic identification (DI) via noisy channels, we consider the problem in its generality for memoryless channels with finite output, but arbitrary input alphabets. Such a channel is essentially given by its output distributions as a subset in the probability simplex. Our main findings are that the maximum length of messages thus identifiable scales superlinearly as $R\,n\log n$ with the block length $n$, and that the optimal rate $R$ is bounded in terms of the covering (aka Minkowski, or Kolmogorov, or entropy) dimension $d$ of a certain algebraic transformation of the output set: $\frac14 d \leq R \leq \frac12 d$. Remarkably, both the lower and upper Minkowski dimensions play a role in this result. Along the way, we present a "Hypothesis Testing Lemma" showing that it is sufficient to ensure pairwise reliable distinguishability of the output distributions to construct a DI code. Although we do not know the exact capacity formula, we can conclude that the DI capacity exhibits superactivation: there exist channels whose capacities individually are zero, but whose product has positive capacity. We also generalise these results to classical-quantum channels with finite-dimensional output quantum system, in particular to quantum channels on finite-dimensional quantum systems under the constraint that the identification code can only use tensor product inputs.</description>

      <title>Kondo-Zeno crossover in the dynamics of a monitored quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuously monitoring a quantum system can strongly affect its properties and even suppress its coherent evolution via the Quantum Zeno effect. Well understood for few body quantum systems, the role of quantum measurements on entangled many-body states is still largely unexplored. Here we focus on one of the simplest entangled many-body state, arising via the Kondo effect in a strongly interacting quantum dot coupled to a metallic bath, and investigate the effect of continuous monitoring of the dot total charge. We show that the decay rate of an initially polarized spin displays a crossover from Kondo screening, with a decay rate controlled by interactions, to Quantum Zeno effect, with a decay rate which decreases with bare dissipation as the monitoring rate is increased. Remarkably we show that the long-lived Kondo state is robust to weak dissipation, as further confirmed by the dot spectral function which features a clear Kondo peak at finite dissipation, even in a regime where charge fluctuations and the associated Hubbard bands have been quenched by the monitoring protocol. We derive an effective model for the long-time dynamics which is described, at weak dissipation, by a non-Hermitian Kondo model with complex-valued spin exchange which is known to host exotic low-energy physics and a dissipative phase transition between Kondo and non-Kondo steady-state. Finally, as the dephasing is increased heating due to doublon production takes over and control the spin decay.</description>

      <title>Resilience of the quantum critical line in the Schmid transition</title>

Abstract: Schmid predicted that a single Josephson junction coupled to a resistive environment undergoes a quantum phase transition to an insulating phase when the shunt resistance $R$ exceeds the resistance quantum $h/(4 e^ 2)$. Recent measurements and theoretical studies have sparked a debate on whether the location of this transition depends on the ratio between the Josephson and the charging energies. We employ a combination of multiple innovative analytical and numerical techniques, never before explicitly applied to this problem, to decisively demonstrate that the transition line between superconducting and insulating behavior is indeed independent of this energy ratio. First, we apply field-theory renormalization group methods and find that the $\beta$ function vanishes along the critical line up to the third order in the Josephson energy. We then identify a simple fermionic model that precisely captures the low-energy physics on the critical line, regardless of the energy ratio. This conformally invariant fermionic model is verified by comparing the expected spectrum with exact diagonalization calculations of the resistively shunted Josephson junction, showing excellent agreement even for moderate system sizes. Importantly, this identification provides a rigorous non-perturbative proof that the transition line is maintained at $R=h/(4 e^ 2)$ for all ratios of Josephson to charging energies. The line is further resilient to other ultraviolet cutoffs such as the plasma frequency of the resistive environment. Finally, we implement an adiabatic approach to validate the duality at large Josephson energy.</description>

      <title>Quantized Area of the Schwarzschild Black Hole: A non-Hermitian Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, our aim is to link Bekenstein's quantized form of the area of the event horizon to the Hamiltonian of the non-Hermitian Swanson oscillator which is known to be $\mathbb{PT}$-symmetric. We achieve this by employing a similarity transformation that maps the non-Hermitian quantum system to a scaled harmonic oscillator. Our procedure is standard and well known. We, first of all, consider the unconstrained reduced Hamiltonian which is directly expressed in terms of the Schwarzschild mass and implies a periodic character for the conjugate momentum (which represents the asymptotic time coordinate), the period being the inverse Hawking temperature. This leads to the quantization of the event-horizon area in terms of the harmonic-oscillator levels. Within the framework of the Swanson oscillator, we proceed to derive novel expressions for the Hawking temperature and the black hole entropy. Notably, the logarithmic area-correction term -(1/2)$\ln$(area) is consistent with our results whereas -(3/2) $\ln$(area) is not.</description>

      <title>Fast, Accurate, and Local Temperature Control Using Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many quantum technologies, including quantum computers, quantum heat engines, and quantum sensors, rely on operating conditions in the subkelvin regime. It is therefore desirable to develop practical tools and methods for the precise control of the temperature in nanoscale quantum systems. Here, we present a proposal for fast, accurate, and local temperature control using qubits, which regulate the flow of heat between a quantum system and its thermal environment. The qubits are kept in a thermal state with a temperature that is controlled in an interplay between work done on the qubits by changing their energy splittings and the flow of heat between the qubits and the environment. Using only a few qubits, it is possible to control the thermal environment of another quantum system, which can be heated or cooled by the qubits. As an example, we show how a quantum system at subkelvin temperatures can be significantly and accurately cooled on a nanosecond timescale. Our proposal can potentially be realized with superconducting flux qubits, charge qubits, or spin qubits, which can now be fabricated and manipulated with exquisite control.</description>

      <title>Ring-exchange physics in a chain of three-level ions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the presence of ring exchange interactions, bosons in a ladder-like lattice may form the bosonic analogon of a correlated metal, known as the d-wave Bose liquid (DBL). In this paper, we show that a chain of trapped ions with three internal levels can mimic a ladder-like system constrained to a maximum occupation of one boson per rung. The setup enables tunable ring exchange interactions, transitioning between a polarized regime with all bosons confined to one leg and the DBL regime. The latter state is characterized by a splitting of the peak in the momentum distribution and an oscillating pair correlation function.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fisher Information Reveals UV-IR Mixing in the Strange Metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density-density response in optimally doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ has recently been shown to exhibit conformal symmetry. Using, the experimentally inferred conformal dynamic susceptibility, we compute the resultant quantum Fisher information (QFI), a witness to multi-partite entanglement. For a Fermi liquid, we find that the QFI grows quadratically as the temperature increases, consistent then with the phase space available for scattering in the standard theory of metals. By contrast, the QFI in a strange metal increases as a power law at as the temperature decreases, but ultimately extrapolates to a constant at $T=0$. The constant is of the form, $\omega_g^{2\Delta}$, where $\Delta$ is the conformal dimension and $\omega_g$ is the UV cutoff which is on the order of the pseudogap. As this constant {depends on both UV and IR properties}, it illustrates that multipartite entanglement in a strange metal exhibits UV-IR mixing, a benchmark feature of doped Mott insulators as exemplified by dynamical spectral weight transfer. We conclude with a discussion of the implication of our results for low-energy reductions of the Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Capturing strong correlation effects on a quantum annealer: calculation of avoided crossing in the H$_4$ molecule using the quantum annealer eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We broaden the scope of the Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm, an underexplored noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era approach for calculating atomic and molecular properties, to predict avoided crossings, where strong correlation effects are at play. For this purpose, we consider the classic example of the H$_4$ molecule in a rectangular geometry. Our results are obtained on the 5000-qubit D-Wave Advantage system 4.1 quantum computer. We benchmark our quantum annealing results with full configuration interaction (FCI) as well as with those obtained using simulated annealing. We find that we can predict avoided crossings within about 1.2% of the FCI value on real quantum hardware. We carry out analyses on the effect of the number of shots, anneal time, and the choice of Lagrange multiplier on our obtained results. Since the QAE algorithm provides information on the wave function as its output, we also check the quality of the computed wave function by calculating the fidelity, and find it to be 99.886%. Finally, we qualitatively discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the QAE algorithm relative to its gate-based NISQ algorithm counterpart, the celebrated Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE).</description>

      <title>Rate-reliability functions for deterministic identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate deterministic identification over arbitrary memoryless channels under the constraint that the error probabilities of first and second kind are exponentially small in the block length $n$, controlled by reliability exponents $E_1,E_2 \geq 0$. In contrast to the regime of slowly vanishing errors, where the identifiable message length scales as $\Theta(n\log n)$, here we find that for positive exponents linear scaling is restored, now with a rate that is a function of the reliability exponents. We give upper and lower bounds on the ensuing rate-reliability function in terms of (the logarithm of) the packing and covering numbers of the channel output set, which for small error exponents $E_1,E_2&gt;0$ can be expanded in leading order as the product of the Minkowski dimension of a certain parametrisation the channel output set and $\log\min\{E_1,E_2\}$. These allow us to recover the previously observed slightly superlinear identification rates, and offer a different perspective for understanding them in more traditional information theory terms. We further illustrate our results with a discussion of the case of dimension zero, and extend them to classical-quantum channels and quantum channels with tensor product input restriction.</description>

      <title>Standalone FPGA-Based QAOA Emulator for Weighted-MaxCut on Embedded Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing QC emulation is crucial for advancing QC applications, especially given the scalability constraints of current devices. FPGA-based designs offer an efficient and scalable alternative to traditional large-scale platforms, but most are tightly integrated with high-performance systems, limiting their use in mobile and edge environments. This study introduces a compact, standalone FPGA-based QC emulator designed for embedded systems, leveraging the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve the Weighted-MaxCut problem. By restructuring QAOA operations for hardware compatibility, the proposed design reduces time complexity from O(N^2) to O(N), where N equals 2^n for n qubits. This reduction, coupled with a pipeline architecture, significantly minimizes resource consumption, enabling support for up to nine qubits on mid-tier FPGAs, roughly three times more than comparable designs. Additionally, the emulator achieved energy savings ranging from 1.53 times for two-qubit configurations to up to 852 times for nine-qubit configurations, compared to software-based QAOA on embedded processors. These results highlight the practical scalability and resource efficiency of the proposed design, providing a robust foundation for QC emulation in resource-constrained edge devices.</description>
