      <title>Covering Random Digraphs with Hamilton Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A covering of a digraph $D$ by Hamilton cycles is a collection of directed Hamilton cycles (not necessarily edge-disjoint) that together cover all the edges of $D$. We prove that for $1/2 \geq p\geq \frac{\log^{20} n}{n}$, the random digraph $D_{n,p}$ typically admits an optimal Hamilton cycle covering. Specifically, the edges of $D_{n,p}$ can be covered by a family of $t$ Hamilton cycles, where $t$ is the maximum of the the in-degree and out-degree of the vertices in $D_{n,p}$. Notably, $t$ is the best possible bound, and our assumption on $p$ is optimal up to a polylogarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Regular bipartite decompositions of pseudorandom graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1972, Kotzig proved that for every even $n$, the complete graph $K_n$ can be decomposed into $\lceil\log_2n\rceil$ edge-disjoint regular bipartite spanning subgraphs, which is best possible. In this paper, we study regular bipartite decompositions of $(n,d,\lambda)$-graphs, where $n$ is an even integer and $d_0\leq d\leq n-1$ for some absolute constant $d_0$. With a randomized algorithm, we prove that such an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph with $\lambda\leq d/12$ can be decomposed into at most $\log_2 d + 36$ regular bipartite spanning subgraphs. This is best possible up to the additive constant term. As a consequence, we also improve the best known bounds on $\lambda = \lambda(d)$ by Ferber and Jain (2020) to guarantee that an $(n,d,\lambda)$-graph on an even number of vertices admits a $1$-factorization, showing that $\lambda \leq cd$ is sufficient for some absolute constant $c &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix by studying the components of its graph. To this end, we introduce the notion of "weighted Toeplitz graph", which is a weighted graph whose adjacency matrix is a symmetric Toeplitz matrix and whose weight is the corresponding entry of the matrix. By studying the components of a weighted Toeplitz graph, we show that a Frobenius normal form of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix is a direct sum of symmetric irreducible Toeplitz matrices. We design a linear time algorithm which determines the number of blocks in a Frobenius normal form of a symmetric Toeplitz matrix. In the process of deriving results needed to design the algorithm, we contract the residue classes of a given graph to obtain a simpler graph, which is then studied using number-theoretic techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define MC left regular bands and study their adjacency graphs. We prove that for thin MC left regular bands, the adjacency graph is particularly nice and is represented by edge labeled graphs where every simple cycle has an even number of edges. Conversely, we define a set of graphs which we call thin LRB graphs which encode rank two thin MC left regular bands. Along the way, we provide a criterion for showing when the face poset of a left regular band is a meet-semilattice.</description>

      <title>Packing large balanced trees into bipartite graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every ${\gamma &gt; 0}$ there exists $n_0 \in \mathbb{N}$ such that for every ${n \geq n_0}$ any family of up to $\lfloor{n^{\frac12+\gamma}}\rfloor$ trees having at most $(1-\gamma)n$ vertices in each bipartition class can be packed into $K_{n,n}$. As a tool for our proof, we show an approximate bipartite version of the Koml\'os-S\'ark\"ozy-Szemer\'edi Theorem, which we believe to be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Spectra of eccentricity matrix of $H$-join of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varepsilon(G)$ be the eccentricity matrix of a graph $G$ and $Spec(\varepsilon(G))$ be the eccentricity spectrum of $G$. Let $H[G_1,G_2,\ldots, G_k]$ be the $H$-join of graphs $G_1,G_2,\ldots, G_k$ and let $H[G]$ be lexicographic product of $H$ and $G$. This paper finds the eccentricity matrix of a $H$-join of graphs. Using this result, we find (i) $Spec(\varepsilon(H[G]))$ in terms of $Spec(\varepsilon(H))$ if the radius $(rad(H))$ of $H$ is at least three; (ii) $Spec(\varepsilon(K_k[G_1,G_2,\ldots, G_k]))$ if $\Delta(G_i)\leq |V(G_i)|-2$ which generalises some of the results in \cite{Mahato1}; (iii) $Spec(\varepsilon(H[G_1,G_2,\ldots, G_k]))$ if $rad(H)\geq 2$ and $G_i$ is complete whenever $e_H(i)=2$, which generalises some of the results in \cite{Mahato1} and \cite{Wang1}. Finally, we find the characteristic polynomial of $\varepsilon(K_{1,m}[G_0,G_1,\ldots, G_m])$ if $G_i$'s are regular. As a result, we deduce some of the results in \cite{Li}, \cite{Mahato1}, \cite{Patel} and \cite{Wang}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of Laplacian and signless Laplacian matrix for a graph product is obtained, where both underlying graphs are regular. As an application of this, we have been able to generate the Kirchhoff Index and Wiener Index and determine the number of spanning trees. Additionally, we derived the conditions necessary for obtaining a Laplacian and signless Laplacian integral product graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a positive integer $g$, we study a family of plane graphs $G$ without cycles of length less than $g$ that are maximal in a sense that adding any new edge to $G$ either makes it non-plane or creates a cycle of length less than $g$. We show that the largest face length ${\rm f}_{\rm max}(g)$ of a 2-connected graph from this family satisfies $3g-12 \leq {\rm f}_{\rm max}(g) \leq 2(g-2)^2+1.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a non-commutative generalisation of Coxeter friezes due to Berenstein and Retakh. It generalises several earlier results to this situation: A formula for frieze determinants, a $T$-path formula expressing the Laurent phenomenon, and results on gluing friezes together. One of our tools is a non-commutative version of the weak friezes introduced by Canakci and Jorgensen.</description>

      <title>Friezes from surfaces and Farey triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a classification of positive integral friezes on marked bordered surfaces. The classification is similar to the Conway--Coxeter's one: positive integral friezes are in one-to-one correspondence with ideal triangulations supplied with a collection of rescaling constants assigned to punctures. For every triangulation the set of the collections of constants is finite and is completely determined by the valencies of vertices in the triangulation. In particular, it follows that the number of non-equivalent friezes on bordered surfaces is finite, and all friezes on unpunctured surfaces are unitary.</description>

      <title>Residue polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A level graph is the data of a pair $(G,\pi)$ consisting of a finite graph $G$ and an ordered partition $\pi$ on the set of vertices of $G$. To each level graph on $n$ vertices we associate a polytope in $\mathbb R^n$ called its residue polytope. We show that residue polytopes are compatible with each other in the sense that if $\pi'$ is a coarsening of $\pi$, then the polytope associated to $(G,\pi)$ is a face of the one associated to $(G,\pi')$. Moreover, they form all the faces of the residue polytope of $G$, defined as the polytope associated to the level graph with the trivial ordered partition. The results are used in a companion work to describe limits of spaces of Abelian differentials on families of Riemann surfaces approaching a stable Riemann surface on the boundary of the moduli space.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Rock Paper Scissors to complete directed graphs, or tournaments, on $n$ vertices. Properties of the mixed-strategy Nash equilibria of these tournaments are discussed, particularly those with Nash equilibria where all of the strategies have a nonzero probability. We find graph-theoretic properties of such games and tabulate them for $n \leq 7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in conjecturing the sign of the pizza quantity P(H,B(a,R)) for the irreducible Coxeter arrangements H of type A_n, where n=2,3 bmod 4, and type D_n, where n is odd. Our approach is to express the pizza quantity in terms of the pizza quantity of subarrangements known as 2-structures, and we obtain the first non-zero term in the multivariate Taylor expansion.</description>

      <title>Stable-limit partially symmetric Macdonald functions and parabolic flag Hilbert schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modified Macdonald functions $\widetilde{H}_{\mu}$ are fundamental objects in modern algebraic combinatorics. Haiman showed that there is a correspondence between the $(\mathbb{C}^{*})^2$-fixed points $I_{\mu}$ of the Hilbert schemes $\mathrm{Hilb}_{n}(\mathbb{C}^2)$ and the functions $\widetilde{H}_{\mu}$ realizing a derived equivalence between $(\mathbb{C}^{*})^2$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $\mathrm{Hilb}_{n}(\mathbb{C}^2)$ and $(\mathfrak{S}_n \times (\mathbb{C}^{*})^2)$-equivariant coherent sheaves on $(\mathbb{C}^2)^n.$ Carlsson--Gorsky--Mellit introduced a larger family of smooth projective varieties $\mathrm{PFH}_{n,n-k}$ called the parabolic flag Hilbert schemes. They showed that an algebra $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$, directly related to the double Dyck path algebra $\mathbb{A}_{q,t}$ employed in Carlsson--Mellit's proof of the Shuffle Theorem, acts naturally on the $(\mathbb{C}^{*})^2$-equivariant K-theory $U_{\bullet}$ of these spaces and, moreover, there is a $\mathbb{B}_{q,t}$-isomorphism $\Phi: U_{\bullet} \rightarrow V_{\bullet}$ where $V_{\bullet}$ is the polynomial representation. The isomorphism $\Phi: U_{\bullet} \rightarrow V_{\bullet}$ is known to extend Haiman's correspondence. In this paper, we explicitly compute the images $\Phi(H_{\mu,w})$ of the normalized $(\mathbb{C}^{*})^2$-fixed point classes $H_{\mu,w}$ of the spaces $\mathrm{PFH}_{n,n-k}$ and show they agree with the modified partially symmetric Macdonald polynomials $\widetilde{H}_{(\lambda|\gamma)}$ introduced by Goodberry-Orr, confirming their prior conjecture. We use this result to give an explicit formula for the action of the involution $\mathcal{N}$ on $V_{\bullet}.$</description>

      <title>Strongly connected orientations and integer lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D=(V,A)$ be a digraph whose underlying graph is $2$-edge-connected. Let $P$ be the polytope whose vertices are the incidence vectors of arc sets whose reversal makes $D$ strongly connected. $P$ can be described by $0,1$ bounds, and 'cut inequalities' which enforce that every nonempty proper vertex subset has at least one incoming arc after a re-orientation. Let $F$ be any face obtained by setting some cut inequalities to equality. We prove under a mild necessary condition that the integer points in $F$ contain an 'integral basis' $B$, i.e., $B$ is linearly independent, and any integral vector in the linear hull of $F$ is an integral linear combination of $B$. This result is surprising as the integer points in $F$ do not necessarily form a Hilbert basis. Our result is obtained by developing a theory similar to Matching Theory for degree-constrained dijoins in bipartite digraphs.
  Our result has several consequences, including to a famous conjecture by Woodall from the 1970s which states that the minimum size of a 'dicut' of $D$, say $\tau$, is equal to the maximum number of disjoint 'dijoins'. Our result proves a relaxation of this conjecture, by finding for any prime number $p\geq 2$, a $p$-adic packing of dijoins of value $\tau$ and of support size at most $2|A|$.</description>

      <title>Zarankiewicz bounds from distal regularity lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since K\H{o}v\'ari, S\'os, and Tur\'an proved upper bounds for the Zarankiewicz problem in 1954, much work has been undertaken to improve these bounds, and some have done so by restricting to particular classes of graphs. In 2017, Fox, Pach, Sheffer, Suk, and Zahl proved better bounds for semialgebraic binary relations, and this work was extended by Do in the following year to arbitrary semialgebraic relations. In this paper, we show that Zarankiewicz bounds in the shape of Do's are enjoyed by all relations satisfying the distal regularity lemma, an improved version of the Szemer\'edi regularity lemma satisfied by relations definable in distal structures (a vast generalisation of o-minimal structures).</description>

      <title>On monochromatic solutions to linear equations over the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the number of monochromatic solutions to linear equations in a $2$-coloring of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We show that any nontrivial linear equation has a constant fraction of solutions that are monochromatic in any $2$-coloring of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. We further study commonness of four-term equations and disprove a conjecture of Costello and Elvin by showing that, unlike over $\mathbb{F}_p$, the four-term equation $x_1 + 2x_2 - x_3 - 2x_4 = 0$ is uncommon over $\{1,\ldots,n\}$.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Tree Packing Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Gy\'arf\'as (1976), which asserts that $K_n$ packs any family of trees $T_1, \dots, T_{n}$ where each $T_k$ has $k$ vertices. We do so by translating the decomposition problem into a labeling problem, namely complete labeling. Our proof employs the polynomial method using a functional reformulation of the conjecture.</description>

      <title>Geometry of multidimensional Farey summation algorithm and frieze patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a new geometric approach to subtractive continued fraction algorithms in high dimensions. We adapt a version of Farey summation to the geometric techniques proposed by F. Klein in 1895. More specifically we introduce Farey polyhedra and their sails that generalise respectively Klein polyhedra and their sails, and show similar duality properties of the Farey sail integer invariants. The construction of Farey sails is based on the multidimensional generalisation of the Farey tessellation provided by a modification of the continued fraction algorithm introduced by R. W. J. Meester. We classify Farey polyhedra in the combinatorial terms of prismatic diagrams. Prismatic diagrams extend boat polygons introduced by S. Morier-Genoud and V. Ovsienko in the two-dimensional case. As one of the applications of the new theory we get a multidimensional version of Conway-Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that multidimensional frieze patterns satisfy generalised Ptolemy relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work will appear as a chapter in a forthcoming volume titled "Topics in Probabilistic Graph Theory". A theory of scaling limits for random graphs has been developed in recent years. This theory gives access to the large-scale geometric structure of these random objects in the limit as their size goes to infinity, with distances appropriately rescaled. We start with the simplest setting of random trees, before turning to various examples of random graphs, including the critical Erd\H{o}s--R\'enyi random graph.</description>

      <title>Tropical Split Jacobians of genus 2 and optimal covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore connections between the category of tropical abelian varieties (tav), $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{A}$, and the the category of tropical curves, $\mathbb{T}\mathcal{C}$, first in a broader context and then specifically by studying the phenomenon of tropical split Jacobians. Jacobians of genus $2$ curves are two-dimensional tav and as such more complicated than their one-dimensional cousins. Whenever $\Gamma$, however, is a covering of an elliptic curve, it so happens that $Jac(\Gamma)$ splits into simpler objects, the direct sum of elliptic curves. This relation is pathological in essentially two ways, the splitting of $Jac(\Gamma)$ is not unique, and it is a priori not clear how to compute it. Similar to algebraic geometry, optimal coverings offer a remedy for both: They resolve indeterminacy as they provide us with a canonical choice. They resolve indeterminability as they provide us with an algorithmic approach. Our methods build on theory developed by Len, Mikhalkin, R\"ohrle, Ulirsch, Zakharov, Zharkov and many more. In accordance with this heritage, we want to put forth tropical geometry as a setting in which we can see abstraction at work. This means pairing "abstract machinery" with a constructive/algorithmic approach.</description>

Abstract: We describe the limits of canonical series along families of curves degenerating to a nodal curve which is general for its topology, in the weak sense that the branches over nodes on each of its components are in general position. We define a fan structure on the space of edge lengths on the dual graph of the limit curve, and construct a projective variety parametrizing the limits, organized in strata associated to the cones of this fan.</description>

      <title>An explicit formula for zonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The derivation of zonal polynomials involves evaluating the integral \[ \exp\left( - \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{tr} D_{\beta} Q D_{l} Q \right) \] with respect to orthogonal matrices \(Q\), where \(D_{\beta}\) and \(D_{l}\) are diagonal matrices. The integral is expressed through a polynomial expansion in terms of the traces of these matrices, leading to the identification of zonal polynomials as symmetric, homogeneous functions of the variables \(l_1, l_2, \ldots, l_n\). The coefficients of these polynomials are derived systematically from the structure of the integrals, revealing relationships between them and illustrating the significance of symmetry in their formulation. Furthermore, properties such as the uniqueness up to normalization are established, reinforcing the foundational role of zonal polynomials in statistical and mathematical applications involving orthogonal matrices.</description>

Abstract: Models of random phylogenetic networks have been used since the inception of the field, but the introduction and rigorous study of mathematically tractable models is a much more recent topic that has gained momentum in the last 5~years. This manuscript discusses some recent developments in the field through a selection of examples. The emphasis is on the techniques rather than on the results themselves, and on probabilistic tools rather than on combinatorial ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a mass formula for a given class of linear codes is a fundamental problem in combinatorics and coding theory. In this paper, we consider the action of the unitary (resp. symplectic) group on the set of all Hermitian (resp. symplectic) linear complementary dual (LCD) codes, prove that all Hermitian (resp. symplectic) LCD codes are on a unique orbit under this action, and determine the formula for the size of the orbit. Based on this, we develop a general technique to obtain a closed mass formula for linear codes with prescribed Hermitian (resp. symplectic) hull dimension, and further obtain some asymptotic results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The type A cluster configuration space, commonly known as $\mathcal M_{0,n}$, is the very affine part of the binary geometry associated with the associahedron. The tropicalization of $\mathcal M_{0,n}$ can be realized as the space of phylogenetic trees and its signed tropicalizations as the dual-associahedron subfans. We give a concise overview of this construction and propose an extension to type C. The type C cluster configuration space $\mathcal M_{\mathrm C_\ell}$ arises from the binary geometry associated with the cyclohedron. We define a space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees containing many dual-associahedron and dual-cyclohedron subfans. We conjecturally realize the tropicalization of $\mathcal M_{\mathrm C_\ell}$ as the defined space and its signed tropicalizations as the aforementioned subfans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if $G$ is amenable and $A\subseteq G$ has positive upper Banach density, then there is an identity neighborhood $B$ in the Bohr topology on $G$ that is almost contained in $AA^{-1}$ in the sense that $B\backslash AA^{-1}$ has upper Banach density $0$. This generalizes the abelian case (due to F{\o}lner) and the countable case (due to Beiglb\"{o}ck, Bergelson, and Fish). The proof is indirectly based on local stable group theory in continuous logic. The main ingredients are Grothendieck's double-limit characterization of relatively weakly compact sets in spaces of continuous functions, along with results of Ellis and Nerurkar on the topological dynamics of weakly almost periodic flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1612.09225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A decomposition space (also called 2-Segal space) is a simplicial object satisfying an exactness condition weaker than the Segal condition: just as the Segal condition expresses composition, the new condition expresses decomposition. It is a general framework for incidence (co)algebras. In this contribution, after establishing a formula for the section coefficients, we survey a large supply of examples, emphasising the notion's firm roots in classical combinatorics. The first batch of examples, similar to binomial posets, serves to illustrate 2 key points: (1) the incidence algebra in question is realised directly from a decomposition space, without a reduction step, and reductions are often given by CULF functors; (2) at the objective level, the convolution algebra is a monoidal structure of species. We encounter the usual Cauchy product of species, the shuffle product of L-species, the Dirichlet product of arithmetic species, the Joyal-Street external product of q-species and the Morrison `Cauchy' product of q-species. In each case a power series representation results from taking cardinality. The external product of q-species exemplifies the fact that Waldhausen's S-construction on an abelian category is a decomposition space, yielding Hall algebras. The next class of examples includes Schmitt's chromatic Hopf algebra, the Fa\`a di Bruno bialgebra, the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra of trees and variations from operad theory. Similar structures on posets and directed graphs exemplify a general construction of decomposition spaces from directed restriction species. An appetiser on decomposition spaces of symmetric functions is included. We finish by computing the M\"obius function in a few cases, and commenting on certain cancellations that occur in the process of taking cardinality, substantiating that these cancellations are not possible at the objective level.</description>

      <title>Irregular triads in 3-uniform hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.01737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past several years, numerous authors have explored model theoretically motivated combinatorial conditions that ensure that a graph has an efficient regular decomposition in the sense of Szemer\'edi. In this paper we set out a research program that explores a corresponding set of questions for 3-uniform hypergraphs, a setting in which useful notions of regularity are significantly more intricate.
  The main results in this paper concern certain combinatorial properties which arose as natural higher-order generalizations of the order property in parallel work of the authors in the arithmetic setting. Interpreted in the context of 3-uniform hypergraphs, these are tightly connected to the nature of irregular triads. Specifically, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs admits regular decompositions with so-called "linear error" if and only if it does not have the functional order property.
  Along the way, we show that a hereditary property of 3-uniform hypergraphs is homogeneous (i.e. all regular triads have density near $0$ or near $1$) if and only it has bounded $\textrm{VC}_2$-dimension. This provides a quantitative version of a recent result of Chernikov and Towsner.
  We also address several questions arising from prior work on tame regularity in hypergraphs. In particular, we characterize the hereditary properties of $3$-uniform hypergraphs admitting the type of regular partitions appearing in work of Fox et al. as those that have finite weak VC-dimension. This is again analogous to a recent non-quantitative result of Chernikov and Towsner.</description>

      <title>Coboundary and cosystolic expansion without dependence on dimension or degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give new bounds on the cosystolic expansion constants of several families of high dimensional expanders, and the known coboundary expansion constants of order complexes of homogeneous geometric lattices, including the spherical building of $SL_n(F_q)$. The improvement applies to the high dimensional expanders constructed by Lubotzky, Samuels and Vishne, and by Kaufman and Oppenheim.
  Our new expansion constants do not depend on the degree of the complex nor on its dimension, nor on the group of coefficients. This implies improved bounds on Gromov's topological overlap constant, and on Dinur and Meshulam's cover stability, which may have applications for agreement testing. In comparison, existing bounds decay exponentially with the ambient dimension (for spherical buildings) and in addition decay linearly with the degree (for all known bounded-degree high dimensional expanders). Our results are based on several new techniques:
  * We develop a new "color-restriction" technique which enables proving dimension-free expansion by restricting a multi-partite complex to small random subsets of its color classes.
  * We give a new "spectral" proof for Evra and Kaufman's local-to-global theorem, deriving better bounds and getting rid of the dependence on the degree. This theorem bounds the cosystolic expansion of a complex using coboundary expansion and spectral expansion of the links.
  * We derive absolute bounds on the coboundary expansion of the spherical building (and any order complex of a homogeneous geometric lattice) by constructing a novel family of very short cones.</description>

      <title>Uniquely hamiltonian graphs for many sets of degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08946v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give constructive proofs for the existence of uniquely hamiltonian graphs for various sets of degrees. We give constructions for all sets with minimum 2 (a trivial case added for completeness), all sets with minimum 3 that contain an even number (for sets without an even number it is known that no uniquely hamiltonian graphs exist), and all sets with minimum 4, except {4}, {4,5}, and {4,6}. For minimum degree 3 and 4, the constructions also give 3-connected graphs. We also introduce the concept of seeds, which makes the above results possible and might be useful in the study of Sheehan's conjecture. Furthermore, we prove that 3-connected uniquely hamiltonian 4-regular graphs exist if and only if 2-connected uniquely hamiltonian 4-regular graphs exist.</description>

      <title>Geometric graphs with exponential chromatic number and arbitrary girth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1975 Erd\H{o}s initiated the study of the following very natural question. What can be said about the chromatic number of unit distance graphs in $\mathbb{R}^2$ that have large girth? Over the years this question and its natural extension to $\mathbb{R}^d$ attracted considerable attention with the high-dimensional variant reiterated recently by Alon and Kupavskii.
  We prove that there exist unit distance graphs in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with chromatic number at least $(1.074 + o(1))^d$ that have arbitrarily large girth. This improves upon a series of results due to Kupavskii; Sagdeev; and Sagdeev and Raigorodskii and gives the first bound in which the base of the exponent does not tend to one with the girth. In addition, our construction can be made explicit which allows us to answer in a strong form a question of Kupavskii.
  Our arguments show graphs of large chromatic number and high girth exist in a number of other geometric settings including diameter graphs and orthogonality graphs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hamming graph $H(n,q)$ is defined on the vertex set $[q]^n$ and two vertices are adjacent if and only if they differ in precisely one coordinate. Alon \cite{Alon} proved that the burning number of $H(n,2)$ is $\lceil\frac n2\rceil+1$. In this note we give a short proof of a fact that the burning number of $H(n,q)$ is $(1-\frac 1q)n+O(\sqrt{n\log n})$ for fixed $q\geq 2$ and $n\to\infty$.</description>

Abstract: By the work of Ferroni and Larson, Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and Z-polynomials of complete graphs have combinatorial interpretations in terms of quasi series-parallel matroids. We provide explicit formulas for the number of series-parallel matroids and the number of simple series-parallel matroids of a given rank and cardinality, extending results of Ferroni-Larson and Gao-Proudfoot-Yang-Zhang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph (with multiple edges allowed) and let $T$ be a tree in $G$. We say that $T$ is $\textit{even}$ if every leaf of $T$ belongs to the same part of the bipartition of $T$, and that $T$ is $\textit{weakly even}$ if every leaf of $T$ that has maximum degree in $G$ belongs to the same part of the bipartition of $T$. We confirm two recent conjectures of Jackson and Yoshimoto by showing that every connected graph that is not a regular bipartite graph has a spanning weakly even tree.</description>

      <title>Rainbow Combinatorial Lines in Hypercubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is about the rainbow dual of the Hales Jewett number, providing general bounds an anti-Hales Jewett Number for hypercubes of length k and dimension n denoted $ah(k, n).$ The best general bounds this paper provides are: $(k-1)^n &lt; ah(k, n) \leq \frac{(k-1)^2-2}{k-1}\cdot k^{n-1}+\frac{k+1}{k-1}.$ This paper also includes proofs about the specific cases of $k = 2$ and $k = 3$, where we show that $ah(2, n) = 2$ and $2^n &lt; ah(3, n) \leq 3^{n-1} - 2\cdot3^{n-4} + 2$ for all natural numbers n $&gt;$ 4. For $n &lt; 4$, we have found the exact values: $ah(3, 1) = 3$, $ah(3, 2) = 5$, and $ah(3, 3) = 11$. In the case $n = 4$, we have found that $23 &lt; ah(3, 4) \leq 27$.</description>

      <title>A geometric realization of the chromatic symmetric function of a unit interval graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shareshian-Wachs, Brosnan-Chow, and Guay-Pacquet [Adv. Math. ${\bf 295}$ (2016), ${\bf 329}$ (2018), arXiv:1601.05498] realized the chromatic (quasi-)symmetric function of a unit interval graph in terms of Hessenberg varieties. Here we exhibit another realization of these chromatic (quasi-)symmetric functions in terms of the Betti cohomology of the variety $\mathscr X_\Psi$ defined in [arXiv:2301.00862]. This yields a new inductive combinatorial expression of these chromatic symmetric functions. Based on this, we propose a geometric refinement of the Stanley-Stembridge conjecture, whose validity would imply the Shareshian-Wachs conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.05420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the exterior algebra $\Lambda_{R}\left[\alpha_{1}, \cdots, \alpha_{n}\right]$, which is the cohomology of the torus $T=(S^{1})^{n}$, and the polynomial ring $\mathbb{R}\left[t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}\right]$, which is the cohomology of the classifying space $B (S^{1})^{n}=\left(\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{\infty}\right)^{n}$, are $S_{n}$-equivariantly log-concave. We do so by explicitly giving the $S_{n}$-representation maps on the appropriate sequences of tensor products of polynomials or exterior powers and proving that these maps satisfy the hard Lefschetz theorem. Furthermore, we prove that the whole K\"ahler package, including algebraic analogies of the Poincar\'e duality, hard Lefschetz, and Hodge-Riemann bilinear relations, holds on the corresponding sequences in an equivariant setting.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of Schensted row insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic probabilistic phenomena arising from the application of the Schensted row insertion algorithm, a key component of the Robinson-Schensted-Knuth (RSK) correspondence, to random inputs. Our analysis centers on a random tableau $T$ with a given shape $\lambda$, which may itself be random or deterministic. We examine the stochastic properties of the position of the new box created when inserting a deterministic entry into $T$. Specifically, we focus on the fluctuations of this position around its expected value as the size of the Young diagram $\lambda$ approaches infinity. Our findings reveal that these fluctuations are asymptotically Gaussian, with the mean and variance expressed in terms of Kerov's transition measure of the diagram $\lambda$. An important application of this analysis is the RSK algorithm applied to a finite, long sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables. While there remains a gap in the reasoning for this case, we present an explicit conjecture regarding its behavior.</description>

      <title>A Solomon Mackey formula for graded bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graded bialgebra $H$, we let $\Delta^{\left[ k\right] }:H\rightarrow H^{\otimes k}$ and $m^{\left[ k\right] }:H^{\otimes k}\rightarrow H$ be its iterated (co)multiplications for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$. For any $k$-tuple $\alpha=\left(
  \alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{k}\right) \in\mathbb{N}^{k}$ of nonnegative integers, and any permutation $\sigma$ of $\left\{ 1,2,\ldots,k\right\} $, we consider the map $p_{\alpha,\sigma}:=m^{\left[ k\right] }\circ P_{\alpha}\circ\sigma^{-1}\circ\Delta^{\left[ k\right] }:H\rightarrow H$, where $P_{\alpha}$ denotes the projection of $H^{\otimes k}$ onto its multigraded component $H_{\alpha_{1}}\otimes H_{\alpha_{2}}\otimes\cdots\otimes H_{\alpha_{k}}$, and where $\sigma^{-1}:H\rightarrow H$ permutes the tensor factors.
  We prove formulas for the composition $p_{\alpha,\sigma}\circ p_{\beta,\tau}$ and the convolution $p_{\alpha,\sigma}\star p_{\beta,\tau}$ of two such maps. When $H$ is cocommutative, these generalize Patras's 1994 results (which, in turn, generalize Solomon's Mackey formula).
  We also construct a combinatorial Hopf algebra $\operatorname*{PNSym}$ ("permuted noncommutative symmetric functions") that governs the maps $p_{\alpha,\sigma}$ for arbitrary connected graded bialgebras $H$ in the same way as the well-known $\operatorname*{NSym}$ governs them in the cocommutative case. We end by outlining an application to checking identities for connected graded Hopf algebras.</description>

      <title>Counting simplicial pairs in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present two ways to measure the simplicial nature of a hypergraph: the simplicial ratio and the simplicial matrix. We show that the simplicial ratio captures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a hypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We then compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10 real-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that simplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We then present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in expectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model, as well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic processes exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs vs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Expectation and Variance of the Degree of a Node in Random Spanning Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Gibbs distribution over all spanning trees of an undirected, edge weighted finite graph, where, up to normalization, the probability of each tree is given by the product of its edge weights. Defining the weighted degree of a node as the sum of the weights of its incident edges, we present analytical expressions for the expectation, variance and covariance of the weighted degree of a node across the Gibbs distribution. To generalize our approach, we distinguish between two types of weight: probability weights, which regulate the distribution of spanning trees, and degree weights, which define the weighted degree of nodes. This distinction allows us to define the weighted degree of nodes independently of the probability weights. By leveraging the Matrix Tree Theorem, we show that these degree moments ultimately depend on the inverse of a submatrix of the graph Laplacian. While our focus is on undirected graphs, we demonstrate that our results can be extended to the directed setting by considering incoming directed trees instead.</description>
