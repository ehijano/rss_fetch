      <title>Theoretical Foundation of Black Hole Image Reconstruction using PRIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new image-reconstruction algorithm, PRIMO, applied to the interferometric data of the M87 black hole collected with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), resulted in an image that reached the native resolution of the telescope array. PRIMO is based on learning a compact set of image building blocks obtained from a large library of high-fidelity, physics-based simulations of black hole images. It uses these building blocks to fill the sparse Fourier coverage of the data that results from the small number of telescopes in the array. In this paper, we show that this approach is readily justified. Since the angular extent of the image of the black hole and of its inner accretion flow is finite, the Fourier space domain is heavily smoothed, with a correlation scale that is at most comparable to the sizes of the data gaps in the coverage of Fourier space with the EHT. Consequently, PRIMO or other machine-learning algorithms can faithfully reconstruct the images without the need to generate information that is unconstrained by the data within the resolution of the array. We also address the completeness of the eigenimages and the compactness of the resulting representation. We show that PRIMO provides a compact set of eigenimages that have sufficient complexity to recreate a broad set of images well beyond those in the training set.</description>

      <title>ExoTiC-LD: thirty seconds to stellar limb-darkening coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar limb darkening is the observed variation in brightness of a star between its centre and edge (or limb) when viewed in the plane of the sky. Stellar brightness is maximal at the centre and then decreases radially and monotonically towards the limb -- hence the term "limb darkening". This effect is crucial for finding and characterising planets beyond our Solar System, known as exoplanets, as these planets are often studied when crossing in front of their host stars. As such, limb darkening is directly linked to the exoplanet signals. Limb darkening is typically modelled by one of various functional forms, as outlined in Claret (2000) and Sing (2010), and the coefficients of these functions is what ExoTiC-LD is designed to compute. A wide variety of functional forms are supported, including those benchmarked by Espinoza &amp; Jord\'an (2016) as well as reparameterisations suggested by Kipping (2013).</description>

      <title>Galaxy cluster profiles: A Gaussian mixture model approach to halo miscentering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the galaxy density and weak-lensing profiles of galaxy clusters typically rely on an assumed cluster center, which is taken to be the brightest cluster galaxy or other proxies for the true halo center. Departure of the assumed cluster center from the true halo center bias the resultant profile measurements, an effect known as miscentering bias. Currently, miscentering is typically modeled in stacked profiles of clusters with a two parameter model. We use an alternate approach in which the profiles of individual clusters are used with the corresponding likelihood computed using a Gaussian mixture model. We test the approach using halos and the corresponding subhalo profiles from the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamic simulations. We obtain significantly improved estimates of the miscentering parameters for both 3D and projected 2D profiles relevant for imaging surveys. We discuss applications to upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>In-Flight Performance of Spider's 280 GHz Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SPIDER is a balloon-borne instrument designed to map the cosmic microwave background at degree-angular scales in the presence of Galactic foregrounds. SPIDER has mapped a large sky area in the Southern Hemisphere using more than 2000 transition-edge sensors (TESs) during two NASA Long Duration Balloon flights above the Antarctic continent. During its first flight in January 2015, SPIDER observed in the 95 GHz and 150 GHz frequency bands, setting constraints on the B-mode signature of primordial gravitational waves. Its second flight in the 2022-23 season added new receivers at 280 GHz, each using an array of TESs coupled to the sky through feedhorns formed from stacks of silicon wafers. These receivers are optimized to produce deep maps of polarized Galactic dust emission over a large sky area, providing a unique data set with lasting value to the field. In this work, we describe the instrument's performance during SPIDER's second flight.</description>

      <title>Concept of a Double Tilted Rowland Spectrograph for X-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy in soft X-rays ($&lt;2$ keV) requires diffractive elements to resolve any astrophysically relevant diagnostics, such as closely spaced lines, weak absorption lines, or line profiles. The Rowland torus geometry describes how gratings and detectors need to be positioned to optimize the spectral resolving power. We describe how an on-axis Rowland geometry can be tilted to accommodate blazed gratings. In this geometry, two channels with separate optical axes can share the same detectors (double tilted Rowland spectrograph, DTRS). Small offsets between the channels can mitigate the effect of chip gaps and reduce the alignment requirements during the construction of the instrument. The DTRS concept is especially useful for sub-apertured mirrors, because it allows an effective use of space in the entrance aperture of a spacecraft. One mission that applies this concept is the Arcus Probe.</description>

      <title>Radio U-Net: a convolutional neural network to detect diffuse radio sources in galaxy clusters and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming generation of radio telescope arrays promises significant advancements in sensitivity and resolution, enabling the identification and characterization of many new faint and diffuse radio sources. Conventional manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise, artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys for scientific exploration.</description>

      <title>Discovery space and science with the PLACID stellar coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The world's first ever ''adaptive stellar coronagraph'' facility will be the PLACID instrument, installed on Turkey's new national observatory 4-m DAG telescope. PLACID incorporates a customized spatial light modulator (SLM) acting as a dynamically addressed focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph in the H-Ks bands. This new approach to high-contrast imaging will be applied on-sky in late 2024/early 2025. We present a first estimate of the science discovery space for PLACID, in terms of known exoplanets and brown dwarfs, considering raw lab contrast, contrast ratios, limiting magnitudes, coronagraphic inner working angle etc. In the future, we will also look into predicted disk and binary or multiple stars systems imaging performance, with the latter being a possible niche science case for the instrument (adaptive FPM for multiple stars). This work will inform on the first light PLACID commissioning activities and early science on the DAG telescope and is deemed to evolve in function of future developments on the DAG AO instrumentation suite.</description>

      <title>Future exoplanet direct imaging instruments: Simulating spatial light modulator-based pixelated focal-plane coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the DAG Telescope (PLACID) instrument will be installed on the Turkish 4-m Telescope by the fall of 2024 and is expected to be on-sky by the end of the year. PLACID will be the first ''active stellar coronagraph instrument'', equipped with a customized spatial light modulator (SLM), which performs as a dynamically programmable focal-plane phase mask (FPM) from H- to Ks- band. A Python-based numerical simulator of SLM-based focal-plane phase coronagraph is developed to investigate the effects of discrete pixelated FPM patterns in place of classical phase masks. The simulator currently explores the impacts of two design choices, spatial sampling in the coronagraphic focal-plane (number of SLM pixels per $\lambda$/D) and phase resolution (SLM greylevel steps). The preliminary results of the monochromatic simulations show that in ideal conditions (no wavefront errors) it is sufficient to use FPMs with spatial sampling of 10 SLM pixel per $\lambda$/D and phase resolution of 8 bits. The tool is expected to enable detailed simulations of PLACID or similar SLM-based instruments, and to help with real-time operations (optimal choice of FPM for given observing conditions) and interpretation of real data. Additionally, the tool is designed to integrate and simulate advanced operation modes, in particular focal-plane phase diversity for coherent differential imaging (CDI) of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the DAG telescope (PLACID) instrument: On-site status update ahead of first light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Programmable Liquid-crystal Active Coronagraphic Imager for the DAG telescope (PLACID) instrument is a novel high-contrast direct imaging facility that was recently delivered to the Turkish 4-m DAG telescope, with first light anticipated by the end of 2024. In a nutshell, PLACID consists in a fore-optics coronagraphic intermediate stage platform, installed in-between the TROIA XAO system and the DIRAC HAWAII-1RG focal-plane array. The PLACID project, led by a consortium of Swiss Universities contracted by the Atat\"urk University Astrophysics Research and Application Center (ATASAM), has passed the Delivery Readiness Review (DRR) milestone in September 2023, and was delivered to ATASAM campus facilities in March 2024. The PLACID commissioning activities with the calibration light source at the summit, on the DAG telescope Nasmyth platform, are foreseen to take place this fall, with first light scheduled to take place before the end of the year. When on-sky, PLACID will be the world's first ''active coronagraph'' facility, fielding a customized spatial light modulator (SLM) acting as a dynamically programmable focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph from H- to Ks-band. This will provide a wealth of novel options to observers, among which software-only abilities to change or re-align the FPM pattern in function of conditions or science requirements, free of any actuator motion. Future features will include non-common path aberrations (NCPA) self-calibration, optimized coronagraphy for binary stars, as well as coherent differential imaging (CDI). We hereby present the delivered PLACID instrument, its current capabilities, and Factory Acceptance commissioning results with relevant performance metrics.</description>

      <title>GRANDlib: A simulation pipeline for the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of upcoming ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray, gamma-ray, and neutrino radio-detection experiments, like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), poses significant computational challenges involving the production of numerous simulations of particle showers and their detection, and a high data throughput. GRANDlib is an open-source software tool designed to meet these challenges. Its primary goal is to perform end-to-end simulations of the detector operation, from the interaction of ultra-high-energy particles, through -- by interfacing with external air-shower simulations -- the ensuing particle shower development and its radio emission, to its detection by antenna arrays and its processing by data-acquisition systems. Additionally, GRANDlib manages the visualization, storage, and retrieval of experimental and simulated data. We present an overview of GRANDlib to serve as the basis of future GRAND analyses.</description>

      <title>SAUNAS II: Discovery of Cross-shaped X-ray Emission and a Rotating Circumnuclear Disk in the Supermassive S0 Galaxy NGC 5084</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining Chandra, ALMA, EVLA, and Hubble Space Telescope archival data and newly acquired APO/DIS spectroscopy, we detect a double-lobed 17~kpc X-ray emission with plumes oriented approximately perpendicular and parallel to the galactic plane of the massive lenticular galaxy NGC\,5084 at 0.3--2.0~keV.
  We detect a highly inclined ($i=71.2^{+1.8\circ}_{-1.7}$), molecular circumnuclear disk ($D=304^{+10}_{-11}$ pc) in the core of the galaxy rotating (V$^{\rm (2-1) CO}_{\rm rot}=242.7^{+9.6}_{-6.4}$ km s$^{-1}$) in a direction perpendicular to that of the galactic disk, implying a total mass of $\log_{10}\left( \frac{M_{\rm BH}}{M_{\odot}} \right) = 7.66^{+0.21}_{-0.15}$ for NGC\,5084's supermassive black hole. Archival EVLA radio observations at 6 cm and 20 cm reveal two symmetric radio lobes aligned with the galactic plane, extending to a distance of $\overline{R}=4.6\pm0.6$ kpc from the core, oriented with the polar axis of the circumnuclear disk. The spectral energy distribution lacks strong emission lines in the optical range.
  Three formation scenarios are considered to explain these multi-wavelength archival observations: 1) AGN re-orientation caused by accretion of surrounding material, 2) AGN-driven hot gas outflow directed along the galactic minor axis, or 3) a starburst / supernovae driven outflow at the core of the galaxy. This discovery is enabled by new imaging analysis tools including \SAUNAS\ (Selective Amplification of Ultra Noisy Astronomical Signal), demonstrating the abundance of information still to be exploited in the vast and growing astronomical archives.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Atmospheric Parameters of Early-type Stars from the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST) Slitless Spectra Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of atmospheric parameters is fundamental for scientific research using stellar spectra. The Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), scheduled to be launched in 2024, will provide researchers with hundreds of millions of slitless spectra for stars during a 10 yr survey. And machine learning has unparalleled efficiency in processing large amounts of data compared to manual processing. Here we studied the stellar parameters of early-type stars (effective temperature Teff more than 15,000 K) based on the design indicators of the CSST slitless spectrum and the machine learning algorithm, Stellar LAbel Machine. We used the Potsdam Wolf-Rayet (POWR) synthetic spectra library for cross validation. Then we tested the reliability of machine learning results by using the Next Generation Spectrum Library (NGSL) from Hubble Space Telescope observation data. We use the spectra with the impact of interstellar extinction (AV = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 mag) and radial velocity (RV = -50, -30, 0, 30, 50 km s-1) from the POWR library as the test set. When RV = 0 km s-1 and AV = 0 mag, the average value and standard deviation for 3 wavelength ranges (2550-4050 Ang (R = 287); 4050-6300 Ang (R = 232); 6300-10000 Ang (R = 207)) are -66 K, 550 K, and 356 K for Teff, and 0.004 c.g.s, -0.024 c.g.s, and 0.01 c.g.s for log g. When using the observed data from NGSL as the testing samples, the deviation of Teff is less than 5%, and the deviation of log g is less than 11%. In addition, we also test the influence of shifting of spectra on the parameters accuracy. The deviation of Teff for the case with a shift of 5 Ang and 10 Ang are 3.6% and 4.3%, respectively; the deviation of log g are 4.2% and 5.1%. These results demonstrate that we can obtain relatively accurate stellar parameters of a population of early-type stars with the CSST slitless spectra and a machine-learning method.</description>

      <title>LavAtmos 2.0: Incorporating Volatiles Species in Vaporization Models</title>

Abstract: Due to strong irradiation, hot rocky exoplanets are able to sustain lava oceans. Direct interaction between these oceans and overlying atmospheres can provide insight into planetary interiors. In order to fully understand how the composition of the atmosphere of such planets are affected by the properties of the oceans, comprehensive chemical equilibrium models are required. Thus far, most models have only taken non-volatile species into account when calculating lava vaporisation. We investigate the effect of including C-, H-, N-, S-, and P-bearing species in the equilibrium lava vaporisation calculations on the overall atmospheric composition of hot rocky exoplanets by expanding our LavAtmos code. In LavAtmos 2.0 we integrate the chemical equilibrium code FastChem to expand the considered gas phase species to 523. We apply this new approach to calculate the composition of "pure" atmospheres which contain only a single volatile element and more complex atmospheres which contain C, H, N, S, and P. We also test two proposed compositions for the atmosphere of 55-Cnc e. We find that the inclusion of volatile elements in vaporisation calculations increases the partial pressures of vaporised species for all tested atmospheric compositions. Our models indicate that the tested volatile atmospheres above a lava ocean have a relatively low C-O ratio. This demonstrates the utility of complex chemical models that better describe the chemical behavior of atmospheres across a wide range of pressures and temperatures. Volatile elements must be taken into account for comprehensive modeling of vaporisation from a surface lava ocean into a volatile atmosphere. Vaporised species such as SiO, TiO, and Na may be present in greater abundances than previously estimated. A low atmospheric C/O ratio may be able to function as a new tracer for the presence of surface lava oceans on hot rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Cosmoglobe DR2. III. Improved modelling of zodiacal light with COBE-DIRBE through global Bayesian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light model for COBE-DIRBE derived through global Bayesian analysis within the Cosmoglobe Data Release 2 framework. The parametric form of the ZL model is identical to that introduced by Kelsall et al. (1998), but the specific best-fit parameter values are re-derived using the combination of DIRBE Calibrated Individual Observations, Planck HFI sky maps, and WISE and Gaia compact object catalogs. Furthermore, the ZL parameters are fitted jointly with astrophysical parameters, such as thermal dust and starlight emission, and the new model takes into account excess radiation that appears stationary in solar-centric coordinates as reported in a companion paper. The relative differences between the predicted signals from K98 and our new model are $\lesssim 5\%$ in the 12 and 25 $\mu$m channels over the full sky. The zero-levels of the cleaned DR2 maps are lower than those of the K98 Zodiacal light Subtracted Mission Average maps by $\sim 10$ kJy/sr at 1.25-3.5 $\mu$m, which is larger than the entire predicted contribution from high-redshift galaxies to the Cosmic Infrared Background at the same wavelengths. The total RMS of each DR2 map at wavelengths up to and including 25 $\mu$m are $\sim 30$ $\%$ lower at high Galactic latitudes than the corresponding DIRBE ZSMA maps. Still, obvious ZL residuals can be seen in several of the DR2 maps, and further work is required to mitigate these. Joint analysis with existing and future high-resolution full-sky surveys such as AKARI, IRAS, Planck HFI, and SPHEREx will be essential both to break key degeneracies in the current model and to determine whether the reported solar-centric excess radiation has a ZL or instrumental origin. Thus, while the results presented in this paper do redefine the state-of-the-art for DIRBE modelling, it also only represents the first among many steps toward a future optimal Bayesian ZL model.</description>

      <title>Diffuse radio sky models using large scale shapelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sky models used in radio interferometric data processing primarily consist of compact and discrete radio sources. When there is a need to model large scale diffuse structure such as the Galaxy, specialized source models are sought after for the sake of simplicity and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose the use of shapelet basis functions for modeling large scale diffuse structure in various radio interferometric data processing pipelines.
  Conventional source model construction using shapelet basis functions is restricted to using images of smaller size due to limitations in computational resources such as memory. We propose a novel shapelet decomposition method to lift this restriction, enabling the use of images of millions of pixels (as well as a wide spectral bandwidth) for building models of large scale diffuse structure. Furthermore, the application of direction dependent errors onto diffuse sky models is an expensive operation often performed as a convolution. In this paper, we propose using some specific properties of shapelet basis functions to apply such direction dependent errors as a product of the model coefficients, thus the avoiding the need for convolution.
  We provide results based on simulations and real observations. In order to measure the efficacy of our proposed method in modeling large scale diffuse structure, we consider direction dependent calibration of simulated as well as real LOFAR observations that have a significant amount of large scale diffuse structure. Results show that by including large scale shapelet models of the diffuse sky, we are able to overcome a major problem faced by existing calibration techniques that do not model such large scale diffuse structure, i.e., the suppression of such large scale diffuse structure due to model incompleteness.</description>

      <title>GalaxyFlow: Upsampling Hydrodynamical Simulations for Realistic Mock Stellar Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological N-body simulations of galaxies operate at the level of "star particles" with a mass resolution on the scale of thousands of solar masses. Turning these simulations into stellar mock catalogs requires "upsampling" the star particles into individual stars following the same phase-space density. In this paper, we introduce two new upsampling methods. First, we describe GalaxyFlow, a sophisticated upsampling method that utilizes normalizing flows to both estimate the stellar phase space density and sample from it. Second, we improve on existing upsamplers based on adaptive kernel density estimation, using maximum likelihood estimation to fine-tune the bandwidth for such algorithms in a way that improves both the density estimation accuracy and upsampling results. We demonstrate our upsampling techniques on a neighborhood of the Solar location in two simulated galaxies: Auriga 6 and h277. Both yield smooth stellar distributions that closely resemble the stellar densities seen in the Gaia DR3 catalog. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multi-model classifier test to compare the accuracy of different upsampling methods quantitatively. This test confirms that GalaxyFlow estimates the density of the underlying star particles more accurately than methods based on kernel density estimation, at the cost of being more computationally intensive.</description>
