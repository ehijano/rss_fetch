      <title>Diversification and Stochastic Dominance: When All Eggs Are Better Put in One Basket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom warns against "putting all your eggs in one basket," and diversification is widely regarded as a reliable strategy for reducing risk. Yet under certain extreme conditions, this intuition not only fails - it reverses. This paper explores such reversals by identifying new settings in which diversification increases risk. Our main result - the one-basket theorem - provides sufficient conditions under which a weighted average of independent risks is larger, in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance, than a corresponding mixture model that concentrates all exposure on a single risk chosen at random. Our framework handles non-identically distributed risks and includes new examples, such as infinite-mean discrete Pareto variables and the St. Petersburg lottery. We further show that these reversals are not isolated anomalies, but boundary cases of a broader phenomenon: diversification always increases the likelihood of exceeding small thresholds, and under specific conditions, this local effect extends globally, resulting in first-order stochastic dominance.</description>

      <title>Can Limited Liability Increase Stability for Banks: A Dynamic Portfolio Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for the bank's decision problem, incorporating Limited Liability in the objective function. Accordingly, we consider continuous time models, with and without Limited Liability. We compare the solutions of these two models to demonstrate the effect of inclusion of Limited Liability. To solve the problem with the objective function incorporating Limited Liability, we approximate the payoff function to another set of functions for which we have closed-form solutions. Then, we show that the solution with Limited Liability incorporates less risky assets, while simultaneously increasing the resilience of the bank. After that, we use the metric of $Distance~to~Default$, from the KMV Model, to analyze the bank's resiliency, by considering that the interest rate follows the Vasicek model. Finally, we illustrate the results obtained with a numerical example.</description>
