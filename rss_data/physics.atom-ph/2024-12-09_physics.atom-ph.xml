      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Ultralong-range Rydberg molecules of Hg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralong-range Rydberg molecules, composed of an excited Rydberg atom and a ground-state atom, are characterized by large bond lengths, dipole moments, sensitivity to external fields, and an unusual binding mechanism based on low-energy elastic electron scattering. Although Rydberg molecules formed between alkali atoms have received the most attention, the additional complexity found in atoms with more than a single valence electron poses new theoretical challenges as well as new possibilities for control and design of the molecular structure. In this paper, we extend the theory of Rydberg molecules to include the additional spin coupling of the Rydberg states of a multivalent atom. We employ this theory to describe the properties of Rydberg molecules composed of mercury atoms. We calculate the potential energy curves of both heteronuclear (Hg*Rb) and homonuclear (Hg*Hg) molecules. In the former case, we propose the realization of long-range spin entanglement and remote spin flip. In the latter, we show how long-lived metastable molecular states of Hg*Hg exist as resonances above the dissociation threshold.</description>

      <title>A practical guide to feedback control for Pound-Drever-Hall laser linewidth narrowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique for laser linewidth narrowing is widely used by AMO experimentalists. However, achieving a high-performance PDH locking requires substantial engineering experience, which is scattered across literature and often lacks a cohesive control-theory perspective. Excellent pedagogical papers exist on the theory of the PDH error signal but they rarely cover feedback control. General-purpose control theory literature seldom discuss PDH laser locking specifically. Although excellent PDH review articles provide thorough knowledge and practice on both aspects but they are not reader-friendly. We extend prior works by addressing component choice and loop tuning using modern tools like a vector network analyzer. We organize multifaceted engineering considerations systematically, grounded in feedback control principles. Our target reader is researchers setting up a PDH laser lock for the first time; we eschew advanced topics like minimizing residual amplitude modulation (RAM). Our guidance is illustrated by step-by-step optimization of the lock for a 1650 nm ECDL.</description>

      <title>A method for measuring deviation from Lambert diffuse scattering law of ultracold neutrons on material walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling the motion of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) is crucial for assessing their losses, accurately measuring their lifetime, and describing other experiments. In material traps, it is necessary to account not only for specular but also for diffuse elastic reflection of UCNs from the trap walls. Typically, the Lambert cosine law is used to describe the angular distribution of diffusely scattered neutrons. However, this law lacks a rigorous theoretical derivation and is often violated. In our work, we propose an experiment to measure the deviation of the angular distribution of UCNs during diffuse scattering from the Lambert law. This deviation can be determined by the difference in the number of neutrons exiting through the central and end windows of a long narrow UCN trap. Monte Carlo simulations corresponding to a possible experiment have been performed, demonstrating a significant effect for different trap geometries.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval in positronium using field-ionization of Rydberg states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02443v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new 40 ppb measurement of the positronium $\text{1}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1} \to \text{2}^\text{3}\text{S}_\text{1}$ interval using pulsed two-photon optical spectroscopy. The transition is detected via field-ionization of atoms excited from the 2S to the 20P Rydberg state. Precise Monte-Carlo line-shape simulations allow for the accounting of effects such as Doppler and AC Stark shifts, while an optical heterodyne measurement of the excitation laser pulse is used to correct for laser frequency chirp. A value of $1\,233\,607\,210.5\pm 49.6\, \mathrm{MHz}$ was obtained. This scheme allows for the measurement of the velocity distribution of positronium atoms to correct for the second-order Doppler effect. This is the major source of systematic uncertainty expected for future measurements of this transition with a CW laser, thus, our technique paves the way toward a new generation of a high precision determination of this interval in positronium.</description>

      <title>Ultra precise determination of Cs($nS_{1/2}$) and Cs($nD_J$) quantum defects for sensing and computing: Evaluation of core contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make absolute frequency measurements of Cs Rydberg transitions, $\vert 6S_{1/2}, F=3 \rangle \rightarrow \vert nS_{1/2}~(n=23\rm{-}90)\rangle$ and $\vert nD_{3/2,5/2}~(n=21\rm{-}90)\rangle$, with an accuracy of less than $ 72\,\rm kHz$. The quantum defect parameters for the measured Rydberg series are the most precise obtained to date. The quantum defect series is terminated at $\delta_4$, showing that prior fits requiring higher order quantum defects reflect uncertainties in the observations. The precision of the measured quantum defects allow for the calculation of Rydberg electric-dipole transitions and fine-structure intervals extrapolated from high principal quantum numbers, to rival that of sophisticated many-body relativistic calculations carried out at low Rydberg principal quantum numbers. We quantitatively predict the contributions to the quantum defect parameters from core polarization and core penetration of Cs inner shell electrons. A new value for the ionization energy, consistent across the $ nS_{1/2}$ and $ nD_{3/2,5/2}$ Rydberg series, is reported at $31406.467 751 48 (14)~\rm{cm}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>A tweezer array with 6100 highly coherent atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several critical metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99%. We lay out a detailed, near-term plan to enable zone-based quantum computing with $\sim$6,000 atoms, and demonstrate a crucial ingredient thereof: coherent moves of up to 610 $\mu$m with a fidelity of $\sim$99.95%, as characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.</description>

      <title>Searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with spin sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>
