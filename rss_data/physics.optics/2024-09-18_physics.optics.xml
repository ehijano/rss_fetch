      <title>Universal radiation dynamics by temporal transitions in optical waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an excited electromagnetically open optical waveguide goes through a temporal transition of its material properties, it radiates to the ambient surroundings. In this letter, we explore this radiation and reveal, using asymptotic evaluation of path integral in the complex frequency (Laplace) plane, a peculiar space-time dependence of its frequency. Specifically, we derive an exact formula (Eq. (11)) for the instantaneous radiation frequency, which exhibits a chirp behavior with respect to time. This simple formula depends on the ambient properties and on the longitudinal wavenumber \beta of the guided mode before the temporal transition but not on the specific waveguide structure or materials. In addition, we derive a t^(-3/2) decay rate of the radiative field on time. We verify our analytic results using full-wave simulations of a dispersive and lossy Indium Tin Oxide waveguide that undergoes smooth temporal long transitions over up to ~200 cycles at the initially guided mode frequency. Thus, these theoretical findings offer valuable insights into the behavior of general optical waveguides experiencing temporal transitions and provide a powerful tool for analyzing and designing such THz and optical setups, with potential use in sensing and imaging.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional topological valley photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological valley photonics, which exploits valley degree of freedom to manipulate electromagnetic waves, offers a practical and effective pathway for various classical and quantum photonic applications across the entire spectrum. Current valley photonics, however, has been limited to two dimensions, which typically suffer from out-of-plane losses and can only manipulate the flow of light in planar geometries. Here, we have theoretically and experimentally developed a framework of three-dimensional (3D) topological valley photonics with a complete photonic bandgap and vectorial valley contrasting physics. Unlike the two-dimensional counterparts with a pair of valleys characterized by scalar valley Chern numbers, the 3D valley systems exhibit triple pairs of valleys characterized by valley Chern vectors, enabling the creation of vectorial bulk valley vortices and canalized chiral valley surface states. Notably, the valley Chern vectors and the circulating propagation direction of the valley surface states are intrinsically governed by the right-hand-thumb rule. Our findings reveal the vectorial nature of the 3D valley states and highlight their potential applications in 3D waveguiding, directional radiation, and imaging.</description>

      <title>Optical Label-Free Microscopy Characterization of Dielectric Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to relate nanoparticle properties to function, fast and detailed particle characterization, is needed. The ability to characterize nanoparticle samples using optical microscopy techniques has drastically improved over the past few decades; consequently, there are now numerous microscopy methods available for detailed characterization of particles with nanometric size. However, there is currently no ``one size fits all'' solution to the problem of nanoparticle characterization. Instead, since the available techniques have different detection limits and deliver related but different quantitative information, the measurement and analysis approaches need to be selected and adapted for the sample at hand. In this tutorial, we review the optical theory of single particle scattering and how it relates to the differences and similarities in the quantitative particle information obtained from commonly used microscopy techniques, with an emphasis on nanometric (submicron) sized dielectric particles. Particular emphasis is placed on how the optical signal relates to mass, size, structure, and material properties of the detected particles and to its combination with diffusivity-based particle sizing. We also discuss emerging opportunities in the wake of new technology development, with the ambition to guide the choice of measurement strategy based on various challenges related to different types of nanoparticle samples and associated analytical demands.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic QED and noise currents in time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic QED (MQED) is the field theory for computing quantum electromagnetic effects in dispersive media. Here we extend MQD to treat time-varying, dispersive media. For a time dependent Drude model, we find that the expected replacement ${\epsilon}({\omega}) {\to} {\epsilon}(t,{\omega})$ within standard MQED leads to nonphysical polarization currents, becoming singular in the limit of a step change in the carrier density. We show this singular behaviour can be removed through modifying the reservaoir dynamics, quantizing the resulting theory and finding the non-equilibrium, time-varying noise currents, which exhibit extra correlations due to temporal reflections within the material dynamics.</description>

      <title>Optical intensity-gradient torque due to chiral multipole interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to the ubiquity and easy-to-shape property of optical intensity, the intensity gradient force of light has been most spectacularly exploited in optical manipulation of small particles. Manifesting the intensity gradient as an optical torque to spin particles is of great fascination on both fundamental and practical sides but remains elusive. Here, we uncover the existence of the optical intensity-gradient torque in the interaction of light with chiral particles. Such a new type of torque derives from the interplay between chirality induced multipoles, which switches its direction for particles with opposite chirality. We show that this torque can be directly detected by a simple standing wave field, created with the interference of two counterpropagating plane-like waves. Our work offers a unique route to achieve rotational control of matter by tailoring the field intensity of Maxwell waves. It also establishes a framework that maps a remarkable connection among the optical forces and torques, across chiral to nonchiral.</description>

      <title>Surface Phonon Polariton Ellipsometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface phonon polaritons (SPhPs) have become a key ingredient for infrared nanophotonics, owing to their long lifetimes and the large number of polar dielectric crystals supporting them. While these evanescent modes have been thoroughly characterized by near-field mapping or far-field intensity measurements over the last decade, far-field optical experiments also providing phase information are less common. In this paper, we study surface phonon polaritons at the gallium phosphide (GaP)-air interface in the momentum domain using the Otto-type prism coupling geometry. We combine this method with spectroscopic ellipsometry to obtain both amplitude and phase information of the reflected waves across the entire reststrahlen band of GaP. By adjusting the prism-sample air gap width, we systematically study the dependence of the ellipsometry parameters on the optical coupling efficiency. In particular, we show that the combined observation of both ellipsometry parameters - amplitude and phase - provides a powerful tool for the detection of SPhPs, even in the presence of high optical losses. Finally, we theoretically study how surface phonon polariton ellipsometry can reveal the emergence of vibrational strong coupling through changes in the topology of their complex plane trajectories, opening up a new perspective on light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Scaling of pseudospectra in exponentially sensitive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the important features of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians is the existence of a unique type of singularities, the so-called exceptional points. When the corresponding systems operate around such singularities, they exhibit ultrasensitive behavior that has no analog in conservative systems. An alternative way to realize such ultra-sensitivity relies on asymmetric couplings. Here we provide a comprehensive analysis based on pseudospectra, that shows the origin of exponential sensitivity, without relying on topological zero modes or the localization of all eigenstates (skin effect), but on the underlying extreme non-normality of the problem. In particular, we consider four different type of lattices (Hatano-Nelson, Sylvester-Kac, NH-SSH and NH-Random lattice) and identify the conditions for exponential sensitivity as a function of the lattice size. Complex and structured pseudospectra reveal the signatures of exponential sensitivity both on the eigenvalue spectra and on the underlying dynamics. Our study, may open new directions on studies related to the exploitation of non-normality for constructing ultra-sensitive systems that do not rely on the existence of EPs.</description>

      <title>Chiral patterning of rough surfaces with vortex laser beams: from structured polarization to twisted forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to create surface structures with precisely controlled chirality remains a major challenge in laser-matter interaction experiments. In this work, we theoretically study the interaction of vortex laser beams, characterized by spiral polarization patterns and twisted wavefronts, with rough metallic surfaces in order to create surface patterns with chirality. Using numerical simulations based on the finite-difference time-domain method, we investigate how spin and orbital angular momenta influence the inhomogeneous energy absorption at the surface and generate twisted optical forces that can drive topographic reorganization. We show how different structured light fields can create intricate patterns with chiral features on a material surface. We emphasize the crucial role of polarization and spatial inhomogeneity of the light field in the generation of asymmetric torque forces that directly affect the surface dynamics. Our electromagnetic simulations show how vortex beams can be used to create chiral surface structures, expanding our knowledge of laser-generated periodic surface structures and opening up new possibilities for chiral surface engineering.</description>

      <title>Enwrapped Perylene Bisimide Enables Room Temperature Polariton Lasing and Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perylene bisimides (PBIs) are organic dyes with photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) close to unity in solution and great thermal and photo-chemical stability. These features alongside the tunability of their solid-state packing arrangement via chemical functionalization make this material class an excellent candidate for exciton-polariton lasing at room temperature. Polariton lasing is well understood in III-V semiconductors at cryogenic temperatures, however, the search for emitter materials for robust and versatile room temperature applications is ongoing. While e.g. perovskites and several organic materials have been identified to support polariton lasing, many of these materials lack tunability and long-term stability under ambient conditions. Here, we fabricate optical microcavities using a strongly enwrapped PBI chromophore with prevailing monomer-like absorption and emission properties in the solid state. Voluminous bay-substituents prevent stacking induced PLQY-quenching, thereby enabling polariton lasing at room temperature. Additionally, photonic confinement in single hemispheric resonators is demonstrated leading to localized polaritonic modes with discrete energies, as well as optical lattices revealing distinct polaritonic band-structures. Due to the possibility of tunable properties by the precise control of the solid-state packing arrangement of PBI emitters, our results pave the way for polarization-dependent light-matter coupling, including topological photonic effects within oriented crystalline thin-film microcavity structures.</description>

      <title>Multiphoton interference in a single-spatial-mode quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiphoton interference is crucial to many photonic quantum technologies. In particular, interference forms the basis of optical quantum information processing platforms and can lead to significant computational advantages. It is therefore interesting to study the interference arising from various states of light in large interferometric networks. Here, we implement a quantum walk in a highly stable, low-loss, multiport interferometer with up to 24 ultrafast time bins. This time-bin interferometer comprises a sequence of birefringent crystals which produce pulses separated by 4.3\,ps, all along a single optical axis. Ultrafast Kerr gating in an optical fiber is employed to time-demultiplex the output from the quantum walk. We measure one-, two-, and three-photon interference arising from various input state combinations, including a heralded single-photon state, a thermal state, and an attenuated coherent state at one or more input ports. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast time bins are a promising platform to observe large-scale multiphoton interference.</description>

      <title>Quantum-like nonlinear interferometry with frequency-engineered classical light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum interferometry methods exploit quantum resources, such as photonic entanglement, to enhance phase estimation beyond classical limits. Nonlinear optics has served as a workhorse for the generation of entangled photon pairs, ensuring both energy and phase conservation, but at the cost of limited rate and degraded signal-to-noise ratio compared to laser-based interferometry approaches. We present a "quantum-like" nonlinear optical method that reaches super-resolution in single-photon detection regime. This is achieved by replacing photon-pairs by coherent states of light, mimicking quantum properties through classical nonlinear optics processes. Our scheme utilizes two high-brightness lasers. This results in a substantially greater signal-to-noise ratio compared to its quantum counterpart. Such an approach paves the way to significantly reduced acquisition times, providing a pathway to explore signals across a broader range of bandwidth. The need to increase the frequency bandwidth of the quantum sensor significantly motivates the potential applications of this pathway.</description>

      <title>On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>Resonant EO combs: Beyond the standard phase noise model of frequency combs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A resonant electro-optic (EO) frequency comb is generated through electro-optic modulation of laser light within an optical resonator. Compared to cavity-less EO combs generated in a single pass through a modulator, resonant EO combs can produce broader spectra with lower radio frequency (RF) power and offer a measure of noise filtering beyond the cavity's linewidth. Understanding, measuring, and suppressing the sources of phase noise in resonant EO combs is crucial for their applications in metrology, astrophotonics, optical clock generation, and fiber-optic communication. According to the standard phase noise model of frequency combs, only two variables - the common mode offset and repetition rate phase noise - are needed to fully describe the phase noise of comb lines. However, in this work we demonstrate analytically, numerically, and experimentally that this standard model breaks down for resonant EO combs at short timescales (high frequencies) and under certain comb parameters. Specifically, a third phase noise component emerges. Consequently, resonant EO combs feature qualitatively different phase noise from their cavity-less counterparts and may not exhibit the anticipated noise filtering. A more complete description of the deviations from the standard phase noise model is critical to accurately predict the performance of frequency combs. The description presented here paves the way for improved designs tailored to applications such as super-continuum generation and optical communication.</description>

      <title>Shaping space-time wavepackets beyond the paraxial limit using a dispersion magnifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Space-time wavepackets (STWPs) have received significant attention since they can propagate in free space at arbitrary group velocity without dispersion and diffraction. However, at present, the generation of STWPs has been limited to the paraxial regime. Here we show that conventional optical elements can be used to extend STWPs beyond the paraxial regime. A dispersion magnifier, consisting of two lenses and a beam expander, applies spatiotemporal shaping to paraxial STWPs to create nonparaxial STWPs. The control of the magnification ratio results in versatile engineering capabilities on group velocity, beam diameter, and propagation distance. As an example, we numerically demonstrated long-distance propagation or slow group velocity of the output wavepacket with subwavelength cross-sections.</description>

Abstract: In this manuscript, after discussing in detail the internals of our recently developed method, the dynamical projective operatorial approach (DPOA), we provide the framework to apply this method to pumped semiconductor lattice systems and, in particular, to study and analyze their electronic excitations and TR-ARPES signal. The expressions for relevant out-of-equilibrium Green's functions and TR-ARPES signal are given within the DPOA framework and, defining a retarded TR-ARPES signal, it is shown that it is possible to obtain an out-of-equilibrium version of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. We clarify how single- and multi-photon resonances, rigid shifts, band dressings, and different types of sidebands emerge in the TR-ARPES signal. We also propose protocols for evaluating the strength of single- and multi-photon resonances and for assigning the residual excited electronic population at each crystal momentum and band to a specific excitation process. Hamiltonians, where intra- and inter-band transitions are selectively inhibited, are defined and used to analyze the effects on the TR-ARPES signal and the residual electronic excited population. Three relevant cases of light-matter coupling are examined within the dipole gauge: only a local dipole, only the Peierls substitution in the hopping term, and both terms at once. The transient and residual pump effects are studied in detail, including the consequences of the lattice symmetries at different crystal momenta on the TR-ARPES signal. A detailed study of the dependence of the TR-ARPES signal on the probe-pulse characteristics is also reported. To provide a guideline for understanding the complex effects and interplays and the variety of possible physical phenomena without being limited by the characteristics of a single particular real material, we have chosen to study a prototypical pumped two-band semiconductor lattice system.</description>

      <title>Fundamental constants from photon-photon scattering in three-beam collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the elastic scattering of real photons on an electromagnetic field would allow the fundamental low-energy constants of quantum electrodynamics (QED) to be experimentally determined. We show that scenarios involving the collision of three laser beams have several advantages over conventional two-beam scenarios. The kinematics of a three-beam collision allows for a higher signal-to-noise ratio in the detection region, without the need for polarimetry and separates out contributions from different orders of photon scattering. A planar configuration of colliding a photon beam from an x-ray free electron laser with two optical beams is studied in detail. We show that measurements of elastic photon scattering and vacuum birefringence are possible with currently available technology.</description>
