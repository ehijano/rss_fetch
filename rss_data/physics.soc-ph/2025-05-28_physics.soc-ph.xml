      <title>Scaling law of urban individual tour behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysing and modeling urban individual tour behavior are of great significance for a wide range of applications such as transportation management and urban planning. However, the urban tour length distribution has long been neglected in individual mobility models that can be found in recent literature. To fill in this gap, we analyse Foursquare user check-in data and find that urban human tour length distribution follows a power-law with exponential truncation. This law also appears in China's urban heavy truck trajectory data which can reflect commercial vehicle mobility. To reproduce the universal scaling law on tours of urban human and truck mobility, we introduce a tour terminate-continue model. Our model can not only reproduce the urban tour length distribution, but also the Heaps' law and Zipf's law in human and truck mobility, providing a new perspective for characterizing individual human mobility.</description>

      <title>Larger cities, more commuters, more crime? The role of inter-city commuting in the scaling of urban crime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities attract a daily influx of non-resident commuters, reflecting their role in wider urban networks -- not as isolated places. However, it remains unclear how this inter-connectivity shapes the way crime scales with population, given that larger cities tend to receive more commuters and experience more crime. Here, we investigate how inter-city commuting relates to the population--crime relationship. We find that larger cities receive proportionately more commuters, which in turn is associated with higher crime levels. Specifically, each 1% increase in inbound commuters corresponds to a 0.32% rise in theft and 0.20% rise in burglary, holding population constant. We show that models incorporating both population and commuter inflows better explain crime variation than population-only models. These findings underscore the importance of considering how cities are connected -- not just their population size -- in disentangling the population--crime relationship.</description>

      <title>Insights on structure and influence from the adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra of intersecting ring networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchronisation is a pervasive phenomenon of emerging collective behaviour observed to develop spontaneously across both natural and engineered systems. The process and patterns of synchronisation are highly influenced by initial conditions and network topology. Synchronisation follows a network's hierarchal structure; developing first at a local level before conglomeration of local clusters typically drives synchronisation at a global scale. The structure and influence of global and local features play a key role in node synchronisation. These differing insights are shown to be uncovered through eigenspectra analyses of ring networks. These network topologies exhibit complex patterns of stable and unstable synchronisation - despite apparently simple coupling schemes - as well as distinctive spectral fingerprints. Intersecting ring networks, with a common focal point, combine to produce hubs of high connectivity at the intersections whose spectral analyses can denote the characteristics and distinctions of structure and influence. The adjacency eigenspectrum detects salient network structures, for example hubs of high connectivity, whilst the Laplacian spectrum indentifies the relative influence of nodes due to their associated spanning trees within the network constituent structures.</description>

      <title>Parameter Effects in ReCom Ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensemble analysis has become central to redistricting litigation, but parameter effects remain understudied. We analyze 315 ReCom ensembles across the three legislative chambers in 7 states, systematically varying the population tolerance, county preservation strength, and algorithm variant. To validate convergence, we introduce new methods to approximate effective sample size and measure redundancy. We find that varying the population tolerance has a negligible effect on all scores, whereas the algorithm and county-preservation parameters can significantly affect some metrics, inconsistently in some cases but surprisingly consistently in others across jurisdictions. These findings suggest parameter choices should be thoughtfully considered when using ReCom ensembles.</description>

      <title>Breaking co-existence: zealotry vs. nonlinear social impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while co-existence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry -- i.e., the presence of agents who never change state -- can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.</description>

      <title>Two-step dimensionality reduction of human mobility data: From potential landscapes to spatiotemporal insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spatiotemporal patterns of human mobility is crucial for addressing societal challenges, such as epidemic control and urban transportation optimization. Despite advancements in data collection, the complexity and scale of mobility data continue to pose significant analytical challenges. Existing methods often result in losing location-specific details and fail to fully capture the intricacies of human movement. This study proposes a two-step dimensionality reduction framework to overcome existing limitations. First, we construct a potential landscape of human flow from origin-destination (OD) matrices using combinatorial Hodge theory, preserving essential spatial and structural information while enabling an intuitive visualization of flow patterns. Second, we apply principal component analysis (PCA) to the potential landscape, systematically identifying major spatiotemporal patterns. By implementing this two-step reduction method, we reveal significant shifts during a pandemic, characterized by an overall declines in mobility and stark contrasts between weekdays and holidays. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our framework in uncovering complex mobility patterns and provide valuable insights into urban planning and public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable, limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches, our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal ambition in business, politics and life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In business, politics and life, folk wisdom encourages people to aim for above-average results, but to not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. Here, we mathematically formalize and extend this folk wisdom. We model a time-limited search for strategies having uncertain rewards. At each time step, the searcher either is satisfied with their current reward or continues searching. We prove that the optimal satisfaction threshold is both finite and strictly larger than the mean of available rewards -- matching the folk wisdom. We show that being too ambitious has a higher expected cost than being too cautious. We show that the optimal satisfaction threshold increases if the search time is longer, or if the reward distribution is rugged (i.e., has low autocorrelation) or left skewed. The skewness result reveals counterintuitive contrasts between optimal ambition and optimal risk taking. We show that using upward social comparison to assess the reward landscape substantially harms expected performance. We show how these insights can be applied in real-world settings, using examples from entrepreneurship, economic policy, political campaigns, online dating and college admissions.</description>

      <title>Fine structure of phase diagram for social impact theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the social impact theory introduced by Latan\'e is reconsidered. A fully differentiated society is considered; that is, initially every actor has their own opinion. The equivalent of Muller's ratchet guards that -- even for the non-deterministic case (with a positive social temperature) -- any opinion once removed from the opinion space does not appear again. With computer simulation, we construct the phase diagram for Latan\'e model based on the number of surviving opinions after various evolution times. The phase diagram is constructed on the two-dimensional plane of model control parameters responsible for the effective range of interaction among actors and the social temperature. Introducing the Muller's ratchet-like mechanism gives a non-zero chance for any opinion to be removed from the system. We believe that in such a case, for any positive temperature, ultimately a consensus is reached. However, even for a moderate system size, the time to reach consensus is very long. In contrast, for the deterministic case (without social temperature), the system may be frozen with clusters of actors having several different opinions, or even reach the cycle limit (with blinking structures).</description>

      <title>A data augmentation strategy for deep neural networks with application to epidemic modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we integrate the predictive capabilities of compartmental disease dynamics models with machine learning ability to analyze complex, high-dimensional data and uncover patterns that conventional models may overlook. Specifically, we present a proof of concept demonstrating the application of data-driven methods and deep neural networks to a recently introduced Susceptible-Infected-Recovered type model with social features, including a saturated incidence rate, to improve epidemic prediction and forecasting. Our results show that a robust data augmentation strategy trough suitable data-driven models can improve the reliability of Feed-Forward Neural Networks and Nonlinear Autoregressive Networks, providing a complementary strategy to Physics-Informed Neural Networks, particularly in settings where data augmentation from mechanistic models can enhance learning. This approach enhances the ability to handle nonlinear dynamics and offers scalable, data-driven solutions for epidemic forecasting, prioritizing predictive accuracy over the constraints of physics-based models. Numerical simulations of the lockdown and post-lockdown phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy and Spain validate our methodology.</description>
