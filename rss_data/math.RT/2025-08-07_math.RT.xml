      <title>Tensor powers of representations of (diagram) monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study tensor powers of representations of finite monoids, focusing on the growth behavior of their composition length and the number of indecomposable summands. Special attention is given to diagram monoids such as the Temperley-Lieb, Motzkin, and Brauer monoids. For these examples, we compute explicit data, including some character tables, and analyze patterns in the decomposition of their tensor powers.</description>

      <title>On representations of the multi-virtual braid group $M_kVB_n$ and the multi-welded braid group $M_kWB_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper classifies complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of the multiple virtual braid group $M_kVB_n$ into $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ for $n\geq3$ and $k &gt;1$, showing that such representations fall into exactly $2^{k+1}+1$ distinct types, out of which except three all are unfaithful. In addition, this paper investigates complex homogeneous $2$-local representations of the multiple welded braid group $M_kWB_n$ into $\mathrm{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ for $n\geq3$ and $k &gt;1$, identifying $3 \cdot 2^{k-1} +1$ representations. Moreover, the article includes a construction of a non-local representation of $M_2WB_3$ that extends the known LKB representation of the braid group on $3$ strands, namely $B_3$, making a path towards constructing non-local representations of $M_kWB_n$ in general.</description>

      <title>Intertwining Algebras and Affine Hecke Algebras for Finite Central Extensions of Classical $p$-adic Groups with Application to Metaplectic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite central extension $\tilde{G}$ of a classical $p$-adic reductive group, we consider the endomorphism algebra of some induced projective generator \`a la Bernstein of the category of smooth representations of $\tilde{G}$. In the case where the Levi subgroups decompose, we can compute this algebra to get a result similar to the one previously obtained by the first author for classical $p$-adic groups, showing that this intertwining algebra is a twisted semi-direct product of an affine Hecke algebra with parameters by a twisted finite group algebra. We discuss also the general case. We give then an application to the category of genuine representations of a $p$-adic metaplectic group. Using results of C. M\oe glin relative to the Howe correspondence, we show that the Bernstein components of these groups are equivalent to tensor products of categories of unipotent representations of classical groups. This generalizes a previous result of the first author. It implies an equivalence of categories between the category of genuine representations of the $p$-adic metaplectic group and the direct sums of those of smooth representations of the corresponding odd special orthogonal group and its pure inner form.</description>

      <title>A Gentle Introduction to Algebraic Operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This text, based on the author's Bachelor's thesis, introduces the theory of Algebraic Operads, a mathematical formalism that provides a unifying framework for modern algebra. We demonstrate how the fundamental theories of associative, commutative, and Lie algebras can be fully recovered as categories of representations of three archetypal operads: $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$ -- the so-called 'three graces' of algebra.
  Following a deductive and self-contained approach, the notion of an operad is initially presented in its classical form, as a single-object multicategory. Subsequently, alternative definitions -- namely, the partial and functorial definitions -- are provided. This framework allows for the extension of classical algebraic notions, such as free objects and quotients, to the operadic context, thereby enabling operads to be formally presented through generators and relations.
  The central result of this work is the rigorous proof of the correspondence between operads and algebras. We establish isomorphisms of categories between the algebras over the operads $\mathsf{As}$, $\mathsf{Com}$ and $\mathsf{Lie}$, and their respective classical counterparts.
  This thesis thus highlights how the theory of operads offers a higher-level language for algebra, encoding entire algebraic theories within single mathematical objects. This formalism not only unifies known structures but also lays the foundation for advanced concepts, such as 'algebras up to homotopy,' with applications in fields like theoretical physics and geometry.</description>

      <title>From Tensor Algebras to Hyperbolic Kac-Moody Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to study hyperbolic Kac-Moody algebras, and more specifically, the Feingold-Frenkel algebra $\mathfrak{F}$, which is based on considering the tensor algebra of level-one states before descending to the Lie algebra by converting tensor products into multiple commutators. This method enables us to exploit the presence of mutually commuting coset Virasoro algebras, whose number grows without bound with increasing affine level. We present the complete decomposition of the tensor algebra under the affine and coset Virasoro symmetries for all levels $\ell\leq 5$, as well as the maximal tensor ground states from which all elements of $\mathfrak{F}$ up to level five can be (redundantly) generated by the joint action of the affine and coset Virasoro generators, and subsequent conversion to multi-commutators, which are then expressed in terms of transversal and longitudinal DDF states. We outline novel directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Comparing cluster algebras on braid varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braid varieties parametrize linear configurations of flags with transversality conditions dictated by positive braids. They include and generalize reduced double Bruhat cells, positroid varieties, open Bott-Samelson varieties, and Richardson varieties, among others. Recently, two cluster algebra structures were independently constructed in the coordinate rings of braid varieties: one using weaves and the other using Deodhar geometry. The main result of the article is that these two cluster algebras coincide. More generally, our comparative study matches the different concepts and results from each approach to the other, both on the combinatorial and algebraic geometric aspects.</description>

      <title>Classifying Wavelet Coorbit Spaces in Dimension 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coorbit spaces provide a rigorous framework for the assessment of the approximation theoretic properties of generalized wavelet systems. It is therefore useful to understand when two different wavelet systems give rise to the same scales of coorbit spaces. This paper provides an exhaustive answer to this question for the case of continuous wavelet transforms associated with matrix groups in dimension two.</description>

      <title>How are pseudo-$q$-traces related to (co)ends?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb V$ be an $\mathbb N$-graded $C_2$-cofinite vertex operator algebra (VOA), not necessarily rational or self-dual. Using a special case of the sewing-factorization theorem from [GZ25a], we show that the end $\mathbb E=\int_{\mathbb M\in\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)}\mathbb M\otimes_{\mathbb C}\mathbb M'$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2})$ (where $\mathbb{M}'$ is the contragredient module of $\mathbb{M}$) admits a natural structure of associative $\mathbb C$-algebra compatible with its $\mathbb{V}^{\otimes2}$-module structure. Moreover, we show that a suitable category $\mathrm{Coh}_{\mathrm{L}}(\mathbb E)$ of left $\mathbb E$-modules is isomorphic, as a linear category, to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, and that the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks is isomorphic to the space $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathbb E)$ of symmetric linear functionals on $\mathbb E$.
  Combining these results with the main theorem of [GZ25b], we prove a conjecture of Gainutdinov-Runkel: For any projective generator $\mathbb G$ in $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, the pseudo-$q$-trace construction yields a linear isomorphism from $\mathrm{SLF}(\mathrm{End}_{\mathbb V}(\mathbb{G})^{\mathrm{opp}})$ to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$.
  In particular, if $A$ is a unital finite-dimensional $\mathbb C$-algebra such that the category of finite-dimensional left $A$-modules is equivalent to $\mathrm{Mod}(\mathbb V)$, then $\mathrm{SLF}(A)$ is linearly isomorphic to the space of vacuum torus conformal blocks of $\mathbb V$. This confirms a conjecture of Arike-Nagatomo.</description>

      <title>Derived equivalence for the simple flop of type $D_4$ via tilting bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to discuss the derived equivalence problem for a local model of the simple flop of type $D_4$, which was found by Kanemitsu. First, tilting bundles on both sides of the flop are constructed, and then those tilting bundles are applied to prove the derived equivalence. This derived equivalence for the flop deduces derived equivalences between general K3 surfaces of degree $12$. The study of this example of a flop is very similar to the author's previous work for the simple of flop of type $G_2^{\dagger}$, but the construction and the analysis of tilting bundles become harder.</description>

      <title>Symmetric modules over the infinite polynomial ring I: nilpotent quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cohen proved that the infinite variable polynomial ring $R=k[x_1,x_2,\ldots]$ is noetherian with respect to the action of the infinite symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}$. The first two authors began a program to understand the $\mathfrak{S}$-equivariant algebra of $R$ in detail. In previous work, they classified the $\mathfrak{S}$-prime ideals of $R$. An important example of an $\mathfrak{S}$-prime is the ideal $\mathfrak{h}_s$ generated by $(s+1)$st powers of the variables. In this paper, we study the category of $R/\mathfrak{h}_s$-modules. We obtain a number of results, and mention just three here: (a) we determine the Grothendieck group of the category; (b) we show that the Krull--Gabriel dimension is $s$; and (c) we obtain generators for the derived category. This paper will play a key role in subsequent work where we study general modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To a quiver we associate a finite length monoidal abelian category which categorifies the corresponding preprojective K-theoretic Hall algebra of Varagnolo-Vasserot. The simples in this category provide a (dual) canonical basis of the Hall algebra. In particular, if the quiver is affine, this provides a basis for the positive half of the corresponding quantum toroidal algebra. We also show that this abelian category is naturally endowed with renormalized r-matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a rank function on a $(d+2)$-angulated category $\mathcal{C}$ which generalises the notion of a rank function on a triangulated category. Inspired by work of Chuang and Lazarev, for $d$ an odd positive integer, we prove that there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions defined on objects in $\mathcal{C}$ and rank functions defined on morphisms in $\mathcal{C}$. Inspired by work of Conde, Gorsky, Marks and Zvonareva, for $d$ an odd positive integer, we show there is a bijective correspondence between rank functions on $\operatorname{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ and additive functions on $\operatorname{\mathsf{mod}}(\operatorname{\mathsf{Proj}}A)$, where $\operatorname{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ is endowed with the Amiot-Lin $(d+2)$-angulated category structure. This allows us to show that every integral rank function on $\operatorname{\mathsf{Proj}}A$ can be decomposed into irreducible rank functions.</description>

      <title>Integer quadratic forms and extensions of subsets of linearly independent roots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider subsets of linearly independent roots in a certain root system $\varPhi$. Let $S'$ be such a subset, and let $S'$ be associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$. The main question of the paper: what root $\gamma \in \varPhi$ can be added to $S'$ so that $S' \cup \gamma$ is also a subset of linearly independent roots? This extra root $\gamma$ is called the linkage root. The vector $\gamma^{\nabla}$ of inner products $\{(\gamma,\tau'_i)\mid \tau'_i \in S'\}$ is called the linkage label vector. Let $B_{\Gamma'}$ be the Cartan matrix associated with $\Gamma'$. It is shown that $\gamma$ is a linkage root if and only if $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}(\gamma^{\nabla}) &lt; 2$, where $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$ is a quadratic form with the matrix inverse to $B_{\Gamma'}$. The set of all linkage roots for $\Gamma'$ is called a linkage system and is denoted by $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$. The Cartan matrix associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$ is conjugate to the Cartan matrix associated with some Dynkin diagram $\Gamma$, [St23]. The sizes of $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$ and $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma)$ are the same. Let $W^{\vee}$ be the Weyl group of the quadratic form $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$. This group acts on the linkage system and forms several orbits. The sizes and structure of orbits for linkage systems $\mathscr{L}(D_l)$ and $\mathscr{L}(D_l(a_k))$ are presented.</description>

Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field. Let $R$ be a finite dimensional commutative local $k$-algebra and let $Q$ be a quiver with no oriented cycles. In this paper, we study (signed) $\tau$-exceptional sequences over the algebra $\Lambda = R\otimes kQ$, which is isomorphic to $RQ$. We show there is a bijection between the set of complete (signed) $\tau$-exceptional sequences in $\text{mod }kQ$ and the set of complete (signed) $\tau$-exceptional sequences in $\text{mod }\Lambda$. Moreover, we prove that every $\tau$-perpendicular subcategory of $\text{mod }\Lambda$ is equivalent to the module category of $R\otimes kQ'$, for some quiver $Q'$. As a consequence, we prove that the $\tau$-cluster morphism categories of $kQ$ and $\Lambda$ are equivalent.</description>

We give a dynamical characterisation of periodic elements via their action on the corresponding 2-Calabi--Yau category and on its space of (fusion equivariant) Bridgeland stability conditions. The main theorem is that an element $\beta$ is periodic if and only if $\beta$ has a fixed point in the stability manifold.</description>

      <title>Geometric models of simple Lie algebras via singularity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that ADE Dynkin diagrams classify both the simply-laced simple Lie algebras and simple singularities. We introduce a polygonal wheel in a plane for each case of ADE, called the Coxeter wheel. We show that equivalence classes of edges and spokes of a Coxeter wheel form a geometric root system isomorphic to the classical root system of the corresponding type. This wheel is in fact derived from the Milnor fiber of corresponding simple singularities of two variables, and the bilinear form on the geometric root system is the negative of its symmetrized Seifert form. Furthermore, we give a completely geometric definition of simple Lie algebras using arcs, Seifert form and variation operator of the singularity theory.</description>

      <title>Birational Weyl group actions and q-Painleve equations via mutation combinatorics in cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06704v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cluster algebra is an algebraic structure generated by operations of a quiver (a directed graph) called the mutations and their associated simple birational mappings. By using a graph-combinatorial approach, we present a systematic way to derive a tropical, i.e. subtraction-free birational, representation of Weyl groups from cluster algebras. Our results provide an extensive class of Weyl group actions, including previously known examples with algebro-geometric background, and hence are relevant to the q-Painleve equations and their higher-order extensions. Key ingredients of the argument are the combinatorial aspects of the reflection associated with a cycle subgraph in the quiver. We also study symplectic structures of the discrete dynamical systems thus obtained. The normal form of a skew-symmetric integer matrix allows us to choose Darboux coordinates while preserving the birationality.</description>

      <title>Cluster algebras and monotone Lagrangian tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the construction of Newton--Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations via cluster algebras in [GHKK18, FO25], we consider a family of Newton--Okounkov polytopes of a complex smooth Fano variety $X$ related by a composition of tropicalized cluster mutations. According to the work of [HK15], the toric degeneration associated with each Newton--Okounkov polytope $\Delta$ in the family produces a completely integrable system of $X$ over $\Delta$. We investigate circumstances in which each completely integrable system possesses a monotone Lagrangian torus fiber. We provide a sufficient condition, based on the data of tropical integer points and exchange matrices, for the family of constructed monotone Lagrangian tori to contain infinitely many monotone Lagrangian tori, no two of which are related by any symplectomorphism. By employing this criterion and exploiting the correspondence between the tropical integer points and the dual canonical basis elements, we generate infinitely many distinct monotone Lagrangian tori on flag manifolds of arbitrary type except in a few cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify two distinct approaches to the derived equivalence for the stratified Mukai flop of cotangent bundles of Grassmannians -- one induced by the geometric categorical sl(2) action, and the other through the magic window category of graded matrix factorizations on the gauged Landau-Ginzburg model -- via the Kn\"orrer periodicity.</description>
