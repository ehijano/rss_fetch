      <title>Robust Barycenter Estimation using Semi-Unbalanced Neural Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common challenge in aggregating data from multiple sources can be formalized as an \textit{Optimal Transport} (OT) barycenter problem, which seeks to compute the average of probability distributions with respect to OT discrepancies. However, the presence of outliers and noise in the data measures can significantly hinder the performance of traditional statistical methods for estimating OT barycenters. To address this issue, we propose a novel, scalable approach for estimating the \textit{robust} continuous barycenter, leveraging the dual formulation of the \textit{(semi-)unbalanced} OT problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to develop an algorithm for robust barycenters under the continuous distribution setup. Our method is framed as a $\min$-$\max$ optimization problem and is adaptable to \textit{general} cost function. We rigorously establish the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed method and demonstrate its robustness to outliers and class imbalance through a number of illustrative experiments.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias of Mirror Descent for Shallow Neural Networks in Univariate Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the implicit bias of mirror flow in univariate least squares error regression with wide and shallow neural networks. For a broad class of potential functions, we show that mirror flow exhibits lazy training and has the same implicit bias as ordinary gradient flow when the network width tends to infinity. For ReLU networks, we characterize this bias through a variational problem in function space. Our analysis includes prior results for ordinary gradient flow as a special case and lifts limitations which required either an intractable adjustment of the training data or networks with skip connections. We further introduce scaled potentials and show that for these, mirror flow still exhibits lazy training but is not in the kernel regime. For networks with absolute value activations, we show that mirror flow with scaled potentials induces a rich class of biases, which generally cannot be captured by an RKHS norm. A takeaway is that whereas the parameter initialization determines how strongly the curvature of the learned function is penalized at different locations of the input space, the scaled potential determines how the different magnitudes of the curvature are penalized.</description>

      <title>Is Score Matching Suitable for Estimating Point Processes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score matching estimators have gained widespread attention in recent years partly because they are free from calculating the integral of normalizing constant, thereby addressing the computational challenges in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Some existing works have proposed score matching estimators for point processes. However, this work demonstrates that the incompleteness of the estimators proposed in those works renders them applicable only to specific problems, and they fail for more general point processes. To address this issue, this work introduces the weighted score matching estimator to point processes. Theoretically, we prove the consistency of our estimator and establish its rate of convergence. Experimental results indicate that our estimator accurately estimates model parameters on synthetic data and yields results consistent with MLE on real data. In contrast, existing score matching estimators fail to perform effectively. Codes are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/KenCao2007/WSM_TPP}.</description>

      <title>pFedGame -- Decentralized Federated Learning using Game Theory in Dynamic Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional federated learning frameworks suffer from several challenges including performance bottlenecks at the central aggregation server, data bias, poor model convergence, and exposure to model poisoning attacks, and limited trust in the centralized infrastructure. In the current paper, a novel game theory-based approach called pFedGame is proposed for decentralized federated learning, best suitable for temporally dynamic networks. The proposed algorithm works without any centralized server for aggregation and incorporates the problem of vanishing gradients and poor convergence over temporally dynamic topology among federated learning participants. The solution comprises two sequential steps in every federated learning round, for every participant. First, it selects suitable peers for collaboration in federated learning. Secondly, it executes a two-player constant sum cooperative game to reach convergence by applying an optimal federated learning aggregation strategy. Experiments performed to assess the performance of pFedGame in comparison to existing methods in decentralized federated learning have shown promising results with accuracy higher than 70% for heterogeneous data.</description>

      <title>Visualising Feature Learning in Deep Neural Networks by Diagonalizing the Forward Feature Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) exhibit a remarkable ability to automatically learn data representations, finding appropriate features without human input. Here we present a method for analysing feature learning by decomposing DNNs into 1) a forward feature-map $\Phi$ that maps the input dataspace to the post-activations of the penultimate layer, and 2) a final linear layer that classifies the data. We diagonalize $\Phi$ with respect to the gradient descent operator and track feature learning by measuring how the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues of $\Phi$ change during training. Across many popular architectures and classification datasets, we find that DNNs converge, after just a few epochs, to a minimal feature (MF) regime dominated by a number of eigenfunctions equal to the number of classes. This behaviour resembles the neural collapse phenomenon studied at longer training times. For other DNN-data combinations, such as a fully connected network on CIFAR10, we find an extended feature (EF) regime where significantly more features are used. Optimal generalisation performance upon hyperparameter tuning typically coincides with the MF regime, but we also find examples of poor performance within the MF regime. Finally, we recast the phenomenon of neural collapse into a kernel picture which can be extended to broader tasks such as regression.</description>

      <title>Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the generalization properties of binary logistic classification in a simplified setting, for which a "memorizing" and "generalizing" solution can always be strictly defined, and elucidate empirically and analytically the mechanism underlying Grokking in its dynamics. We analyze the asymptotic long-time dynamics of logistic classification on a random feature model with a constant label and show that it exhibits Grokking, in the sense of delayed generalization and non-monotonic test loss. We find that Grokking is amplified when classification is applied to training sets which are on the verge of linear separability. Even though a perfect generalizing solution always exists, we prove the implicit bias of the logisitc loss will cause the model to overfit if the training data is linearly separable from the origin. For training sets that are not separable from the origin, the model will always generalize perfectly asymptotically, but overfitting may occur at early stages of training. Importantly, in the vicinity of the transition, that is, for training sets that are almost separable from the origin, the model may overfit for arbitrarily long times before generalizing. We gain more insights by examining a tractable one-dimensional toy model that quantitatively captures the key features of the full model. Finally, we highlight intriguing common properties of our findings with recent literature, suggesting that grokking generally occurs in proximity to the interpolation threshold, reminiscent of critical phenomena often observed in physical systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Runge-Kutta Methods: Provable Acceleration of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models play a pivotal role in contemporary generative modeling, claiming state-of-the-art performance across various domains. Despite their superior sample quality, mainstream diffusion-based stochastic samplers like DDPM often require a large number of score function evaluations, incurring considerably higher computational cost compared to single-step generators like generative adversarial networks. While several acceleration methods have been proposed in practice, the theoretical foundations for accelerating diffusion models remain underexplored. In this paper, we propose and analyze a training-free acceleration algorithm for SDE-style diffusion samplers, based on the stochastic Runge-Kutta method. The proposed sampler provably attains $\varepsilon^2$ error -- measured in KL divergence -- using $\widetilde O(d^{3/2} / \varepsilon)$ score function evaluations (for sufficiently small $\varepsilon$), strengthening the state-of-the-art guarantees $\widetilde O(d^{3} / \varepsilon)$ in terms of dimensional dependency. Numerical experiments validate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Smoothed Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical results in statistical learning typically consider two extreme data-generating models: i.i.d. instances from an unknown distribution, or fully adversarial instances, often much more challenging statistically. To bridge the gap between these models, recent work introduced the smoothed framework, in which at each iteration an adversary generates instances from a distribution constrained to have density bounded by $\sigma^{-1}$ compared to some fixed base measure $\mu$. This framework interpolates between the i.i.d. and adversarial cases, depending on the value of $\sigma$. For the classical online prediction problem, most prior results in smoothed online learning rely on the arguably strong assumption that the base measure $\mu$ is known to the learner, contrasting with standard settings in the PAC learning or consistency literature. We consider the general agnostic problem in which the base measure is unknown and values are arbitrary. Along this direction, Block et al. showed that empirical risk minimization has sublinear regret under the well-specified assumption. We propose an algorithm R-Cover based on recursive coverings which is the first to guarantee sublinear regret for agnostic smoothed online learning without prior knowledge of $\mu$. For classification, we prove that R-Cover has adaptive regret $\tilde O(\sqrt{dT/\sigma})$ for function classes with VC dimension $d$, which is optimal up to logarithmic factors. For regression, we establish that R-Cover has sublinear oblivious regret for function classes with polynomial fat-shattering dimension growth.</description>

      <title>Are causal effect estimations enough for optimal recommendations under multitreatment scenarios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When making treatment selection decisions, it is essential to include a causal effect estimation analysis to compare potential outcomes under different treatments or controls, assisting in optimal selection. However, merely estimating individual treatment effects may not suffice for truly optimal decisions. Our study addressed this issue by incorporating additional criteria, such as the estimations' uncertainty, measured by the conditional value-at-risk, commonly used in portfolio and insurance management. For continuous outcomes observable before and after treatment, we incorporated a specific prediction condition. We prioritized treatments that could yield optimal treatment effect results and lead to post-treatment outcomes more desirable than pretreatment levels, with the latter condition being called the prediction criterion. With these considerations, we propose a comprehensive methodology for multitreatment selection. Our approach ensures satisfaction of the overlap assumption, crucial for comparing outcomes for treated and control groups, by training propensity score models as a preliminary step before employing traditional causal models. To illustrate a practical application of our methodology, we applied it to the credit card limit adjustment problem. Analyzing a fintech company's historical data, we found that relying solely on counterfactual predictions was inadequate for appropriate credit line modifications. Incorporating our proposed additional criteria significantly enhanced policy performance.</description>

      <title>Regression Conformal Prediction under Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is crucial to account for the imperfect predictions of machine learning algorithms for high-impact applications. Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for uncertainty quantification that generates calibrated prediction intervals with valid coverage. In this work, we study how CP intervals are affected by bias - the systematic deviation of a prediction from ground truth values - a phenomenon prevalent in many real-world applications. We investigate the influence of bias on interval lengths of two different types of adjustments -- symmetric adjustments, the conventional method where both sides of the interval are adjusted equally, and asymmetric adjustments, a more flexible method where the interval can be adjusted unequally in positive or negative directions. We present theoretical and empirical analyses characterizing how symmetric and asymmetric adjustments impact the "tightness" of CP intervals for regression tasks. Specifically for absolute residual and quantile-based non-conformity scores, we prove: 1) the upper bound of symmetrically adjusted interval lengths increases by $2|b|$ where $b$ is a globally applied scalar value representing bias, 2) asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are not affected by bias, and 3) conditions when asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are guaranteed to be smaller than symmetric ones. Our analyses suggest that even if predictions exhibit significant drift from ground truth values, asymmetrically adjusted intervals are still able to maintain the same tightness and validity of intervals as if the drift had never happened, while symmetric ones significantly inflate the lengths. We demonstrate our theoretical results with two real-world prediction tasks: sparse-view computed tomography (CT) reconstruction and time-series weather forecasting. Our work paves the way for more bias-robust machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Universality in Transfer Learning for Linear Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer learning is an attractive framework for problems where there is a paucity of data, or where data collection is costly. One common approach to transfer learning is referred to as "model-based", and involves using a model that is pretrained on samples from a source distribution, which is easier to acquire, and then fine-tuning the model on a few samples from the target distribution. The hope is that, if the source and target distributions are ``close", then the fine-tuned model will perform well on the target distribution even though it has seen only a few samples from it. In this work, we study the problem of transfer learning in linear models for both regression and binary classification. In particular, we consider the use of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on a linear model initialized with pretrained weights and using a small training data set from the target distribution. In the asymptotic regime of large models, we provide an exact and rigorous analysis and relate the generalization errors (in regression) and classification errors (in binary classification) for the pretrained and fine-tuned models. In particular, we give conditions under which the fine-tuned model outperforms the pretrained one. An important aspect of our work is that all the results are "universal", in the sense that they depend only on the first and second order statistics of the target distribution. They thus extend well beyond the standard Gaussian assumptions commonly made in the literature.</description>

      <title>Meta Reinforcement Learning Approach for Adaptive Resource Optimization in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wireless networks grow to support more complex applications, the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its smart RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, becomes a crucial solution for real-time network data collection, analysis, and dynamic management of network resources including radio resource blocks and downlink power allocation. Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), O-RAN addresses the variable demands of modern networks with unprecedented efficiency and adaptability. Despite progress in using ML-based strategies for network optimization, challenges remain, particularly in the dynamic allocation of resources in unpredictable environments. This paper proposes a novel Meta Deep Reinforcement Learning (Meta-DRL) strategy, inspired by Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), to advance resource block and downlink power allocation in O-RAN. Our approach leverages O-RAN's disaggregated architecture with virtual distributed units (DUs) and meta-DRL strategies, enabling adaptive and localized decision-making that significantly enhances network efficiency. By integrating meta-learning, our system quickly adapts to new network conditions, optimizing resource allocation in real-time. This results in a 19.8% improvement in network management performance over traditional methods, advancing the capabilities of next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimization naturally appear in many application areas, including machine learning. Our goal is to go further in the analysis of the Stochastic Average Gradient Accelerated (SAGA) algorithm. To achieve this, we introduce a new  $\lambda$-SAGA algorithm which interpolates between the Stochastic Gradient Descent ($\lambda=0$) and the SAGA algorithm ($\lambda=1$). Firstly, we investigate the almost sure convergence of this new algorithm with decreasing step which allows us to avoid the restrictive strong convexity and Lipschitz gradient hypotheses associated to the objective function. Secondly, we establish a central limit theorem for the $\lambda$-SAGA algorithm. Finally, we provide the non-asymptotic $\mathbb{L}^p$ rates of convergence.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation of Long Memory Stochastic Processes with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a purely deep neural network-based approach for estimating long memory parameters of time series models that incorporate the phenomenon of long-range dependence. Parameters, such as the Hurst exponent, are critical in characterizing the long-range dependence, roughness, and self-similarity of stochastic processes. The accurate and fast estimation of these parameters holds significant importance across various scientific disciplines, including finance, physics, and engineering. We harnessed efficient process generators to provide high-quality synthetic training data, enabling the training of scale-invariant 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models. Our neural models outperform conventional statistical methods, even those augmented with neural networks. The precision, speed, consistency, and robustness of our estimators are demonstrated through experiments involving fractional Brownian motion (fBm), the Autoregressive Fractionally Integrated Moving Average (ARFIMA) process, and the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. We believe that our work will inspire further research in the field of stochastic process modeling and parameter estimation using deep learning techniques.</description>

Abstract: A new Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) is proposed to approximate potentially irregular functions in high dimension. We show that it outperforms multilayer perceptrons in terms of accuracy and converges faster. We also compare it with ReLU-KAN, a recently proposed network: it is more time consuming than ReLU-KAN, but more accurate.</description>

      <title>Why Fine-Tuning Struggles with Forgetting in Machine Unlearning? Theoretical Insights and a Remedial Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Unlearning has emerged as a significant area of research, focusing on 'removing' specific subsets of data from a trained model. Fine-tuning (FT) methods have become one of the fundamental approaches for approximating unlearning, as they effectively retain model performance. However, it is consistently observed that naive FT methods struggle to forget the targeted data. In this paper, we present the first theoretical analysis of FT methods for machine unlearning within a linear regression framework, providing a deeper exploration of this phenomenon. We investigate two scenarios with distinct features and overlapping features. Our findings reveal that FT models can achieve zero remaining loss yet fail to forget the forgetting data, unlike golden models (trained from scratch without the forgetting data). This analysis reveals that naive FT methods struggle with forgetting because the pretrained model retains information about the forgetting data, and the fine-tuning process has no impact on this retained information. To address this issue, we first propose a theoretical approach to mitigate the retention of forgetting data in the pretrained model. Our analysis shows that removing the forgetting data's influence allows FT models to match the performance of the golden model. Building on this insight, we introduce a discriminative regularization term to practically reduce the unlearning loss gap between the fine-tuned model and the golden model. Our experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate these theoretical insights and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed regularization method.</description>

      <title>Sequential Probability Assignment with Contexts: Minimax Regret, Contextual Shtarkov Sums, and Contextual Normalized Maximum Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fundamental problem of sequential probability assignment, also known as online learning with logarithmic loss, with respect to an arbitrary, possibly nonparametric hypothesis class. Our goal is to obtain a complexity measure for the hypothesis class that characterizes the minimax regret and to determine a general, minimax optimal algorithm. Notably, the sequential $\ell_{\infty}$ entropy, extensively studied in the literature (Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2015, Bilodeau et al., 2020, Wu et al., 2023), was shown to not characterize minimax risk in general. Inspired by the seminal work of Shtarkov (1987) and Rakhlin, Sridharan, and Tewari (2010), we introduce a novel complexity measure, the \emph{contextual Shtarkov sum}, corresponding to the Shtarkov sum after projection onto a multiary context tree, and show that the worst case log contextual Shtarkov sum equals the minimax regret. Using the contextual Shtarkov sum, we derive the minimax optimal strategy, dubbed \emph{contextual Normalized Maximum Likelihood} (cNML). Our results hold for sequential experts, beyond binary labels, which are settings rarely considered in prior work. To illustrate the utility of this characterization, we provide a short proof of a new regret upper bound in terms of sequential $\ell_{\infty}$ entropy, unifying and sharpening state-of-the-art bounds by Bilodeau et al. (2020) and Wu et al. (2023).</description>

      <title>Improving Mapper's Robustness by Varying Resolution According to Lens-Space Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an improvement to the Mapper algorithm that removes the assumption of a single resolution scale across semantic space, and improves the robustness of the results under change of parameters. This eases parameter selection, especially for datasets with highly variable local density in the Morse function $f$ used for Mapper. This is achieved by incorporating this density into the choice of cover for Mapper. Furthermore, we prove that for covers with some natural hypotheses, the graph output by Mapper still converges in bottleneck distance to the Reeb graph of the Rips complex of the data, but captures more topological features than when using the usual Mapper cover. Finally, we discuss implementation details, and include the results of computational experiments. We also provide an accompanying reference implementation.</description>

      <title>A Federated Distributionally Robust Support Vector Machine with Mixture of Wasserstein Balls Ambiguity Set for Distributed Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The training of classification models for fault diagnosis tasks using geographically dispersed data is a crucial task for original parts manufacturers (OEMs) seeking to provide long-term service contracts (LTSCs) to their customers. Due to privacy and bandwidth constraints, such models must be trained in a federated fashion. Moreover, due to harsh industrial settings the data often suffers from feature and label uncertainty. Therefore, we study the problem of training a distributionally robust (DR) support vector machine (SVM) in a federated fashion over a network comprised of a central server and $G$ clients without sharing data. We consider the setting where the local data of each client $g$ is sampled from a unique true distribution $\mathbb{P}_g$, and the clients can only communicate with the central server. We propose a novel Mixture of Wasserstein Balls (MoWB) ambiguity set that relies on local Wasserstein balls centered at the empirical distribution of the data at each client. We study theoretical aspects of the proposed ambiguity set, deriving its out-of-sample performance guarantees and demonstrating that it naturally allows for the separability of the DR problem. Subsequently, we propose two distributed optimization algorithms for training the global FDR-SVM: i) a subgradient method-based algorithm, and ii) an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. We derive the optimization problems to be solved by each client and provide closed-form expressions for the computations performed by the central server during each iteration for both algorithms. Finally, we thoroughly examine the performance of the proposed algorithms in a series of numerical experiments utilizing both simulation data and popular real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>DiSK: Differentially Private Optimizer with Simplified Kalman Filter for Noise Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) offers a robust framework for safeguarding individual data privacy. To utilize DP in training modern machine learning models, differentially private optimizers have been widely used in recent years. A popular approach to privatize an optimizer is to clip the individual gradients and add sufficiently large noise to the clipped gradient. This approach led to the development of DP optimizers that have comparable performance with their non-private counterparts in fine-tuning tasks or in tasks with a small number of training parameters. However, a significant performance drop is observed when these optimizers are applied to large-scale training. This degradation stems from the substantial noise injection required to maintain DP, which disrupts the optimizer's dynamics. This paper introduces DiSK, a novel framework designed to significantly enhance the performance of DP optimizers. DiSK employs Kalman filtering, a technique drawn from control and signal processing, to effectively denoise privatized gradients and generate progressively refined gradient estimations. To ensure practicality for large-scale training, we simplify the Kalman filtering process, minimizing its memory and computational demands. We establish theoretical privacy-utility trade-off guarantees for DiSK, and demonstrate provable improvements over standard DP optimizers like DPSGD in terms of iteration complexity upper-bound. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks, including vision tasks such as CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k and language fine-tuning tasks such as GLUE, E2E, and DART, validate the effectiveness of DiSK. The results showcase its ability to significantly improve the performance of DP optimizers, surpassing state-of-the-art results under the same privacy constraints on several benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Posterior sampling in contextual bandits with a Gaussian prior can be implemented exactly or approximately using the Laplace approximation. The Gaussian prior is computationally efficient but it cannot describe complex distributions. In this work, we propose approximate posterior sampling algorithms for contextual bandits with a diffusion model prior. The key idea is to sample from a chain of approximate conditional posteriors, one for each stage of the reverse process, which are estimated in a closed form using the Laplace approximation. Our approximations are motivated by posterior sampling with a Gaussian prior, and inherit its simplicity and efficiency. They are asymptotically consistent and perform well empirically on a variety of contextual bandit problems.</description>

      <title>GAS-Norm: Score-Driven Adaptive Normalization for Non-Stationary Time Series Forecasting in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their popularity, deep neural networks (DNNs) applied to time series forecasting often fail to beat simpler statistical models. One of the main causes of this suboptimal performance is the data non-stationarity present in many processes. In particular, changes in the mean and variance of the input data can disrupt the predictive capability of a DNN. In this paper, we first show how DNN forecasting models fail in simple non-stationary settings. We then introduce GAS-Norm, a novel methodology for adaptive time series normalization and forecasting based on the combination of a Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS) model and a Deep Neural Network. The GAS approach encompasses a score-driven family of models that estimate the mean and variance at each new observation, providing updated statistics to normalize the input data of the deep model. The output of the DNN is eventually denormalized using the statistics forecasted by the GAS model, resulting in a hybrid approach that leverages the strengths of both statistical modeling and deep learning. The adaptive normalization improves the performance of the model in non-stationary settings. The proposed approach is model-agnostic and can be applied to any DNN forecasting model. To empirically validate our proposal, we first compare GAS-Norm with other state-of-the-art normalization methods. We then combine it with state-of-the-art DNN forecasting models and test them on real-world datasets from the Monash open-access forecasting repository. Results show that deep forecasting models improve their performance in 21 out of 25 settings when combined with GAS-Norm compared to other normalization methods.</description>

      <title>Clustering Alzheimer's Disease Subtypes via Similarity Learning and Graph Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. Due to the heterogeneous nature of AD, its diagnosis and treatment pose critical challenges. Consequently, there is a growing research interest in identifying homogeneous AD subtypes that can assist in addressing these challenges in recent years. In this study, we aim to identify subtypes of AD that represent distinctive clinical features and underlying pathology by utilizing unsupervised clustering with graph diffusion and similarity learning. We adopted SIMLR, a multi-kernel similarity learning framework, and graph diffusion to perform clustering on a group of 829 patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a prodromal stage of AD) based on their cortical thickness measurements extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Although the clustering approach we utilized has not been explored for the task of AD subtyping before, it demonstrated significantly better performance than several commonly used clustering methods. Specifically, we showed the power of graph diffusion in reducing the effects of noise in the subtype detection. Our results revealed five subtypes that differed remarkably in their biomarkers, cognitive status, and some other clinical features. To evaluate the resultant subtypes further, a genetic association study was carried out and successfully identified potential genetic underpinnings of different AD subtypes.

      <title>Model Developmental Safety: A Safety-Centric Method and Applications in Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the real world, a learning-enabled system usually undergoes multiple cycles of model development to enhance the system's ability to handle difficult or emerging tasks. This continual model development process raises a significant issue that the model development for acquiring new or improving existing capabilities may inadvertently lose capabilities of the old model, also known as catastrophic forgetting. Existing continual learning studies focus on mitigating catastrophic forgetting by trading off performance on previous tasks and new tasks to ensure good average performance. However, they are inadequate for many applications especially in safety-critical domains, as failure to strictly preserve the performance of the old model not only introduces safety risks and uncertainties but also imposes substantial expenses in the re-improving and re-validation of existing properties. To address this issue, we introduce model developmental safety as a guarantee of a learning system such that in the model development process the new model should strictly preserve the existing protected capabilities of the old model while improving its performance on target tasks. To ensure the model developmental safety, we present a safety-centric framework by formulating the model developmental safety as data-dependent constraints. Under this framework, we study how to develop a pretrained vision-language model (aka the CLIP model) for acquiring new capabilities or improving existing capabilities of image classification. We propose an efficient constrained optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantee and use its insights to finetune a CLIP model with task-dependent heads for promoting the model developmental safety. Our experiments on improving vision perception capabilities on autonomous driving and scene recognition datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Variational Language Concepts for Interpreting Foundation Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation Language Models (FLMs) such as BERT and its variants have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of conceptual interpretation and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs.</description>

Abstract: Randomly pivoted Cholesky (RPCholesky) is an algorithm for constructing a low-rank approximation of a positive-semidefinite matrix using a small number of columns. This paper develops an accelerated version of RPCholesky that employs block matrix computations and rejection sampling to efficiently simulate the execution of the original algorithm. For the task of approximating a kernel matrix, the accelerated algorithm can run over $40\times$ faster. The paper contains implementation details, theoretical guarantees, experiments on benchmark data sets, and an application to computational chemistry.</description>

      <title>Efficient Training of Neural Stochastic Differential Equations by Matching Finite Dimensional Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) have emerged as powerful mesh-free generative models for continuous stochastic processes, with critical applications in fields such as finance, physics, and biology. Previous state-of-the-art methods have relied on adversarial training, such as GANs, or on minimizing distance measures between processes using signature kernels. However, GANs suffer from issues like instability, mode collapse, and the need for specialized training techniques, while signature kernel-based methods require solving linear PDEs and backpropagating gradients through the solver, whose computational complexity scales quadratically with the discretization steps. In this paper, we identify a novel class of strictly proper scoring rules for comparing continuous Markov processes. This theoretical finding naturally leads to a novel approach called Finite Dimensional Matching (FDM) for training Neural SDEs. Our method leverages the Markov property of SDEs to provide a computationally efficient training objective. This scoring rule allows us to bypass the computational overhead associated with signature kernels and reduces the training complexity from $O(D^2)$ to $O(D)$ per epoch, where $D$ represents the number of discretization steps of the process. We demonstrate that FDM achieves superior performance, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of both computational efficiency and generative quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents approaches to compute sparse solutions of Generalized Singular Value Problem (GSVP). The GSVP is regularized by $\ell_1$-norm and $\ell_q$-penalty for $0&lt;q&lt;1$, resulting in the $\ell_1$-GSVP and $\ell_q$-GSVP formulations. The solutions of these problems are determined by applying the proximal gradient descent algorithm with a fixed step size. The inherent sparsity levels within the computed solutions are exploited for feature selection, and subsequently, binary classification with non-parallel Support Vector Machines (SVM). For our feature selection task, SVM is integrated into the $\ell_1$-GSVP and $\ell_q$-GSVP frameworks to derive the $\ell_1$-GSVPSVM and $\ell_q$-GSVPSVM variants. Machine learning applications to cancer detection are considered. We remarkably report near-to-perfect balanced accuracy across breast and ovarian cancer datasets using a few selected features.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph Self-Supervised Learning with Graph Interplay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL) has emerged as a compelling framework for extracting informative representations from graph-structured data without extensive reliance on labeled inputs. In this study, we introduce Graph Interplay (GIP), an innovative and versatile approach that significantly enhances the performance equipped with various existing GSSL methods. To this end, GIP advocates direct graph-level communications by introducing random inter-graph edges within standard batches. Against GIP's simplicity, we further theoretically show that \textsc{GIP} essentially performs a principled manifold separation via combining inter-graph message passing and GSSL, bringing about more structured embedding manifolds and thus benefits a series of downstream tasks. Our empirical study demonstrates that GIP surpasses the performance of prevailing GSSL methods across multiple benchmarks by significant margins, highlighting its potential as a breakthrough approach. Besides, GIP can be readily integrated into a series of GSSL methods and consistently offers additional performance gain. This advancement not only amplifies the capability of GSSL but also potentially sets the stage for a novel graph learning paradigm in a broader sense.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Fair Representation Learning for Performance-Sensitive Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prominent class of fair representation learning methods for bias mitigation. Using causal reasoning to define and formalise different sources of dataset bias, we reveal important implicit assumptions inherent to these methods. We prove fundamental limitations on fair representation learning when evaluation data is drawn from the same distribution as training data and run experiments across a range of medical modalities to examine the performance of fair representation learning under distribution shifts. Our results explain apparent contradictions in the existing literature and reveal how rarely considered causal and statistical aspects of the underlying data affect the validity of fair representation learning. We raise doubts about current evaluation practices and the applicability of fair representation learning methods in performance-sensitive settings. We argue that fine-grained analysis of dataset biases should play a key role in the field moving forward.</description>

      <title>Preference Optimization as Probabilistic Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing preference optimization methods are mainly designed for directly learning from human feedback with the assumption that paired examples (preferred vs. dis-preferred) are available. In contrast, we propose a method that can leverage unpaired preferred or dis-preferred examples, and works even when only one type of feedback (positive or negative) is available. This flexibility allows us to apply it in scenarios with varying forms of feedback and models, including training generative language models based on human feedback as well as training policies for sequential decision-making problems, where learned (value) functions are available. Our approach builds upon the probabilistic framework introduced in (Dayan and Hinton, 1997), which proposes to use expectation-maximization (EM) to directly optimize the probability of preferred outcomes (as opposed to classic expected reward maximization). To obtain a practical algorithm, we identify and address a key limitation in current EM-based methods: when applied to preference optimization, they solely maximize the likelihood of preferred examples, while neglecting dis-preferred samples. We show how one can extend EM algorithms to explicitly incorporate dis-preferred outcomes, leading to a novel, theoretically grounded, preference optimization algorithm that offers an intuitive and versatile way to learn from both positive and negative feedback.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization with Flat Hilbert Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Flat Hilbert Bayesian Inference (FHBI), an algorithm designed to enhance generalization in Bayesian inference. Our approach involves an iterative two-step procedure with an adversarial functional perturbation step and a functional descent step within the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This methodology is supported by a theoretical analysis that extends previous findings on generalization ability from finite-dimensional Euclidean spaces to infinite-dimensional functional spaces. To evaluate the effectiveness of FHBI, we conduct comprehensive comparisons against seven baseline methods on the VTAB-1K benchmark, which encompasses 19 diverse datasets across various domains with diverse semantics. Empirical results demonstrate that FHBI consistently outperforms the baselines by notable margins, highlighting its practical efficacy.</description>

      <title>Learning on LoRAs: GL-Equivariant Processing of Low-Rank Weight Spaces for Large Finetuned Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-rank adaptations (LoRAs) have revolutionized the finetuning of large foundation models, enabling efficient adaptation even with limited computational resources. The resulting proliferation of LoRAs presents exciting opportunities for applying machine learning techniques that take these low-rank weights themselves as inputs. In this paper, we investigate the potential of Learning on LoRAs (LoL), a paradigm where LoRA weights serve as input to machine learning models. For instance, an LoL model that takes in LoRA weights as inputs could predict the performance of the finetuned model on downstream tasks, detect potentially harmful finetunes, or even generate novel model edits without traditional training methods. We first identify the inherent parameter symmetries of low rank decompositions of weights, which differ significantly from the parameter symmetries of standard neural networks. To efficiently process LoRA weights, we develop several symmetry-aware invariant or equivariant LoL models, using tools such as canonicalization, invariant featurization, and equivariant layers. We finetune thousands of text-to-image diffusion models and language models to collect datasets of LoRAs. In numerical experiments on these datasets, we show that our LoL architectures are capable of processing low rank weight decompositions to predict CLIP score, finetuning data attributes, finetuning data membership, and accuracy on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Black Boxes and Looking Glasses: Multilevel Symmetries, Reflection Planes, and Convex Optimization in Deep Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that training deep neural networks (DNNs) with absolute value activation and arbitrary input dimension can be formulated as equivalent convex Lasso problems with novel features expressed using geometric algebra. This formulation reveals geometric structures encoding symmetry in neural networks. Using the equivalent Lasso form of DNNs, we formally prove a fundamental distinction between deep and shallow networks: deep networks inherently favor symmetric structures in their fitted functions, with greater depth enabling multilevel symmetries, i.e., symmetries within symmetries. Moreover, Lasso features represent distances to hyperplanes that are reflected across training points. These reflection hyperplanes are spanned by training data and are orthogonal to optimal weight vectors. Numerical experiments support theory and demonstrate theoretically predicted features when training networks using embeddings generated by Large Language Models.</description>

      <title>MindFlayer: Efficient Asynchronous Parallel SGD in the Presence of Heterogeneous and Random Worker Compute Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing the expectation of smooth nonconvex functions with the help of several parallel workers whose role is to compute stochastic gradients. In particular, we focus on the challenging situation where the workers' compute times are arbitrarily heterogeneous and random. In the simpler regime characterized by arbitrarily heterogeneous but deterministic compute times, Tyurin and Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) recently designed the first theoretically optimal asynchronous SGD method, called Rennala SGD, in terms of a novel complexity notion called time complexity. The starting point of our work is the observation that Rennala SGD can have arbitrarily bad performance in the presence of random compute times -- a setting it was not designed to handle. To advance our understanding of stochastic optimization in this challenging regime, we propose a new asynchronous SGD method, for which we coin the name MindFlayer SGD. Our theory and empirical results demonstrate the superiority of MindFlayer SGD over existing baselines, including Rennala SGD, in cases when the noise is heavy tailed.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap Sampling Rate Greater than 1.0 May Improve Random Forest Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random forests utilize bootstrap sampling to create an individual training set for each component tree. This involves sampling with replacement, with the number of instances equal to the size of the original training set ($N$). Research literature indicates that drawing fewer than $N$ observations can also yield satisfactory results. The ratio of the number of observations in each bootstrap sample to the total number of training instances is called the bootstrap rate (BR). Sampling more than $N$ observations (BR $&gt;$ 1) has been explored in the literature only to a limited extent and has generally proven ineffective. In this paper, we re-examine this approach using 36 diverse datasets and consider BR values ranging from 1.2 to 5.0. Contrary to previous findings, we show that such parameterization can result in statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to standard settings (BR $\leq$ 1). Furthermore, we investigate what the optimal BR depends on and conclude that it is more a property of the dataset than a dependence on the random forest hyperparameters. Finally, we develop a binary classifier to predict whether the optimal BR is $\leq$ 1 or $&gt;$ 1 for a given dataset, achieving between 81.88\% and 88.81\% accuracy, depending on the experiment configuration.</description>

      <title>Approximate Maximum Likelihood Inference for Acoustic Spatial Capture-Recapture with Unknown Identities, Using Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic spatial capture-recapture (ASCR) surveys with an array of synchronized acoustic detectors can be an effective way of estimating animal density or call density. However, constructing the capture histories required for ASCR analysis is challenging, as recognizing which detections at different detectors are of which calls is not a trivial task. Because calls from different distances take different times to arrive at detectors, the order in which calls are detected is not necessarily the same as the order in which they are made, and without knowing which detections are of the same call, we do not know how many different calls are detected. We propose a Monte Carlo expectation-maximization (MCEM) estimation method to resolve this unknown call identity problem. To implement the MCEM method in this context, we sample the latent variables from a complete-data likelihood model in the expectation step and use a semi-complete-data likelihood or conditional likelihood in the maximization step. We use a parametric bootstrap to obtain confidence intervals. When we apply our method to a survey of moss frogs, it gives an estimate within 15% of the estimate obtained using data with call capture histories constructed by experts, and unlike this latter estimate, our confidence interval incorporates the uncertainty about call identities. Simulations show it to have a low bias (6%) and coverage probabilities close to the nominal 95% value.</description>

      <title>TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&amp;P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

      <title>GAMformer: In-Context Learning for Generalized Additive Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) are widely recognized for their ability to create fully interpretable machine learning models for tabular data. Traditionally, training GAMs involves iterative learning algorithms, such as splines, boosted trees, or neural networks, which refine the additive components through repeated error reduction. In this paper, we introduce GAMformer, the first method to leverage in-context learning to estimate shape functions of a GAM in a single forward pass, representing a significant departure from the conventional iterative approaches to GAM fitting. Building on previous research applying in-context learning to tabular data, we exclusively use complex, synthetic data to train GAMformer, yet find it extrapolates well to real-world data. Our experiments show that GAMformer performs on par with other leading GAMs across various classification benchmarks while generating highly interpretable shape functions.</description>

      <title>Ranking Policy Learning via Marketplace Expected Value Estimation From Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a decision making framework to cast the problem of learning a ranking policy for search or recommendation engines in a two-sided e-commerce marketplace as an expected reward optimization problem using observational data. As a value allocation mechanism, the ranking policy allocates retrieved items to the designated slots so as to maximize the user utility from the slotted items, at any given stage of the shopping journey. The objective of this allocation can in turn be defined with respect to the underlying probabilistic user browsing model as the expected number of interaction events on presented items matching the user intent, given the ranking context. Through recognizing the effect of ranking as an intervention action to inform users' interactions with slotted items and the corresponding economic value of the interaction events for the marketplace, we formulate the expected reward of the marketplace as the collective value from all presented ranking actions. The key element in this formulation is a notion of context value distribution, which signifies not only the attribution of value to ranking interventions within a session but also the distribution of marketplace reward across user sessions. We build empirical estimates for the expected reward of the marketplace from observational data that account for the heterogeneity of economic value across session contexts as well as the distribution shifts in learning from observational user activity data. The ranking policy can then be trained by optimizing the empirical expected reward estimates via standard Bayesian inference techniques. We report empirical results for a product search ranking task in a major e-commerce platform demonstrating the fundamental trade-offs governed by ranking polices trained on empirical reward estimates with respect to extreme choices of the context value distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work tackles an intriguing and fundamental open challenge in representation learning: Given a well-trained deep learning model, can it be reprogrammed to enhance its robustness against adversarial or noisy input perturbations without altering its parameters? To explore this, we revisit the core feature transformation mechanism in representation learning and propose a novel non-linear robust pattern matching technique as a robust alternative. Furthermore, we introduce three model reprogramming paradigms to offer flexible control of robustness under different efficiency requirements. Comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across diverse learning models ranging from basic linear model and MLPs to shallow and modern deep ConvNets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches. This work not only opens a promising and orthogonal direction for improving adversarial defenses in deep learning beyond existing methods but also provides new insights into designing more resilient AI systems with robust statistics.</description>

      <title>Upsample or Upweight? Balanced Training on Heavily Imbalanced Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data availability across domains often follows a long-tail distribution: a few domains have abundant data, while most face data scarcity. This imbalance poses challenges in training language models uniformly across all domains. In our study, we focus on multilingual settings, where data sizes vary significantly between high- and low-resource languages. Common strategies to address this include upsampling low-resource languages (Temperature Sampling) or upweighting their loss (Scalarization). Although often considered equivalent, this assumption has not been proven, which motivates our study. Through both theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify the conditions under which these approaches are equivalent and when they diverge. Specifically, we demonstrate that these two methods are equivalent under full gradient descent, but this equivalence breaks down with stochastic gradient descent. Empirically, we observe that Temperature Sampling converges more quickly but is prone to overfitting. We argue that this faster convergence is likely due to the lower variance in gradient estimations, as shown theoretically. Based on these insights, we propose Cooldown, a strategy that reduces sampling temperature during training, accelerating convergence without overfitting to low-resource languages. Our method is competitive with existing data re-weighting and offers computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Provable Weak-to-Strong Generalization via Benign Overfitting</title>

Abstract: The classic teacher-student model in machine learning posits that a strong teacher supervises a weak student to improve the student's capabilities. We instead consider the inverted situation, where a weak teacher supervises a strong student with imperfect pseudolabels. This paradigm was recently brought forth by Burns et al.'23 and termed \emph{weak-to-strong generalization}. We theoretically investigate weak-to-strong generalization for binary and multilabel classification in a stylized overparameterized spiked covariance model with Gaussian covariates where the weak teacher's pseudolabels are asymptotically like random guessing. Under these assumptions, we provably identify two asymptotic phases of the strong student's generalization after weak supervision: (1) successful generalization and (2) random guessing. Our techniques should eventually extend to weak-to-strong multiclass classification. Towards doing so, we prove a tight lower tail inequality for the maximum of correlated Gaussians, which may be of independent interest. Understanding the multilabel setting reinforces the value of using logits for weak supervision when they are available.</description>

      <title>The Optimization Landscape of SGD Across the Feature Learning Strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider neural networks (NNs) where the final layer is down-scaled by a fixed hyperparameter $\gamma$. Recent work has identified $\gamma$ as controlling the strength of feature learning. As $\gamma$ increases, network evolution changes from ``lazy'' kernel dynamics to ``rich'' feature-learning dynamics, with a host of associated benefits including improved performance on common tasks. In this work, we conduct a thorough empirical investigation of the effect of scaling $\gamma$ across a variety of models and datasets in the online training setting. We first examine the interaction of $\gamma$ with the learning rate $\eta$, identifying several scaling regimes in the $\gamma$-$\eta$ plane which we explain theoretically using a simple model. We find that the optimal learning rate $\eta^*$ scales non-trivially with $\gamma$. In particular, $\eta^* \propto \gamma^2$ when $\gamma \ll 1$ and $\eta^* \propto \gamma^{2/L}$ when $\gamma \gg 1$ for a feed-forward network of depth $L$. Using this optimal learning rate scaling, we proceed with an empirical study of the under-explored ``ultra-rich'' $\gamma \gg 1$ regime. We find that networks in this regime display characteristic loss curves, starting with a long plateau followed by a drop-off, sometimes followed by one or more additional staircase steps. We find networks of different large $\gamma$ values optimize along similar trajectories up to a reparameterization of time. We further find that optimal online performance is often found at large $\gamma$ and could be missed if this hyperparameter is not tuned. Our findings indicate that analytical study of the large-$\gamma$ limit may yield useful insights into the dynamics of representation learning in performant models.</description>

      <title>Graph Fourier Neural Kernels (G-FuNK): Learning Solutions of Nonlinear Diffusive Parametric PDEs on Multiple Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting time-dependent dynamics of complex systems governed by non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with varying parameters and domains is a challenging task motivated by applications across various fields. We introduce a novel family of neural operators based on our Graph Fourier Neural Kernels, designed to learn solution generators for nonlinear PDEs in which the highest-order term is diffusive, across multiple domains and parameters. G-FuNK combines components that are parameter- and domain-adapted with others that are not. The domain-adapted components are constructed using a weighted graph on the discretized domain, where the graph Laplacian approximates the highest-order diffusive term, ensuring boundary condition compliance and capturing the parameter and domain-specific behavior. Meanwhile, the learned components transfer across domains and parameters via Fourier Neural Operators. This approach naturally embeds geometric and directional information, improving generalization to new test domains without need for retraining the network. To handle temporal dynamics, our method incorporates an integrated ODE solver to predict the evolution of the system. Experiments show G-FuNK's capability to accurately approximate heat, reaction diffusion, and cardiac electrophysiology equations across various geometries and anisotropic diffusivity fields. G-FuNK achieves low relative errors on unseen domains and fiber fields, significantly accelerating predictions compared to traditional finite-element solvers.</description>

      <title>A Clifford Algebraic Approach to E(n)-Equivariant High-order Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing neural network architectures that can handle data symmetry is crucial. This is especially important for geometric graphs whose properties are equivariance under Euclidean transformations. Current equivariant graph neural networks (EGNNs), particularly those using message passing, have a limitation in expressive power. Recent high-order graph neural networks can overcome this limitation, yet they lack equivariance properties, representing a notable drawback in certain applications in chemistry and physical sciences. In this paper, we introduce the Clifford Group Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (CG-EGNNs), a novel EGNN that enhances high-order message passing by integrating high-order local structures in the context of Clifford algebras. As a key benefit of using Clifford algebras, CG-EGNN can learn functions that capture equivariance from positional features. By adopting the high-order message passing mechanism, CG-EGNN gains richer information from neighbors, thus improving model performance. Furthermore, we establish the universality property of the $k$-hop message passing framework, showcasing greater expressive power of CG-EGNNs with additional $k$-hop message passing mechanism. We empirically validate that CG-EGNNs outperform previous methods on various benchmarks including n-body, CMU motion capture, and MD17, highlighting their effectiveness in geometric deep learning.</description>

      <title>Neural Fourier Modelling: A Highly Compact Approach to Time-Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural time-series analysis has traditionally focused on modeling data in the time domain, often with some approaches incorporating equivalent Fourier domain representations as auxiliary spectral features. In this work, we shift the main focus to frequency representations, modeling time-series data fully and directly in the Fourier domain. We introduce Neural Fourier Modelling (NFM), a compact yet powerful solution for time-series analysis. NFM is grounded in two key properties of the Fourier transform (FT): (i) the ability to model finite-length time series as functions in the Fourier domain, treating them as continuous-time elements in function space, and (ii) the capacity for data manipulation (such as resampling and timespan extension) within the Fourier domain. We reinterpret Fourier-domain data manipulation as frequency extrapolation and interpolation, incorporating this as a core learning mechanism in NFM, applicable across various tasks. To support flexible frequency extension with spectral priors and effective modulation of frequency representations, we propose two learning modules: Learnable Frequency Tokens (LFT) and Implicit Neural Fourier Filters (INFF). These modules enable compact and expressive modeling in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NFM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of tasks (forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification), including challenging time-series scenarios with previously unseen sampling rates at test time. Moreover, NFM is highly compact, requiring fewer than 40K parameters in each task, with time-series lengths ranging from 100 to 16K.</description>

      <title>Tight Stability, Convergence, and Robustness Bounds for Predictive Coding Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-based learning algorithms, such as predictive coding (PC), have garnered significant attention in the machine learning community due to their theoretical properties, such as local operations and biologically plausible mechanisms for error correction. In this work, we rigorously analyze the stability, robustness, and convergence of PC through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We show that, first, PC is Lyapunov stable under mild assumptions on its loss and residual energy functions, which implies intrinsic robustness to small random perturbations due to its well-defined energy-minimizing dynamics. Second, we formally establish that the PC updates approximate quasi-Newton methods by incorporating higher-order curvature information, which makes them more stable and able to converge with fewer iterations compared to models trained via backpropagation (BP). Furthermore, using this dynamical framework, we provide new theoretical bounds on the similarity between PC and other algorithms, i.e., BP and target propagation (TP), by precisely characterizing the role of higher-order derivatives. These bounds, derived through detailed analysis of the Hessian structures, show that PC is significantly closer to quasi-Newton updates than TP, providing a deeper understanding of the stability and efficiency of PC compared to conventional learning methods.</description>

      <title>ProtoNAM: Prototypical Neural Additive Models for Interpretable Deep Tabular Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) have long been a powerful white-box tool for the intelligible analysis of tabular data, revealing the influence of each feature on the model predictions. Despite the success of neural networks (NNs) in various domains, their application as NN-based GAMs in tabular data analysis remains suboptimal compared to tree-based ones, and the opacity of encoders in NN-GAMs also prevents users from understanding how networks learn the functions. In this work, we propose a new deep tabular learning method, termed Prototypical Neural Additive Model (ProtoNAM), which introduces prototypes into neural networks in the framework of GAMs. With the introduced prototype-based feature activation, ProtoNAM can flexibly model the irregular mapping from tabular features to the outputs while maintaining the explainability of the final prediction. We also propose a gradient-boosting inspired hierarchical shape function modeling method, facilitating the discovery of complex feature patterns and bringing transparency into the learning process of each network layer. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that ProtoNAM outperforms all existing NN-based GAMs, while providing additional insights into the shape function learned for each feature. The source code of ProtoNAM is available at \url{https://github.com/Teddy-XiongGZ/ProtoNAM}.</description>

      <title>Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Timer-XL, a generative Transformer for unified time series forecasting. To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem. We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity, multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate generative Transformers on time series, which can effectively capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches) and is further strengthened by position embeddings in both temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. As a large time series model, it demonstrates notable model transferability by large-scale pre-training, as well as contextual flexibility in token lengths, positioning it as a one-for-all forecaster.</description>

      <title>Taming Gradient Oversmoothing and Expansion in Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oversmoothing has been claimed as a primary bottleneck for multi-layered graph neural networks (GNNs). Multiple analyses have examined how and why oversmoothing occurs. However, none of the prior work addressed how optimization is performed under the oversmoothing regime. In this work, we show the presence of $\textit{gradient oversmoothing}$ preventing optimization during training. We further analyze that GNNs with residual connections, a well-known solution to help gradient flow in deep architecture, introduce $\textit{gradient expansion}$, a phenomenon of the gradient explosion in diverse directions. Therefore, adding residual connections cannot be a solution for making a GNN deep. Our analysis reveals that constraining the Lipschitz bound of each layer can neutralize the gradient expansion. To this end, we provide a simple yet effective normalization method to prevent the gradient expansion. An empirical study shows that the residual GNNs with hundreds of layers can be efficiently trained with the proposed normalization without compromising performance. Additional studies show that the empirical observations corroborate our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Strong Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the scaling laws paradigm, which underpins the training of large neural networks like ChatGPT and Llama, we consider a supervised regression setting and establish the existance of a strong form of the model collapse phenomenon, a critical performance degradation due to synthetic data in the training corpus. Our results show that even the smallest fraction of synthetic data (e.g., as little as 1\% of the total training dataset) can still lead to model collapse: larger and larger training sets do not enhance performance. We further investigate whether increasing model size, an approach aligned with current trends in training large language models, exacerbates or mitigates model collapse. In a simplified regime where neural networks are approximated via random projections of tunable size, we both theoretically and empirically show that larger models can amplify model collapse. Interestingly, our theory also indicates that, beyond the interpolation threshold (which can be extremely high for very large datasets), larger models may mitigate the collapse, although they do not entirely prevent it. Our theoretical findings are empirically verified through experiments on language models and feed-forward neural networks for images.</description>

      <title>TimeCNN: Refining Cross-Variable Interaction on Time Point for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is extensively applied across diverse domains. Transformer-based models demonstrate significant potential in modeling cross-time and cross-variable interaction. However, we notice that the cross-variable correlation of multivariate time series demonstrates multifaceted (positive and negative correlations) and dynamic progression over time, which is not well captured by existing Transformer-based models. To address this issue, we propose a TimeCNN model to refine cross-variable interactions to enhance time series forecasting. Its key innovation is timepoint-independent, where each time point has an independent convolution kernel, allowing each time point to have its independent model to capture relationships among variables. This approach effectively handles both positive and negative correlations and adapts to the evolving nature of variable relationships over time. Extensive experiments conducted on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, our model achieves significant reductions in computational requirements (approximately 60.46%) and parameter count (about 57.50%), while delivering inference speeds 3 to 4 times faster than the benchmark iTransformer model</description>

      <title>On the Optimization and Generalization of Two-layer Transformers with Sign Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Adam optimizer is widely used for transformer optimization in practice, which makes understanding the underlying optimization mechanisms an important problem. However, due to the Adam's complexity, theoretical analysis of how it optimizes transformers remains a challenging task. Fortunately, Sign Gradient Descent (SignGD) serves as an effective surrogate for Adam. Despite its simplicity, theoretical understanding of how SignGD optimizes transformers still lags behind. In this work, we study how SignGD optimizes a two-layer transformer -- consisting of a softmax attention layer with trainable query-key parameterization followed by a linear layer -- on a linearly separable noisy dataset. We identify four stages in the training dynamics, each exhibiting intriguing behaviors. Based on the training dynamics, we prove the fast convergence but poor generalization of the learned transformer on the noisy dataset. We also show that Adam behaves similarly to SignGD in terms of both optimization and generalization in this setting. Additionally, we find that the poor generalization of SignGD is not solely due to data noise, suggesting that both SignGD and Adam requires high-quality data for real-world tasks. Finally, experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets empirically support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Improving the Sampling Strategy in KernelSHAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shapley values are a popular model-agnostic explanation framework for explaining predictions made by complex machine learning models. The framework provides feature contribution scores that sum to the predicted response and represent each feature's importance. The computation of exact Shapley values is computationally expensive due to estimating an exponential amount of non-trivial conditional expectations. The KernelSHAP framework enables us to approximate the Shapley values using a sampled subset of weighted conditional expectations. We propose three main novel contributions: a stabilizing technique to reduce the variance of the weights in the current state-of-the-art strategy, a novel weighing scheme that corrects the Shapley kernel weights based on sampled subsets, and a straightforward strategy that includes the important subsets and integrates them with the corrected Shapley kernel weights. We compare these new approximation strategies against existing ones by evaluating their Shapley value accuracy as a function of the number of subsets. The results demonstrate that our sampling strategies significantly enhance the accuracy of the approximated Shapley value explanations, making them more reliable in practical applications. This work provides valuable insights and practical recommendations for researchers and practitioners seeking to implement Shapley value-based explainability of their models.</description>

      <title>Wide Neural Networks Trained with Weight Decay Provably Exhibit Neural Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) at convergence consistently represent the training data in the last layer via a highly symmetric geometric structure referred to as neural collapse. This empirical evidence has spurred a line of theoretical research aimed at proving the emergence of neural collapse, mostly focusing on the unconstrained features model. Here, the features of the penultimate layer are free variables, which makes the model data-agnostic and, hence, puts into question its ability to capture DNN training. Our work addresses the issue, moving away from unconstrained features and studying DNNs that end with at least two linear layers. We first prove generic guarantees on neural collapse that assume (i) low training error and balancedness of the linear layers (for within-class variability collapse), and (ii) bounded conditioning of the features before the linear part (for orthogonality of class-means, as well as their alignment with weight matrices). We then show that such assumptions hold for gradient descent training with weight decay: (i) for networks with a wide first layer, we prove low training error and balancedness, and (ii) for solutions that are either nearly optimal or stable under large learning rates, we additionally prove the bounded conditioning. Taken together, our results are the first to show neural collapse in the end-to-end training of DNNs.</description>

      <title>Random-projection ensemble dimension reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for dimension reduction in the context of high-dimensional regression. Our proposal is to aggregate an ensemble of random projections, which have been carefully chosen based on the empirical regression performance after being applied to the covariates. More precisely, we consider disjoint groups of independent random projections, apply a base regression method after each projection, and retain the projection in each group based on the empirical performance. We aggregate the selected projections by taking the singular value decomposition of their empirical average and then output the leading order singular vectors. A particularly appealing aspect of our approach is that the singular values provide a measure of the relative importance of the corresponding projection directions, which can be used to select the final projection dimension. We investigate in detail (and provide default recommendations for) various aspects of our general framework, including the projection distribution and the base regression method, as well as the number of random projections used. Additionally, we investigate the possibility of further reducing the dimension by applying our algorithm twice in cases where projection dimension recommended in the initial application is too large. Our theoretical results show that the error of our algorithm stabilises as the number of groups of projections increases. We demonstrate the excellent empirical performance of our proposal in a large numerical study using simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Failure-Proof Non-Contrastive Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify sufficient conditions to avoid known failure modes, including representation, dimensional, cluster and intracluster collapses, occurring in non-contrastive self-supervised learning. Based on these findings, we propose a principled design for the projector and loss function. We theoretically demonstrate that this design introduces an inductive bias that promotes learning representations that are both decorrelated and clustered without explicit enforcing these properties and leading to improved generalization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first solution that achieves robust training with respect to these failure modes while guaranteeing enhanced generalization performance in downstream tasks. We validate our theoretical findings on image datasets including SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and ImageNet-100, and show that our solution, dubbed FALCON, outperforms existing feature decorrelation and cluster-based self-supervised learning methods in terms of generalization to clustering and linear classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Assumption-Lean Post-Integrated Inference with Negative Control Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data integration has become increasingly common in aligning multiple heterogeneous datasets. With high-dimensional outcomes, data integration methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings of observations to remove unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, inherent in data collected from different sources. However, multiple hypothesis testing after data integration can be substantially biased due to the data-dependent integration processes. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity using negative control outcomes. By leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identification conditions that form the basis of our PII approach.
  Our assumption-lean semiparametric inference method extends robustness and generality to projected direct effect estimands that account for mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide deterministic quantifications of the bias of target estimands induced by estimated embeddings and finite-sample linear expansions of the estimators with uniform concentration bounds on the residuals for all outcomes.
  The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Using random forests, we evaluate empirical statistical errors in simulations and analyze single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with potential unmeasured confounders.</description>

      <title>T-JEPA: Augmentation-Free Self-Supervised Learning for Tabular Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervision is often used for pre-training to foster performance on a downstream task by constructing meaningful representations of samples. Self-supervised learning (SSL) generally involves generating different views of the same sample and thus requires data augmentations that are challenging to construct for tabular data. This constitutes one of the main challenges of self-supervision for structured data. In the present work, we propose a novel augmentation-free SSL method for tabular data. Our approach, T-JEPA, relies on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) and is akin to mask reconstruction in the latent space. It involves predicting the latent representation of one subset of features from the latent representation of a different subset within the same sample, thereby learning rich representations without augmentations. We use our method as a pre-training technique and train several deep classifiers on the obtained representation. Our experimental results demonstrate a substantial improvement in both classification and regression tasks, outperforming models trained directly on samples in their original data space. Moreover, T-JEPA enables some methods to consistently outperform or match the performance of traditional methods likes Gradient Boosted Decision Trees. To understand why, we extensively characterize the obtained representations and show that T-JEPA effectively identifies relevant features for downstream tasks without access to the labels. Additionally, we introduce regularization tokens, a novel regularization method critical for training of JEPA-based models on structured data.</description>

      <title>On subdifferential chain rule of matrix factorization and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equality-type Clarke subdifferential chain rules of matrix factorization and factorization machine. Specifically, we show for these problems that provided the latent dimension is larger than some multiple of the problem size (i.e., slightly overparameterized) and the loss function is locally Lipschitz, the subdifferential chain rules hold everywhere. In addition, we examine the tightness of the analysis through some interesting constructions and make some important observations from the perspective of optimization; e.g., we show that for all this type of problems, computing a stationary point is trivial. Some tensor generalizations and neural extensions are also discussed, albeit they remain mostly open.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the nonsmooth optimization landscape of the $\ell_1$-norm rank-one symmetric matrix factorization problem using tools from second-order variational analysis. Specifically, as the main finding of this paper, we show that any second-order stationary point (and thus local minimizer) of the problem is actually globally optimal. Besides, some other results concerning the landscape of the problem, such as a complete characterization of the set of stationary points, are also developed, which should be interesting in their own rights. Furthermore, with the above theories, we revisit existing results on the generic minimizing behavior of simple algorithms for nonsmooth optimization and showcase the potential risk of their applications to our problem through several examples. Our techniques can potentially be applied to analyze the optimization landscapes of a variety of other more sophisticated nonsmooth learning problems, such as robust low-rank matrix recovery.</description>

      <title>FreSh: Frequency Shifting for Accelerated Neural Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently gained attention as a powerful approach for continuously representing signals such as images, videos, and 3D shapes using multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). However, MLPs are known to exhibit a low-frequency bias, limiting their ability to capture high-frequency details accurately. This limitation is typically addressed by incorporating high-frequency input embeddings or specialized activation layers. In this work, we demonstrate that these embeddings and activations are often configured with hyperparameters that perform well on average but are suboptimal for specific input signals under consideration, necessitating a costly grid search to identify optimal settings. Our key observation is that the initial frequency spectrum of an untrained model's output correlates strongly with the model's eventual performance on a given target signal. Leveraging this insight, we propose frequency shifting (or FreSh), a method that selects embedding hyperparameters to align the frequency spectrum of the model's initial output with that of the target signal. We show that this simple initialization technique improves performance across various neural representation methods and tasks, achieving results comparable to extensive hyperparameter sweeps but with only marginal computational overhead compared to training a single model with default hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>HyperINF: Unleashing the HyperPower of the Schulz's Method for Data Influence Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of individual training samples to a specific target. Yet, their high computational costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets. Existing methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly reduced the computational overheads. However, they mostly suffer from inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the algorithm. The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs on large-scale models. We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method, specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm.
  To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models.
  We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of \method compared to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix inversion. We further validate the efficacy of \method through extensive real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning.
  On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with minimal memory and computational overhead, while other baselines suffer from significant degradation. Our codebase is available at https://github.com/Blackzxy/HyperINF.</description>

      <title>Nonasymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Gradient Descent with the Richardson-Romberg Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of solving strongly convex and smooth minimization problems using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm with a constant step size. Previous works suggested to combine the Polyak-Ruppert averaging procedure with the Richardson-Romberg extrapolation technique to reduce the asymptotic bias of SGD at the expense of a mild increase of the variance. We significantly extend previous results by providing an expansion of the mean-squared error of the resulting estimator with respect to the number of iterations $n$. More precisely, we show that the mean-squared error can be decomposed into the sum of two terms: a leading one of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ with explicit dependence on a minimax-optimal asymptotic covariance matrix, and a second-order term of order $\mathcal{O}(n^{-3/4})$ where the power $3/4$ can not be improved in general. We also extend this result to the $p$-th moment bound keeping optimal scaling of the remainders with respect to $n$. Our analysis relies on the properties of the SGD iterates viewed as a time-homogeneous Markov chain. In particular, we establish that this chain is geometrically ergodic with respect to a suitably defined weighted Wasserstein semimetric.</description>

      <title>Assouad, Fano, and Le Cam with Interaction: A Unifying Lower Bound Framework and Characterization for Bandit Learnability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a unified framework for lower bound methods in statistical estimation and interactive decision making. Classical lower bound techniques -- such as Fano's inequality, Le Cam's method, and Assouad's lemma -- have been central to the study of minimax risk in statistical estimation, yet they are insufficient for the analysis of methods that collect data in an interactive manner. The recent minimax lower bounds for interactive decision making via the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC) appear to be genuinely different from the classical methods. We propose a unified view of these distinct methodologies through a general algorithmic lower bound method. We further introduce a novel complexity measure, decision dimension, which facilitates the derivation of new lower bounds for interactive decision making. In particular, decision dimension provides a characterization of bandit learnability for any structured bandit model class. Further, we characterize the sample complexity of learning convex model class up to a polynomial gap with the decision dimension, addressing the remaining gap between upper and lower bounds in Foster et al. (2021, 2023).</description>

      <title>LOTOS: Layer-wise Orthogonalization for Training Robust Ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transferability of adversarial examples is a well-known property that endangers all classification models, even those that are only accessible through black-box queries. Prior work has shown that an ensemble of models is more resilient to transferability: the probability that an adversarial example is effective against most models of the ensemble is low. Thus, most ongoing research focuses on improving ensemble diversity. Another line of prior work has shown that Lipschitz continuity of the models can make models more robust since it limits how a model's output changes with small input perturbations. In this paper, we study the effect of Lipschitz continuity on transferability rates. We show that although a lower Lipschitz constant increases the robustness of a single model, it is not as beneficial in training robust ensembles as it increases the transferability rate of adversarial examples across models in the ensemble. Therefore, we introduce LOTOS, a new training paradigm for ensembles, which counteracts this adverse effect. It does so by promoting orthogonality among the top-$k$ sub-spaces of the transformations of the corresponding affine layers of any pair of models in the ensemble. We theoretically show that $k$ does not need to be large for convolutional layers, which makes the computational overhead negligible. Through various experiments, we show LOTOS increases the robust accuracy of ensembles of ResNet-18 models by $6$ percentage points (p.p) against black-box attacks on CIFAR-10. It is also capable of combining with the robustness of prior state-of-the-art methods for training robust ensembles to enhance their robust accuracy by $10.7$ p.p.</description>

      <title>Tuning-Free Bilevel Optimization: New Algorithms and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization has recently attracted considerable attention due to its abundant applications in machine learning problems. However, existing methods rely on prior knowledge of problem parameters to determine stepsizes, resulting in significant effort in tuning stepsizes when these parameters are unknown. In this paper, we propose two novel tuning-free algorithms, D-TFBO and S-TFBO. D-TFBO employs a double-loop structure with stepsizes adaptively adjusted by the "inverse of cumulative gradient norms" strategy. S-TFBO features a simpler fully single-loop structure that updates three variables simultaneously with a theory-motivated joint design of adaptive stepsizes for all variables. We provide a comprehensive convergence analysis for both algorithms and show that D-TFBO and S-TFBO respectively require $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ and $O(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\log^4(\frac{1}{\epsilon}))$ iterations to find an $\epsilon$-accurate stationary point, (nearly) matching their well-tuned counterparts using the information of problem parameters. Experiments on various problems show that our methods achieve performance comparable to existing well-tuned approaches, while being more robust to the selection of initial stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, our methods are the first to completely eliminate the need for stepsize tuning, while achieving theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Understanding Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rates: A River Valley Loss Landscape Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training language models currently requires pre-determining a fixed compute budget because the typical cosine learning rate schedule depends on the total number of steps. In contrast, the Warmup-Stable-Decay (WSD) schedule uses a constant learning rate to produce a main branch of iterates that can in principle continue indefinitely without a pre-specified compute budget. Then, given any compute budget, one can branch out from the main branch at a proper at any time with a rapidly decaying learning rate to produce a strong model. Empirically, WSD generates a non-traditional loss curve: the loss remains elevated during the stable phase but sharply declines during the decay phase. Towards explaining this phenomenon, we conjecture that pretraining loss exhibits a river valley landscape, which resembles a deep valley with a river at its bottom. Under this assumption, we show that during the stable phase, the iterate undergoes large oscillations due to the high learning rate, yet it progresses swiftly along the river. During the decay phase, the rapidly dropping learning rate minimizes the iterate's oscillations, moving it closer to the river and revealing true optimization progress. Therefore, the sustained high learning rate phase and fast decaying phase are responsible for progress in the river and the mountain directions respectively, and are both critical. Our analysis predicts phenomenons consistent with empirical observations and shows that this landscape can emerge from pretraining on a simple bi-gram dataset. Inspired by the theory, we introduce WSD-S, a variant of WSD that reuses previous checkpoints' decay phases and keeps only one main branch, where we resume from a decayed checkpoint. WSD-S empirically outperforms WSD and Cyclic-Cosine in obtaining multiple language model checkpoints across various compute budgets in a single run for parameters scaling from 0.1B to 1.2B.</description>

      <title>The Informed Elastic Net for Fast Grouped Variable Selection and FDR Control in Genomics Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern genomics research relies on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify the few genetic variants among potentially millions that are associated with diseases of interest. Only reproducible discoveries of groups of associations improve our understanding of complex polygenic diseases and enable the development of new drugs and personalized medicine. Thus, fast multivariate variable selection methods that have a high true positive rate (TPR) while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) are crucial. Recently, the T-Rex+GVS selector, a version of the T-Rex selector that uses the elastic net (EN) as a base selector to perform grouped variable election, was proposed. Although it significantly increased the TPR in simulated GWAS compared to the original T-Rex, its comparably high computational cost limits scalability. Therefore, we propose the informed elastic net (IEN), a new base selector that significantly reduces computation time while retaining the grouped variable selection property. We quantify its grouping effect and derive its formulation as a Lasso-type optimization problem, which is solved efficiently within the T-Rex framework by the terminated LARS algorithm. Numerical simulations and a GWAS study demonstrate that the proposed T-Rex+GVS (IEN) exhibits the desired grouping effect, reduces computation time, and achieves the same TPR as T-Rex+GVS (EN) but with lower FDR, which makes it a promising method for large-scale GWAS.</description>

      <title>Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</description>

      <title>ETGL-DDPG: A Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Sparse Reward Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) in the context of reinforcement learning with sparse rewards. To enhance exploration, we introduce a search procedure, \emph{${\epsilon}{t}$-greedy}, which generates exploratory options for exploring less-visited states. We prove that search using $\epsilon t$-greedy has polynomial sample complexity under mild MDP assumptions. To more efficiently use the information provided by rewarded transitions, we develop a new dual experience replay buffer framework, \emph{GDRB}, and implement \emph{longest n-step returns}. The resulting algorithm, \emph{ETGL-DDPG}, integrates all three techniques: \bm{$\epsilon t$}-greedy, \textbf{G}DRB, and \textbf{L}ongest $n$-step, into DDPG. We evaluate ETGL-DDPG on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms DDPG, as well as other state-of-the-art methods, across all tested sparse-reward continuous environments. Ablation studies further highlight how each strategy individually enhances the performance of DDPG in this setting.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Tail Index Regression: with An Application to Text Analyses of Viral Posts in Social Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the empirical observation of power-law distributions in the credits (e.g., "likes") of viral social media posts, we introduce a high-dimensional tail index regression model and propose methods for estimation and inference of its parameters. First, we present a regularized estimator, establish its consistency, and derive its convergence rate. Second, we introduce a debiasing technique for the regularized estimator to facilitate inference and prove its asymptotic normality. Third, we extend our approach to handle large-scale online streaming data using stochastic gradient descent. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings. We apply these methods to the text analysis of viral posts on X (formerly Twitter) related to LGBTQ+ topics.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of Switchback Designs in Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a detailed investigation of switchback designs in A/B testing, which alternate between baseline and new policies over time. Our aim is to thoroughly evaluate the effects of these designs on the accuracy of their resulting average treatment effect (ATE) estimators. We propose a novel "weak signal analysis" framework, which substantially simplifies the calculations of the mean squared errors (MSEs) of these ATEs in Markov decision process environments. Our findings suggest that (i) when the majority of reward errors are positively correlated, the switchback design is more efficient than the alternating-day design which switches policies in a daily basis. Additionally, increasing the frequency of policy switches tends to reduce the MSE of the ATE estimator. (ii) When the errors are uncorrelated, however, all these designs become asymptotically equivalent. (iii) In cases where the majority of errors are negative correlated, the alternating-day design becomes the optimal choice. These insights are crucial, offering guidelines for practitioners on designing experiments in A/B testing. Our analysis accommodates a variety of policy value estimators, including model-based estimators, least squares temporal difference learning estimators, and double reinforcement learning estimators, thereby offering a comprehensive understanding of optimal design strategies for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Just Wing It: Near-Optimal Estimation of Missing Mass in a Markovian Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the stationary mass -- also called the unigram mass -- that is missing from a single trajectory of a discrete-time, ergodic Markov chain. This problem has several applications -- for example, estimating the stationary missing mass is critical for accurately smoothing probability estimates in sequence models. While the classical Good--Turing estimator from the 1950s has appealing properties for i.i.d. data, it is known to be biased in the Markovian setting, and other heuristic estimators do not come equipped with guarantees. Operating in the general setting in which the size of the state space may be much larger than the length $n$ of the trajectory, we develop a linear-runtime estimator called Windowed Good--Turing (WingIt) and show that its risk decays as $\widetilde{O}(\mathsf{T_{mix}}/n)$, where $\mathsf{T_{mix}}$ denotes the mixing time of the chain in total variation distance. Notably, this rate is independent of the size of the state space and minimax-optimal up to a logarithmic factor in $n / \mathsf{T_{mix}}$. We also present an upper bound on the variance of the missing mass random variable, which may be of independent interest. We extend our estimator to approximate the stationary mass placed on elements occurring with small frequency in the trajectory. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our estimators both in simulations on canonical chains and on sequences constructed from natural language text.</description>

      <title>I Bet You Did Not Mean That: Testing Semantic Importance via Betting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works have extended notions of feature importance to semantic concepts that are inherently interpretable to the users interacting with a black-box predictive model. Yet, precise statistical guarantees, such as false positive rate and false discovery rate control, are needed to communicate findings transparently and to avoid unintended consequences in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we formalize the global (i.e., over a population) and local (i.e., for a sample) statistical importance of semantic concepts for the predictions of opaque models by means of conditional independence, which allows for rigorous testing. We use recent ideas of sequential kernelized independence testing (SKIT) to induce a rank of importance across concepts, and showcase the effectiveness and flexibility of our framework on synthetic datasets as well as on image classification tasks using several and diverse vision-language models.</description>

      <title>Generative modeling of density regression through tree flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05260v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A common objective in the analysis of tabular data is estimating the conditional distribution (in contrast to only producing predictions) of a set of "outcome" variables given a set of "covariates", which is sometimes referred to as the "density regression" problem. Beyond estimation on the conditional distribution, the generative ability of drawing synthetic samples from the learned conditional distribution is also desired as it further widens the range of applications. We propose a flow-based generative model tailored for the density regression task on tabular data. Our flow applies a sequence of tree-based piecewise-linear transforms on initial uniform noise to eventually generate samples from complex conditional densities of (univariate or multivariate) outcomes given the covariates and allows efficient analytical evaluation of the fitted conditional density on any point in the sample space. We introduce a training algorithm for fitting the tree-based transforms using a divide-and-conquer strategy that transforms maximum likelihood training of the tree-flow into training a collection of binary classifiers--one at each tree split--under cross-entropy loss. We assess the performance of our method under out-of-sample likelihood evaluation and compare it with a variety of state-of-the-art conditional density learners on a range of simulated and real benchmark tabular datasets. Our method consistently achieves comparable or superior performance at a fraction of the training and sampling budget. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our method's generative ability through an application to generating synthetic longitudinal microbiome compositional data based on training our flow on a publicly available microbiome study.</description>

      <title>To Clip or not to Clip: the Dynamics of SGD with Gradient Clipping in High-Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of modern machine learning is due in part to the adaptive optimization methods that have been developed to deal with the difficulties of training large models over complex datasets. One such method is gradient clipping: a practical procedure with limited theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we study clipping in a least squares problem under streaming SGD. We develop a theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics in the limit of large intrinsic dimension-a model and dataset dependent notion of dimensionality. In this limit we find a deterministic equation that describes the evolution of the loss and demonstrate that this equation predicts the path of clipped SGD on synthetic, CIFAR10, and Wikitext2 data. We show that with Gaussian noise clipping cannot improve SGD performance. Yet, in other noisy settings, clipping can provide benefits with tuning of the clipping threshold. We propose a simple heuristic for near optimal scheduling of the clipping threshold which requires the tuning of only one hyperparameter. We conclude with a discussion about the links between high-dimensional clipping and neural network training.</description>

      <title>Flat Posterior Does Matter For Bayesian Model Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian neural network (BNN) approximates the posterior distribution of model parameters and utilizes the posterior for prediction via Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The quality of the posterior approximation is critical for achieving accurate and robust predictions. It is known that flatness in the loss landscape is strongly associated with generalization performance, and it necessitates consideration to improve the quality of the posterior approximation. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that BNNs often struggle to capture the flatness. Moreover, we provide both experimental and theoretical evidence showing that BMA can be ineffective without ensuring flatness. To address this, we propose Sharpness-Aware Bayesian Model Averaging (SA-BMA), a novel optimizer that seeks flat posteriors by calculating divergence in the parameter space. SA-BMA aligns with the intrinsic nature of BNN and the generalized version of existing sharpness-aware optimizers for DNN. In addition, we suggest a Bayesian Transfer Learning scheme to efficiently leverage pre-trained DNN. We validate the efficacy of SA-BMA in enhancing generalization performance in few-shot classification and distribution shift by ensuring flat posterior.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation on EEG data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) data is often collected from diverse contexts involving different populations and EEG devices. This variability can induce distribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest $y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML) algorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to mitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution shifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for EEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the Riemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is appealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper proposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift Adaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which source domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic structure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific re-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression model. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of age-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national dataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$ human participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed that GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression metrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\rho$) for several source-target site combinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with predictive shifts in EEG data analysis. Our method has the potential to combine the advantages of mixed-effects modeling with machine learning for biomedical applications of EEG, such as multicenter clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Private Density Estimation for GMMs via List Global Stability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of private density estimation for mixtures of unrestricted high dimensional Gaussians in the agnostic setting. We prove the first upper bound on the sample complexity of this problem. Previously, private learnability of high dimensional GMMs was only known in the realizable setting [Afzali et al., 2024].
  To prove our result, we exploit the notion of $\textit{list global stability}$ [Ghazi et al., 2021b,a] that was originally introduced in the context of private supervised learning. We define an agnostic variant of this definition, showing that its existence is sufficient for agnostic private density estimation. We then construct an agnostic list globally stable learner for GMMs.</description>

      <title>FredNormer: Frequency Domain Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</description>

      <title>CAnDOIT: Causal Discovery with Observational and Interventional Data from Time-Series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of cause-and-effect is of the utmost importance in many branches of science, but also for many practical applications of intelligent systems. In particular, identifying causal relationships in situations that include hidden factors is a major challenge for methods that rely solely on observational data for building causal models. This paper proposes CAnDOIT, a causal discovery method to reconstruct causal models using both observational and interventional time-series data. The use of interventional data in the causal analysis is crucial for real-world applications, such as robotics, where the scenario is highly complex and observational data alone are often insufficient to uncover the correct causal structure. Validation of the method is performed initially on randomly generated synthetic models and subsequently on a well-known benchmark for causal structure learning in a robotic manipulation environment. The experiments demonstrate that the approach can effectively handle data from interventions and exploit them to enhance the accuracy of the causal analysis. A Python implementation of CAnDOIT has also been developed and is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/lcastri/causalflow.</description>

Abstract: RF-GAP has recently been introduced as an improved random forest proximity measure. In this paper, we present PF-GAP, an extension of RF-GAP proximities to proximity forests, an accurate and efficient time series classification model. We use the forest proximities in connection with Multi-Dimensional Scaling to obtain vector embeddings of univariate time series, comparing the embeddings to those obtained using various time series distance measures. We also use the forest proximities alongside Local Outlier Factors to investigate the connection between misclassified points and outliers, comparing with nearest neighbor classifiers which use time series distance measures. We show that the forest proximities may exhibit a stronger connection between misclassified points and outliers than nearest neighbor classifiers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.11394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we learn dynamics models for parametrized families of dynamical systems with varying properties. The dynamics models are formulated as stochastic processes conditioned on a latent context variable which is inferred from observed transitions of the respective system. The probabilistic formulation allows us to compute an action sequence which, for a limited number of environment interactions, optimally explores the given system within the parametrized family. This is achieved by steering the system through transitions being most informative for the context variable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for exploration on a non-linear toy-problem and two well-known reinforcement learning environments.</description>

      <title>Multiply Robust Causal Mediation Analysis with Continuous Treatments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many applications, researchers are interested in the direct and indirect causal effects of a treatment or exposure on an outcome of interest. Mediation analysis offers a rigorous framework for identifying and estimating these causal effects. For binary treatments, efficient estimators for the direct and indirect effects are presented by Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2012) based on the influence function of the parameter of interest. These estimators possess desirable properties such as multiple-robustness and asymptotic normality while allowing for slower than root-n rates of convergence for the nuisance parameters. However, in settings involving continuous treatments, these influence function-based estimators are not readily applicable without making strong parametric assumptions. In this work, utilizing a kernel-smoothing approach, we propose an estimator suitable for settings with continuous treatments inspired by the influence function-based estimator of Tchetgen Tchetgen and Shpitser (2012). Our proposed approach employs cross-fitting, relaxing the smoothness requirements on the nuisance functions and allowing them to be estimated at slower rates than the target parameter. Additionally, similar to influence function-based estimators, our proposed estimator is multiply robust and asymptotically normal, allowing for inference in settings where parametric assumptions may not be justified.</description>

      <title>Mixture of Linear Models Co-supervised by Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network (DNN) models have achieved phenomenal success for applications in many domains, ranging from academic research in science and engineering to industry and business. The modeling power of DNN is believed to have come from the complexity and over-parameterization of the model, which on the other hand has been criticized for the lack of interpretation. Although certainly not true for every application, in some applications, especially in economics, social science, healthcare industry, and administrative decision making, scientists or practitioners are resistant to use predictions made by a black-box system for multiple reasons. One reason is that a major purpose of a study can be to make discoveries based upon the prediction function, e.g., to reveal the relationships between measurements. Another reason can be that the training dataset is not large enough to make researchers feel completely sure about a purely data-driven result. Being able to examine and interpret the prediction function will enable researchers to connect the result with existing knowledge or gain insights about new directions to explore. Although classic statistical models are much more explainable, their accuracy often falls considerably below DNN. In this paper, we propose an approach to fill the gap between relatively simple explainable models and DNN such that we can more flexibly tune the trade-off between interpretability and accuracy. Our main idea is a mixture of discriminative models that is trained with the guidance from a DNN. Although mixtures of discriminative models have been studied before, our way of generating the mixture is quite different.</description>

      <title>A Validation Approach to Over-parameterized Matrix and Image Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of recovering a low-rank matrix from several noisy random linear measurements. We consider the setting where the rank of the ground-truth matrix is unknown a priori and use an objective function built from a rank-overspecified factored representation of the matrix variable, where the global optimal solutions overfit and do not correspond to the underlying ground truth. We then solve the associated nonconvex problem using gradient descent with small random initialization. We show that as long as the measurement operators satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with its rank parameter scaling with the rank of the ground-truth matrix rather than scaling with the overspecified matrix rank, gradient descent iterations are on a particular trajectory towards the ground-truth matrix and achieve nearly information-theoretically optimal recovery when it is stopped appropriately. We then propose an efficient stopping strategy based on the common hold-out method and show that it detects a nearly optimal estimator provably. Moreover, experiments show that the proposed validation approach can also be efficiently used for image restoration with deep image prior, which over-parameterizes an image with a deep network.</description>

      <title>A Sequential Quadratic Programming Method with High Probability Complexity Bounds for Nonlinear Equality Constrained Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A step-search sequential quadratic programming method is proposed for solving nonlinear equality constrained stochastic optimization problems. It is assumed that constraint function values and derivatives are available, but only stochastic approximations of the objective function and its associated derivatives can be computed via inexact probabilistic zeroth- and first-order oracles. Under reasonable assumptions, a high-probability bound on the iteration complexity of the algorithm to approximate first-order stationarity is derived. Numerical results on standard nonlinear optimization test problems illustrate the advantages and limitations of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>CST-YOLO: A Novel Method for Blood Cell Detection Based on Improved YOLOv7 and CNN-Swin Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blood cell detection is a typical small-scale object detection problem in computer vision. In this paper, we propose a CST-YOLO model for blood cell detection based on YOLOv7 architecture and enhance it with the CNN-Swin Transformer (CST), which is a new attempt at CNN-Transformer fusion. We also introduce three other useful modules: Weighted Efficient Layer Aggregation Networks (W-ELAN), Multiscale Channel Split (MCS), and Concatenate Convolutional Layers (CatConv) in our CST-YOLO to improve small-scale object detection precision. Experimental results show that the proposed CST-YOLO achieves 92.7%, 95.6%, and 91.1% mAP@0.5, respectively, on three blood cell datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art object detectors, e.g., RT-DETR, YOLOv5, and YOLOv7. Our code is available at https://github.com/mkang315/CST-YOLO.</description>

      <title>Causal Message Passing for Experiments with Unknown and General Network Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized experiments are a powerful methodology for data-driven evaluation of decisions or interventions. Yet, their validity may be undermined by network interference. This occurs when the treatment of one unit impacts not only its outcome but also that of connected units, biasing traditional treatment effect estimations. Our study introduces a new framework to accommodate complex and unknown network interference, moving beyond specialized models in the existing literature. Our framework, termed causal message-passing, is grounded in high-dimensional approximate message passing methodology. It is tailored for multi-period experiments and is particularly effective in settings with many units and prevalent network interference. The framework models causal effects as a dynamic process where a treated unit's impact propagates through the network via neighboring units until equilibrium is reached. This approach allows us to approximate the dynamics of potential outcomes over time, enabling the extraction of valuable information before treatment effects reach equilibrium. Utilizing causal message-passing, we introduce a practical algorithm to estimate the total treatment effect, defined as the impact observed when all units are treated compared to the scenario where no unit receives treatment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across five numerical scenarios, each characterized by a distinct interference structure.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Predictor Obtaining $2\sqrt{T}+1$ Distance to Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blasiok et al. [2023] proposed distance to calibration as a natural measure of calibration error that unlike expected calibration error (ECE) is continuous. Recently, Qiao and Zheng [2024] gave a non-constructive argument establishing the existence of an online predictor that can obtain $O(\sqrt{T})$ distance to calibration in the adversarial setting, which is known to be impossible for ECE. They leave as an open problem finding an explicit, efficient algorithm. We resolve this problem and give an extremely simple, efficient, deterministic algorithm that obtains distance to calibration error at most $2\sqrt{T}+1$.</description>

      <title>Jailbreaking Leading Safety-Aligned LLMs with Simple Adaptive Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02151v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that even the most recent safety-aligned LLMs are not robust to simple adaptive jailbreaking attacks. First, we demonstrate how to successfully leverage access to logprobs for jailbreaking: we initially design an adversarial prompt template (sometimes adapted to the target LLM), and then we apply random search on a suffix to maximize a target logprob (e.g., of the token "Sure"), potentially with multiple restarts. In this way, we achieve 100% attack success rate -- according to GPT-4 as a judge -- on Vicuna-13B, Mistral-7B, Phi-3-Mini, Nemotron-4-340B, Llama-2-Chat-7B/13B/70B, Llama-3-Instruct-8B, Gemma-7B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and R2D2 from HarmBench that was adversarially trained against the GCG attack. We also show how to jailbreak all Claude models -- that do not expose logprobs -- via either a transfer or prefilling attack with a 100% success rate. In addition, we show how to use random search on a restricted set of tokens for finding trojan strings in poisoned models -- a task that shares many similarities with jailbreaking -- which is the algorithm that brought us the first place in the SaTML'24 Trojan Detection Competition. The common theme behind these attacks is that adaptivity is crucial: different models are vulnerable to different prompting templates (e.g., R2D2 is very sensitive to in-context learning prompts), some models have unique vulnerabilities based on their APIs (e.g., prefilling for Claude), and in some settings, it is crucial to restrict the token search space based on prior knowledge (e.g., for trojan detection). For reproducibility purposes, we provide the code, logs, and jailbreak artifacts in the JailbreakBench format at https://github.com/tml-epfl/llm-adaptive-attacks.</description>

      <title>Postprocessing of point predictions for probabilistic forecasting of day-ahead electricity prices: The benefits of using isotonic distributional regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operational decisions relying on predictive distributions of electricity prices can result in significantly higher profits compared to those based solely on point forecasts. However, the majority of models developed in both academic and industrial settings provide only point predictions. To address this, we examine three postprocessing methods for converting point forecasts of day-ahead electricity prices into probabilistic ones: Quantile Regression Averaging, Conformal Prediction, and the recently introduced Isotonic Distributional Regression. We find that while the latter demonstrates the most varied behavior, it contributes the most to the ensemble of the three predictive distributions, as measured by Shapley values. Remarkably, the performance of the combination is superior to that of state-of-the-art Distributional Deep Neural Networks over two 4.5-year test periods from the German and Spanish power markets, spanning the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine.</description>

      <title>Self-Play Preference Optimization for Language Model Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Standard reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) approaches relying on parametric models like the Bradley-Terry model fall short in capturing the intransitivity and irrationality in human preferences. Recent advancements suggest that directly working with preference probabilities can yield a more accurate reflection of human preferences, enabling more flexible and accurate language model alignment. In this paper, we propose a self-play-based method for language model alignment, which treats the problem as a constant-sum two-player game aimed at identifying the Nash equilibrium policy. Our approach, dubbed Self-Play Preference Optimization (SPPO), utilizes iterative policy updates to provably approximate the Nash equilibrium. Additionally, we propose a new SPPO objective which is both strongly motivated by theory and is simple and effective in practice. In our experiments, using only 60k prompts (without responses) from the UltraFeedback dataset and without any prompt augmentation, by leveraging a pre-trained preference model PairRM with only 0.4B parameters, SPPO can obtain a model from fine-tuning Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 that achieves the state-of-the-art length-controlled win-rate of 28.53% against GPT-4-Turbo on AlpacaEval 2.0. It also outperforms the (iterative) DPO and IPO on MT-Bench, Arena-Hard, and the Open LLM Leaderboard. Starting from a stronger base model Llama-3-8B-Instruct, we are able to achieve a length-controlled win rate of 38.77%. Notably, the strong performance of SPPO is achieved without additional external supervision (e.g., responses, preferences, etc.) from GPT-4 or other stronger language models. Codes are available at https://github.com/uclaml/SPPO.</description>

      <title>Optimal Aggregation of Prediction Intervals under Unsupervised Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As machine learning models are increasingly deployed in dynamic environments, it becomes paramount to assess and quantify uncertainties associated with distribution shifts. A distribution shift occurs when the underlying data-generating process changes, leading to a deviation in the model's performance. The prediction interval, which captures the range of likely outcomes for a given prediction, serves as a crucial tool for characterizing uncertainties induced by their underlying distribution. In this paper, we propose methodologies for aggregating prediction intervals to obtain one with minimal width and adequate coverage on the target domain under unsupervised domain shift, under which we have labeled samples from a related source domain and unlabeled covariates from the target domain. Our analysis encompasses scenarios where the source and the target domain are related via i) a bounded density ratio, and ii) a measure-preserving transformation. Our proposed methodologies are computationally efficient and easy to implement. Beyond illustrating the performance of our method through real-world datasets, we also delve into the theoretical details. This includes establishing rigorous theoretical guarantees, coupled with finite sample bounds, regarding the coverage and width of our prediction intervals. Our approach excels in practical applications and is underpinned by a solid theoretical framework, ensuring its reliability and effectiveness across diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Learning Long Range Dependencies on Graphs via Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) excel at capturing local relationships but struggle with long-range dependencies in graphs. In contrast, graph transformers (GTs) enable global information exchange but often oversimplify the graph structure by representing graphs as sets of fixed-length vectors. This work introduces a novel architecture that overcomes the shortcomings of both approaches by combining the long-range information of random walks with local message passing. By treating random walks as sequences, our architecture leverages recent advances in sequence models to effectively capture long-range dependencies within these walks. Based on this concept, we propose a framework that offers (1) more expressive graph representations through random walk sequences, (2) the ability to utilize any sequence model for capturing long-range dependencies, and (3) the flexibility by integrating various GNN and GT architectures. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements on 19 graph and node benchmark datasets, notably outperforming existing methods by up to 13\% on the PascalVoc-SP and COCO-SP datasets.

      <title>Advancing Graph Generation through Beta Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have excelled in generating natural images and are now being adapted to a variety of data types, including graphs. However, conventional models often rely on Gaussian or categorical diffusion processes, which can struggle to accommodate the mixed discrete and continuous components characteristic of graph data. Graphs typically feature discrete structures and continuous node attributes that often exhibit rich statistical patterns, including sparsity, bounded ranges, skewed distributions, and long-tailed behavior. To address these challenges, we introduce Graph Beta Diffusion (GBD), a generative model specifically designed to handle the diverse nature of graph data. GBD leverages a beta diffusion process, effectively modeling both continuous and discrete elements. Additionally, we propose a modulation technique that enhances the realism of generated graphs by stabilizing critical graph topology while maintaining flexibility for other components. GBD competes strongly with existing models across multiple general and biochemical graph benchmarks, showcasing its ability to capture the intricate balance between discrete and continuous features inherent in real-world graph data. The PyTorch code is available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Differentiable and Learnable Wireless Simulation with Geometric Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14995v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling the propagation of electromagnetic wireless signals is critical for designing modern communication systems. Wireless ray tracing simulators model signal propagation based on the 3D geometry and other scene parameters, but their accuracy is fundamentally limited by underlying modelling assumptions and correctness of parameters. In this work, we introduce Wi-GATr, a fully-learnable neural simulation surrogate designed to predict the channel observations based on scene primitives (e.g., surface mesh, antenna position and orientation). Recognizing the inherently geometric nature of these primitives, Wi-GATr leverages an equivariant Geometric Algebra Transformer that operates on a tokenizer specifically tailored for wireless simulation. We evaluate our approach on a range of tasks (i.e., signal strength and delay spread prediction, receiver localization, and geometry reconstruction) and find that Wi-GATr is accurate, fast, sample-efficient, and robust to symmetry-induced transformations. Remarkably, we find our results also translate well to the real world: Wi-GATr demonstrates more than 35% lower error than hybrid techniques, and 70% lower error than a calibrated wireless tracer.</description>

      <title>Filtration learning in exact multi-parameter persistent homology and classification of time-series data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To analyze the topological properties of the given discrete data, one needs to consider a continuous transform called filtration. Persistent homology serves as a tool to track changes of homology in the filtration. The outcome of the topological analysis of data varies depending on the choice of filtration, making the selection of filtration crucial. Filtration learning is an attempt to find an optimal filtration that minimizes the loss function. Exact Multi-parameter Persistent Homology (EMPH) has been recently proposed, particularly for topological time-series analysis, that utilizes the exact formula of rank invariant instead of calculating it. In this paper, we propose a framework for filtration learning of EMPH. We formulate an optimization problem and propose an algorithm for solving the problem. We then apply the proposed algorithm to several classification problems. Particularly, we derive the exact formula of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the filtration parameters, which makes it possible to directly update the filtration without using automatic differentiation, significantly enhancing the learning process.</description>

      <title>Comparative Evaluation of Learning Models for Bionic Robots: Non-Linear Transfer Function Identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The control and modeling of robot dynamics have increasingly adopted model-free control strategies using machine learning. Given the non-linear elastic nature of bionic robotic systems, learning-based methods provide reliable alternatives by utilizing numerical data to establish a direct mapping from actuation inputs to robot trajectories without complex kinematics models. However, for developers, the method of identifying an appropriate learning model for their specific bionic robots and further constructing the transfer function has not been thoroughly discussed. Thus, this research introduces a comprehensive evaluation strategy and framework for the application of model-free control, including data collection, learning model selection, comparative analysis, and transfer function identification to effectively deal with the multi-input multi-output (MIMO) robotic data.</description>

      <title>RotRNN: Modelling Long Sequences with Rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear recurrent neural networks, such as State Space Models (SSMs) and Linear Recurrent Units (LRUs), have recently shown state-of-the-art performance on long sequence modelling benchmarks. Despite their success, their empirical performance is not well understood and they come with a number of drawbacks, most notably their complex initialisation and normalisation schemes. In this work, we address some of these issues by proposing RotRNN -- a linear recurrent model which utilises the convenient properties of rotation matrices. We show that RotRNN provides a simple and efficient model with a robust normalisation procedure, and a practical implementation that remains faithful to its theoretical derivation. RotRNN also achieves competitive performance to state-of-the-art linear recurrent models on several long sequence modelling datasets.</description>

      <title>On Characterizing and Mitigating Imbalances in Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: *Multi-Instance Partial Label Learning* (MI-PLL) is a weakly-supervised learning setting encompassing *partial label learning*, *latent structural learning*, and *neurosymbolic learning*. Unlike supervised learning, in MI-PLL, the inputs to the classifiers at training-time are tuples of instances $\mathbf{x}$. At the same time, the supervision signal is generated by a function $\sigma$ over the (hidden) gold labels of $\mathbf{x}$. In this work, we make multiple contributions towards addressing a problem that hasn't been studied so far in the context of MI-PLL: that of characterizing and mitigating *learning imbalances*, i.e., major differences in the errors occurring when classifying instances of different classes (aka *class-specific risks*). In terms of theory, we derive class-specific risk bounds for MI-PLL, while making minimal assumptions. Our theory reveals a unique phenomenon: that $\sigma$ can greatly impact learning imbalances. This result is in sharp contrast with previous research on supervised and weakly-supervised learning, which only studies learning imbalances under the prism of data imbalances. On the practical side, we introduce a technique for estimating the marginal of the hidden labels using only MI-PLL data. Then, we introduce algorithms that mitigate imbalances at training- and testing-time, by treating the marginal of the hidden labels as a constraint. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our techniques using strong baselines from neurosymbolic and long-tail learning, suggesting performance improvements of up to 14\%.</description>

      <title>Learning to Steer Markovian Agents under Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing incentives for an adapting population is a ubiquitous problem in a wide array of economic applications and beyond. In this work, we study how to design additional rewards to steer multi-agent systems towards desired policies \emph{without} prior knowledge of the agents' underlying learning dynamics. Motivated by the limitation of existing works, we consider a new and general category of learning dynamics called \emph{Markovian agents}. We introduce a model-based non-episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation for our steering problem. Importantly, we focus on learning a \emph{history-dependent} steering strategy to handle the inherent model uncertainty about the agents' learning dynamics. We introduce a novel objective function to encode the desiderata of achieving a good steering outcome with reasonable cost. Theoretically, we identify conditions for the existence of steering strategies to guide agents to the desired policies. Complementing our theoretical contributions, we provide empirical algorithms to approximately solve our objective, which effectively tackles the challenge in learning history-dependent strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Function-Space MCMC for Bayesian Wide Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14325v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian Neural Networks represent a fascinating confluence of deep learning and probabilistic reasoning, offering a compelling framework for understanding uncertainty in complex predictive models. In this paper, we investigate the use of the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson algorithm and its Langevin version to sample from the reparametrised posterior distribution of the weights as the widths of Bayesian Neural Networks grow larger. In addition to being robust in the infinite-dimensional setting, we prove that the acceptance probabilities of the proposed methods approach 1 as the width of the network increases, independently of any stepsize tuning. Moreover, we examine and compare how the mixing speeds of the underdamped Langevin Monte Carlo, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson and the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson Langevin samplers are influenced by changes in the network width in some real-world cases. Our findings suggest that, in wide Bayesian Neural Networks configurations, the preconditioned Crank-Nicolson method allows for more efficient sampling of the reparametrised posterior distribution, as evidenced by a higher effective sample size and improved diagnostic results compared with the other analysed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Autoregressive Models as Causal Inference Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing causal inference (CI) models are limited to primarily handling low-dimensional confounders and singleton actions. We propose an autoregressive (AR) CI framework capable of handling complex confounders and sequential actions common in modern applications. We accomplish this by {\em sequencification}, transforming data from an underlying causal diagram into a sequence of tokens. This approach not only enables training with data generated from any DAG but also extends existing CI capabilities to accommodate estimating several statistical quantities using a {\em single} model. We can directly predict interventional probabilities, simplifying inference and enhancing outcome prediction accuracy. We demonstrate that an AR model adapted for CI is efficient and effective in various complex applications such as navigating mazes, playing chess endgames, and evaluating the impact of certain keywords on paper acceptance rates.</description>
