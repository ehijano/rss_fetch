      <title>Signal Enhancement in Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data Using a Guided Unsupervised Deep Learning Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) is a promising technology introducing a new paradigm in the acquisition of high-resolution seismic data. However, DAS data often show weak signals compared to the background noise, especially in tough installation environments. In this study, we propose a new approach to denoise DAS data that leverages an unsupervised deep learning (DL) model, eliminating the need for labeled training data. The DL model aims to reconstruct the DAS signal while simultaneously attenuating DAS noise. The input DAS data undergo band-pass filtering to eliminate high-frequency content. Subsequently, a continuous wavelet transform (CWT) is performed, and the finest scale is used to guide the DL model in reconstructing the DAS signal. First, we extract 2D patches from both the band-pass filtered data and the CWT scale of the data. Then, these patches are converted using an unrolling mechanism into 1D vectors to form the input of the DL model. The architecture of the proposed DL network is composed of several fully-connected layers. A self-attention layer is further included in each layer to extract the spatial relation between the band-pass filtered data and the CWT scale. Through an iterative process, the DL model tunes its parameters to suppress DAS noise, with the band-pass filtered data serving as the target for the network. We employ the log cosh as a loss function for the DL model, enhancing its robustness against erratic noise. The denoising performance of the proposed framework is validated using field examples from the San Andreas Fault Observatory at Depth (SAFOD) and Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) datasets, where the data are recorded by a fiber-optic cable. Comparative analyses against three benchmark methods reveal the robust denoising performance of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Revisiting visualization of spiral states in a wide-gap spherical Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pioneering study conducted by Egbers and Rath [Acta Mech. 111 pp. 125--140 (1995)] experimentally captured spiral waves to elucidate the transition in the wide-gap spherical Couette flow. However, the physical field quantities of the spiral waves corresponding to light patterns of various intensities, as obtained in the experiment, remain unclear, and we have yet to move beyond the understanding that the reflected light from shear-sensitive flake tracers responds to a flow that appears at the transition. In this study, the experiment to visualize spiral waves using aluminum flakes, as performed by Egbers and Rath, was numerically reproduced by solving the translational and rotational motions of the particles in a spiral wave. First, the spiral wave in a spherical Couette flow with an aspect ratio $\eta=1/2$ was numerically calculated using the Newton--Raphson method. Subsequently, the image that was numerically reproduced from the spiral wave was compared with an experimentally visualized image. The torque acting on the inner sphere and the phase angular velocity of the spiral waves with various wavenumbers were provided. Attempts have been made to determine the instantaneous physical quantity to which the light and dark patterns obtained in the visualization corresponded, and the orientation motion of the flakes developed in the advective history of the flow is essential to yield favorable results. Exploring the correlation between flow visualization results and shear structures may provide a new avenue for quantitatively estimating spatial structures and time scales in complex and quickly time-varying flow fields, such as turbulence.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Magmatic Architecture Beneath Oceanus Procellarum: Insights from GRAIL Mission Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Oceanus Procellarum region, characterized by its vast basaltic plains and pronounced volcanic activity, serves as a focal point for understanding the volcanic history of the Moon. Leveraging the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission data, we imaged the magmatic structures beneath the Oceanus Procellarum region. Our 3D density models uncover pronounced linear magmatic structures along the Procellarum's western border and significant intrusions within the northern and southern Marius Hills. Crucially, they reveal three narrow near-horizontal sheeted magmatic structures, 80-150 km long, extending from near-surface to 6- 7 km depth, which we identified as sill-like magmatic conduits. These magmatic conduits connect the Marius Hills' northern and southern intrusions and bridge them with the Procellarum's western border structures. These discoveries suggest that sill-like magmatic conduits likely serve as central pathways facilitating magma transport across various volcanic systems and furthermore indicate widespread magmatic connectivity beneath the Oceanus Procellarum.</description>

      <title>Auto-Linear Phenomenon in Subsurface Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subsurface imaging involves solving full waveform inversion (FWI) to predict geophysical properties from measurements. This problem can be reframed as an image-to-image translation, with the usual approach being to train an encoder-decoder network using paired data from two domains: geophysical property and measurement. A recent seminal work (InvLINT) demonstrates there is only a linear mapping between the latent spaces of the two domains, and the decoder requires paired data for training.
  This paper extends this direction by demonstrating that only linear mapping necessitates paired data, while both the encoder and decoder can be learned from their respective domains through self-supervised learning. This unveils an intriguing phenomenon (named Auto-Linear) where the self-learned features of two separate domains are automatically linearly correlated. Compared with existing methods, our Auto-Linear has four advantages: (a) solving both forward and inverse modeling simultaneously, (b) applicable to different subsurface imaging tasks and achieving markedly better results than previous methods, (c)enhanced performance, especially in scenarios with limited paired data and in the presence of noisy data, and (d) strong generalization ability of the trained encoder and decoder.</description>
