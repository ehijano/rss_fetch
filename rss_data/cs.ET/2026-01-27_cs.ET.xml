      <title>Safety, Mobility, and Environmental Impacts of Driver-Assistance-Enabled Electric Vehicles: An Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advancement of vehicle automation and the growing adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) are reshaping transportation systems. While fully automated vehicles are expected to improve traffic stability, efficiency, and sustainability, recent studies suggest that partially automated vehicles, such as those equipped with adaptive cruise control (ACC), may adversely affect traffic flow. These drawbacks may not extend to ACC-enabled EVs due to their distinct mechanical characteristics, including regenerative braking and smoother torque delivery. As a result, the impacts of EVs operating under ACC remain insufficiently understood.
  To address this gap, this study develops an empirical framework using the OpenACC dataset to compare ACC-enabled EVs and internal combustion engine vehicles. Dynamic time warping aligns comparable lead-vehicle trajectories. Results show that EVs exhibit smoother speed profiles, lower speed variability, and shorter spacing, leading to higher efficiency. EVs reduce critical safety events by over 85% and lower platoon-level emissions by up to 26.2%.</description>

      <title>Eyes on the Mission: Mixed Methods Assessment of Eye-Tracker-Enabled Interactive Decision Support in a Simulated Unmanned Aerial Vehicle System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supervisors in military command and control (C2) environments face dynamic conditions. Dynamically changing information continuously flows to the supervisors through multiple displays. In this environment, important pieces of information can be overlooked due to the complexity of tasks and environments. This study examined the efficacy of an eye-tracker-based adaptive attention-guided decision support tool (DST) for supervisors in a simulated C2 environment. The DST monitors supervisors' visual attention allocation in real time and displays visually salient cues if critical changes or events are missed. Twenty-five military students participated in a simulated intelligence task. Results indicated significant performance enhancement when the adaptive DST was present. Eye-tracking analysis also showed that longer, more frequent fixations on critical areas of interest were negatively correlated with performance. Additionally, post-experiment interviews revealed that the adaptive DST was unobtrusive and positively received. These findings underscore the potential of real-time gaze-based interventions to optimize supervisory decision-making. Future research could incorporate AI-driven approaches to better support supervisors in complex task environments.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Cliff: A Critical Proton Tunneling Threshold Determines Clinical Severity in RPE65-Mediated Retinal Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting clinical severity from genotype remains a fundamental challenge in molecular medicine, particularly for enzymes whose function depends on sub-atomic-scale geometry. Mutations in the \textit{RPE65} isomerohydrolase cause Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) and related retinal diseases; however, the kinetic mechanisms connecting sub-atomic-scale perturbations to blindness remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that mutations in the human visual isomerase RPE65 are governed by a quantum-mechanical threshold effect arising from proton tunneling in the active site. We established a hybrid quantum-classical structure-to-phenotype pipeline combining AlphaFold structure prediction with \textit{ab initio} quantum simulation using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to analyze minimal proton-coupled electron transfer in the visual cycle. Our analysis reveals that many pathogenic mutations do not merely occlude the active site, but rather strongly reduce the quantum probability of proton tunneling. We observed a sharp non-linear effect, termed the "Quantum Cliff," where minute structural changes (below 0.1 \AA) reduce the reaction rate by multiple orders of magnitude. Based on these findings, we introduce a dimensionless Relative Quantum Activity Score (RQAS) that isolates the geometry-controlled exponential sensitivity of the reaction rate and successfully distinguishes between mild and severe patient phenotypes. These results suggest that RPE65 operates near a quantum-critical point, where sub-Angstrom structural perturbations induce a catastrophic loss of function. Furthermore, our findings establish quantum tunneling as a predictive mechanistic link between atomic structure and clinical phenotype, proposing a general framework for quantum-structural disease modeling.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Images of Blood Cells with Quantum Machine Learning Methods: Equilibrium Propagation and Variational Quantum Circuits to Detect Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a feasibility study demonstrating that quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms achieve competitive performance on real-world medical imaging despite operating under severe constraints. We evaluate Equilibrium Propagation (EP), an energy-based learning method that does not use backpropagation (incompatible with quantum systems due to state-collapsing measurements) and Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for automated detection of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) from blood cell microscopy images using binary classification (2 classes: AML vs. Healthy).
  Key Result: Using limited subsets (50-250 samples per class) of the AML-Cytomorphology dataset (18,365 expert-annotated images), quantum methods achieve performance only 12-15% below classical CNNs despite reduced image resolution (64x64 pixels), engineered features (20D), and classical simulation via Qiskit. EP reaches 86.4% accuracy (only 12% below CNN) without backpropagation, while the 4-qubit VQC attains 83.0% accuracy with consistent data efficiency: VQC maintains stable 83% performance with only 50 samples per class, whereas CNN requires 250 samples (5x more data) to reach 98%. These results establish reproducible baselines for QML in healthcare, validating NISQ-era feasibility.</description>

      <title>From Access Control to Usage Control with User-Managed Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent data protection and data governance regulations have intensified the demand for interoperable, decentralized data ecosystems that can support not only access control but also legally-aligned governance over data use. Existing Web-based data storage platforms increasingly struggle to meet these regulatory and practical requirements, as their authorization mechanisms rely on tightly coupled, document-centric access control models that lack expressiveness for legal constraints and fail to separate data management from authorization concerns. In parallel, widely adopted authorization standards remain poorly aligned with decentralized, semantically rich usage-control scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces an architecture that replaces Solid's native access control mechanisms with a UMA authorization flow, enabling the enforcement of usage control policies expressed with the W3C ODRL standard. This article details the conceptual background motivating this approach, presents the proposed UMA-based architecture, and describes a prototype implementation that integrates an ODRL-enabled Authorization Server with a Solid-compatible Resource Server. The prototype demonstrates that decoupling authorization from storage enables more flexible, interoperable, and legally expressive control over data use, while remaining compatible with existing Solid infrastructure. It also highlights practical design choices required to evaluate ODRL policies in the absence of a fully standardized evaluation semantics. Moreover, this work shows how usage control can be operationalized using existing Web standards, offering a concrete path beyond permission-based access control toward policy-aware, legally informed data governance. Future research will focus on policy management interfaces, richer claim verification mechanisms, and techniques for communicating and enforcing obligations over time.</description>

      <title>From Noise to Insights: Enhancing Supply Chain Decision Support through AI-Based Survey Integrity Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliability of survey data is crucial in supply chain decision-making, particularly when evaluating readiness for AI-driven tools such as safety stock optimization systems. However, surveys often attract low-effort or fake responses that degrade the accuracy of derived insights. This study proposes a lightweight AI-based framework for filtering unreliable survey inputs using a supervised machine learning approach. In this expanded study, a larger dataset of 99 industry responses was collected, with manual labeling to identify fake responses based on logical inconsistencies and response patterns. After preprocessing and label encoding, both Random Forest and baseline models (Logistic Regression, XGBoost) were trained to distinguish genuine from fake responses. The best-performing model achieved an 92.0% accuracy rate, demonstrating improved detection compared to the pilot study. Despite limitations, the results highlight the viability of integrating AI into survey pipelines and provide a scalable solution for improving data integrity in supply chain research, especially during product launch and technology adoption phases.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Evolution of Critical Thinking, Creativity, Communication and Collaboration in Higher Education Courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of Creativity, Communication, Critical Thinking, and Collaboration (the 4Cs) is a central objective of contemporary competency-based education. However, empirical evidence on how these competencies evolve across learning modules and instructional phases remains limited. This study evaluates the evolution of the 4Cs from pre-pilot to pilot implementation phases across three educational contexts, using the project's 4Cs theoretical framework as an analytical lens. The analysis of three pilot cases (IASIS, EASD, and UPATRAS) compares the 4Cs scores to identify patterns of growth, stagnation, or decline over time. Results indicate that communication and critical thinking showed the most consistent and substantial improvements, particularly in pilots with lower pre-pilot baselines, suggesting that structured pilot interventions effectively support cognitive and expressive competencies. In contrast, creativity exhibited context-dependent outcomes, while collaboration emerged as the most fragile competency, often stagnating or declining during scale-up. Interpreted through the theoretical framework, these findings suggest that competency evolution is strongly shaped by instructional design, assessment alignment, and learning activity structures rather than learner ability alone. The study contributes empirical validation to the 4Cs framework and highlights the need for differentiated, competency-sensitive design and evaluation strategies when scaling educational modules.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Multi-Agent Swarms for Autonomous Grid Security in Industrial IoT: A Consensus-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments expand to include tens of thousands of connected devices. The centralization of security monitoring architectures creates serious latency issues that savvy attackers can exploit to compromise an entire manufacturing ecosystem. This paper outlines a new, decentralized multi-agent swarm (DMAS) architecture that includes autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents at each edge gateway, functioning as a distributed digital "immune system" for IIoT networks. Instead of using a traditional static firewall approach, the DMAS agents communicate via a lightweight peer-to-peer protocol to cooperatively detect anomalous behavior across the IIoT network without sending data to a cloud infrastructure. The authors also outline a consensus-based threat validation (CVT) process in which agents vote on the threat level of an identified threat, enabling instant quarantine of a compromised node or nodes. The authors conducted experiments on a testbed that simulated an innovative factory environment with 2000 IIoT devices and found that the DMAS demonstrated sub-millisecond response times (average of 0.85ms), 97.3% accuracy in detecting malicious activity under high load, and 87% accuracy in detecting zero-day attacks. All significantly higher than baseline values for both centralized and edge computing. Additionally, the proposed architecture can prevent real-time cascading failures in industrial control systems and reduce network bandwidth use by 89% compared to cloud-based solutions.</description>

      <title>Over-The-Air Extreme Learning Machines with XL Reception via Nonlinear Cascaded Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recently envisioned goal-oriented communications paradigm calls for the application of inference on wirelessly transferred data via Machine Learning (ML) tools. An emerging research direction deals with the realization of inference ML models directly in the physical layer of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems, which, however, entails certain significant challenges. In this paper, leveraging the technology of programmable MetaSurfaces (MSs), we present an eXtremely Large (XL) MIMO system that acts as an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) performing binary classification tasks completely Over-The-Air (OTA), which can be trained in closed form. The proposed system comprises a receiver architecture consisting of densely parallel placed diffractive layers of XL MSs followed by a single reception radio-frequency chain. The front layer facing the MIMO channel consists of identical unit cells of a fixed NonLinear (NL) response, while the remaining layers of elements of tunable linear responses are utilized to approximate OTA the trained ELM weights. Our numerical investigations showcase that, in the XL regime of MS elements, the proposed XL-MIMO-ELM system achieves performance comparable to that of digital and idealized ML models across diverse datasets and wireless scenarios, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of embedding OTA learning capabilities into future communication systems.</description>

      <title>An MLIR Lowering Pipeline for Stencils at Wafer-Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine (WSE) delivers performance at an unprecedented scale of over 900,000 compute units, all connected via a single-wafer on-chip interconnect. Initially designed for AI, the WSE architecture is also well-suited for High Performance Computing (HPC). However, its distributed asynchronous programming model diverges significantly from the simple sequential or bulk-synchronous programs that one would typically derive for a given mathematical program description. Targeting the WSE requires a bespoke re-implementation when porting existing code. The absence of WSE support in compilers such as MLIR, meant that there was little hope for automating this process.
  Stencils are ubiquitous in HPC, and in this paper we explore the hypothesis that domain specific information about stencils can be leveraged by the compiler to automatically target the WSE without requiring application-level code changes. We present a compiler pipeline that transforms stencil-based kernels into highly optimized CSL code for the WSE, bridging the semantic gap between the mathematical representation of the problem and the WSE's asynchronous execution model. Based upon five benchmarks across three HPC programming technologies, running on both the Cerebras WSE2 and WSE3, our approach delivers comparable, if not slightly better, performance than manually optimized code. Furthermore, without requiring any application level code changes, performance on the WSE3 is around 14 times faster than 128 Nvidia A100 GPUs and 20 times faster than 128 nodes of a CPU-based Cray-EX supercomputer when using our approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is a pivotal enabler for the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). However, current research often relies on super-capable individual agents with complex transceiver architectures that defy the energy and processing constraints of realistic nanomachines. This paper proposes a paradigm shift towards collective intelligence, inspired by the cortical networks of the biological brain. We introduce a decentralized network architecture where simple nanomachines interact via a diffusive medium using a threshold-based firing mechanism modeled by Greenberg-Hastings (GH) cellular automata. We derive fixed-point equations for steady-state populations via mean-field analysis and validate them against stochastic simulations. We demonstrate that the network undergoes a second-order phase transition at a specific activation threshold. Crucially, we show that both pairwise and collective mutual information peak exactly at this critical transition point, confirming that the system maximizes information propagation and processing capacity at the edge of chaos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.18047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for implementing an optical neural network using only linear optical resources, namely field displacement and interferometry applied to coherent states of light. The nonlinearity required for learning in a neural network is realized via an encoding of the input into phase shifts allowing for far more straightforward experimental implementation compared to previous proposals for, and demonstrations of, $\textit{in situ}$ inference. Beyond $\textit{in situ}$ inference, the method enables $\textit{in situ}$ training by utilizing established techniques like parameter shift rules or physical backpropagation to extract gradients directly from measurements of the linear optical circuit. We also investigate the effect of photon losses and find the model to be very resilient to these.</description>

      <title>A Programming Model for Disaggregated Memory over CXL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16300v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: CXL (Compute Express Link) is an emerging open industry-standard interconnect between processing and memory devices that is expected to revolutionize the way systems are designed.
  It enables cache-coherent, shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with various storage devices using simple loads and stores.
  While CXL unleashes unique opportunities, it also introduces challenges of data management and crash consistency.
  For example, CXL currently lacks an adequate programming model, making it impossible to reason about the correctness and behavior of systems on top.
  In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs over CXL.
  We propose a high-level abstraction for memory accesses and formally define operational semantics.
  We demonstrate that CXL0 captures a wide range of current and future CXL setups and perform initial measurements on real hardware.
  To illustrate the usefulness of CXL0, we present a general transformation that enhances any linearizable concurrent algorithm with durability in a distributed partial-crash setting.
  We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and programming on top of CXL.</description>

      <title>Reducing T Gates with Unitary Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for achieving practical quantum computing but has a significant computational overhead. Among fault-tolerant (FT) gate operations, non-Clifford gates, such as $T$, are particularly expensive due to their reliance on magic state distillation. These costly $T$ gates appear frequently in FT circuits as many quantum algorithms require arbitrary single-qubit rotations, such as $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates, which must be decomposed into a sequence of $T$ and Clifford gates. In many quantum circuits, $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates can be fused to form a single $U3$ unitary. However, existing synthesis methods, such as Gridsynth, rely on indirect decompositions, requiring separate $R_z$ decompositions that result in a threefold increase in $T$ count.
  This work presents TensoR-based Arbitrary unitary SYNthesis (trasyn), a novel FT synthesis algorithm that directly synthesizes arbitrary single-qubit unitaries, avoiding the overhead of separate $R_z$ decompositions. By leveraging tensor network-based search, our approach enables native $U3$ synthesis, reducing the $T$ count, Clifford gate count, and approximation error. Compared to Gridsynth-based circuit synthesis, for 187 representative benchmarks, our design reduces the T count by up to 3.5$\times$, and Clifford gates by 7$\times$, resulting in up to 4$\times$ improvement in overall circuit infidelity.</description>

      <title>Prompt to Pwn: Automated Exploit Generation for Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Smart contracts are important for digital finance, yet they are hard to patch once deployed. Prior work mostly studies LLMs for vulnerability detection, leaving their automated exploit generation (AEG) capability unclear. This paper closes that gap with \textsc{ReX}, a framework that links LLM-based exploit synthesis to the Foundry stack for end-to-end generation, compilation, execution, and verification. Five recent LLMs are evaluated across eight common vulnerability classes, supported by a curated dataset of 38{+} real incident PoCs and three automation aids: prompt refactoring, a compiler feedback loop, and templated test harnesses. Results indicate strong performance on single-contract PoCs and weak performance on cross-contract attacks; outcomes depend mainly on the model and bug type, with code structure and prompt tuning contributing little. The study also surfaces gaps in current defenses against LLM-driven AEG, pointing to the need for stronger protections.</description>

      <title>Cross-Platform Scaling of Vision-Language-Action Models from Edge to Cloud GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as powerful generalist policies for robotic control, yet their performance scaling across model architectures and hardware platforms, as well as their associated power budgets, remain poorly understood. This work presents an evaluation of five representative VLA models -- spanning state-of-the-art baselines and two newly proposed architectures -- targeting edge and datacenter GPU platforms. Using the LIBERO benchmark, we measure accuracy alongside system-level metrics, including latency, throughput, and peak memory usage, under varying edge power constraints and high-performance datacenter GPU configurations. Our results identify distinct scaling trends: (1) architectural choices, such as action tokenization and model backbone size, strongly influence throughput and memory footprint; (2) power-constrained edge devices exhibit non-linear performance degradation, with some configurations matching or exceeding older datacenter GPUs; and (3) high-throughput variants can be achieved without significant accuracy loss. These findings provide actionable insights when selecting and optimizing VLAs across a range of deployment constraints. Our work challenges current assumptions about the superiority of datacenter hardware for robotic inference.</description>

      <title>Device-Native Autonomous Agents for Privacy-Preserving Negotiations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated negotiations in insurance and business-to-business (B2B) commerce encounter substantial challenges. Current systems force a trade-off between convenience and privacy by routing sensitive financial data through centralized servers, increasing security risks, and diminishing user trust. This study introduces a device-native autonomous Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent system for privacy-preserving negotiations. The proposed system operates exclusively on user hardware, enabling real-time bargaining while maintaining sensitive constraints locally. It integrates zero-knowledge proofs to ensure privacy and employs distilled world models to support advanced on-device reasoning. The architecture incorporates six technical components within an agentic AI workflow. Agents autonomously plan negotiation strategies, conduct secure multi-party bargaining, and generate cryptographic audit trails without exposing user data to external servers. The system is evaluated in insurance and B2B procurement scenarios across diverse device configurations. Results show an average success rate of 87%, a 2.4x latency improvement over cloud baselines, and strong privacy preservation through zero-knowledge proofs. User studies show 27% higher trust scores when decision trails are available. These findings establish a foundation for trustworthy autonomous agents in privacy-sensitive financial domains.</description>

      <title>TruthTensor: Evaluating LLMs through Human Imitation on Prediction Market under Drift and Holistic Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evaluating language models and AI agents remains fundamentally challenging because static benchmarks fail to capture real-world uncertainty, distribution shift, and the gap between isolated task accuracy and human-aligned decision-making under evolving conditions. This paper introduces TruthTensor, a novel, reproducible evaluation paradigm that measures reasoning models not only as prediction engines but as human-imitation systems operating in socially-grounded, high-entropy environments. Building on forward-looking, contamination-free tasks, our framework anchors evaluation to live prediction markets and combines probabilistic scoring to provide a holistic view of model behavior. TruthTensor complements traditional correctness metrics with drift-centric diagnostics and explicit robustness checks for reproducibility. It specify human vs. automated evaluation roles, annotation protocols, and statistical testing procedures to ensure interpretability and replicability of results. In experiments across 500+ real markets (political, economic, cultural, technological), TruthTensor demonstrates that models with similar forecast accuracy can diverge markedly in calibration, drift, and risk-sensitivity, underscoring the need to evaluate models along multiple axes (accuracy, calibration, narrative stability, cost, and resource efficiency). TruthTensor therefore operationalizes modern evaluation best practices, clear hypothesis framing, careful metric selection, transparent compute/cost reporting, human-in-the-loop validation, and open, versioned evaluation contracts, to produce defensible assessments of LLMs in real-world decision contexts. We publicly released TruthTensor at https://truthtensor.com.</description>
