      <title>Enumeration of $n$-plexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Palmer provides a method of enumerating $n$-plexes, however it has some typographical errors in the formula for the cycle index $Z(S_p^{(r)})$ and the values of $s_p^n$, the number of $n$-plexes on $p$ points. This article is intended to provide the correct formulas.</description>

      <title>An explicit family of 30 blocks meeting every 6-set of [60] in at least two points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit an explicit family $\mathcal{B}$ of $30$ subsets (``blocks'') of size $6$ of $[60]=\{1,2,\dots,60\}$ with the following property: for every $6$-subset $S\subset[60]$, there exists a block $B\in\mathcal{B}$ such that $|S\cap B|\ge 2$. The construction is fully explicit and the proof is purely combinatorial.</description>

      <title>Metric general position extensions of classical graph invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter framework that refines several classical graph invariants by imposing higher-order constraints along bounded-length geodesics. For integers $k,d\ge1$, a vertex set is called $k,d$-independent if every shortest path of length at most $d$ contains fewer than $k$ vertices of the set, giving rise to corresponding $k,d$-independence, chromatic, clique, and domination invariants. We develop a general framework for these parameters by associating each graph with a $k$-uniform hypergraph that encodes its geodesic structure. We then establish basic bounds and monotonicity properties, and introduce a notion of $k,d$-perfection extending the classical theory of perfect graphs. Exact formulas are obtained for the $k,d$-chromatic number of paths and cycles. In particular, all paths are $k,d$-perfect for all parameters, while cycles admit a complete classification of $k,d$-perfection that recovers the classical case when $k=2$ and exhibits new periodic and finite-exception behavior for $k\ge3$. We further investigate the interaction between $k,d$-invariants and graph powers, showing that while the $k=2$ case reduces to graph powers in a straightforward way, substantially different behavior arises for higher values of $k$, even for powers of paths.</description>

      <title>Positive expansions of permuted basement and quasisymmetric Macdonald polynomials at $t=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that the $q$-Whittaker polynomials, which are $t=0$ specializations of the Macdonald polynomials $P_\lambda(X;q,t)$, expand positively as the sum of Schur polynomials. Macdonald polynomials have a quasisymmetric refinement: the quasisymmetric Macdonald polynomials $G_\gamma(X;q,t)$, and a nonsymmetric refinement: the ASEP polynomials $f_\alpha(X;q,t)$. We study the $t=0$ specializations of both these families of polynomials and show analogous properties: the quasisymmetric Macdonald polynomials expand positively as a sum of quasisymmetric Schur functions, $\text{QS}_\gamma(X)$, and the ASEP polynomials expand positively as a sum of Demazure atoms, $\mathcal{A}_\alpha(X)$. As a corollary of the latter, we prove more generally that any permuted basement Macdonald polynomial has a positive expansion in the Demazure atoms at $t=0$. We give a description of the structure coefficients of $G_\gamma(X;q,0)$ and $f_\alpha(X;q,0)$ in both cases in terms of the charge statistic on a restricted set of semistandard tableaux.</description>

      <title>Proof of Convergence of a Laplace Expansion Algorithm For Calculating Recursions Satisfied by a Family of Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Evan and Hendel's recent proof of an outstanding conjecture on the resistance distances of a family of linear 3-trees, a key technique in the proof was calculating the recursion satisfied by a family of determinants. The underlying algorithm employed to prove the conjecture converged (i.e. terminated) in the particular case studied, and the paper presented an open question on when such a procedure converges in general. This paper proves convergence of the procedure for an arbitrary family of determinants of banded, square, Toeplitz matrices. Moreover, the algorithm in this paper improves several aspects of the algorithm of Evans and Hendel.</description>

      <title>Two conjectures in spectral hypergraph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a $k$-th order $n$-dimensional tensor, and we denote by ${\rm am}(\lambda, \mathcal{A})$ the algebraic multiplicity of the eigenvalue $\lambda$ of $\mathcal{A}$. The projective eigenvariety $\mathbb{V}_\lambda(\mathcal{A})$ is defined as the set of eigenvectors of $\mathcal{A}$ associated with $\lambda$, considered in the complex projective space. For a connected uniform hypergraph $H$, let $\mathcal{A}(H)$ and $\mathcal{L}(H)$ denote its adjacency tensor and Laplacian tensor, respectively. Let $\rho$ be the spectral radius of $\mathcal{A}(H)$, for which it is known that $|\mathbb{V}_{\rho}(\mathcal{A}(H))| = |\mathbb{V}_{0}(\mathcal{L}(H))|$. Recently, Fan [arXiv:2410.20830v2, 2024] conjectured that ${\rm am}(\rho, \mathcal{A}(H)) = |\mathbb{V}_{\rho}(\mathcal{A}(H))|$ and ${\rm am}(0, \mathcal{L}(H)) = {\rm am}(\rho, \mathcal{A}(H))$. In this paper, we prove these two conjectures, and thereby establish $$ {\rm am}(\rho, \mathcal{A}(H)) = |\mathbb{V}_{\rho}(\mathcal{A}(H))| = |\mathbb{V}_{0}(\mathcal{L}(H))| = {\rm am}(0, \mathcal{L}(H)). $$ As shown by Fan et al., $|\mathbb{V}_{\rho}(\mathcal{A}(H))|$ and $|\mathbb{V}_{0}(\mathcal{L}(H))|$ can be computed via the Smith normal form of the incidence matrix of $H$ over $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. Consequently, we provide a method for computing the algebraic multiplicity of the spectral radius and zero Laplacian eigenvalue for connected uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>On identity Seidel switches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seidel switching is a classical operation on graphs which plays a central role in the theory of two-graphs, signed graphs, and switching classes. In this paper we focus on those switches which leave a given graph invariant up to isomorphism. We call such subsets of the vertex set \emph{identity Seidel switches}. After recalling basic properties of Seidel switching and the associated abelian group structure, we introduce Seidel equivalence classes of graphs and then study the structure of the family of identity Seidel switches of a fixed graph. We show that this family forms a 14 pages; 2--group under composition, and we obtain structural constraints on graphs in which many vertices or edges give rise to identity switches. In particular, we derive necessary conditions in terms of degree parameters, and we characterize certain edge-identity switches via an automorphism of an induced subgraph. Several constructions and examples are presented, and some open problems are proposed.</description>

      <title>Large induced forests in planar multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices, denote by $a(G)$ the number of vertices in the largest induced forest in $G$. The Albertson-Berman conjecture, which is open since 1979, states that $a(G) \geq \frac{n}{2}$ for all simple planar graphs $G$. We show that the version of this problem for multigraphs (allowing parallel edges) is easily reduced to the problem about the independence number of simple planar graphs. Specifically, we prove that $a(M) \geq \frac{n}{4}$ for all planar multigraphs $M$ and that this lower bound is tight. Then, we study the case when the number of pairs of vertices with parallel edges, which we denote by $k$, is small. In particular, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{2}{5}n-\frac{k}{10}$ and that the Albertson-Berman conjecture for simple planar graphs, assuming that it holds, would imply the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{n-k}{2}$ for planar multigraphs, which would be better than the general lower bound when $k$ is small. Finally, we study the variant of the problem where the plane multigraphs are prohibited from having $2$-faces, which is the main non-trivial problem that we introduce in this article. For that variant without $2$-faces, we prove the lower bound $a(M) \geq \frac{3}{10}n+\frac{7}{30}$ and give a construction of an infinite sequence of multigraphs with $a(M)=\frac{3}{7}n+\frac{4}{7}$.</description>

      <title>More on spectral supersaturation for the bowtie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central topic in extremal graph theory is the supersaturation problem, which studies the minimum number of copies of a fixed substructure that must appear in any graph with more edges than the corresponding Tur\'an number. Significant works due to Erd\H{o}s, Rademacher, Lov\'{a}sz and Simonovits investigated the supersaturation problem for the triangle. Moreover, Kang, Makai and Pikhurko studied the case for the bowtie, which consists of two triangles sharing a vertex. Building upon the pivotal results established by Bollob\'{a}s, Nikiforov, Ning and Zhai on counting triangles via the spectral radius, we study in this paper the spectral supersaturation problem for the bowtie. Let $\lambda (G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$, and let $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor}^q$ be the graph obtained from Tur\'{a}n graph $T_{n,2}$ by adding $q$ pairwise disjoint edges to the partite set of size $\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil$. Firstly, we prove that there exists an absolute constant $\delta &gt;0$ such that if $n$ is sufficiently large, $2\le q \le \delta \sqrt{n}$, and $G$ is an $n$-vertex graph with $\lambda (G)\ge \lambda (K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor}^q)$, then $G$ contains at least ${q\choose 2}\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ bowties, and $K_{\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil, \lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor}^q$ is the unique spectral extremal graph. This solves an open problem proposed by Li, Feng and Peng. Secondly, we show that a graph $G$ whose spectral radius exceeds that of the spectral extremal graph for the bowtie must contain at least $\lfloor \frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor$ bowties. This sharp bound reveals a distinct phenomenon from the edge-supersaturation case, which guarantees at least $\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$ bowties.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic enumeration of constrained bipartite, directed and oriented graphs by degree sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the sufficiently sparse case, we find the probability that a uniformly random bipartite graph with given degree sequence contains no edge from a specified set of edges. This enables us to enumerate loop-free digraphs and oriented graphs with given in-degree and out-degree sequences, and obtain subgraph probabilities. Our theorems are not restricted to the near-regular case. As an application, we determine the expected permanent of sparse or very dense random matrices with given row and column sums; in the regular case, our formula holds over all densities. We also draw conclusions about the degrees of a random orientation of a random undirected graph with given degrees, including its number of Eulerian orientations.</description>

      <title>Arboreal Ultrametrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultametrics are an important class of distances used in applications such as phylogenetics, clustering and classification theory. Ultrametrics are essentially distances that can be represented by an edge-weighted rooted tree so that all of the distances in the tree from the root to any leaf of the tree are equal. In this paper, we introduce a generalization of ultrametrics called arboreal ultrametrics which have applications in phylogenetics and also arise in the theory of distance-hereditary graphs. These are partial distances, that is distances that are not necessarily defined for every pair of elements in the groundset, that can be represented by an ultrametric arboreal network, that is, an edge-weighted rooted network whose underlying graph is a tree. As with ultrametrics all of the distances in the ultrametric arboreal network from any root to any leaf below it are are equal but, in contrast, the network may have more than one root. In our two main results we characterize when a partial distance is an arboreal ultrametric as well as proving that, somewhat surprisingly, given any unrooted edge-weighted phylogenetic tree there is a necessarily unique way to insert roots into this tree so as to obtain an arboreal ultrametric.</description>

      <title>Stability results for Berge-matching in hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $F$, a hypergraph is called a Berge-$F$ if it can be obtained by expanding each edge of $F$ into a hyperedge containing it. Let $M_{k}$ denote the matching of size $k$. Kang, Ni, and Shan [12] determined the Tur\'an number of Berge-$M_k$. Our main result shows that if an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ on $n$ vertices has nearly as many edges as the extremal in their theorem without containing $M_k$, then $H$ must be structurally close to certain well-specified graphs. Meanwhile, our result also implies several stability results, such as the stability version of the well-known Erd\H{o}s-Gallai theorem (Erd\H{o}s and Gallai, 1959 [5]).</description>

      <title>L-log-concavity and a proof of the conjecture of Lam, Postnikov and Pylyavskyy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$, $\mu$, $\lambda'$, $\mu'$ be partitions. The conjecture of Lam, Postnikov and Pylyavskyy states that, if $\lambda+\mu = \lambda' + \mu'$, and $\min(\lambda_i-\lambda_j, \mu_i-\mu_j) \leq \lambda'_i - \lambda'_j \leq \max(\lambda_i-\lambda_j, \mu_i-\mu_j)$ for all $1 \leq i&lt;j \leq n$, then $s_{\lambda'} s_{\mu'} - s_{\lambda} s_{\mu}$ is Schur nonnegative. We prove this conjecture.
  Our proof is based on two key ideas. First, we introduce a new combinatorial model for Littlewood-Richardson coefficients which we name ``skeps", which are similar to but distinct from Knutson and Tao's hives. Second, we use tools from Murota's theory of L-convexity to prove an L-log-concavity theorem for skeps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Bruggesser-Mani's line shellings of polytopes, we introduce line shellings for the lattice of flats of a matroid: given a normal complex for a Bergman fan of a matroid induced by a building set, we show that the lexicographic order of the coordinates of its vertices is a shelling order. This gives a new proof of Bj\"orner's classical result that the order complex of the lattice of flats of a matroid is shellable, and demonstrates shellability for all nested set complexes for matroids.</description>

      <title>Neural Algorithmic Reasoning for Approximate $k$-Coloring with Recursive Warm Starts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Node coloring is the task of assigning colors to the nodes of a graph such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, while using as few colors as possible. It is the most widely studied instance of graph coloring and of central importance in graph theory; major results include the Four Color Theorem and work on the Hadwiger-Nelson Problem. As an abstraction of classical combinatorial optimization tasks, such as scheduling and resource allocation, it is also rich in practical applications. Here, we focus on a relaxed version, approximate $k$-coloring, which is the task of assigning at most $k$ colors to the nodes of a graph such that the number of edges whose vertices have the same color is approximately minimized. While classical approaches leverage mathematical programming or SAT solvers, recent studies have explored the use of machine learning. We follow this route and explore the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for node coloring. We first present an optimized differentiable algorithm that improves a prior approach by Schuetz et al. with orthogonal node feature initialization and a loss function that penalizes conflicting edges more heavily when their endpoints have higher degree; the latter inspired by the classical result that a graph is $k$-colorable if and only if its $k$-core is $k$-colorable. Next, we introduce a lightweight greedy local search algorithm and show that it may be improved by recursively computing a $(k-1)$-coloring to use as a warm start. We then show that applying such recursive warm starts to the GNN approach leads to further improvements. Numerical experiments on a range of different graph structures show that while the local search algorithms perform best on small inputs, the GNN exhibits superior performance at scale. The recursive warm start may be of independent interest beyond graph coloring for local search methods for combinatorial optimization.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of nested set complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study structural and topological properties of nested set complexes of matroids with arbitrary building sets, proving that these complexes are vertex decomposable and admit convex ear decompositions. These results unify and generalize several recent and classical theorems on Bergman complexes and augmented Bergman complexes of matroids. As a first application, we show that the $h$-vector of a nested set complex is strongly flawless and, in particular, top-heavy. We then specialize to the boundary complex of the Deligne--Mumford--Knudsen moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0, n}$ of rational stable marked curves, which coincides with the complex of trees, establishing new structural decomposition theorems and deriving combinatorial formulas for its face enumeration polynomials.</description>

      <title>Basis Number of Graphs Excluding Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The basis number of a graph $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that the cycle space of $G$ is generated by a family of cycles using each edge at most $k$ times. A classical result of Mac Lane states that planar graphs are exactly graphs with basis number at most 2, and more generally, graphs embedded on a fixed surface are known to have bounded basis number. Generalising this, we prove that graphs excluding a fixed minor $H$ have bounded basis number.
  Our proof uses the Graph Minor Structure Theorem, which requires us to understand how basis number behaves in tree-decompositions. In particular, we prove that graphs of treewidth $k$ have basis number bounded by some function of $k$. We handle tree-decompositions using the proof framework developed by Boja\'nczyk and Pilipczuk in their proof of Courcelle's conjecture.
  Combining our approach with independent results of Miraftab, Morin and Yuditsky (2025) on basis number and path-decompositions, one can moreover improve our upper bound to a polynomial one: there exists an absolute constant $c&gt;0$ such that every $H$-minor free graph has basis number $O(|H|^c)$.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this survey is to provide a gentle introduction to several recent breakthroughs in graph Ramsey theory. In particular, we will outline the proofs (due to various groups of authors) of exponential improvements to the diagonal, near-diagonal, and multicolour Ramsey numbers, improved lower bounds on $R(3,k)$ and $R(4,k)$, and an exponential upper bound on the induced Ramsey numbers.</description>

Abstract: Classical anti-concentration results focus on the random sum $S := \sum _{i=1}^n \xi_i v_i$, where $\xi_i$ are independent random variables and $v_i$ are real numbers. In this paper, we prove new concentration results concerning the random sum $S := \sum_{i=1}^n w_{\pi _i } v_i $, where $w_i , v_i$ are real numbers and $\pi$ is a random permutation.</description>

      <title>Asymmetrically Weighted Dowker Persistence and Applications in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By their nature it is difficult to differentiate chaotic dynamical systems through measurement. In recent years, work has begun on using methods of Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to qualitatively type dynamical data by approximating the topology of the underlying attracting set. This comes with the additional challenges of high dimensionality incurring computational complexity along with the lack of directional information encoded in the approximated topology. Due to the latter fact, standard methods of TDA for this high dimensional dynamical data do not differentiate between periodic cycles and non-periodic cycles in the attractor. We present a framework to address both of these challenges. We begin by binning the dynamical data, and capturing the sequential information in the form of a coarse-grained weighted and directed network. We then calculate the persistent Dowker homology of the asymmetric network, encoding spatial and temporal information. Analytically, we highlight the differences in periodic and non-periodic cycles by providing a full characterization of their one-dimensional Dowker persistences. We prove how the homologies of graph wedge sums can be described in terms of the wedge component homologies. Finally, we generalize our characterization to cactus graphs with arbitrary edge weights and orientations. Our analytical results give insight into how our method captures temporal information in its asymmetry, producing a persistence framework robust to noise and sensitive to dynamical structure.</description>

Abstract: We prove an infinite family of linear identities for the number $A_5(n)$ of partition pairs of $n$ with $5$-cores by using certain theta function identities involving the Ramanujan's parameter $k(q)$ due to Cooper, and Lee and Park. Consequently, we deduce an infinite family of congruences for $A_5(n)$ using these linear identities.</description>

      <title>Branch-width of connectivity functions is fixed-parameter tractable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A connectivity function on a finite set $V$ is a symmetric submodular function $f \colon 2^V \to \mathbb{Z}$ with $f(\emptyset)=0$. We prove that finding a branch-decomposition of width at most $k$ for a connectivity function given by an oracle is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT), by providing an algorithm of running time $2^{O(k^2)} \gamma n^6 \log n$, where $\gamma$ is the time to compute $f(X)$ for any set $X$, and $n = |V|$. This improves the previous algorithm by Oum and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser.~B, 2007], which runs in time $\gamma n^{O(k)}$. Our algorithm can be applied to rank-width of graphs, branch-width of matroids, branch-width of (hyper)graphs, and carving-width of graphs. This resolves an open problem asked by Hlin\v{e}n\'y [SIAM J. Comput., 2005], who asked whether branch-width of matroids given by the rank oracle is fixed-parameter tractable. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the best known dependency on $k$ in the running times of FPT algorithms for graph branch-width, rank-width, and carving-width.</description>

Abstract: We present a new probabilistic proof of Otter's asymptotic formula for the number of unlabelled trees with a given number of vertices. We additionally prove a new approximation result, showing that the total variation distance between random P\'olya trees and random unlabelled trees tends to zero when the number of vertices tends to infinity. In order to demonstrate that our approach is not restricted to trees we extend our results to tree-like classes of graphs.</description>

      <title>Listing faces of polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02584v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of listing faces of combinatorial polytopes, such as hypercubes, permutahedra, associahedra, and their generalizations. Firstly, we consider the face lattice, which is the inclusion order of all faces of a polytope, and we seek a Hamiltonian cycle in its cover graph, i.e., for any two consecutive faces, one must be a subface of the other, and their dimensions differ by 1. We construct such Hamiltonian cycles for hypercubes, permutahedra, $B$-permutahedra, associahedra, cyclic polytopes, 3-dimensional polytopes, graph associahedra of chordal graphs, and quotientopes. Secondly, we consider facet-Hamiltonian cycles, which are cycles on the skeleton of a polytope that enter and leave every facet exactly once. This notion was recently introduced by Akitaya, Cardinal, Felsner, Kleist, and Lauff [SODA 2025], where the authors conjectured that $B$-permutahedra admit a facet-Hamiltonian cycle for all dimensions. We construct such facet-Hamiltonian cycles in this paper, thus establishing their conjecture as a theorem. A key tool we use are so-called rhombic strips, which are planar spanning subgraphs of the cover graph of the face lattice in which every face is a 4-cycle. Specifically, we construct a rhombic strip in the face lattice of the hypercube of any dimension, and characterize the existence of rhombic strips in the face lattice of 3-dimensional polytopes. Our constructions yield time- and space-efficient algorithms for computing the aforementioned cycles and thus for listing the corresponding combinatorial objects, including ordered set partitions and dissections of a convex polygon.</description>

Abstract: We construct growth bijections for bipolar oriented planar maps and for Schnyder woods. These give direct combinatorial proofs of several counting identities for these objects.
  Our method mainly uses two ingredients. First, a slit-slide-sew operation, which consists in slightly sliding a map along a well-chosen path. Second, the study of the orbits of natural rerooting operations on the considered classes of oriented maps.</description>

      <title>Curves on the torus with few intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aougab and Gaster [Math. Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 174 (2023), 569-584] proved that any set of simple closed curves on the torus, where any two are non-homotopic and intersect at most k times, has a maximum size of $k+O(\sqrt{k}\log k)$. We determine the maximum size of such a set for every k. In particular, the maximum never exceeds k+6, and it does not exceed k+4 when k is large.
  As this quantity coincides with the maximal number of columns of a generic k-modular matrix with two rows, our result also settles the column number problem, a problem of interest in combinatorial optimization, for such matrices.</description>

      <title>Permutation-based Strategies for Labeled Chip-Firing on $k$-ary Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09577v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chip-firing is a combinatorial game on a graph, in which chips are placed and dispersed among its vertices until a stable configuration is achieved. We specifically study a chip-firing variant on an infinite, rooted, directed $k$-ary tree where we place $k^n$ chips labeled $0,1,\dots, k^n-1$ on the root for some nonnegative integer $n$, and we say a vertex $v$ can fire if it has at least $k$ chips. When a vertex fires, we select $k$ labeled chips and send the $i$th smallest chip among them to its $i$th leftmost child. A stable configuration is reached when no vertex can fire. In this paper, we focus on stable configurations resulting from specific firing strategies based on permutations of $1, 2, \dots, n$. We then express the stable configuration as a permutation of $0,1, 2, \dots, k^n-1$ and explore its properties, such as the number of inversions and descents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nut graph is a nontrivial simple graph whose adjacency matrix has a simple eigenvalue zero such that the corresponding eigenvector has no zero entries. It is known that the order $n$ and degree $d$ of a vertex-transitive nut graph satisfy $4 \mid d$, $d \ge 4$, $2 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 4$; or $d \equiv 2 \pmod 4$, $d \ge 6$, $4 \mid n$ and $n \ge d + 6$. Here, we prove that for each such $n$ and $d$, there exists a $d$-regular Cayley nut graph of order $n$. As a direct consequence, we obtain all the pairs $(n, d)$ for which there is a $d$-regular vertex-transitive (resp. Cayley) nut graph of order $n$.</description>

      <title>On the non-zero divisor graph of the Hamilton quaternions over $\mathbb Z_{2^n}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring with unity. The non-zero divisor graph of $R$, $\Phi(R)$, is the graph with vertex set $R\backslash \{0,1,-1\}$, and two vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if either $xy$ or $yx$ is non-zero. In this article we associate $\Phi(R)$ to the ring of Hamilton quaternions over $\mathbb Z_{2^n}$, $\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n})$. The detailed structure of the elements in $\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n})$ is presented, based on which various structural properties of the graph $\Phi(\mathbb H(\mathbb Z_{2^n}))$, such as connectedness, adjacency of vertices, traversability, and planarity, are studied. Furthermore, we derive bounds for clique number and chromatic number.</description>

Abstract: A central question in the theory of hyperplane arrangements is when the complement of a complex arrangement is aspherical. Barkley and Speyer introduced a class of real arrangements that are called "clean," and Yoshinaga proved that every real arrangement whose complexification is $K(\pi,1)$ is clean. We show that cleanliness is equivalent to a natural statement about the Varchenko-Gelfand ring, which in practice allows for fast calculation. We conclude with an investigation of the relationships between various properties of arrangements, including cleanliness and the asphericity of the arrangement complement.</description>

Abstract: Chordal graphs and chordal bigraphs enjoy beautiful characterizations, in terms of forbidden subgraphs, vertex/edge orderings, vertex/edge separating sets, and tree-like representations. In this paper, we introduce chordal signed graphs and chordal signed bigraphs. Interestingly, chordal signed graphs are equivalent to strict chordal digraphs studied by Hell and Hern\'andez-Cruz. A forbidden subdigraph characterization of strict chordal digraphs can be translated to a forbidden subgraph characterization of chordal signed graphs. We give a forbidden subgraph characterization of chordal signed bigraphs. The forbidden subgraphs for chordal signed bigraphs are analogous to those for chordal signed graphs but the proofs are much more complicated and intriguing.</description>

      <title>The Littlewood-Richardson rule for Schur multiple zeta functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03970</link>

Abstract: The Schur multiple zeta function was defined as a multivariable function by Nakasuji-Phuksuwan-Yamasaki. Inspired by the product formula of Schur functions, the products of Schur multiple zeta functions have been studied. While the product of two Schur functions expands as a linear combination of Schur functions, it is known that a similar expansion for the product of Schur multiple zeta functions can be obtained by symmetrizing, i.e., by taking the summation over all permutations of the variables. In this paper, we present a more refined formula by restricting the summation from the full symmetric group to its specific subgroup.</description>

      <title>Classification of Cellular Fake Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic polyhedra are interesting mathematical objects to study in their own right. In this paper, we initialize a systematic study of two-dimensional generic polyhedra with an eye towards applications to low-dimensional topology, especially the Andrews-Curtis and Zeeman conjectures. After recalling the basic notions of generic polyhedra and fake surfaces, we derive some interesting properties of fake surfaces. Our main result is a complete classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces up to complexity 4 and a classification of acyclic cellular fake surfaces without small disks of complexity 5. From this classification, we prove the contractibility conjecture for acyclic cellular fake surfaces of complexity 4, and the embedded disk conjecture up to complexity 5. We provide evidence for the conjectures that the probability of being a spine among fake surfaces is 0 and that every contractible fake surface has an embedded disk.</description>

      <title>Fast Approximation Algorithms for Euclidean Minimum Weight Perfect Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07749v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem for $n$ points in the plane. It is known that any deterministic approximation algorithm whose approximation ratio depends only on $n$ requires at least $\Omega(n \log n)$ time. We propose such an algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem with runtime $O(n\log n)$ and show that it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.206})$. This improves the so far best known approximation ratio of $n/2$. We also develop an $O(n \log n)$ algorithm for the Euclidean minimum weight perfect matching problem in higher dimensions and show it has approximation ratio $O(n^{0.412})$ in all fixed dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the algebraic matroid induced by the ideal of (r+1)-minors of a matrix of variables over a field. This is inherently connected to the bounded-rank matrix completion problem, in which the aim is to complete a partially observed rank r matrix. We give criteria that detect dependent sets in the matroid, we describe a family of bases of the matroid, and we study the question of unique completability.</description>

      <title>Remarks on a certain restricted partition function of Lin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23996v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $b(n)$ be the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ consists of distinct odd parts, and $\pi_2$ and $\pi_3$ consist of parts divisible by $4$. Utilizing modular forms, Lin obtained the generating functions for $b(3n+1)$ and $b(3n+2)$, which yields the congruence $b(3n+2)\equiv 0\pmod{3}$ for all $n\geq 0$. We provide in this note elementary proofs of these generating functions by employing $q$-series manipulations and dissection formulas. We also establish infinite families of internal congruences modulo $3$ for $b(n)$.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for certain two restricted partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an integer $c\geq 1$, let $a_c(n)$ count the number of generalized cubic partitions of $n$, which are partitions of $n$ whose even parts may appear in $c$ different colors, and $d_c(n)$ count the number of partitions obtained by adding the links of the $c$-elongated plane partition diamonds of length $n$. We prove in this note infinite families of congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ by employing elementary $q$-series techniques. These results generalize particular congruences modulo $7$ and $11$ for $a_c(n)$ and $d_c(n)$ recently found by Dockery, and Baruah, Das, and Talukdar, respectively, using modular forms.</description>

      <title>Congruences for an analogue of Lin's partition function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study certain arithmetic properties of an analogue $B(n)$ of Lin's restricted partition function that counts the number of partition triples $\pi=(\pi_1,\pi_2,\pi_3)$ of $n$ such that $\pi_1$ and $\pi_2$ comprise distinct odd parts and $\pi_3$ consists of parts divisible by $4$. With the help of elementary $q$-series techniques and modular functions, we establish Ramanujan-type congruences modulo $2,3,5,7$, and $9$ for certain sums involving $B(n)$.</description>
