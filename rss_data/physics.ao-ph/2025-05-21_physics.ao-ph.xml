      <title>Generalizable neural-network parameterization of mesoscale eddies in idealized and global ocean models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08900v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven methods have become popular to parameterize the effects of mesoscale eddies in ocean models. However, they perform poorly in generalization tasks and may require retuning if the grid resolution or ocean configuration changes. We address the generalization problem by enforcing physical constraints on a neural network parameterization of mesoscale eddy fluxes. We found that the local scaling of input and output features helps to generalize to unseen grid resolutions and depths offline in the global ocean. The scaling is based on dimensional analysis and incorporates grid spacing as a length scale. We formulate our findings as a general algorithm that can be used to enforce data-driven parameterizations with dimensional scaling. The new parameterization improves the representation of kinetic and potential energy in online simulations with idealized and global ocean models. Comparison to baseline parameterizations and impact on global ocean biases are discussed.</description>

      <title>Improving Medium Range Severe Weather Prediction through Transformer Post-processing of AI Weather Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving the skill of medium-range (1-8 day) severe weather prediction is crucial for mitigating societal impacts. This study introduces a novel approach leveraging decoder-only transformer networks to post-process AI-based weather forecasts, specifically from the Pangu-Weather model, for improved severe weather guidance. Unlike traditional post-processing methods that use a dense neural network to predict the probability of severe weather using discrete forecast samples, our method treats forecast lead times as sequential ``tokens'', enabling the transformer to learn complex temporal relationships within the evolving atmospheric state. We compare this approach against post-processing of the Global Forecast System (GFS) using both a traditional dense neural network and our transformer, as well as configurations that exclude convective parameters to fairly evaluate the impact of using the Pangu-Weather AI model. Results demonstrate that the transformer-based post-processing significantly enhances forecast skill compared to dense neural networks. Furthermore, AI-driven forecasts, particularly Pangu-Weather initialized from high resolution analysis, exhibit superior performance to GFS in the medium-range, even without explicit convective parameters. Our approach offers improved accuracy, and reliability, which also provides interpretability through feature attribution analysis, advancing medium-range severe weather prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Regularized Fingerprinting with Linearly Optimal Weight Matrix in Detection and Attribution of Climate Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate change detection and attribution play a central role in establishing the causal influence of human activities on global warming. The dominant framework, optimal fingerprinting, is a linear errors-in-variables model in which each covariate is subject to measurement error with covariance proportional to that of the regression error. The reliability of such analyses depends critically on accurate inference of the regression coefficients. The optimal weight matrix for estimating these coefficients is the precision matrix of the regression error, which is typically unknown and must be estimated from climate model simulations. However, existing regularized optimal fingerprinting approaches often yield underestimated uncertainties and overly narrow confidence intervals that fail to attain nominal coverage, thereby compromising the reliability of analysis. In this paper, we first propose consistent variance estimators for the regression coefficients within the class of linear shrinkage weight matrices, addressing undercoverage in conventional methods. Building on this, we derive a linearly optimal weight matrix that directly minimizes the asymptotic variances of the estimated scaling factors. Numerical studies confirm improved empirical coverage and shorter interval lengths. When applied to annual mean temperature data, the proposed method produces narrower, more reliable intervals and provides new insights into detection and attribution across different regions.</description>
