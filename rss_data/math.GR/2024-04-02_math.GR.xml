      <title>A contribution to the theory of $\sigma$-properties of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize some classes of finite soluble groups. In particular, we prove that: a finite group $G$ is supersoluble if and only if $G$ has a normal subgroup $D$ such that $G/D$ is supersoluble and $D$ avoids every chief factor of $G$ between $V^{G}$ and $V_{G}$ for every maximal subgroup $V$ of the generalized Fitting subgroup $F^{*}(G)$ of $G$; a finite soluble group $G$ is a $PST$-group (that is, Sylow permutability is a transitive relation on $G$) if and only if $G$ has a normal subgroup $D$ such that $G/D$ is nilpotent and $D$ avoids every chief factor of $G$ between $V^{G}$ and $V_{G}$ for every subnormal subgroup $A$ of $G$.</description>

      <title>Conciseness on normal subgroups and new concise words from outer commutator words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $w=w(x_1,\ldots,x_r)$ be an outer commutator word. We show that the word $w(u_1,\ldots,u_r)$ is concise whenever $u_1,\ldots,u_r$ are non-commutator words in disjoint sets of variables. This applies in particular to words of the form $w(x_1^{n_1},\ldots,x_r^{n_r})$, where the $n_i$ are non-zero integers. Our approach is via the study of values of $w$ on normal subgroups, and in this setting we obtain the following result: if $N_1,\ldots,N_r$ are normal subgroups of a group $G$ and the set of all values $w(g_1,\ldots,g_r)$ with $g_i\in N_i$ is finite then also the subgroup generated by these values, i.e. $w(N_1,\ldots,N_r)$, is finite.</description>

      <title>Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$ and the Cowling--Haagerup constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$ is an obstruction to weak amenability with Cowling--Haagerup constant $1$. More precisely, if $G$ is a countable group and $H$ is an infinite subgroup of $G$ such that the pair $(G,H)$ has relative Property $\mathrm{(TTT)}$, then the weak Haagerup constant $\boldsymbol\Lambda_{\mathrm{WH}}(G)$ is strictly greater than $1$. We apply this result to some semidirect products and lattices in higher rank algebraic groups.</description>

      <title>Oriented graphs, Frattini-resistance, and maximal pro-$p$ Galois groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. Following Snopce-Tanushevski, a pro-$p$ group $G$ is called Frattini-resistant if the function $H\mapsto\Phi(H)$, from the poset of all closed finitely-generated subgroups of $G$ into itself, is a poset embedding. We prove that for an oriented right-angled Artin pro-$p$ group (oriented pro-$p$ RAAG) $G$ associated to an oriented graph the following four conditions are equivalent: the associated oriented graph is of elementary type; $G$ is Frattini-resistant; every topologically finitely generated closed subgroup of $G$ is an oriented pro-$p$ RAAG; $G$ is the maximal pro-$p$ Galois group of a field containing a root of 1 of order $p$. Also, we conjecture that in the $\mathbb{Z}/p$-cohomology of a Frattini-resistant pro-$p$ group there are no essential triple Massey products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The following refinement of the Higman embedding theorem is proved: Given a finitely generated recursively presented group $R$, there exists a quasi-isometric malnormal embedding of $R$ into a finitely presented group $H$ such that the image of the embedding enjoys the Congruence Extension Property. Moreover, it is shown that the group $H$ can be constructed to have decidable Word problem if and only if the Word problem of $R$ is decidable, yielding a refinement of a theorem of Clapham. Finally, it is proved that for any countable group $G$ and any computable function $\ell:G\to\mathbb{N}$ satisfying some necessary requirements, there exists a malnormal embedding enjoying the Congruence Extension Property of $G$ into a finitely presented group $H$ such that the restriction of $|\cdot|_H$ to $G$ is equivalent to $\ell$, producing a refinement of a result of Ol'shanskii.</description>

      <title>Finite groups with some subgroups of prime power order satisfying the partial $ \Pi $-property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $ H $ be a subgroup of a finite group $ G $. We say that $ H $ satisfies the partial $ \Pi $-property in $ G $ if there exists a $G$-chief series $ \varGamma_{G}: 1 =G_{0} &lt; G_{1} &lt; \cdot\cdot\cdot &lt; G_{n}= G $ of $ G $ such that $ | G / G_{i-1} : N_{G/G_{i-1}} (HG_{i-1}/G_{i-1}\cap G_{i}/G_{i-1})| $ is a $ \pi (HG_{i-1}/G_{i-1}\cap G_{i}/G_{i-1}) $-number for every $ G $-chief factor $ G_{i}/G_{i-1} $ of $ \varGamma_{G} $, $1\leq i\leq n$. In this paper, we investigate the structure of a finite group $ G $ under the assumption that some subgroups of prime power order satisfy the partial $ \Pi $-property.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bogolyubov for special linear groups via tensor rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a polynomial Bogolyubov type lemma for the special linear group over finite fields. Specifically, we show that there exists an absolute constant $C&gt;0,$ such that if $A$ is a density $\alpha$ subset of the special linear group, then the set $AA^{-1}AA^{-1}$ contains a subgroup $H$ of density $\alpha^C$. Moreover, this subgroup is isomorphic to a special linear group of a smaller rank. We also show that if $A$ is an approximate subgroups then it can be covered by the union of few cosets of $H$. Our proof makes use of the Gurevich--Howe notion of tensor rank, and of a strengthened Bonami type Lemma for global functions on the bilinear scheme. We also present applications to spectral bounds for global convolution operators, global product free sets, and covering numbers corresponding to global sets.</description>

      <title>Foundations of geometric approximate group theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.15303v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the foundations of a geometric theory of countably-infinite approximate groups, extending work of Bj\"orklund and the second-named author. Our theory is based on the notion of a quasi-isometric quasi-action (qiqac) of an approximate group on a metric space.
  More specifically, we introduce a geometric notion of finite generation for approximate group and prove that every geometrically finitely-generated approximate group admits a geometric qiqac on a proper geodesic metric space. We then show that all such spaces are quasi-isometric, hence can be used to associate a canonical QI type with every geometrically finitely-generated approximate group. This in turn allows us to define geometric invariants of approximate groups using QI invariants of metric spaces. Among the invariants we consider are asymptotic dimension, finiteness properties, numbers of ends and growth type. For geometrically finitely-generated approximate groups of polynomial growth we derive a version of Gromov's polynomial growth theorem, based on work of Hrushovski and Breuillard--Green--Tao.
  A particular focus is on qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces. Our strongest results are obtained for approximate groups which admit a geometric qiqac on a proper geodesic hyperbolic space. For such "hyperbolic approximate groups" we establish a number of fundamental properties in analogy with the case of hyperbolic groups. For example, we show that their asymptotic dimension is one larger than the topological dimension of their Gromov boundary and that - under some mild assumption of being "non-elementary" - they have exponential growth and act minimally on their Gromov boundary. We also study convex cocompact qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces. Using the theory of Morse boundaries, we extend some of our results concerning qiqacs on hyperbolic spaces to qiqacs on proper geodesic metric spaces with non-trivial Morse boundary.</description>

      <title>Doubly Sequenceable Groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.14334v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a sequence ${\bf g}: g_0,\ldots, g_{m}$, in a finite group $G$ with $g_0=1_G$, let ${\bf \bar g}: \bar g_0,\ldots, \bar g_{m}$, be the sequence defined by $\bar g_0=1_G$ and $\bar g_i=g_{i-1}^{-1}g_i$ for $1\leq i \leq m$. We say that $G$ is doubly sequenceable if there exists a sequence ${\bf g}$ in $G$ such that every element of $G$ appears exactly twice in each of ${\bf g}$ and ${\bf \bar g}$. If a group $G$ is abelian, odd, sequenceable, R-sequenceable, or terraceable, then $G$ is doubly sequenceable. In this paper, we show that if $N$ is an odd or sequenceable group and $H$ is an abelian group, then $N \times H$ is doubly sequenceable.</description>

      <title>The Gruenberg-Kegel graph of finite solvable rational groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12883v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite group $G$ is said to be rational if every character of $G$ is rational-valued. The Gruenberg-Kegel graph of a finite group $G$ is the undirected graph whose vertices are the primes dividing the order of $G$ and the edges join different primes $p$ and $q$ whenever $G$ contains an element of order $pq$. In this paper, we complete the classification of the Gruenberg-Kegel graphs of finite solvable rational groups initiated in \cite{BKMdR}.</description>

      <title>Stability of Homomorphisms, Coverings and Cocycles I: Equivalence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by recent developments in group stability, high dimensional expansion, local testability of error correcting codes and topological property testing. In Part I, we formulate and motivate three stability problems: 1. Homomorphism stability: Are almost homomorphisms close to homomorphisms? 2. Covering stability: Are almost coverings of a cell complex close to genuine coverings of it? 3. Cocycle stability: Are 1-cochains whose coboundary is small close to 1-cocycles? We then prove that these three problems are equivalent.</description>

      <title>Stability of Homomorphisms, Coverings and Cocycles II: Examples, Applications and Open problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coboundary expansion (with $\mathbb{F}_2$ coefficients), and variations on it, have been the focus of intensive research in the last two decades. It was used to study random complexes, property testing, and above all Gromov's topological overlapping property.
  In part I of this paper, we extended the notion of coboundary expansion (and its variations) to cochains with permutation coefficients, equipped with the normalized Hamming distance. We showed that this gives a unified language for studying covering stability of complexes, as well as stability of group homomorphisms -- a topic that drew a lot of attention in recent years.
  In this part, we extend the theory to the permutation coefficients setting. This gives some new results, even for $\mathbb{F}_2$ coefficients, opens several new directions of research, and suggests a pattern to proving the existence of non-sofic groups.
  Along the way, we solve the dimension $2$ case of a problem of Gromov, exhibiting a family of bounded degree coboundary expanders with $\mathbb{F}_2$ coefficients.</description>

      <title>Small values and forbidden values for the Fourier antidiagonal constant of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, let ${\rm AD}(G)$ denote the Fourier norm of the antidiagonal in $G\times G$. It was shown recently by the author (IMRN, 2023) that ${\rm AD}(G)$ coincides with the amenability constant of the Fourier algebra of $G$, and is equal to the normalized sum of the cubes of character degrees of $G$. Motivated by a gap result for amenability constants due to Johnson (JLMS, 1994), we determine exactly which numbers in the interval $[1,2]$ arise as values of ${\rm AD}(G)$.
  As a by-product, we show that the set of values of ${\rm AD}(G)$ does not contain all its limit points. Some other calculations or bounds for ${\rm AD}(G)$ are given for familiar classes of finite groups. We also indicate a connection between ${\rm AD}(G)$ and the commuting probability of $G$, and use this to show that every finite group $G$ satisfying ${\rm AD}(G)&lt; \frac{61}{15}$ must be solvable; here the value $\frac{61}{15}$ is best possible.</description>

      <title>Sarnak's conjecture in quantum computing, cyclotomic unitary group coranks, and Shimura curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.02137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sarnak's conjecture in quantum computing concerns when the groups $\operatorname{PU}_2$ and $\operatorname{PSU}_2$ over cyclotomic rings $\mathbb{Z}[\zeta_n, 1/2]$ with $\zeta_n=e^{2\pi i/n}$, $4|n$, are generated by the Clifford-cyclotomic gate set. We previously settled this using Euler-Poincar\'{e} characteristics. A generalization of Sarnak's conjecture is to ask when these groups are generated by torsion elements. An obstruction to this is provided by the corank: a group $G$ has $\operatorname{corank} G &gt;0$ only if $G$ is not generated by torsion elements. In this paper we study the corank of these cyclotomic unitary groups in the families $n=2^s$ and $n=3\cdot 2^s$, $n\geq 8$, by letting them act on Bruhat-Tits trees. The quotients by this action are finite graphs whose first Betti number is the corank of the group. Our main result is that for $n=2^s$ and $n=3\cdot 2^s$ the corank groups doubly exponentially in $s$ as $s\rightarrow \infty$; it is $0$ precisely when $n=8,12, 16,24$ and indeed the cyclotomic unitary groups are generated by torsion elements (in fact by the Clifford-cyclotomic gates) for these $n$. We give explicit lower bounds for the corank in two different ways. The first is to bound the isotropy subgroups in the action on the tree by explicit cyclotomy. The second is to relate our graphs to Shimura curves over $F_n=\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_n)^+$ via interchanging local invariants and applying a result of Selberg and Zograf. We show that the cyclotomy arguments give the stronger bounds. In a final section we execute a program of Sarnak to show that our results for the $n=2^s$ and $n=3\cdot 2^s$ families are sufficient to give a second proof of Sarnak's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we provide a criterion for determining whether multiple shells support a $t$-design. We construct as a corollary an infinite series of $2$-designs using power residue codes.</description>

      <title>On possible symmetry groups of 27-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane</title>

Abstract: In 1987 Brehm and K\"uhnel showed that any triangulation of a $d$-manifold (without boundary) that is not homeomorphic to the sphere has at least $3d/2+3$ vertices. Moreover, triangulations with exactly $3d/2+3$ vertices may exist only for `manifolds like projective planes', which can have dimensions $2$, $4$, $8$, and $16$ only. There is a $6$-vertex triangulation of the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, a $9$-vertex triangulation of the complex projective plane $\mathbb{CP}^2$, and $15$-vertex triangulations of the quaternionic projective plane $\mathbb{HP}^2$. Recently, the author has constructed first examples of $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$. The four most symmetrical have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ of order $351$. These triangulations were constructed using a computer program after the symmetry group was guessed. However, it remained unclear why exactly this group is realized as the symmetry group and whether $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like $\mathbb{OP}^2$ exist with other (possibly larger) symmetry groups. In this paper we find strong restrictions on symmetry groups of such $27$-vertex triangulations. Namely, we present a list of $26$ subgroups of $\mathrm{S}_{27}$ containing all possible symmetry groups of $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. (We do not know whether all these subgroups can be realized as symmetry groups.) The group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ is the largest group in this list, and the orders of all other groups do not exceed $52$. A key role in our approach is played by the use of Smith and Bredon's results on the topology of fixed point sets of finite transformation groups.</description>

      <title>Variation of the Hausdorff dimension and degenerations of Schottky groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of a Schottky group varies continuously over the moduli space of Schottky groups defined over any complete valued field constructed by Poineau and Turchetti. To obtain this result, we first study the non-Archimedean case in a setting of Berkovich analytic spaces, where we make use of Poincar\'e series. We show that the latter can be extended meromorphically over the complex plane and admit a special value at zero which is a purely topological invariant.
  As an application, we prove results on the asymptotic behavior of the Hausdorff dimension of degenerating families of complex Schottky groups. For certain families, including Schottky reflection groups, we obtain an exact formula for the asymptotic logarithmic decay rate of the Hausdorff dimension. This generalizes a theorem of McMullen.</description>
