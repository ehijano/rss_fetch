      <title>Sparse Axonal and Dendritic Delays Enable Competitive SNNs for Keyword Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training transmission delays in spiking neural networks (SNNs) has been shown to substantially improve their performance on complex temporal tasks. In this work, we show that learning either axonal or dendritic delays enables deep feedforward SNNs composed of leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons to reach accuracy comparable to existing synaptic delay learning approaches, while significantly reducing memory and computational overhead. SNN models with either axonal or dendritic delays achieve up to $95.58\%$ on the Google Speech Command (GSC) and $80.97\%$ on the Spiking Speech Command (SSC) datasets, matching or exceeding prior methods based on synaptic delays or more complex neuron models. By adjusting the delay parameters, we obtain improved performance for synaptic delay learning baselines, strengthening the comparison. We find that axonal delays offer the most favorable trade-off, combining lower buffering requirements with slightly higher accuracy than dendritic delays. We further show that the performance of axonal and dendritic delay models is largely preserved under strong delay sparsity, with as few as $20\%$ of delays remaining active, further reducing buffering requirements. Overall, our results indicate that learnable axonal and dendritic delays provide a resource-efficient and effective mechanism for temporal representation in SNNs.

      <title>From Lightweight CNNs to SpikeNets: Benchmarking Accuracy-Energy Tradeoffs with Pruned Spiking SqueezeNet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are increasingly studied as energy-efficient alternatives to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), particularly for edge intelligence. However, prior work has largely emphasized large-scale models, leaving the design and evaluation of lightweight CNN-to-SNN pipelines underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic benchmark of lightweight SNNs obtained by converting compact CNN architectures into spiking networks, where activations are modeled with Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons and trained using surrogate gradient descent under a unified setup. We construct spiking variants of ShuffleNet, SqueezeNet, MnasNet, and MixNet, and evaluate them on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, measuring accuracy, F1-score, parameter count, computational complexity, and energy consumption. Our results show that SNNs can achieve up to 15.7x higher energy efficiency than their CNN counterparts while retaining competitive accuracy. Among these, the SNN variant of SqueezeNet consistently outperforms other lightweight SNNs. To further optimize this model, we apply a structured pruning strategy that removes entire redundant modules, yielding a pruned architecture, SNN-SqueezeNet-P. This pruned model improves CIFAR-10 accuracy by 6% and reduces parameters by 19% compared to the original SNN-SqueezeNet. Crucially, it narrows the gap with CNN-SqueezeNet, achieving nearly the same accuracy (only 1% lower) but with an 88.1% reduction in energy consumption due to sparse spike-driven computations. Together, these findings establish lightweight SNNs as practical, low-power alternatives for edge deployment, highlighting a viable path toward deploying high-performance, low-power intelligence on the edge.</description>

      <title>Structural Plasticity as Active Inference: A Biologically-Inspired Architecture for Homeostatic Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02241v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional neural networks, while powerful, rely on biologically implausible learning mechanisms such as global backpropagation. This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.</description>

      <title>SpikySpace: A Spiking State Space Model for Energy-Efficient Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02411v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series forecasting in domains like traffic management and industrial monitoring often requires real-time, energy-efficient processing on edge devices with limited resources. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer event-driven computation and ultra-low power and have been proposed for use in this space. Unfortunately, existing SNN-based time-series forecasters often use complex transformer blocks. To address this issue, we propose SpikySpace, a spiking state-space model (SSM) that reduces the quadratic cost in the attention block to linear time via spiking selective scanning. Further, we introduce PTsoftplus and PTSiLU, two efficient approximations of SiLU and Softplus that replace costly exponential and division operations with simple bit-shifts. Evaluated on four multivariate time-series benchmarks, SpikySpace outperforms the leading SNN in terms of accuracy by up to 3.0% while reducing energy consumption by over 96.1%. As the first fully spiking state-space model, SpikySpace bridges neuromorphic efficiency with modern sequence modeling, opening a practical path toward efficient time series forecasting systems. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpikySpace.</description>

      <title>Spark: Modular Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, neural networks act as a synonym for artificial intelligence. Present neural network models, although remarkably powerful, are inefficient both in terms of data and energy. Several alternative forms of neural networks have been proposed to address some of these problems. Specifically, spiking neural networks are suitable for efficient hardware implementations. However, effective learning algorithms for spiking networks remain elusive, although it is suspected that effective plasticity mechanisms could alleviate the problem of data efficiency. Here, we present a new framework for spiking neural networks - Spark - built upon the idea of modular design, from simple components to entire models. The aim of this framework is to provide an efficient and streamlined pipeline for spiking neural networks. We showcase this framework by solving the sparse-reward cartpole problem with simple plasticity mechanisms. We hope that a framework compatible with traditional ML pipelines may accelerate research in the area, specifically for continuous and unbatched learning, akin to the one animals exhibit.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence Software Structured to Simulate Human Working Memory, Mental Imagery, and Mental Continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents an artificial intelligence (AI) architecture intended to simulate the iterative updating of the human working memory system. It features several interconnected neural networks designed to emulate the specialized modules of the cerebral cortex. These are structured hierarchically and integrated into a global workspace. They are capable of temporarily maintaining high-level representational patterns akin to the psychological items maintained in working memory. This maintenance is made possible by persistent neural activity in the form of two modalities: sustained neural firing (resulting in a focus of attention) and synaptic potentiation (resulting in a short-term store). Representations held in persistent activity are recursively replaced resulting in incremental changes to the content of the working memory system. As this content gradually evolves, successive processing states overlap and are continuous with one another. The present article will explore how this architecture can lead to iterative shift in the distribution of coactive representations, ultimately leading to mental continuity between processing states, and thus to human-like thought and cognition. Taken together, these components outline a biologically motivated route toward synthetic consciousness or artificial sentience and subjectivity.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Geometric Structure of Neural Networks and Neural ODEs via Morse Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09351v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Besides classical feed-forward neural networks such as multilayer perceptrons, also neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) have gained particular interest in recent years. Neural ODEs can be interpreted as an infinite depth limit of feed-forward or residual neural networks. We study the input-output dynamics of finite and infinite depth neural networks with scalar output. In the finite depth case, the input is a state associated with a finite number of nodes, which maps under multiple non-linear transformations to the state of one output node. In analogy, a neural ODE maps an affine linear transformation of the input to an affine linear transformation of its time-$T$ map. We show that, depending on the specific structure of the network, the input-output map has different properties regarding the existence and regularity of critical points. These properties can be characterized via Morse functions, which are scalar functions where every critical point is non-degenerate. We prove that critical points cannot exist if the dimension of the hidden layer is monotonically decreasing or the dimension of the phase space is smaller than or equal to the input dimension. In the case that critical points exist, we classify their regularity depending on the specific architecture of the network. We show that except for a Lebesgue measure zero set in the weight space, each critical point is non-degenerate if for finite depth neural networks the underlying graph has no bottleneck, and if for neural ODEs, the affine linear transformations used have full rank. For each type of architecture, the proven properties are comparable in the finite and infinite depth cases. The established theorems allow us to formulate results on universal embedding and universal approximation, i.e., on the exact and approximate representation of maps by neural networks and neural ODEs.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>

      <title>MEGConformer: Conformer-Based MEG Decoder for Robust Speech and Phoneme Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Decoding speech-related information from non-invasive MEG is a key step toward scalable brain-computer interfaces. We present compact Conformer-based decoders on the LibriBrain 2025 PNPL benchmark for two core tasks: Speech Detection and Phoneme Classification. Our approach adapts a compact Conformer to raw 306-channel MEG signals, with a lightweight convolutional projection layer and task-specific heads. For Speech Detection, a MEG-oriented SpecAugment provided a first exploration of MEG-specific augmentation. For Phoneme Classification, we used inverse-square-root class weighting and a dynamic grouping loader to handle 100-sample averaged examples. In addition, a simple instance-level normalization proved critical to mitigate distribution shifts on the holdout split. Using the official Standard track splits and F1-macro for model selection, our best systems achieved 88.9% (Speech) and 65.8% (Phoneme) on the leaderboard, winning the Phoneme Classification Standard track. For further implementation details, the technical documentation, source code, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/neural2speech/libribrain-experiments.</description>

      <title>Discount Model Search for Quality Diversity Optimization in High-Dimensional Measure Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01082v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quality diversity (QD) optimization searches for a collection of solutions that optimize an objective while attaining diverse outputs of a user-specified, vector-valued measure function. Contemporary QD algorithms are typically limited to low-dimensional measures because high-dimensional measures are prone to distortion, where many solutions found by the QD algorithm map to similar measures. For example, the state-of-the-art CMA-MAE algorithm guides measure space exploration with a histogram in measure space that records so-called discount values. However, CMA-MAE stagnates in domains with high-dimensional measure spaces because solutions with similar measures fall into the same histogram cell and hence receive the same discount value. To address these limitations, we propose Discount Model Search (DMS), which guides exploration with a model that provides a smooth, continuous representation of discount values. In high-dimensional measure spaces, this model enables DMS to distinguish between solutions with similar measures and thus continue exploration. We show that DMS facilitates new capabilities for QD algorithms by introducing two new domains where the measure space is the high-dimensional space of images, which enables users to specify their desired measures by providing a dataset of images rather than hand-designing the measure function. Results in these domains and on high-dimensional benchmarks show that DMS outperforms CMA-MAE and other existing black-box QD algorithms.</description>

      <title>Statistical Guarantees for Reasoning Probes on Looped Boolean Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistical behaviour of reasoning probes in a stylized model of looped reasoning, given by Boolean circuits whose computational graph is a perfect $\nu$-ary tree ($\nu\ge 2$) and whose output is appended to the input and fed back iteratively for subsequent computation rounds. A reasoning probe has access to a sampled subset of internal computation nodes, possibly without covering the entire graph, and seeks to infer which $\nu$-ary Boolean gate is executed at each queried node, representing uncertainty via a probability distribution over a fixed collection of $\mathtt{m}$ admissible $\nu$-ary gates. This partial observability induces a generalization problem, which we analyze in a realizable, transductive setting.
  We show that, when the reasoning probe is parameterized by a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based hypothesis class and queries $N$ nodes, the worst-case generalization error attains the optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\log(2/\delta)}/\sqrt{N})$ with probability at least $1-\delta$, for $\delta\in (0,1)$. Our analysis combines snowflake metric embedding techniques with tools from statistical optimal transport. A key insight is that this optimal rate is achievable independently of graph size, owing to the existence of a low-distortion one-dimensional snowflake embedding of the induced graph metric. As a consequence, our results provide a sharp characterization of how structural properties of the computational graph govern the statistical efficiency of reasoning under partial access.</description>
