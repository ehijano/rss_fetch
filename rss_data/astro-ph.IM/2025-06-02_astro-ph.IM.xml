      <title>Photometric redshift estimation for emission line galaxies of DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys by CNN-MLP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission Line Galaxies (ELGs) are crucial for cosmological studies, particularly in understanding the large-scale structure of the Universe and the role of dark energy. ELGs form an essential component of the target catalogue for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), a major astronomical survey. However, the accurate selection of ELGs for such surveys is challenging due to the inherent uncertainties in determining their redshifts with photometric data. In order to improve the accuracy of photometric redshift estimation for ELGs, we propose a novel approach CNN-MLP that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs). This approach integrates both images and photometric data derived from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10. By leveraging the complementary strengths of CNNs (for image data processing) and MLPs (for photometric feature integration), the CNN-MLP model achieves a $\sigma_{\mathrm{NMAD}}$ (normalised median absolute deviation) of 0.0140 and an outlier fraction of 2.57%. Compared to other models, CNN-MLP demonstrates a significant improvement in the accuracy of ELG photometric redshift estimation, which directly benefits the target selection process for DESI. In addition, we explore the photometric redshifts of different galaxy types (Starforming, Starburst, AGN, Broadline). Furthermore, this approach will contribute to more reliable photometric redshift estimation in ongoing and future large-scale sky surveys (e.g. LSST, CSST, Euclid), enhancing the overall efficiency of cosmological research and galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Quantum Search for Gravitational Wave of Massive Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matched filtering is a common method for detecting gravitational waves. However, the computational costs of searching large template banks limit the efficiency of classical algorithms when searching for massive black hole binary (MBHB) systems. In this work, a quantum matched filtering algorithm based on Grover's algorithm is applied to the MBHB signals. It is demonstrated that the quantum approach can reduce the computational complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(\sqrt{N})$ theoretically, where $N$ is the size of the template bank. Simulated results indicate that the quantum-enhanced approach significantly reduces computational costs. However, it is also found that the performance can degrade in some cases due to instability of the algorithm. This highlights the need for more robust and stable quantum search strategies.</description>

      <title>Automatic detection and characterization of random telegraph noise in sCMOS sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific CMOS (sCMOS) image sensors are a modern alternative to typical CCD detectors and are rapidly gaining popularity in observational astronomy due to their large sizes, low read-out noise, high frame rates, and cheap manufacturing. However, numerous challenges remain in using them due to fundamental differences between CCD and CMOS architectures, especially concerning the pixel-dependent and non-Gaussian nature of their read-out noise. One of the main components of the latter is the random telegraph noise (RTN) caused by the charge traps introduced by the defects close to the oxide-silicon interface in sCMOS image sensors, which manifests itself as discrete jumps in a pixel's output signal, degrading the overall image fidelity. In this work, we present a statistical method to detect and characterize RTN-affected pixels using a series of dark frames. Identifying RTN contaminated pixels enables post-processing strategies that mitigate their impact and the development of manufacturing quality metrics.</description>

      <title>The SPHEREx Sky Simulator: Science Data Modeling for the First All-Sky Near-Infrared Spectral Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the SPHEREx Sky Simulator, a software tool designed to model science data for NASA's SPHEREx mission that will carry out a series of all-sky spectrophotometric surveys at $\sim$6'' spatial resolution in 102 spectral channels spanning 0.75 to 5 $\mu$m. The Simulator software implements models for astrophysical emission, instrument characteristics, and survey strategy to generate realistic infrared sky scenes as they will be observed by SPHEREx. The simulated data includes a variety of realistic noise and systematic effects that are estimated using up-to-date astrophysical measurements and information from pre-launch instrument characterization campaigns. Through the pre-flight mission phases the Simulator has been critical in predicting the impact of various effects on SPHEREx science performance, and has played an important role guiding the development of the SPHEREx data analysis pipeline. In this paper, we describe the \skysim\ architecture, pre-flight instrument and sky models, and summarize high-level predictions from the Simulator, including a pre-launch prediction for the 5$\sigma$ point source sensitivity of SPHEREx, which we estimate to be $m_{\rm AB}$ 18.5--19 from 0.75 to 3.8~$\mu$m and $m_{\rm AB}$ 16.6--18 from 3.8 to 5 $\mu$m, with the sensitivity limited by the zodiacal light background at all wavelengths. In the future, on-orbit data will be used to improve the Simulator, which will form the basis of a variety of forward-modeling tools that will be used to model myriad instrumental and astrophysical processes to characterize their systematic effects on our final data products and analyses.</description>

      <title>How Many Times Should We Matched Filter Gravitational Wave Data? A Comparison of GstLAL's Online and Offline Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences employ a process called matched filtering, in which gravitational wave strain data is cross-correlated against a bank of waveform templates. Data from every observing run of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration is typically analyzed in this way twice, first in a low-latency mode in which gravitational wave candidates are identified in near-real time, and later in a high-latency mode. Such high-latency analyses have traditionally been considered more sensitive, since background data from the full observing run is available for assigning significance to all candidates, as well as more robust, since they do not need to worry about keeping up with live data. In this work, we present a novel technique to use the matched filtering data products from a low-latency analysis and re-process them by assigning significances in a high-latency way, effectively removing the need to perform matched filtering a second time. To demonstrate the efficacy of our method, we analyze 38 days of LIGO and Virgo data from the third observing run (O3) using the GstLAL pipeline, and show that our method is as sensitive and reliable as a traditional high-latency analysis. Since matched filtering represents the vast majority of computing time for a traditional analysis, our method greatly reduces the time and computational burden required to produce the same results as a traditional high-latency analysis. Consequently, it has already been adopted by GstLAL for the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA collaboration.</description>

      <title>Minimising the numerical viscosity in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique typically include numerical viscosity to model shocks and maintain particle order on the kernel scale. This numerical viscosity is composed of linear and quadratic terms, with coefficients $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ respectively. Setting these coefficients too high results in excessive numerical dissipation, whereas setting them too low may lead to unwanted effects such as particle penetration, which also leads to excess dissipation. In this study, we simulate accretion discs using the SPH code {\sc phantom} to investigate the effective disc viscosity arising from numerical viscosity. We model steady-state coplanar and circular discs with different values of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$, from which we determine the coefficients that lead to minimum levels of numerical viscosity by maximising the steady-state disc surface density for the same mass input rate. We find that, for planar and circular discs, the default values of the numerical viscosity parameters in the {\sc phantom} code can be too high particularly for the quadratic term. As higher values of the coefficients are required to adequately capture strong shocks in the flow, we suggest that the coefficient of the quadratic term should be time-dependent in a similar manner to the presently used ``switches'' on the linear term. This can be simply achieved by setting $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ to be a constant multiple of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ with $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ determined by an appropriate switch, as previously advocated in the literature.</description>

      <title>Electroluminescence and charge multiplication in liquid xenon with a VCC-like Microstrip Plate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the first observation of electroluminescence and charge amplification with a Virtual Cathode Chamber (VCC) microstrips plate immersed in liquid xenon. Both were observed in an intense non-uniform electric field in the vicinity of 2-$\mu$m narrow anode strips deposited, with a 2~mm pitch, on a semiconductive glass substrate (S8900), with a cathode film on its backside. An initial light yield of $\sim$460 VUV photons per drifting electron was measured, which degraded within tens of minutes stabilizing at (27.0~$\pm$~3.1)~photons per electron. The electroluminescence was accompanied by electron multiplication with an estimated charge gain $&lt;$10. Further investigations are necessary to understand and mitigate the light yield degradation phenomenon. We expect other substrate materials, including VUV-transparent ones, to provide large stable photon yields, compatible with our model predictions. The VCC configuration has demonstrated great potential in single-phase noble-liquid detectors, particularly for dark-matter searches, neutrino physics and other fields.</description>

      <title>Modeling Polarized Radio Sounding Observations of a Coronal Mass Ejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) evolve significantly as they propagate from the Sun to the Earth, so remote observations of their changes in speed, strength of the magnetic field, density, and overall structure are critical for predicting their arrival time and geoeffectiveness. Radio line-of-sight observations of Faraday rotation and Total Electron Content combined with white-light observations enables the measurement of these properties with careful analyses. This paper describes the analysis techniques and evaluates their accuracy with regard to measuring a CME's complex evolving structure and speed. The approach utilizes the layout of the Faraday effect tracker of coronal and heliospheric structures (FETCH), a purely space-based instrument concept, with Alfven Wave Solar atmosphere Model (AWSoM) simulations as input for evaluating these radio-based measures. Focusing on density and velocity/speed, we find that in-situ measurements of CME properties observe similar but different aspects of the distinct CME structure. The AWSoM model suggests that Faraday rotation may be a more sensitive measure of structure than Total Electron Content (TEC). Finally, we discuss the difficulty the simulation reveals in determining the trailing edge location of a magnetic flux rope.</description>

      <title>Sunrise III: Overview of Observatory and Instruments</title>

Abstract: In July 2024, Sunrise completed its third successful science flight. The Sunrise III observatory had been upgraded significantly after the two previous successful flights in 2009 and 2013. Three completely new instruments focus on the small-scale physical processes and their complex interaction from the deepest observable layers in the photosphere up to chromospheric heights. Previously poorly explored spectral regions and lines are exploited to paint a three-dimensional picture of the solar atmosphere with unprecedented completeness and level of detail. The full polarimetric information is captured by all three instruments to reveal the interaction between the magnetic fields and the hydrodynamic processes. Two slit-based spectropolarimeters, the Sunrise UV Spectropolarimeter and Imager (SUSI) and the Sunrise Chromospheric Infrared spectro-Polarimeter (SCIP), focus on the near-ultraviolet and the near-infrared regions respectively, and the imaging spectropolarimeter Tunable Magnetograph (TuMag) simultaneously obtains maps of the full field-of-view of $46 \times 46$ Mm$^2$ in the photosphere and the chromosphere in the visible. The instruments are operated in an orchestrated mode, benefiting from a new Image Stabilization and Light Distribution unit (ISLiD), with the Correlating Wavefront Sensor (CWS) providing the autofocus control and an image stability with a root-mean-square value smaller than 0.005''. A new gondola was constructed to significantly improve the telescope pointing stability, required to achieve uninterrupted observations over many hours. Sunrise III was launched successfully on July 10, 2024, from the Esrange Space Center near Kiruna (Sweden). It reached the landing site between the Mackenzie River and the Great Bear Lake in Canada after a flight duration of 6.5 days. In this paper, we give an overview of the Sunrise III observatory and its instruments.</description>

      <title>PROTOCALC, A W-band polarized calibrator for CMB Telescopes: application to Simons Observatory and CLASS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments will measure polarization anisotropies with unprecedented sensitivities. The need for high precision in these measurements underscores the importance of gaining a comprehensive understanding of instrument properties, with a particular emphasis on the study of the beam properties and, in particular, their polarization characteristics, and the measurement of the polarization angle. In this context, a major challenge lies in the scarcity of millimeter polarized astrophysical sources with sufficient brightness and calibration knowledge to meet the stringent accuracy requirements of future CMB missions. This led to the development of a drone-borne calibration source designed for frequency band centered on approximately 90 GHz band, matching a commonly used channel in ground based CMB measurements. The PROTOtype CALibrator for Cosmology, PROTOCALC, has undergone thorough in-lab testing, and its properties have been subsequently modeled through simulation software integrated into the standard Simons Observatory (SO) analysis pipeline. Moreover, the PROTOCALC system has been tested in the field, having been deployed twice on calibration campaigns with CMB telescopes in the Atacama desert. The data collected constrain the roll angle of the source with a statistical accuracy of $0.045^\circ$.</description>

Raw data for the Keck/LRIS spectrograph does not include information about the sky positions of the slitmask targets, making it difficult to use beyond the scope of the original programs. tilsotua translates slit coordinates from the mask design files in the mask milling machine frame to sky coordinates. tilsotua also shifts the original input astrometry to modern frames using the objects targeted by mask alignment boxes. This can be applied to the archived mask design files at the Lick Observatory Archive. We demonstrate that the final reconstructed slit positions are accurate to 0."14 (RMS) across the set of archived masks based on a comparison of our calculated mask alignment box coordinates with Gaia astrometric positions of the likely alignment objects. We make available the tilsotua code, archived mask files, and slit positions of the historical masks for the community to maximize the science from Keck/LRIS data in the Keck Observatory Archive.</description>

      <title>Deep learning to improve the discovery of near-Earth asteroids in the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>

Abstract: We present a novel pipeline that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to improve the detection capability of near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) in the context of planetary defense. Our work aims to minimize the dependency on human intervention of the current approach adopted by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF). The target NEAs have a high proper motion of up to tens of degrees per day and thus appear as streaks of light in the images. We trained our CNNs to detect these streaks using three datasets: a set with real asteroid streaks, a set with synthetic (i.e., simulated) streaks and a mixed set, and tested the resultant models on real survey images. The results achieved were almost identical across the three models: $0.843\pm0.005$ in completeness and $0.820\pm0.025$ in precision. The bias on streak measurements reported by the CNNs was $1.84\pm0.03$ pixels in streak position, $0.817\pm0.026$ degrees in streak angle and $-0.048\pm0.003$ in fractional bias in streak length (computed as the absolute length bias over the streak length, with the negative sign indicating an underestimation). We compared the performance of our CNN trained with a mix of synthetic and real streaks to that of the ZTF human scanners by analyzing a set of 317 streaks flagged as valid by the scanners. Our pipeline detected $80~\%$ of the streaks found by the scanners and 697 additional streaks that were subsequently verified by the scanners to be valid streaks. These results suggest that our automated pipeline can complement the work of the human scanners at no cost for the precision and find more objects than the current approach. They also prove that the synthetic streaks were realistic enough to be used for augmenting training sets when insufficient real streaks are available or exploring the simulation of streaks with unusual characteristics that have not yet been detected.</description>

      <title>PyTICS: An Iterative Method for Photometric Lightcurve Intercalibration using Comparison Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensive reverberation mapping monitoring programs combine ground-based photometric observations from different telescopes, requiring intercalibration of lightcurves to reduce systematic instrumental differences. We present a new iterative algorithm to calibrate photometric time-series data of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using 100s of comparison stars on the same images, building upon the established method of ensemble photometry. The algorithm determines telescope-specific and epoch-specific correction parameters, and simultaneously computes a multi-component noise model to account for underestimated uncertainties based on the scatter in the comparison star data, effectively identifying problematic epochs, telescopes, and stars. No assumptions need to be made about the AGN variability shape, and the algorithm can in principle be applied to any astronomical object. We demonstrate our method on lightcurves taken with ten 1-m telescopes from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) robotic telescope network. Comparing our results to other intercalibration tools, we find that the algorithm can more accurately quantify the uncertainties in the data. We describe additional corrections that can be made for particularly bluer AGNs like Fairall 9, arising due to systematic effects dependent on star colour.</description>

      <title>Cyclostationary signals in LISA: a practical application to Milky Way satellites</title>

Abstract: One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.</description>

      <title>Test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity: extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to the formation of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables.Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.</description>

      <title>The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator for the 21-cm power spectrum from MWA drift scan observations II: The Missing Frequency Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Missing frequency channels pose a problem for estimating $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum (PS) from radio-interferometric visibility data. This is particularly severe for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), which has a periodic pattern of missing channels that introduce spikes along $k_\parallel$. The Tracking Tapered Gridded Estimator (TTGE) overcomes this by first correlating the visibilities in the frequency domain to estimate the multi-frequency angular power spectrum (MAPS) $C_\ell(\Delta\nu)$ that has no missing frequency separation $\Delta\nu$. We perform a Fourier transform along $\Delta\nu$ to estimate $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$. Considering our earlier work, simulations demonstrate that the TTGE can estimate $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ without any artifacts due to the missing channels. However, the spikes were still found to persist for the actual data, which is foreground-dominated. The current work presents a detailed investigation considering both simulations and actual data. We find that the spikes arise due to a combination of the missing channels and the strong spectral dependence of the foregrounds. Based on this, we propose and demonstrate a technique to mitigate the spikes. Applying this, we find the values of $P(k_\perp,k_\parallel)$ in the region $0.004 \leq k_\perp \leq 0.048\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ and $k_\parallel &gt; 0.35 \,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ to be consistent with zero within the expected statistical fluctuations. We obtain the $2\sigma$ upper limit of $\Delta_{\rm UL}^2(k)=(918.17)^2\,{\rm mK^2}$ at $k=0.404\,{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$ for the mean squared brightness temperature fluctuations of the $z=8.2$ epoch of reionization (EoR) 21-cm signal. This upper limit is from just $\sim 17$ minutes of observation for a single pointing direction. We expect tighter constraints when we combine all $162$ different pointing directions of the drift scan observation.</description>

      <title>Astrometry-Only Detection of Microlensing Events with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrometric microlensing events occur when a massive object passes between a distant source and the observer, causing a shift of the light centroid. The precise astrometric measurements of the Gaia mission provide an unprecedented opportunity to detect and analyze these events, revealing properties of lensing objects such as their mass and distance. We develop and test the Gaia Astrometric Microlensing Events (GAME) Filter, a software tool to identify astrometric microlensing events and derive lensing object properties. We generated mock Gaia observations for different magnitudes, number of Gaia visits, and events extending beyond Gaia's observational run. We applied GAME Filter to these datasets and validated its performance. We also assessed the rate of false positives where binary astrometric systems are misidentified as microlensing events. GAME Filter successfully recovers microlensing parameters for strong events. Parameters are more difficult to recover for short events and those extending beyond Gaia's run, where only a fraction of the events is observed. The astrometric effect breaks the degeneracy in the microlensing parallax present in photometric microlensing. For fainter sources, the observed signal weakens, reducing recovered events and increasing parameter errors. However, even for Gaia G-band magnitude 19, parameters can be recovered for Einstein radii above two mas. Observing regions with varying numbers of Gaia visits has minimal impact on filter accuracy when the number of visits exceeds 90. Additionally, even if the peak of a microlensing event lies outside Gaia's run, microlensing parameters can still be recovered. GAME Filter characterizes lenses with astrometry-only data for lens masses from approximately 1 to 20 solar masses and distances up to 6 kpc.</description>
