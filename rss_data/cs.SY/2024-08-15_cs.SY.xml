      <title>Local Cold Load Pick-up Estimation Using Customer Energy Consumption Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermostatically-controlled loads have a significant impact on electricity demand after service is restored following an outage, a phenomenon known as cold load pick-up (CLPU). Active management of CLPU is becoming an essential tool for distribution system operators who seek to defer network upgrades and speed up post-outage customer restoration. One key functionality needed for actively managing CLPU is its forecast at various scales. The widespread deployment of smart metering devices is also opening up new opportunities for data-driven load modeling and forecast. In this paper, we propose an approach for customer-side estimation of CLPU using time-stamped local load measurements. The proposed method uses Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) modeling for short-term foregone energy consumption forecast during an outage. Forecasts are made on an hourly basis to estimate the energy to potentially recover after outages lasting up to several hours. Moreover, to account for changing customer behavior and weather, the model order is adjusted dynamically. Simulation results based on actual smart meter measurements are presented for 50 residential customers over the duration of one year. These results are validated using physical modeling of residential loads and are shown to match well the ARIMA-based forecasts. Additionally, accuracy and execution speed has been compared with other state-of-the-art approaches for time-series forecasting including Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM) and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing (HWES). ARIMA-based forecast is found to offer superior performance both in terms of accuracy and computation speed.</description>

      <title>Certifiable Deep Learning for Reachability Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite any disturbance within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reach-avoid value function and post-learning certification. Compared to prior works, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway takeover example.</description>

      <title>Stable State Space SubSpace (S$^5$) Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State space subspace algorithms for input-output systems have been widely applied but also have a reasonably well-developedasymptotic theory dealing with consistency. However, guaranteeing the stability of the estimated system matrix is a major issue. Existing stability-guaranteed algorithms are computationally expensive, require several tuning parameters, and scale badly to high state dimensions. Here, we develop a new algorithm that is closed-form and requires no tuning parameters. It is thus computationally cheap and scales easily to high state dimensions. We also prove its consistency under reasonable conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Equivalent Circuit Model for High Current Discharge of Lithium-Ion Batteries with Application to Electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional battery equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have limited capability to predict performance at high discharge rates, where lithium depleted regions may develop and cause a sudden exponential drop in the cell's terminal voltage. Having accurate predictions of performance under such conditions is necessary for electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft applications, where high discharge currents can be required during fault scenarios and the inability to provide these currents can be safety-critical. To address this challenge, we utilize data-driven modeling methods to derive a parsimonious addition to a conventional ECM that can capture the observed rapid voltage drop with only one additional state. We also provide a detailed method for identifying the resulting model parameters, including an extensive characterization data set along with a well-regularized objective function formulation. The model is validated against a novel data set of over 150 flights encompassing a wide array of conditions for an eVTOL aircraft using an application-specific and safety-relevant reserve duration metric for quantifying accuracy. The model is shown to predict the landing hover capability with an error mean and standard deviation of 2.9 and 6.2 seconds, respectively, defining the model's ability to capture the cell voltage behavior under high discharge currents.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal Model Reduction of Linear Quadratic Output Systems in Finite Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear quadratic output systems constitute an important class of dynamical systems with numerous practical applications. When the order of these models is exceptionally high, simulating and analyzing these systems becomes computationally prohibitive. In such instances, model order reduction offers an effective solution by approximating the original high-order system with a reduced-order model while preserving the system's essential characteristics.
  In frequency-limited model order reduction, the objective is to maintain the frequency response of the original system within a specified frequency range in the reduced-order model. In this paper, a mathematical expression for the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm is derived, which quantifies the error within the desired frequency interval. Subsequently, the necessary conditions for a local optimum of the frequency-limited $\mathcal{H}_2$ norm of the error are derived. The inherent difficulty in satisfying these conditions within a Petrov-Galerkin projection framework is also discussed. Based on the optimality conditions and Petrov-Galerkin projection, a stationary point iteration algorithm is proposed that enforces three of the four optimality conditions upon convergence. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the algorithm's effectiveness in accurately approximating the original high-order model within the specified frequency interval.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Real-Time Economic Dispatch for Integrated Electric and Gas Systems Considering Uncertainty Propagation and Pipeline Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gas-fired units (GFUs) with rapid regulation capabilities are considered an effective tool to mitigate fluctuations in the generation of renewable energy sources and have coupled electricity power systems (EPSs) and natural gas systems (NGSs) more tightly. However, this tight coupling leads to uncertainty propagation, a challenge for the real-time dispatch of such integrated electric and gas systems (IEGSs). Moreover, pipeline leakage failures in the NGS may threaten the electricity supply reliability of the EPS through GFUs. To address these problems, this paper first establishes an operational model considering gas pipeline dynamic characteristics under uncertain leakage failures for the NGS and then presents a stochastic IEGS real-time economic dispatch (RTED) model considering both uncertainty propagation and pipeline leakage uncertainty. To quickly solve this complicated large-scale stochastic optimization problem, a novel notion of the coupling boundary dynamic adjustment region considering pipeline leakage failure (LCBDAR) is proposed to characterize the dynamic characteristics of the NGS boundary connecting GFUs. Based on the LCBDAR, a noniterative decentralized solution is proposed to decompose the original stochastic RTED model into two subproblems that are solved separately by the EPS and NGS operators, thus preserving their data privacy. In particular, only one-time data interaction from the NGS to the EPS is required. Case studies on several IEGSs at different scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Communication-robust and Privacy-safe Distributed Estimation for Heterogeneous Community-level Behind-the-meter Solar Power Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of behind-the-meter (BTM) solar power generation systems presents challenges for distribution system planning and scheduling due to invisible solar power generation. To address the data leakage problem of centralized machine-learning methods in BTM solar power generation estimation, the federated learning (FL) method has been investigated for its distributed learning capability. However, the conventional FL method has encountered various challenges, including heterogeneity, communication failures, and malicious privacy attacks. To overcome these challenges, this study proposes a communication-robust and privacy-safe distributed estimation method for heterogeneous community-level BTM solar power generation. Specifically, this study adopts multi-task FL as the main structure and learns the common and unique features of all communities. Simultaneously, it embeds an updated parameters estimation method into the multi-task FL, automatically identifies similarities between any two clients, and estimates the updated parameters for unavailable clients to mitigate the negative effects of communication failures. Finally, this study adopts a differential privacy mechanism under the dynamic privacy budget allocation strategy to combat malicious privacy attacks and improve model training efficiency. Case studies show that in the presence of heterogeneity and communication failures, the proposed method exhibits better estimation accuracy and convergence performance as compared with traditional FL and localized learning methods, while providing stronger privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model of Modular Upper Limb Rehabilitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Configurable robots are made up of robotic modules that can be assembled or can configure themselves into multiple robot configurations. In this research plan, a method for upper-body rehabilitation will be discussed in the form of a modular robot with different morphologies. The advantage and superiority of designing an example of a robotic module for upper body rehabilitation is the ability to reset the modular robot system. In this research, a number of modules will be designed and implemented according to the needs of one-hand rehabilitation with different degrees of freedom. The design modules' performance and efficiency will be evaluated by simulating, making samples, and testing them. This article's research includes presenting a modular upper body rehabilitation robot in the wrist, elbow, and shoulder areas, as well as providing a suitable kinematic and dynamic model of the upper body rehabilitation robot to determine human-robot interaction forces and movement. The research also involves analyzing the mathematical model of the upper body rehabilitation robot to identify advanced control strategies that rely on force control and torque control. After reviewing the articles and research of others, we concluded that no one has yet worked on the design of a prototype robotic module for upper body rehabilitation in the specified order. In our pioneering research, we intend to address this important matter.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Highway Ramp Merge Safety and Efficiency via Spatio-Temporal Cooperative Control and Vehicle-Road Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In view of existing automatic driving, it is difficult to accurately and timely obtain the status and driving intention of other vehicles. The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation. Using SUMO and Python co-simulation, mainline traffic volumes of 800 veh*h-1*lane-1</description>

      <title>CatalogBank: A Structured and Interoperable Catalog Dataset with a Semi-Automatic Annotation Tool (DocumentLabeler) for Engineering System Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of document engineering and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the integration of digitally born catalogs into product design processes presents a novel avenue for enhancing information extraction and interoperability. This paper introduces CatalogBank, a dataset developed to bridge the gap between textual descriptions and other data modalities related to engineering design catalogs. We utilized existing information extraction methodologies to extract product information from PDF-based catalogs to use in downstream tasks to generate a baseline metric. Our approach not only supports the potential automation of design workflows but also overcomes the limitations of manual data entry and non-standard metadata structures that have historically impeded the seamless integration of textual and other data modalities. Through the use of DocumentLabeler, an open-source annotation tool adapted for our dataset, we demonstrated the potential of CatalogBank in supporting diverse document-based tasks such as layout analysis and knowledge extraction. Our findings suggest that CatalogBank can contribute to document engineering and NLP by providing a robust dataset for training models capable of understanding and processing complex document formats with relatively less effort using the semi-automated annotation tool DocumentLabeler.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Semantic/Bit Communication Based Networking Problem Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently shown great potential in significant resource savings and efficient information exchanges, thus naturally introducing a novel and practical next-generation cellular network paradigm where two modes of SemCom and conventional bit communication (BitCom) coexist, namely hybrid semantic/bit communication network (HSB-Net). Nevertheless, the pertinent wireless resource management issue becomes rather complicated and challenging, especially considering the unique background knowledge matching and time-consuming semantic coding requirements in SemCom. To this end, this paper jointly investigates user association (UA), mode selection (MS), and bandwidth allocation (BA) problems in the uplink of HSB-Net. Concretely, we first identify a unified performance metric of message throughput for both SemCom and BitCom links. Next, we comprehensively develop a knowledge matching-aware two-stage tandem packet queuing model and theoretically derive the average packet loss ratio and queuing latency. Combined with several practical constraints, we then formulate a joint optimization problem for UA, MS, and BA to maximize the overall message throughput of HSB-Net. Afterward, we propose an optimal resource management strategy by employing a Lagrange primal-dual method and devising a preference list-based heuristic algorithm. Finally, numerical results validate the performance superiority of our proposed strategy compared with different benchmarks.</description>

      <title>SustainDC -- Benchmarking for Sustainable Data Center Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>On Accelerating Large-Scale Robust Portfolio Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving large-scale robust portfolio optimization problems is challenging due to the high computational demands associated with an increasing number of assets, the amount of data considered, and market uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose an extended supporting hyperplane approximation approach for efficiently solving a class of distributionally robust portfolio problems for a general class of additively separable utility functions and polyhedral ambiguity distribution set, applied to a large-scale set of assets. Our technique is validated using a large-scale portfolio of the S&amp;P 500 index constituents, demonstrating robust out-of-sample trading performance. More importantly, our empirical studies show that this approach significantly reduces computational time compared to traditional concave Expected Log-Growth (ELG) optimization, with running times decreasing from several thousand seconds to just a few. This method provides a scalable and practical solution to large-scale robust portfolio optimization, addressing both theoretical and practical challenges.</description>

      <title>The Nah Bandit: Modeling User Non-compliance in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems now pervade the digital world, ranging from advertising to entertainment. However, it remains challenging to implement effective recommendation systems in the physical world, such as in mobility or health. This work focuses on a key challenge: in the physical world, it is often easy for the user to opt out of taking any recommendation if they are not to her liking, and to fall back to her baseline behavior. It is thus crucial in cyber-physical recommendation systems to operate with an interaction model that is aware of such user behavior, lest the user abandon the recommendations altogether. This paper thus introduces the Nah Bandit, a tongue-in-cheek reference to describe a Bandit problem where users can say `nah' to the recommendation and opt for their preferred option instead. As such, this problem lies in between a typical bandit setup and supervised learning. We model the user non-compliance by parameterizing an anchoring effect of recommendations on users. We then propose the Expert with Clustering (EWC) algorithm, a hierarchical approach that incorporates feedback from both recommended and non-recommended options to accelerate user preference learning. In a recommendation scenario with $N$ users, $T$ rounds per user, and $K$ clusters, EWC achieves a regret bound of $O(N\sqrt{T\log K} + NT)$, achieving superior theoretical performance in the short term compared to LinUCB algorithm. Experimental results also highlight that EWC outperforms both supervised learning and traditional contextual bandit approaches. This advancement reveals that effective use of non-compliance feedback can accelerate preference learning and improve recommendation accuracy. This work lays the foundation for future research in Nah Bandit, providing a robust framework for more effective recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Meta SAC-Lag: Towards Deployable Safe Reinforcement Learning via MetaGradient-based Hyperparameter Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) is one of the prevalently studied subcategories of trial-and-error-based methods with the intention to be deployed on real-world systems. In safe RL, the goal is to maximize reward performance while minimizing constraints, often achieved by setting bounds on constraint functions and utilizing the Lagrangian method. However, deploying Lagrangian-based safe RL in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the necessity of threshold fine-tuning, as imprecise adjustments may lead to suboptimal policy convergence. To mitigate this challenge, we propose a unified Lagrangian-based model-free architecture called Meta Soft Actor-Critic Lagrangian (Meta SAC-Lag). Meta SAC-Lag uses meta-gradient optimization to automatically update the safety-related hyperparameters. The proposed method is designed to address safe exploration and threshold adjustment with minimal hyperparameter tuning requirement. In our pipeline, the inner parameters are updated through the conventional formulation and the hyperparameters are adjusted using the meta-objectives which are defined based on the updated parameters. Our results show that the agent can reliably adjust the safety performance due to the relatively fast convergence rate of the safety threshold. We evaluate the performance of Meta SAC-Lag in five simulated environments against Lagrangian baselines, and the results demonstrate its capability to create synergy between parameters, yielding better or competitive results. Furthermore, we conduct a real-world experiment involving a robotic arm tasked with pouring coffee into a cup without spillage. Meta SAC-Lag is successfully trained to execute the task, while minimizing effort constraints.</description>

      <title>Robust Maneuver Planning With Scalable Prediction Horizons: A Move Blocking Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementation of Model Predictive Control (MPC) on hardware with limited computational resources remains a challenge. Especially for long-distance maneuvers that require small sampling times, the necessary horizon lengths prevent its application on onboard computers. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient tubebased shrinking horizon MPC that is scalable to long prediction horizons. Using move blocking, we ensure that a given number of decision inputs is efficiently used throughout the maneuver. Next, a method to substantially reduce the number of constraints is introduced. The approach is demonstrated with a helicopter landing on an inclined platform using a prediction horizon of 300 steps. The constraint reduction decreases the computation time by an order of magnitude with a slight increase in trajectory cost.</description>

      <title>A Conflicts-free, Speed-lossless KAN-based Reinforcement Learning Decision System for Interactive Driving in Roundabouts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety and efficiency are crucial for autonomous driving in roundabouts, especially in the context of mixed traffic where autonomous vehicles (AVs) and human-driven vehicles coexist. This paper introduces a learning-based algorithm tailored to foster safe and efficient driving behaviors across varying levels of traffic flows in roundabouts. The proposed algorithm employs a deep Q-learning network to effectively learn safe and efficient driving strategies in complex multi-vehicle roundabouts. Additionally, a KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold network) enhances the AVs' ability to learn their surroundings robustly and precisely. An action inspector is integrated to replace dangerous actions to avoid collisions when the AV interacts with the environment, and a route planner is proposed to enhance the driving efficiency and safety of the AVs. Moreover, a model predictive control is adopted to ensure stability and precision of the driving actions. The results show that our proposed system consistently achieves safe and efficient driving whilst maintaining a stable training process, as evidenced by the smooth convergence of the reward function and the low variance in the training curves across various traffic flows. Compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, the proposed algorithm achieves a lower number of collisions and reduced travel time to destination.</description>

      <title>Memory-optimised Cubic Splines for High-fidelity Quantum Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio-frequency pulses are widespread for the control of quantum bits and the execution of operations in quantum computers. The ability to tune key pulse parameters such as time-dependent amplitude, phase, and frequency is essential to achieve maximal gate fidelity and mitigate errors. As systems scale, a larger fraction of the control electronic processing will move closer to the qubits, to enhance integration and minimise latency in operations requiring fast feedback. This will constrain the space available in the memory of the control electronics to load time-resolved pulse parameters at high sampling rates. Cubic spline interpolation is a powerful and widespread technique that divides the pulse into segments of cubic polynomials. We show an optimised implementation of this strategy, using a two-stage curve fitting process and additional symmetry operations to load a high-sampling pulse output on an FPGA. This results in a favourable accuracy versus memory footprint trade-off. By simulating single-qubit population transfer and atom transport on a neutral atom device, we show that we can achieve high fidelities with low memory requirements. This is instrumental for scaling up the number of qubits and gate operations in environments where memory is a limited resource.</description>

      <title>In-Field Gyroscope Autocalibration with Iterative Attitude Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.11097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an efficient in-field calibration method tailored for low-cost triaxial MEMS gyroscopes often used in healthcare applications. Traditional calibration techniques are challenging to implement in clinical settings due to the unavailability of high-precision equipment. Unlike the auto-calibration approaches used for triaxial MEMS accelerometers, which rely on local gravity, gyroscopes lack a reliable reference since the Earth's self-rotation speed is insufficient for accurate calibration. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method that uses manual rotation of the MEMS gyroscope to a specific angle (360{\deg}) as the calibration reference. This approach iteratively estimates the sensor's attitude without requiring any external equipment. Numerical simulations and empirical tests validate that the calibration error is low and that parameter estimation is unbiased. The method can be implemented in real-time on a low-energy microcontroller and completed in under 30 seconds. Comparative results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving scale factor and bias errors of less than $2.5\times10^{-2}$ for LSM9DS1 and less than $1\times10^{-2}$ for ICM20948.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control design for general nonlinear robotic systems with guaranteed stability and/or safety in the presence of model uncertainties is a challenging problem. Recent efforts attempt to learn a controller and a certificate (e.g., a Lyapunov function or a contraction metric) jointly using neural networks (NNs), in which model uncertainties are generally ignored during the learning process. In this paper, for nonlinear systems subject to bounded disturbances, we present a framework for jointly learning a robust nonlinear controller and a contraction metric using a novel disturbance rejection objective that certifies a tube bound using NNs for user-specified variables (e.g. control inputs). The learned controller aims to minimize the effect of disturbances on the actual trajectories of state and/or input variables from their nominal counterparts while providing certificate tubes around nominal trajectories that are guaranteed to contain actual trajectories in the presence of disturbances. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework can generate tighter (smaller) tubes and a controller that is computationally efficient to implement.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Control for a Class of Uncertain MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Generalized Time-Varying Output Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel control framework to address the satisfaction of multiple time-varying output constraints in uncertain high-order MIMO nonlinear control systems. Unlike existing methods, which often assume that the constraints are always decoupled and feasible, our approach can handle coupled time-varying constraints even in the presence of potential infeasibilities. First, it is shown that satisfying multiple constraints essentially boils down to ensuring the positivity of a scalar variable, representing the signed distance from the boundary of the time-varying output-constrained set. To achieve this, a single consolidating constraint is designed that, when satisfied, guarantees convergence to and invariance of the time-varying output-constrained set within a user-defined finite time. Next, a novel robust and low-complexity feedback controller is proposed to ensure the satisfaction of the consolidating constraint. Additionally, we provide a mechanism for online modification of the consolidating constraint to find a least violating solution when the constraints become mutually infeasible for some time. Finally, simulation examples of trajectory and region tracking for a mobile robot validate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Line zonotopes: a set representation suitable for unbounded systems and its application to set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis of descriptor systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes new methods for set-based state estimation and active fault diagnosis (AFD) of linear descriptor systems (LDS). In contrast to intervals, ellipsoids, and zonotopes, linear static constraints on the state variables, typical of descriptor systems, can be directly incorporated in the mathematical description of constrained zonotopes (CZs). Thanks to this feature, methods using CZs could provide less conservative enclosures than zonotope methods. However, an enclosure on the states should be known for all $k \geq 0$, which is not true in the case of unstable or unobservable LDS. In this context, this paper proposes a new representation for unbounded sets, which allows to develop methods for state estimation and AFD of stable and unstable LDS. Unlike many other extensions of CZs, the proposed set inherits most of their properties, including polynomial time complexity reduction methods, while allowing to describe different classes of sets, such as strips, hyperplanes, and the entire $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. The advantages of the proposed approaches with respect to CZ methods are highlighted in numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Quality-Aware Hydraulic Control in Drinking Water Networks via Controllability Proxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12214v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operation of water distribution networks is a complex procedure aimed at efficiently delivering consumers with adequate water quantity while ensuring its safe quality. An added challenge is the dependency of the water quality dynamics on the system's hydraulics, which influences the performance of the water quality controller. Prior research has addressed either solving the optimum operational hydraulic setting problem or regulating the water quality dynamics as separate problems. Additionally, there have been efforts to couple these two problems and solve one compact problem resulting in trade-offs between the contradictory objectives. In contrast, this paper takes a novel approach by examining the water quality dependency on the hydraulics from a control-theoretic standpoint. More specifically, we explore the influence of accountability for water quality controllability improvement when addressing the pump scheduling problem. We examine its effects on the cumulative cost of the interconnected systems as well as the subsequent performance of the water quality controller. To achieve this, we develop a framework that incorporates different controllability metrics within the operational hydraulic optimization problem; its aim is attaining an adequate level of water quality control across the system. We assess the aforementioned aspects' performance on various scaled networks with a wide range of numerical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Channel Characterization of IRS-assisted Resonant Beam Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To meet the growing demand for data traffic, spectrum-rich optical wireless communication (OWC) has emerged as a key technological driver for the development of 6G. The resonant beam communication (RBC) system, which employs spatially separated laser cavities as the transmitter and receiver, is a high-speed OWC technology capable of self-alignment without tracking. However, its transmission through the air is susceptible to losses caused by obstructions. In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted RBC system with the optical frequency doubling method, where the resonant beam in frequency-fundamental and frequency-doubled is transmitted through both direct line-of-sight (LoS) and IRS-assisted channels to maintain steady-state oscillation and enable communication without echo-interference, respectively. Then, we establish the channel model based on Fresnel diffraction theory under the near-field optical propagation to analyze the transmission loss and frequency-doubled power analytically. Furthermore, communication power can be maximized by dynamically controlling the beam-splitting ratio between the two channels according to the loss levels encountered over air. Numerical results validate that the IRS-assisted channel can compensate for the losses in the obstructed LoS channel and misaligned receivers, ensuring that communication performance reaches an optimal value with dynamic ratio adjustments.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, achieving autonomous control in nuclear reactor operations has become pivotal for the effectiveness of Space Nuclear Power Systems (SNPS). However, compared to power control, the startup control of SNPS remains underexplored. This study introduces a multi-objective optimization framework aimed at enhancing startup control, leveraging a system level analysis program to simulate the system's dynamic behavior accurately. The primary contribution of this work is the development and implementation of an optimization framework that significantly reduces startup time and improves control efficiency. Utilizing a non-ideal gas model, a multi-channel core model and the Monte Carlo code RMC employed to calculate temperature reactivity coefficients and neutron kinetics parameters, the system analysis tool ensures precise thermal-dynamic simulations. After insightful comprehension of system dynamics through reactive insertion accidents, the optimization algorithm fine-tunes the control sequences for external reactivity insertion, TAC system shaft speed, and cooling system background temperature. The optimized control strategy achieves threshold power 1260 seconds earlier and turbine inlet temperature 1980 seconds sooner than baseline methods. The findings highlight the potential of the proposed optimization framework to enhance the autonomy and operational efficiency of future SNPS designs.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the gatekeeper algorithm, a real-time and computationally-lightweight method that ensures that trajectories of a nonlinear system satisfy safety constraints despite sensing limitations. gatekeeper integrates with existing path planners and feedback controllers by introducing an additional verification step to ensure that proposed trajectories can be executed safely, despite nonlinear dynamics subject to bounded disturbances, input constraints and partial knowledge of the environment. Our key contribution is that (A) we propose an algorithm to recursively construct safe trajectories by numerically forward propagating the system over a (short) finite horizon, and (B) we prove that tracking such a trajectory ensures the system remains safe for all future time, i.e., beyond the finite horizon. We demonstrate the method in a simulation of a dynamic firefighting mission, and in physical experiments of a quadrotor navigating in an obstacle environment that is sensed online. We also provide comparisons against the state-of-the-art techniques for similar problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Underwater navigation is a challenging area in the field of mobile robotics due to inherent constraints in self-localisation and communication in underwater environments. Some of these challenges can be mitigated by using collaborative multi-agent teams. However, when applied underwater, the robustness of traditional multi-agent collaborative control approaches is highly limited due to the unavailability of reliable measurements. In this paper, the concept of a Virtual Elastic Tether (VET) is introduced in the context of incomplete state measurements, which represents an innovative approach to underwater navigation in confined spaces. The concept of VET is formulated and validated using the Cooperative Aquatic Vehicle Exploration System (CAVES), which is a sim-to-real multi-agent aquatic robotic platform. Within this framework, a vision-based Autonomous Underwater Vehicle-Autonomous Surface Vehicle leader-follower formulation is developed. Experiments were conducted in both simulation and on a physical platform, benchmarked against a traditional Image-Based Visual Servoing approach. Results indicate that the formation of the baseline approach fails under discrete disturbances, when induced distances between the robots exceeds 0.6 m in simulation and 0.3 m in the real world. In contrast, the VET-enhanced system recovers to pre-perturbation distances within 5 seconds. Furthermore, results illustrate the successful navigation of VET-enhanced CAVES in a confined water pond where the baseline approach fails to perform adequately.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate Relative Motion Tracking for Dual Industrial Robots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Industrial robotic applications such as spraying, welding, and additive manufacturing frequently require fast, accurate, and uniform motion along a 3D spatial curve. To increase process throughput, some manufacturers propose a dual-robot setup to overcome the speed limitation of a single robot. Industrial robot motion is programmed through waypoints connected by motion primitives (Cartesian linear and circular paths and linear joint paths at constant Cartesian speed). The actual robot motion is affected by the blending between these motion primitives and the pose of the robot (an outstretched/near-singularity pose tends to have larger path tracking errors). Choosing the waypoints and the speed along each motion segment to achieve the performance requirement is challenging. At present, there is no automated solution, and laborious manual tuning by robot experts is needed to approach the desired performance. In this paper, we present a systematic three-step approach to designing and programming a dual robot system to optimize system performance. The first step is to select the relative placement between the two robots based on the specified relative motion path. The second step is to select the relative waypoints and the motion primitives. The final step is to update the waypoints iteratively based on the actual measured relative motion. Waypoint iteration is first executed in simulation and then completed using the actual robots. For performance assessment, we use the mean path speed subject to the relative position and orientation constraints and the path speed uniformity constraint. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on two systems, a physical testbed of two ABB robots and a simulation testbed of two FANUC robots, for two challenging test curves.</description>

      <title>Formally Verifying Deep Reinforcement Learning Controllers with Lyapunov Barrier Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is a powerful machine learning paradigm for generating agents that control autonomous systems. However, the ``black box'' nature of DRL agents limits their deployment in real-world safety-critical applications. A promising approach for providing strong guarantees on an agent's behavior is to use Neural Lyapunov Barrier (NLB) certificates, which are learned functions over the system whose properties indirectly imply that an agent behaves as desired. However, NLB-based certificates are typically difficult to learn and even more difficult to verify, especially for complex systems. In this work, we present a novel method for training and verifying NLB-based certificates for discrete-time systems. Specifically, we introduce a technique for certificate composition, which simplifies the verification of highly-complex systems by strategically designing a sequence of certificates. When jointly verified with neural network verification engines, these certificates provide a formal guarantee that a DRL agent both achieves its goals and avoids unsafe behavior. Furthermore, we introduce a technique for certificate filtering, which significantly simplifies the process of producing formally verified certificates. We demonstrate the merits of our approach with a case study on providing safety and liveness guarantees for a DRL-controlled spacecraft.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of learning stable matchings with unknown preferences in a decentralized and uncoordinated manner, where "decentralized" means that players make decisions individually without the influence of a central platform, and "uncoordinated" means that players do not need to synchronize their decisions using pre-specified rules. First, we provide a game formulation for this problem with known preferences, where the set of pure Nash equilibria (NE) coincides with the set of stable matchings, and mixed NE can be rounded to a stable matching. Then, we show that for hierarchical markets, applying the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm to the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret in a fully decentralized and uncoordinated fashion. Moreover, we show that EXP converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general markets. We also introduce another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability. Finally, we provide stronger feedback conditions under which it is possible to drive the market faster toward an approximate stable matching. Our proposed game-theoretic framework bridges the discrete problem of learning stable matchings with the problem of learning NE in continuous-action games.</description>
