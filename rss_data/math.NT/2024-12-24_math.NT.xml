      <title>Arithmetic properties of $k$-tuple $\ell$-regular partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study arithmetic properties satisfied by the $k$-tuple $\ell$-regular partitions. A $k$-tuple of partitions $(\xi_1, \xi_2, \ldots, \xi_k)$ is said to be $\ell$-regular if all the $\xi_i$'s are $\ell$-regular. We study the cases $(\ell, k)=(2,3), (4,3), (\ell, p)$, where $p$ is a prime, and even the general case when both $\ell$ and $k$ are unrestricted. Using elementary means as well as the theory of modular forms we prove several infinite family of congruences and density results for these family of partitions.</description>

      <title>P-adic approximation of algebraic integers and residue class rings of rings of integer-valued polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let F:K be a Galois extension of number fields and Q a prime ideal of O_F lying over the prime P of O_K. By analyzing the Q-adic closure of O_K in O_F we characterize those rings of integers O_K for which every residue class ring of Int(O_K) modulo a non-zero prime ideal is GE2 (meaning that every unimodular pair can be trasformed to (1,0) by a series of elementary transformations).</description>

      <title>On non-holonomicity, transcendence and $p$-adic valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\nu}_q(n)$ be the p-adic valuation of $n$. We show that the power series with coefficients ${\nu}_q(n)$, respectively ${\nu}_p(n)(\mathrm{ mod\;} k)$, are non-holonomic and not algebraic in characteristic 0. We find infinitely many rational numbers and infinitely many algebraic irrational numbers for which the values of these series are transcendental. We apply these results to some $p$-automatic sequences, one of them being the period-doubling sequence.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic formulae for Iwasawa Invariants of Mazur--Tate elements of elliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two related questions regarding the $\lambda$-invariants of Mazur--Tate elements of elliptic curves defined over the field of rational numbers. At additive primes, we explain their growth and how these invariants relate to other better understood invariants depending on the potential reduction type. At good ordinary primes dividing the denominator of the normalised $L$-value of the elliptic curve, we prove that the $\lambda$-invariant grows as $p^n-1$, which is the maximum value. In addition, we give examples and a conjecture for the additive potentially supersingular case, supported by computational data from Sage in this setting.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we complete B\"{u}chi's proof that there is no decision algorithm for the solubility in integers of arbitrary systems of diagonal quadratic form equations, by proving the assertion that whenever $x_1^2, \cdots, x_5^2$ are five squares such that the second differences satisfy
  \[x_{k+2}^2 - 2 x_{k+1}^2 + x_k^2 = 2\]
  for $k = 1,2,3$, then they must be consecutive. This answers a question of J.~Richard~B\"{u}chi.</description>

      <title>On Shusterman's Goldbach-type problem for sign patterns of the Liouville function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\lambda$ be the Liouville function. Assuming the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis for Dirichlet $L$-functions (GRH), we show that for every sufficiently large even integer $N$ there are $a,b \geq 1$ such that $$ a+b = N \text{ and } \lambda(a) = \lambda(b) = -1. $$ This conditionally answers an analogue of the binary Goldbach problem for the Liouville function, posed by Shusterman.
  The latter is a consequence of a quantitative lower bound on the frequency of sign patterns attained by $(\lambda(n),\lambda(N-n))$, for sufficiently large primes $N$. We show, assuming GRH, that there is a constant $C &gt; 0$ such that for each pattern $(\eta_1,\eta_2) \in \{-1,+1\}^2$ and each prime $N \geq N_0$, $$ |\{n &lt; N : (\lambda(n),\lambda(N-n)) = (\eta_1,\eta_2)\}| \gg N e^{-C(\log \log N)^{6}}. $$ The proof makes essential use of the Pierce expansion of rational numbers $n/N$, which may be of interest in other binary problems.</description>

      <title>Explicit linear dependence congruence relations for the partition function modulo 4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Almost nothing is known about the parity of the partition function $p(n)$, which is conjectured to be random. Despite this expectation, Ono surprisingly proved the existence of infinitely many linear dependence congruence relations modulo 4 for $p(n)$, indicating that the parity of the partition function cannot be truly random. Answering a question of Ono, we explicitly exhibit the first examples of these relations which he proved theoretically exist. The first two relations invoke 131 (resp. 198) different discriminants $D \leq 24k-1$ for $k=309$ (resp. $k=312$); new relations occur for $k = 316, 317, 319, 321, 322, 326, \ldots$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic independence of $\Omega(n)$ and $\Omega(n+1)$ along logarithmic averages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega(n)$ denote the number of prime factors of a positive integer $n$ counted with multiplicities. We establish asymptotic independence for the joint distribution of $\Omega(n)$ and $\Omega(n+1)$ along logarithmic averages. More precisely, we show that for any bounded functions $a,b\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{C}$, $$\frac{1}{\log{N}}\sum_{n=1}^N \frac{a(\Omega(n))b(\Omega(n+1))}{n} = \Bigg(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N a(\Omega(n))\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=1}^N b(\Omega(n))\Bigg) + \mathrm{o}_{N\to\infty}(1).$$ This generalizes Tao's theorem on the logarithmically averaged two-point correlation case of Chowla conjecture. Our result is quantitative and the explicit error term that we obtain establishes double-logarithmic savings. As an application, we obtain new results about the distribution of $\Omega(p+1)$ as $p$ ranges over $\ell$-almost primes for a "typical" value of $\ell$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1987, Mazur and Tate stated conjectures which, in some cases, resemble the classical Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and its $p$-adic analog. We study experimentally three conjectures stated by Mazur and Tate using SageMath. Our findings indicate discrepancies in some of the original statements of some of the conjectures presented by Mazur and Tate. However, a slight modification on the statement of these conjectures does appear to hold.</description>

      <title>Heights of complete intersections in toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The height of a toric variety and that of its hypersurfaces can be expressed in convex-analytic terms as an adelic sum of mixed integrals of their roof functions and duals of their Ronkin functions.
  Here we extend these results to the $2$-codimensional situation by presenting a limit formula predicting the typical height of the intersection of two hypersurfaces on a toric variety. More precisely, we prove that the height of the intersection cycle of two effective divisors translated by a strict sequence of torsion points converges to an adelic sum of mixed integrals of roof and duals of Ronkin functions.
  This partially confirms a previous conjecture of the authors about the average height of families of complete intersections in toric varieties.</description>

      <title>Explicit Upper Bounds on Decay Rates of Fourier Transforms of Self-similar Measures on Self-similar Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of Fourier transforms of probability measures on fractal sets plays an important role in recent research. Faster decay rates are known to yield enhanced results in areas such as metric number theory. This paper focuses on self-similar probability measures defined on self-similar sets. Explicit upper bounds are derived for their decay rates, improving upon prior research. These findings are illustrated with an application to sets of numbers whose digits in their L\"uroth representations are restricted to a finite set.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Discovery of Formulas for Mathematical Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ongoing efforts that span over decades show a rise of AI methods for accelerating scientific discovery, yet accelerating discovery in mathematics remains a persistent challenge for AI. Specifically, AI methods were not effective in creation of formulas for mathematical constants because each such formula must be correct for infinite digits of precision, with "near-true" formulas providing no insight toward the correct ones. Consequently, formula discovery lacks a clear distance metric needed to guide automated discovery in this realm.
  In this work, we propose a systematic methodology for categorization, characterization, and pattern identification of such formulas. The key to our methodology is introducing metrics based on the convergence dynamics of the formulas, rather than on the numerical value of the formula. These metrics enable the first automated clustering of mathematical formulas. We demonstrate this methodology on Polynomial Continued Fraction formulas, which are ubiquitous in their intrinsic connections to mathematical constants, and generalize many mathematical functions and structures.
  We test our methodology on a set of 1,768,900 such formulas, identifying many known formulas for mathematical constants, and discover previously unknown formulas for $\pi$, $\ln(2)$, Gauss', and Lemniscate's constants. The uncovered patterns enable a direct generalization of individual formulas to infinite families, unveiling rich mathematical structures. This success paves the way towards a generative model that creates formulas fulfilling specified mathematical properties, accelerating the rate of discovery of useful formulas.</description>

Abstract: We take a first step towards the classification of singular Mori dream $K3$ surfaces. We prove that if the Picard lattice of a singular $K3$ surface is Mori dream, then the surface is Mori dream. Moreover, we show that for singular $K3$ surfaces, of Picard rank two, being Mori dream is equivalent to contain two negative curves intersecting each other, and apply this result to study Mori dreamness of $K3$ surfaces with a singular point of type $A_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by earlier results on recursions for open-string tree-level amplitudes, and by a result of Brown and Dupont relating open- and closed-string tree-level amplitudes via single-valued periods, we identify a recursive relation for closed-string tree-level amplitudes. We achieve this by showing that closed-string analogues of Selberg integrals satisfy the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equation for a suitable matrix representation of the free Lie algebra on two generators, and by identifying the limits at z=1 and z=0, which are related by the Deligne associator, with N-point and (N-1)-point closed-string amplitudes, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work brings Mellin transforms into the realm of motivic integration. The new, larger class of motivic functions is stable under motivic Mellin and Fourier transforms, with general Fubini results and change of variables formulas. It specializes to $p$-adic integrals and $p$-adic Mellin transforms uniformly in $p$, with transfer principles between zero and positive characteristic local fields. In particular, it generalizes previous set-ups of motivic integration with Fubini from among others [16, 17, 18, 29, 9] and simplifies some aspects on the way by using the ideas of [10].</description>

Abstract: The modular curves serve as excellent objects for testing conjectures in arithmetic geometry. They possess a natural geometric definition in contrast with rather nontrivial structure. On the other hand, they are well-studied from the perspective of number theory. Furthermore, there is a well-developed and powerful analytic technique available. We will use the square of the modular curve as the experimental object to investigate the arithmetic properties of the periods of mixed Hodge structures. There is an additional reason for this study: this square is naturally associated with a family of (Hecke) curves. These curves form components of the Neron-Severi locus, allowing for the interpretation of the square of the moduli curve as the moduli space of split (i.e., the product of two elliptic curves) abelian surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.11982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be the maximal order in a quadratic imaginary field $K$. We give an equivalence of categories between the category of polarized abelian varieties isomorphic to a product of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{C}$ with complex multiplication (CM) by $R$ and the category of integral hermitian $R$-lattices. Then we apply this equivalence to enumerate all the genus $2$ and $3$ curves with field of moduli $\mathbb{Q}$ and with Jacobian isomorphic to a product of elliptic curves with CM by $R$.</description>

      <title>Periodic points of rational functions over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $q$ a prime power and $\phi$ a rational function with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_q$, let $p(q,\phi)$ be the proportion of $\mathbb{P}^1(\mathbb{F}_q)$ that is periodic with respect to $\phi$. And if $d$ is a positive integer, let $Q_d$ be the set of prime powers coprime to $d!$ and let $\mathcal{P}(d,q)$ be the expected value of $p(q,\phi)$ as $\phi$ ranges over rational functions with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_q$ of degree $d$. We prove that if $d$ is a positive integer no less than $2$, then $\mathcal{P}(d,q)$ tends to 0 as $q$ increases in $Q_d$. This theorem generalizes our previous work, which held only for quadratic polynomials, and only in fixed characteristic. To deduce this result, we prove a uniformity theorem on specializations of dynamical systems of rational functions with coefficients in certain finitely-generated algebras over residually finite Dedekind domains. This specialization theorem generalizes our previous work, which held only for algebras of dimension one.</description>

      <title>Elliptic Curves with positive rank and no integral points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider all \emph{odd} fundamental discriminants $D \equiv 2 \bmod 3$ and their mirror discriminants $D' = -3D$, and we study the family of elliptic curves $E_{D'}: y^{2} = x^{3} + 16D'$. By employing results of Satg\'e and by assuming finiteness of the $3$-primary part of their Tate-Shafarevich group, we show that these curves must have odd rank when $D &lt; 0$ and even rank when $D &gt; 0$. We denote by $r_{3}(D)$ the rank of the $3$-part of the ideal class group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$ and by $r_{3}(D')$ the rank of the $3$-part of the ideal class group of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D'})$. We show that every curve in the subfamily of elliptic curves $E_{D'}$ with $r_{3}(D) = r_{3}(D') + 1$ for $D &lt; 0$ (respectively, with $r_{3}(D) = r_{3}(D')$ for $D &gt; 0$) cannot have any integral points. This is particularly interesting for the case of $D &lt; 0$ since every curve $E_{D'}$ in this case has infinitely many rational points, yet no integral points.</description>

      <title>Galois representations with large image in the global Langlands correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global Langlands conjecture for $\text{GL}_n$ over a number field $F$ predicts a correspondence between certain algebraic automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ and certain families $\{ \rho_{\pi,\ell} \}_\ell$ of $n$-dimensional $\ell$-adic Galois representations of $\text{Gal}(\overline{F}/F)$. In general, it is expected that the image of the residual Galois representation $\overline{\rho}_{\pi,\ell}$ of $\rho_{\pi,\ell}$ should be as large as possible for almost all primes $\ell$, unless there is an automorphic reason for the image to be small.
  In this paper, we study the images of certain compatible systems of Galois representations $\{\rho_{\pi,\ell} \}_\ell$ associated to regular algebraic, polarizable, cuspidal automorphic representations $\pi$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{A}_F)$ by using only standard techniques and currently available tools (e.g., Fontaine-Laffaille theory, Serre's modularity conjecture, classification of the maximal subgroups of Lie type groups, and known results about irreducibility of automorphic Galois representations and Langlands functoriality). In particular, when $F$ is a totally real field and $n$ is an odd prime number $\leq 293$, we prove that (under certain automorphic conditions) the images of the residual representations $\overline{\rho}_{\pi,\ell}$ are as large as possible for infinitely many primes $\ell$. In fact, we prove the large image conjecture (i.e., large image for almost all primes $\ell$) when $F=\mathbb{Q}$ and $n=5$.</description>

Abstract: On page 206 in his lost notebook, Ramanujan recorded an incomplete septic theta function identity. Motivated by the completion of this identity by the second author, we offer cubic and quintic analogues. Using the theory generated by these two analogues and Ramanujan's class invariants, we provide many evaluations for Ramanujan's most prominent theta function, $\varphi(q)$ in his notation.</description>

Abstract: The $(k,l)$-G\"{o}bel sequences defined by Ibstedt remain integers for the first (in some cases, many) terms, but for selected values of $(k,l)$, computations show that the terms eventually stop being integers. It is still unresolved whether the integrality of these sequences breaks down for all $k, l\geq 2$. In this article, we prove the non-integrality for a specific class of $(k,l)$ values. Our proof is based on geometric arguments related to the distribution of quadratic residues modulo a prime.</description>

      <title>Linear relations of p-adic periods of 1-motives (thesis)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this thesis, we aim to develop p-adic analogs of known results for classical periods, focusing specifically on 1-motives. We establish an integration theory for 1-motives with good reductions, which generalizes the Colmez-Fontaine-Messing p-adic integration for abelian varieties with good reductions. We also compare the integration pairing with other pairings such as those induced by crystalline theory. Additionally, we introduce a formalism for periods and formulate p-adic period conjectures related to p-adic periods arising from this integration pairing. Broadly, our p-adic period conjecture operates at different depths, with each depth revealing distinct relations among the p-adic periods. Notably, the classical period conjecture (Kontsevich-Zanier conjecture over $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$) for 1-periods fits within our framework, and, according to the classical subgroup theorem of Huber-W\"ustholz for 1-motives, the conjecture for classical periods of 1-motives holds true at depth 1. Finally, we identify three $\mathbb{Q}$-structures arising from $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}$-rational points of the formal p-divisible group associated with a 1-motive $M$ with a good reduction at $p$, and we prove p-adic period conjectures at depths 2 and 1, relative to periods induced by the p-adic integration of $M$ and these $\mathbb{Q}$-structures. Our proof involves a p-adic version of the subgroup theorem that we obtain for 1-motives with good reductions.</description>

      <title>On an indivisibility version of Iizuka's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the existence of a positive proportion of \( d \in \mathbb{N} \) such that the class numbers of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}), \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d+1}), \dots, \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d+n}) \) are not divisible by \( 3^k \), where \( n = 3^{k+1} - 5 \) and \( k \in \mathbb{N} \). This provides an indivisibility analog of Iizuka's conjecture. Similarly, for \( d &lt; 0 \) and the same \( n \), a positive proportion of \( d \) ensures that the class numbers of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d}), \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d+1}), \dots, \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d+n}) \) are not divisible by \( 3^{k+1} \). Denoting the square-free natural numbers by \( (d_n) \), we prove the existence of a positive density set of \( i\in\mathbb{N} \) such that the class numbers of \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d_i}), \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d_{i+1}}), \dots, \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d_{i+n}}) \) are not divisible by \( 3^k \). Moreover, we study the indivisibility of class numbers by $3$ for imaginary biquadratic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our object of study is extremal functions which are defined by distance functions of convex bodies. These functions take values in the moduli spaces of algebraic and geometric objects associated with these ${\mathbb Z}$-modules (geometric lattices) and with convex bodies. In most cases, convex bodies are $2$-dimensional Minkowski balls whose boundaries are Minkowski curves and we study lattice points on these curves. We define and investigate extremal functions that yield the homogeneous arithmetic minimum of a function in a lattice, the Hermite constant, the critical determinant of a body, optimal packings of bodies, best values of covering constants, and optimal solutions of Diophantine approximation problems. Moreover, for two-dimensional unit Minkowski balls and Minkowski domains we determine the minimal areas of inscribed and circumscribed hexagons.</description>

      <title>Badly approximable triangles and Delone sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the linear equation $x+y+z=1$ where $\pi x$, $\pi y$, $\pi z$ are three angles of a triangle and the numbers $x$, $y$, $z$ are badly approximable. We show that there are exactly two solutions which have the smallest partial quotients by lexicographical ordering. Lastly, we give a construction of associated Delone sets which are expected to have rotationally invariant diffraction.</description>

      <title>Euler-type recurrences for $t$-color and $t$-regular partition functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give Euler-like recursive formulas for the $t$-colored partition function when $t=2$ or $t=3,$ as well as for all $t$-regular partition functions. In particular, we derive an infinite family of ``triangular number" recurrences for the $3$-colored partition function. Our proofs are inspired by the recent work of Gomez, Ono, Saad, and Singh on the ordinary partition function and make extensive use of $q$-series identities for $(q;q)_{\infty}$ and $(q;q)_{\infty}^3.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:1810.11853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a theorem of Bhatt-Morrow-Scholze, we develop a stacky approach to crystals and isocrystals on "Frobenius-smooth" schemes over F_p . This class of schemes goes back to Berthelot-Messing and contains all smooth schemes over perfect fields of characteristic p.
  To treat isocrystals, we prove some descent theorems for sheaves of Banachian modules, which could be interesting in their own right.</description>

      <title>On loop Deligne--Lusztig varieties of Coxeter-type for inner forms of ${\rm GL}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.03412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a reductive group $G$ over a local non-archimedean field $K$ one can mimic the construction from the classical Deligne--Lusztig theory by using the loop space functor. We study this construction in special the case that $G$ is an inner form of ${\rm GL}_n$ and the loop Deligne--Lusztig variety is of Coxeter type. After simplifying the proof of its representability, our main result is that its $\ell$-adic cohomology realizes many irreducible supercuspidal representations of $G$, notably almost all among those whose L-parameter factors through an unramified elliptic maximal torus of $G$. This gives a purely local, purely geometric and -- in a sense -- quite explicit way to realize special cases of the local Langlands and Jacquet--Langlands correspondences.</description>

      <title>Computing isogenies from modular equations in genus two</title>

      <description>arXiv:2001.04137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm solving the following problem: given two  genus 2 curves over a field k with isogenous Jacobians, compute  such an isogeny explicitly.  This isogeny can be either an  l-isogeny or, in the real multiplication case, an isogeny with  cyclic kernel; we require that k have large enough characteristic  and that the curves be sufficiently generic.  Our algorithm uses  modular equations for these isogeny types, and makes essential use  of an explicit Kodaira--Spencer isomorphism in genus 2.</description>

      <title>On additive bases in infinite abelian semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.03919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on previous work by Lambert, Plagne and the third author, we study various aspects of the behavior of additive bases in infinite abelian groups and semigroups. We show that, for every infinite abelian group $T$, the number of essential subsets of any additive basis is finite, and also that the number of essential subsets of cardinality $k$ contained in an additive basis of order at most $h$ can be bounded in terms of $h$ and $k$ alone. These results extend the reach of two theorems, one due to Deschamps and Farhi and the other to Hegarty, bearing upon $\mathbf{N}$. Also, using invariant means, we address a classical problem, initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Graham and then generalized by Nash and Nathanson both in the case of $\mathbf{N}$, of estimating the maximal order $X_T(h,k)$ that a basis of cocardinality $k$ contained in an additive basis of order at most $h$ can have. Among other results, we prove that $X_T(h,k)=O(h^{2k+1})$ for every integer $k \ge 1$. This result is new even in the case where $k=1$. Besides the maximal order $X_T(h,k)$, the typical order $S_T(h,k)$ is also studied. Our methods actually apply to a wider class of infinite abelian semigroups, thus unifying in a single axiomatic frame the theory of additive bases in $\mathbf{N}$ and in abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Singularities of local models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.12072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct local models of Shimura varieties and investigate their singularities, with special emphasis on wildly ramified cases. More precisely, with the exception of odd unitary groups in residue characteristic $2$ we construct local models, show reducedness of their special fiber, Cohen$-$Macaulayness and in equi-characteristic also (pseudo-)rationality. In mixed characteristic we conjecture their (pseudo-)rationality. This is based on the construction of parahoric group schemes over two-dimensional bases for wildly ramified groups and an analysis of singularities of the attached Schubert varieties in positive characteristic using perfect geometry.</description>

      <title>Arbitrarily large jumps in the de Rham and Hodge cohomology of families in characteristic $p$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct smooth projective families of algebraic varieties in characteristic $p$ such that the dimensions of the de Rham and Hodge cohomology groups of the fibers can be made to jump by an arbitrarily large amount. To do this, we first construct an example using the classifying stack of a finite flat group scheme which degenerates $\mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$ to $\alpha_p \oplus \alpha_p$. Along the way, we give a self-contained exposition of the construction of Godeaux--Serre varieties.</description>

      <title>On off-diagonal Ramsey numbers for vector spaces over $\mathbb{F}_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $d$, we show that there must exist an absolute constant $c &gt; 0$ such that the following holds: for any integer $n \geq cd^{7}$ and any red-blue coloring of the one-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$, there must exist either a $d$-dimensional subspace for which all of its one-dimensional subspaces get colored red or a $2$-dimensional subspace for which all of its one-dimensional subspaces get colored blue. This answers recent questions of Nelson and Nomoto, and confirms that for any even plane binary matroid $N$, the class of $N$-free, claw-free binary matroids is polynomially $\chi$-bounded.
  Our argument will proceed via a reduction to a well-studied additive combinatorics problem, originally posed by Green: given a set $A \subset \mathbb{F}_{2}^{n}$ with density $\alpha \in [0,1]$, what is the largest subspace that we can find in $A+A$? Our main contribution to the story is a new result for this problem in the regime where $1/\alpha$ is large with respect to $n$, which utilizes ideas from the recent breakthrough paper of Kelley and Meka on sets of integers without three-term arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <title>On moments of the derivative of CUE characteristic polynomials and the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of $N \times N$ Haar distributed unitary matrices. We obtain the first explicit formulae for complex-valued moments when the spectral variable is inside the unit disc, in the limit $N \to \infty$. These formulae are expressed in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind. As an application, we provide an alternative method to re-obtain Mezzadri's result [J. Phys. A, 36(12):2945-2962, 2003] on the asymptotic density of zeros of the derivative as $N \to \infty$. We explore the connection between these moments and those of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function away from the critical line. Under the Lindel\"of hypothesis, we prove that all positive integer moments agree with our random matrix results up to an arithmetic factor. Inspired by this finding, we propose a conjecture on the asymptotics of non-integer moments of the derivative of the Riemann zeta function off the critical line. Within random matrix theory, we also investigate the microscopic regime where the spectral variable $z$ satisfies $|z|^{2}=1-\frac{c}{N}$ for a fixed constant $c$. We obtain an asymptotic formula for the moments in this regime as a determinant involving the finite temperature Bessel kernel, which reduces to the Bessel kernel when $c=0$. For finite matrix size, we provide an exact formula for the moments of the derivative inside the unit disc, expressed as polynomials of the inverse of the distance from the circle, with coefficients given by combinatorial sums.</description>

      <title>Schubert cells and Whittaker functionals for $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ part I: Combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a formula for a birational map on the Schubert cell associated to each Weyl group element of $G=\text{GL}(n)$. The map simplifies the UDL decomposition of matrices, providing structural insight into the Schubert cell decomposition of the flag variety $G/B$, where $B$ is a Borel subgroup. An application of the formula includes a new proof of the existence of Whittaker functionals for principal series representations of $\text{GL}(n,\mathbb{R})$ via integration by parts. In this paper, we establish combinatorial properties of the birational map and prove auxiliary results.</description>
