      <title>Aging of glass-forming materials following a temperature jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aging in a glass forming model in which both trapping effect and delayed response of the free energy landscape (FEL) exist is studied after the temperature is changed. It is confirmed that the trapping effect gives rise to Type-I aging where the relaxation time increases with waiting time regardless of the direction of temperature change, and that the delayed response of the FEL produces Type-II aging where the waiting-time dependence of the relaxation time depends on the direction of temperature change. When both effects exist and the response time of the FEL is appropriate, these effects can be differentiated in the short-time behavior of the temporal relaxation time. It is argued that the material time or the internal clock and the fictive temperature introduced phenomenologically are understood as the concepts describing the delayed response of the FEL to temperature change.</description>

      <title>The frustrated Ising model on the honeycomb lattice: Metastability and universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Ising model with competing ferromagnetic nearest- and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor interactions of strengths $J_1 &gt; 0$ and $J_2 &lt; 0$, respectively, on the honeycomb lattice. For $J_2 &gt; - J_1 / 4$ it has a ferromagnetic ground state, and previous work has shown that at least for $J_2 \gtrsim -0.2 J_1$ the transition is in the Ising universality class. For even lower $J_2$ some indicators pointing towards a first-order transition were reported. By utilizing population annealing Monte Carlo simulations together with a rejection-free and adaptive update, we can equilibrate systems with $J_2$ as low as $-0.23 J_1$. By means of a finite-size scaling analysis we show that the system undergoes a second-order phase transition within the Ising universality class at least down to $J_2 =-0.23 J_1$ and, most likely, for all $J_2 &gt; - J_1 / 4$. As we show here, there exist very long-lived metastable states in this system explaining the first-order like behavior seen in only partially equilibrated systems.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Brownian escape via intermediate finite potential barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean first-passage time (MFPT) for a Brownian particle to surmount a potential barrier of height $\Delta U$ is a fundamental quantity governing a wide array of physical and chemical processes. According to the Arrhenius Law, the MFPT typically grows exponentially with increasing barrier height, reflecting the rarity of thermally activated escape events. In this work, we demonstrate that the MFPT can be significantly reduced by reshaping the original single-barrier potential into a structured energy landscape comprising multiple intermediate barriers of lower heights, while keeping the total barrier height $\Delta U$ unchanged. Furthermore, this counterintuitive result holds across both linear and nonlinear potential profiles. Our findings suggest that tailoring the energy landscape -- by introducing well-placed intermediate barriers -- can serve as an effective control strategy to accelerate thermally activated transitions. These predictions are amenable to experimental validation using optical trapping techniques.</description>

      <title>Rosette formations as symmetry-breaking events: theory and experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20543v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multicellular rosettes are observed in different situations such as morphogenesis, wound healing, and cancer progression. While some molecular insights have been gained to explain the presence of these assemblies of five or more cells around a common center, what are the tunable, global features that favors/hinders their formation is still largely unknown. Here, we made use of a Voronoi dynamical model to investigate the ingredients driving the emergence of rosettes characterized by different degree of stability and organization. We found that (i) breaking the local spatial symmetry of the system, i.e., introducing curvature-inducing defects, allows for the formation of rosette-like structures (ii) whose probability of formation depends on the characteristic of the cellular layer. In particular, a trade-off between tissue fluidity and single cell deformability dictates the assembly of transient rosettes, that are strongly stabilized in the presence of cell alignment interactions. To test our model predictions, we performed fluorescence microscopy experiments on rosette-forming neural populations derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, finding significant agreement. Overall, our work may set the stage to gain an unifying understanding of the plethora of biophysical mechanisms involving the occurrence of rosette-like structure both in physiology and their altered formation in pathology.</description>

      <title>Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ short-ranged $\textit{Ans\"atze}$, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a novel semi-Dirac spin liquid, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for future neutron-scattering studies on these materials.</description>

      <title>Self-similar kinetics for gravitational Bose-Einstein condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an overpopulated gas of gravitationally interacting bosons surrounding a droplet of Bose-Einstein condensate - Bose star. We argue that kinetic evolution of this gas approaches with time a self-similar attractor solution to the kinetic equation. If the scale symmetry of the equation is broken by external conditions, the attractor solution exists, remains approximately self-similar, but has slowly drifting scaling dimension. The latter new regime of adiabatic self-similarity can determine growth of dark matter Bose stars in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Competing Dirac masses in one dimension: Symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition and deconfined criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent symmetries and slow crossover phenomena are central themes in quantum criticality and manifest themselves in the pseudocritical scaling experienced in the context of deconfined criticality. Here we discover its conceptual counterpart, i.e., a symmetry-enhanced pseudo-first-order transition. It emerges from a one-dimensional realization of deconfined criticality between charge- and bond-ordered states driven by competing Holstein and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger electron-phonon couplings, for which quantum fluctuations and thereby the nature of the transition can be tuned systematically via the phonon frequency $\omega_0$. In the classical limit $\omega_0 \to 0$, a low-energy Dirac theory predicts a direct first-order transition with emergent U(1) symmetry. Using exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we provide strong evidence for symmetry enhancement and even finite-size scaling on intermediate length scales but in the thermodynamic limit it turns into a narrow intermediate phase where both order parameters are finite, as chiral U(1) symmetry is weakly broken on the lattice. Including quantum lattice fluctuations diminishes the width of the intermediate phase, gradually restores the U(1) symmetry, and eventually tunes the system to a deconfined quantum critical point.</description>

      <title>Conformal bootstrap: from Polyakov to our times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We trace the history of conformal bootstrap from its early days to our times - a great example of unity of physics. We start by describing little-known details about the origins of conformal field theory in the study of strong interactions and critical phenomena in the 1960s and 1970s. We describe similarities and differences between approaches and results of the main groups in Moscow, Rome, and Sofia. Then come the breakthroughs in the 1980s and the 1990s, in particular 2D CFT and holography. Finally, we describe the genesis of the numerical conformal bootstrap, from the conformal technicolor bounds in the 2000s, to the determination of the 3D Ising critical exponents in the 2010s. We conclude with some outstanding challenges. We stress that conformal invariance is a symmetry of nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02850v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.</description>

      <title>Identifiability and minimality bounds of quantum and post-quantum models of classical stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To make sense of the world around us, we develop models, constructed to enable us to replicate, describe, and explain the behaviours we see. Focusing on the broad case of sequences of correlated random variables, i.e., classical stochastic processes, we tackle the question of determining whether or not two different models produce the same observable behavior. This is the problem of identifiability. Curiously, the physics of the model need not correspond to the physics of the observations; recent work has shown that it is even advantageous -- in terms of memory and thermal efficiency -- to employ quantum models to generate classical stochastic processes. We resolve the identifiability problem in this regime, providing a means to compare any two models of a classical process, be the models classical, quantum, or `post-quantum', by mapping them to a canonical `generalized' hidden Markov model. Further, this enables us to place (sometimes tight) bounds on the minimal dimension required of a quantum model to generate a given classical stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Chirality, confinement and dimensionality govern re-entrant transitions in active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium dynamics of individual chiral active particles underpin the complex behavior of chiral active matter. Here we present an exact analytical framework, supported by simulations, to characterize the steady states of two-dimensional chiral active Brownian particles and three-dimensional torque-driven counterparts in a harmonic trap. Using a Laplace-transform approach of the Fokker-Planck equation, we derive closed-form expressions for displacement moments and excess kurtosis, providing a precise probe of non-Gaussian statistics. Our analysis reveals three distinct regimes: bimodal active states with off-center peaks, Gaussian-like passive states, and weakly heavy-tailed distributions unique to two dimensions. We show that dimensionality plays a decisive role: in two dimensions, increasing chirality suppresses activity and restores passive behavior, while in three dimensions torque preserves activity along the torque axis, producing anisotropic steady states. These behaviors are captured by simple active length-scale arguments that map the boundaries between passive and active phases. Our results offer concrete experimental signatures - including kurtosis crossovers, off-center peaks, and torque-induced anisotropy - that establish confinement as a powerful tool to probe and control chiral and torque-driven active matter.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of density fluctuations in the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the boundary driven Quantum Symmetric Simple Inclusion Process (QSSIP) which describes a one-dimensional system of bosonic particles with stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping, modeled as a Brownian motion, with gain/loss processes at the endpoints of the chain driving the system out-of-equilibrium. Although the averaged QSSIP dynamics differs from that of the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (QSSEP) - the analogous system where bosons are replaced by fermions - we show that, paradoxically, the dynamics of their matrices of two-point functions, along with all their fluctuations, coincide. In contrary, the underlying classical models differs significantly, as the bosonic statistics allow the inclusion of multiple particles at the same site, in contrast to (symmetric) simple exclusion processes (SSEP). We provide an exact derivation of the large deviation function of density fluctuations in QSSIP and, as a consequence, in the classical inclusion process (SSIP) by exploiting its quantum formulation. Remarkably, our study highlights that, both in QSSEP and QSSIP, fluctuations of the local densities are typically classical, i.e. the cumulant generating functions of the local densities are asymptotically self-averaging and converge toward those of the classical SSEP and SSIP, realization-wise. This provides a test of the conjectured almost sure classical behavior of transport fluctuations, at leading order in the system size, in noisy diffusive quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Equilibrium Dynamics of Hard Spheres in the Fluid, Crystalline, and Glassy Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the response of a system of hard spheres to two classes of perturbations over a range of densities spanning the fluid, crystalline, and glassy regimes within a molecular dynamics framework. Firstly, we consider the relaxation of a "thermal inhomogeneity," in which a central region of particles is given a higher temperature than its surroundings and is then allowed to evolve under Newtonian dynamics. In this case, the hot central "core" of particles expands and collides with the cold surrounding material, creating a transient radially-expanding "compression wave," which is rapidly dissipated by particle-particle collisions and interaction with periodic images at the boundary, leading to a rapid relaxation to equilibrium. Secondly, we consider a rapid compression of the spheres into a disordered glassy state at high densities. Such rapidly compressed systems exhibit very slow structural relaxation times, many orders of magnitude longer than thermalization times for simple temperature inhomogeneities. We find that thermal relaxation of the velocity distribution is determined simply by the total collision rate, whereas structural relaxation requires coordinated collective motion, which is strongly suppressed at high density, although some particle rearrangement nevertheless occurs. We further find that collisions propagate significantly faster through glassy systems than through crystalline systems at the same density, which leads to very rapid relaxation of velocity perturbations, although structural relaxation remains very slow. These results extend the validity of previous observations that glassy systems exhibit a hybrid character, sharing features with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we introduce the hard sphere causal graph, a network-based characterization of the dynamical history of a hard sphere system, which encapsulates several useful...</description>

      <title>Flow Matching at Scale: A Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Large-Size Sampling of Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability offers a powerful and efficient alternative for studying critical phenomena. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a powerful proposal generator in a hybrid scheme with MCMC, dramatically accelerating high-precision studies of the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple modeling of the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a single impurity or resource site where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around the resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process by the walker. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in these models. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solutions are the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and they are linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are interspersed with intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence forgetting can allow the walker to save memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.</description>

      <title>Deep Variational Multivariate Information Bottleneck -- A Framework for Variational Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.03311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational dimensionality reduction methods are widely used for their accuracy, generative capabilities, and robustness. We introduce a unifying framework that generalizes both such as traditional and state-of-the-art methods. The framework is based on an interpretation of the multivariate information bottleneck, trading off the information preserved in an encoder graph (defining what to compress) against that in a decoder graph (defining a generative model for data). Using this approach, we rederive existing methods, including the deep variational information bottleneck, variational autoencoders, and deep multiview information bottleneck. We naturally extend the deep variational CCA (DVCCA) family to beta-DVCCA and introduce a new method, the deep variational symmetric information bottleneck (DVSIB). DSIB, the deterministic limit of DVSIB, connects to modern contrastive learning approaches such as Barlow Twins, among others. We evaluate these methods on Noisy MNIST and Noisy CIFAR-100, showing that algorithms better matched to the structure of the problem like DVSIB and beta-DVCCA produce better latent spaces as measured by classification accuracy, dimensionality of the latent variables, sample efficiency, and consistently outperform other approaches under comparable conditions. Additionally, we benchmark against state-of-the-art models, achieving superior or competitive accuracy. Our results demonstrate that this framework can seamlessly incorporate diverse multi-view representation learning algorithms, providing a foundation for designing novel, problem-specific loss functions.</description>

      <title>Propp's benzels and Lai's nearly symmetric hexagons with holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18419v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a new version of the second author's factorization theorem for perfect matchings of symmetric graphs. We then use our result to solve four open problems of Propp on the enumeration of trimer tilings on the hexagonal lattice.
  As another application, we obtain a semi-factorization result for the number of lozenge tilings of a large class of hexagonal regions with holes (obtained by starting with an arbitrary symmetric hexagon with holes, and translating all the holes one unit lattice segment in the same direction). This in turn leads to the solution of two open problems posed by Lai and to an extension of a result due to Fulmek and Krattenthaler, which results in exact enumeration formulas for some new families of hexagonal regions with holes.
  Our result also allows us to find new, simpler proofs (and in one case, a new, simpler form) of some formulas due to Krattenthaler for the number of perfect matchings of Aztec rectangles with unit holes along a lattice diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a novel paradigm for conformal defects with continuously adjustable dimensions. Just as the standard $\varepsilon$ expansion interpolates between integer spacetime dimensions, a new parameter, $\delta$, is used to interpolate between different integer-dimensional defects. The ensuing framework is explored in detail for defects of dimension $p=2+\delta$ in both free and interacting $O(N)$ bulk conformal field theories (CFTs) in $d=4-\varepsilon$. Comprehensive calculations are performed to first and second order in $\varepsilon$ and to high or all orders in $\delta$. Additionally, in the large-$N$ limit, the interpolation between defects of dimensions $p=1$ and $p=2$ is analysed for spacetime dimensions $4\leq d\leq 6$. The new parameter $\delta$ provides a natural enrichment of the space of defect CFTs and allows to find new integer dimension or co-dimension defects.</description>

      <title>Periodic revivals from supersymmetry in a fermionic kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of dynamically constrained lattice fermion models. We here illustrate how supersymmetry can be used to construct a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model, inheriting its integrability. The supersymmetric algebra additionally implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic effective model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model. While we focus on a concrete model, our proposed approach is applicable to more general supersymmetric algebras, where it is expected to lead to non-ergodic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Principled model selection for stochastic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex dynamical systems, from macromolecules to ecosystems, are often modeled by stochastic differential equations. To learn such models from data, a common approach involves sparse selection among a large function library. However, we show that overfitting arises not just from individual model complexity, but also from the combinatorial growth of possible models. To address this, we introduce Parsimonious Stochastic Inference (PASTIS), a principled method combining likelihood-estimation statistics with extreme value theory to suppress superfluous parameters. PASTIS outperforms existing methods and reliably identifies minimal models, even with low sampling rates or measurement error. It extends to stochastic partial differential equations, and applies to ecological networks and reaction-diffusion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Slip-flow theory for thermo-osmosis based on a kinetic model with near-wall potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, thermal-slip coefficients in slip boundary conditions of the Stokes equation are derived using the generalized slip-flow theory, with special interest in the role of near-wall potential in micro- and nanoscale flows. As the model of fluids and fluid-solid interaction, we employ the model Boltzmann equation for dilute gases and the diffuse-reflection boundaries with near-wall potential, respectively. It is found that, when the mean free path of gas molecules and the effective range of potential are of the same order of magnitude, the thermal-slip boundary condition can be derived in the near-continuum limit. In the derived slip-flow theory, the thermal-slip coefficient and the boundary-layer corrections (i.e., Knudsen-layer corrections) are determined by solving the kinetic boundary-layer problems (i.e., Knudsen-layer problems) that include external-force terms and inhomogeneous terms both driven by the potential. As an application of the slip-flow theory, thermo-osmosis between two parallel plates with uniform temperature gradients is analyzed. The results of the slip-flow theory are validated by comparing them with those of the direct numerical analysis of the same problem. Furthermore, it is found that thermo-osmosis and thermal slip on the plates are significantly affected by the features of the near-wall potential; even the gas-flow direction can be reversed when the near-wall potential is repulsive. Such a flow reversal is qualitatively similar to thermo-osmosis in liquids reported in existing molecular dynamics simulation.</description>

      <title>Variational simulation of quantum phase transitions induced by boundary fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occurring in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural networks storing multiple discrete attractors are canonical models of biological memory. Previously, the dynamical stability of such networks could only be guaranteed under highly restrictive conditions. Here, we derive a theory of the local stability of discrete fixed points in a broad class of networks with graded neural activities and in the presence of noise. By directly analyzing the bulk and outliers of the Jacobian spectrum, we show that all fixed points are stable below a critical load that is distinct from the classical \textit{critical capacity} and depends on the statistics of neural activities in the fixed points as well as the single-neuron activation function. Our analysis highlights the computational benefits of threshold-linear activation and sparse-like patterns.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free-energy differences from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using flow-based generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating the dissipation along an alchemical switching process in terms of a nonadiabatic force field that can be learned through stochastic flow matching. The learned field can be used in conjunction with short-time trajectory data to evaluate upper and lower bounds on the alchemical free energy that variationally converge to the exact value if the field is optimal. Applying the method to evaluate the alchemical free energy of atomistic models shows that it can substantially reduce the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at negligible loss of accuracy when compared with thermodynamic integration.</description>

      <title>Percolation transition in entangled granular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00216v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Highly nonconvex granular particles, such as staples and metal shavings, can form solid-like cohesive structures through geometric entanglement (interlocking). The network structure formed by this entanglement, however, remains largely unexplored. Here we utilize network science to investigate the entanglement networks of C-shaped granular particles under vibration through experiments and simulations. By analyzing key network properties, we demonstrate that these networks undergo a percolation transition as the number of links increases logarithmically over time; the entangled particles form a giant cluster when the number of links exceeds a critical threshold. We propose a continuum percolation model of rings that effectively describes the observed transition. Additionally, we find that particle's opening angle significantly affects mechanical bonding and, consequently, the network structure. This work highlights the potential of network-based approaches to study entangled materials, paving the way for advancements in applications ranging from mechanical metamaterials to entangled robot swarms.</description>
