      <title>Design of A* based heuristic algorithm for efficient interdiction in multi-Layer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercepting a criminal using limited police resources presents a significant challenge in dynamic crime environments, where the criminal's location continuously changes over time. The complexity is further heightened by the vastness of the transportation network. To tackle this problem, we propose a layered graph representation, in which each time step is associated with a duplicate of the transportation network. For any given set of attacker strategies, a near-optimal defender strategy is computed using the A-Star heuristic algorithm applied to the layered graph. The defender's goal is to maximize the probability of successful interdiction. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method by comparing it with a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach used for the defender. The comparison considers both computational efficiency and solution quality. The results demonstrate that our approach effectively addresses the complexity of the problem and delivers high-quality solutions within a short computation time.</description>

      <title>Inference of Hierarchical Core-Periphery Structure in Temporal Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks can have various types of mesoscale structures. One type of mesoscale structure in networks is core-periphery structure, which consists of densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected peripheral nodes. The core nodes are connected densely to each other and can be connected to the peripheral nodes, which are connected sparsely to other nodes. There has been much research on core-periphery structure in time-independent networks, but few core-periphery detection methods have been developed for time-dependent (i.e., ``temporal") networks. Using a multilayer-network representation of temporal networks and an inference approach that employs stochastic block models, we generalize a recent method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure \cite{Polanco23} from time-independent networks to temporal networks. In contrast to ``onion-like'' nested core-periphery structures (where each node is assigned to a group according to how deeply it is nested in a network's core), hierarchical core-periphery structures encompass networks with nested structures, tree-like structures (where any two groups must either be disjoint or have one as a strict subset of the other), and general non-nested mesoscale structures (where the group assignments of nodes do not have to be nested in any way). To perform statistical inference and thereby identify core-periphery structure, we use a Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. We illustrate our method for detecting hierarchical core-periphery structure in two real-world temporal networks, and we briefly discuss the structures that we identify in these networks.</description>

      <title>GRAIL: A Benchmark for GRaph ActIve Learning in Dynamic Sensing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based Active Learning (AL) leverages the structure of graphs to efficiently prioritize label queries, reducing labeling costs and user burden in applications like health monitoring, human behavior analysis, and sensor networks. By identifying strategically positioned nodes, graph AL minimizes data collection demands while maintaining model performance, making it a valuable tool for dynamic environments. Despite its potential, existing graph AL methods are often evaluated on static graph datasets and primarily focus on prediction accuracy, neglecting user-centric considerations such as sampling diversity, query fairness, and adaptability to dynamic settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce GRAIL, a novel benchmarking framework designed to evaluate graph AL strategies in dynamic, real-world environments. GRAIL introduces novel metrics to assess sustained effectiveness, diversity, and user burden, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of AL methods under varying conditions. Extensive experiments on datasets featuring dynamic, real-life human sensor data reveal trade-offs between prediction performance and user burden, highlighting limitations in existing AL strategies. GRAIL demonstrates the importance of balancing node importance, query diversity, and network topology, providing an evaluation mechanism for graph AL solutions in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Comparing name generator designs in rural panel studies: analyzing alter retention and change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conducted a two-wave personal network study in a rural Romanian community, interviewing the same participants (n = 68) using two name generators. Wave 1 employed a fixed-choice generator (n = 25) focused on emotional closeness; Wave 2 used a free-choice generator based on frequent interaction. We compared tie characteristics and assessed retention across waves. Alters who were kin, co-residents, or emotionally close were more likely to be retained, regardless of generator type. These findings underscore the role of relational attributes in personal network stability and highlight design considerations for network studies in resource-limited, culturally distinct settings.</description>

      <title>Fast nonparametric inference of network backbones for weighted graph sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network backbones provide useful sparse representations of weighted networks by keeping only their most important links, permitting a range of computational speedups and simplifying network visualizations. A key limitation of existing network backboning methods is that they either require the specification of a free parameter (e.g. significance level) that determines the number of edges to keep in the backbone, or impose specific restrictions on the topology of the backbone (e.g. that it is a spanning tree). Here we develop a completely nonparametric framework for inferring the backbone of a weighted network that overcomes these limitations and automatically selects the optimal set of edges to retain using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle. We develop objective functions for global and local network backboning which evaluate the importance of an edge in the context of the whole network and individual node neighborhoods respectively and are generalizable to any weight distribution under Bayesian model specifications that fix the average edge weight either exactly or in expectation. We then construct an efficient and provably optimal greedy algorithm to identify the backbone minimizing our objectives, whose runtime complexity is log-linear in the number of edges. We demonstrate our methods by comparing them with existing methods in a range of tasks on real and synthetic networks, finding that both the global and local backboning methods can preserve network connectivity, weight heterogeneity, and spreading dynamics while removing a substantial fraction of edges.</description>

      <title>Learning hidden cascades via classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11228v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spreading dynamics in social networks are often studied under the assumption that individuals' statuses, whether informed or infected, are fully observable. However, in many real-world situations, such statuses remain unobservable, which is crucial for determining an individual's potential to further spread the infection. While this final status is hidden, intermediate indicators such as symptoms of infection are observable and provide important insights into the spread process. We propose a partial observability-aware Machine Learning framework to learn the characteristics of the spreading model. We term the method Distribution Classification, which utilizes the power of classifiers to infer the underlying transmission dynamics. We evaluate our method on two types of synthetic networks and extend the study to a real-world insider trading network. Results show that the method performs well, especially on complex networks with high cyclic connectivity, supporting its utility in analyzing real-world spreading phenomena where direct observation of individual statuses is not possible.</description>
