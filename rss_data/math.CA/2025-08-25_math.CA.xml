      <title>Measurable solutions of an alternative functional equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the functional equation \[ \varphi \left( \frac{x+y}{2} \right) \left( \psi_1(x) - \psi_2(y) \right) = 0 \hspace{20mm} \left( \mbox{ for all } x \in I_1 \mbox{ and } y \in I_2 \right) \] where $ I_1 \,, I_2 $ are open intervals of $ \mathbb{R} $, $ J = \frac{1}{2} \left( I_1 + I_2 \right) $ moreover $ \psi_1 : I_1 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $, $ \psi_2 : I_2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ and $ \varphi : J \rightarrow \mathbb{R} $ are unknown functions. We describe the structure of the possible solutions assuming that $ \varphi $ is measurable. In the case when $ \varphi $ is a derivative, we give a complete characterization of the solutions. Furthermore, we present an example of a solution consisting of irregular Darboux functions. This provides the answer to an open problem proposed during the 59th International Symposium on Functional Equations.</description>

      <title>A variation norm Carleson theorem in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Carleson-Hunt theorem gives pointwise almost everywhere convergence for the Fourier series of a function in $L^p(\mathbb T)$. R. Oberlin, A. Seeger, T. Tao, C. Thiele and J. Wright (OSTTW) strengthened this theorem by proving $L^p$ estimates for the $r$-variation of the partial sum operators for Fourier series. Also, C. Fefferman gave an extension of the theorem in higher dimensions by proving the maximal function bound for polygonal Fourier partial sums of functions in $L^p(\mathbb T^d)$. In this brief note, we observe that C. Fefferman's argument can be used, together with the OSTTW result, to establish variation norm bounds for the polygonal Fourier partial sums in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Generalized convexity of the Lambert $W$ function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the generalized convexity properties of the Lambert $W$ function, defined as the solution to $W(z)e^{W(z)}=z$. Focusing on $H_{p,q}$-convexity and concavity with respect to H\"older means, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for $W$ to exhibit strict $H_{p,q}$-convexity or concavity on the interval $(0,+\infty)$. The main result characterizes these properties in terms of specific parameter regions $(p,q)$-plane. Inequalities involving harmonic, geometric, and arithmetic means are established, with equalities holding only when $x=y$.</description>

      <title>Fractional series operators on $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $0 \leq \alpha &lt; n$ and $m \in \mathbb{N} \cap (1 - \frac{\alpha}{n}, \, \infty)$, we introduce a class of fractional series operators $T_{\alpha, m}$ defined on $\mathbb{Z}^n$ which are generated by certain $m$-invertible matrices with integer coefficients. In this note, we prove that $T_{\alpha, m}$ is a bounded operator $H^p(\mathbb{Z}^n) \to \ell^q(\mathbb{Z}^n)$ for $0 &lt; p &lt; \frac{n}{\alpha}$ and $\frac{1}{q} = \frac{1}{p} - \frac{\alpha}{n}$. This generalizes the results obtained by the author in [Acta Math. Hungar., 168 (1) (2022), 202-216].</description>

      <title>Quantitative homogenization of first-order ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the quantitative homogenization of first-order ODEs. For single-scale scalar ODEs, we obtain a sharp $O(\varepsilon)$ convergence rate and characterize the effective constant. In the multi-scale setting, our results match those of \cite{IM} for long times but improve the short-time error to $O(\varepsilon)$. We also initiate the study of quasi-periodic homogenization in this context. The scalar framework is further extended to higher dimensions under a boundedness assumption on trajectories. For weakly coupled systems with fast switching rates, we obtain for the first time a convergence rate of order $O(\varepsilon)$. These results have applications to linear transport equations and broader connections to PDEs and gradient systems.</description>

      <title>Curved Kakeya sets for generic phases in odd dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for each odd integer $n\ge 3$, there is an open dense subset of H\"ormander phase functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$ for which the associated curved Kakeya sets have Hausdorff dimension at least $\frac{n+1}{2} + d_n$ for some positive $d_n$, thereby exceeding the classical compression threshold. In particular, in $\mathbb{R}^3$, generic H\"ormander phases induce curved Kakeya sets of dimension at least $2 + \tfrac17$. As an application, on a generic three-dimensional Riemannian manifold, every geodesic Nikodym set has Hausdorff dimension at least $2 + \tfrac17$. We achieve these results by generalizing the finite contact order condition from Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang, originally developed in $\mathbb{R}^3$, to arbitrary dimensions. Our bounds are stronger than those of Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang even in $\mathbb{R}^3$, since we derive curved Kakeya estimates directly via the polynomial method. Moreover, for H\"ormander-type oscillatory integral operators with positive-definite phases of finite contact order, we obtain quantitative improvements in all odd dimensions over the bounds of Guth--Hickman--Iliopoulou, while in three dimensions our oscillatory integral estimate exactly matches the result of Dai--Gong--Guo--Zhang.</description>

      <title>Weak $(1,1)$ estimate for maximal truncated rough singular integral operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In their seminal work (Amer. J. Math. 78: 289-309, 1956), Calder\'on and Zygmund introduced the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator and established its $L^p$-boundedness for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$. However, the endpoint case $p = 1$ remained an open problem. This paper resolves this problem. More precisely, we prove that the maximal truncated rough singular integral operator is of weak type $(1,1)$.</description>

      <title>Extremizers of a Fourier uncertainty principle related to averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the uncertainty principle
  $$\lVert\widehat{\mu}(\xi) |\xi|^\beta\rVert_\infty^{\alpha}
  \left(\int |x|^\alpha d \mu\right)^{\beta} \geq C(\alpha,\beta,d){\lVert{\mu}\rVert_{TV}^{\alpha+\beta}}$$ for finite non-negative measures on $\mathbb{R}^d $. We prove that $C(\alpha,\beta,d)&gt;0$ for all $\alpha,\beta&gt;0$ and that extremizers exist. Moreover, we obtain an abstract characterization of the extremizers, which allows us to describe their asymptotic behavior and, for certain parameter values, to determine them explicitly.</description>

      <title>Polynomial perturbations of Euler's and Clausen's identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A product of two hypergeometric series is generally not hypergeometric. However, there are a few cases when such product does reduce to a single hypergeometric series. The oldest result of this type, beyond the obvious $(1-x)^{a}(1-x)^{b}=(1-x)^{a+b}$, is Euler's transformation for the Gauss hypergeometric function ${}_2F_1$. Another important one is the celebrated Clausen's identity dated 1828 which expresses the square of a suitable ${}_2F_1$ function as a single ${}_3F_2$. By equating coefficients each product identity corresponds to a special type of summation theorem for terminating series. Over the last two decades Euler's transformations and many summation theorems have been extended by introducing additional parameter pairs differing by positive integers. This amounts to multiplication of the power series coefficients by values of a fixed polynomial at nonnegative integers. The main goal of this paper is to present an extension of Clausen's identity obtained by such polynomial perturbation. To this end, we first reconsider the polynomial perturbations of Euler's transformations found by Miller and Paris around 2010. We propose new, simplified proofs of their transformations relating them to polynomial interpolation and exhibiting various new forms of the characteristic polynomials. We further introduce the notion of the Miller-Paris operators which play a prominent role in the construction of the extended Clausen's identity.</description>

      <title>On some examples and counterexamples about weighted Lagrange interpolation with Exponential and Hermite weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Bernstein conjecture about optimal node systems of classical polynomial Lagrange interpolation, standing unresolved for over half a century, was solved by T. Kilgore in 1978. Immediately following him, also the additional conjecture of Erd\H{o}s was solved by deBoor and Pinkus. These breakthrough achievements were built on a fundamental auxiliary result on nonsingularity of derivative (Jacobian) matrices of certain interval maxima in function of the nodes. After the above breakthrough, a considerable effort was made to extend the results to the case of at least certain restricted classes of functions and Chebyshev-Haar subspaces. Here, we analyse, in what extent the key auxiliary statement remains true in case of exponentially weighted interpolation on the halfline, or with Hermite weights on the full real line. It turns out that carrying through this nonsingularity statement is impossible: counterexamples demonstrate that the respective derivative matrices may as well be singular. It remains to further study if the fundamental Bernstein- and Erd\H{o}s characterizations remain valid. The Chebyshev--Haar system of weighted polynomials with Laguerre weigth adjoined with constant functions and the corresponding interpolation were previously studied, as well. Some hints were also mentioned for he proof of Bernstein and Erd\H{o}s conjectures. Our aim is to present in detail the proof of all the auxiliary results needed in the new setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We improve the best known lower bound for the dimension of radial projections of sets in the plane. We show that if $X,Y$ are Borel sets in $\R^2$, $X$ is not contained in any line and $\dim_H(X)&gt;0$, then
  $$\sup\limits_{x\in X} \dim_H(\pi_x Y) \geq \min\left\{(\dim_H(Y) + \dim_H(X))/2, \dim_H(Y), 1\right\},$$ where $\pi_x Y$ is the radial projection of the set $Y$ from the point $x$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the packing dimension of unions of subsets of $k$-planes in $\mathbb{R}^n$ using tools from algorithmic information theory, obtaining an analog of a result of H\'era and a mild generalization of a recent result of Fraser. Along the way, we introduce a notion of effective dimension on the Grassmannian and affine Grassmannian, and we establish several useful algorithmic and geometric tools in this setting. Additionally, we consider how the packing dimension of the union of certain subsets of $k$-planes changes when the subsets are extended to the entire $k$-plane. Finally, we improve the above bounds for unions and extensions in the special case that $k=n-1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A random ensemble of cusp forms for the full modular group is introduced. For a weight-$k$ cusp form, restricted to a compact subdomain of the modular surface, the true order of magnitude of its expected supremum is determined to be $\asymp \sqrt{\log{k}}$, in line with the conjectured bounds. Additionally, the exponential concentration of the supremum around its median is established. Contrary to the compact case, it is shown that the global expected supremum, which is attained around the cusp, grows like $k^{1/4}$, up to a logarithmic factor.</description>

      <title>Integer-valued polynomials satisfying growth constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider polynomials which take integer values on the integers (IVPs), and satisfy an additional growth condition on the natural numbers. Elkies and Speyer, answering a question by Dimitrov, showed there is a critical exponential growth threshold, such that there are infinitely many IVPs with growth above the threshold and finitely many IVPs below that threshold (of arbitrary degree). In this paper, we give more refined estimates for the number of IVPs having exponential growth thresholds. In addition, we consider a similar problem, where there is a (not necessarily symmetric) growth condition on the integers. Notably, the critical threshold is determined by the logarithmic capacity of an explicit domain.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Gauge Caratheodory Measure Bridging Lebesgue Volume and Surface Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a one-parameter family of Borel regular measures on $\mathbb{R}^n$ that enhances Lebesgue measure by incorporating a scale-invariant penalty for codimension-1 boundary structures. Utilizing Carath\'eodory's outer measure construction with the mixed gauge $h_\lambda(r) = r^n + \lambda r^{n-1}$ for $\lambda &gt; 0$, the resulting measure $\mu_\lambda$ seamlessly combines $n$-dimensional volume with $(n-1)$-dimensional surface contributions in a single $\sigma$-additive framework. Key results include: (i) $\mu_\lambda$ is a metric outer measure, with all Borel sets measurable and Borel regular; (ii) the scaling property $\mu_\lambda(tE) = t^n \mu_{\lambda/t}(E)$ for $t &gt; 0$; (iii) quantitative comparability for bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega$, where dimensional constants $c_n, C_n &gt; 0$ satisfy $c_n (|\Omega| + \lambda \mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\partial \Omega)) \leq \mu_\lambda(\Omega) \leq C_n (|\Omega| + \lambda \mathcal{H}^{n-1}(\partial \Omega))$, directly relating $\mu_\lambda$ to perimeter. This addresses Lebesgue measure's oversight of boundary complexity while preserving compatibility with the Carath\'eodory-Hausdorff paradigm. Potential applications span robust numerical integration on irregular domains, perimeter-regularized functionals in image and shape processing, and boundary-aware probabilistic modeling. Examples are provided in $\mathbb{R}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2$, alongside links to Minkowski content and sets of finite perimeter. Open problems encompass optimal constants, coarea formulas in BV spaces, and extensions to rectifiable sets.</description>

      <title>A Littlewood-Paley approach to the Mittag-Leffler function in the frequency space and applications to nonlocal problems</title>

Abstract: Let $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$, $\beta&gt;0$ and $\alpha/2&lt;|s|\leq 1$. In a previous work, we obtained all possible values of the Lebesgue exponent $p=p(\gamma)$ for which the Fourier transform of $ E_{\alpha,\beta}(e^{\dot{\imath}\pi s} |\cdot|^{\gamma} )$ is an $L^{p}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ function, when $\gamma&gt;(d-1)/2$. We recover the more interesting lower regularity case $0&lt;\gamma\leq (d-1)/2$, using tools from the Littlewood-Paley theory. This question arises in the analysis of certain space-time fractional diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger problems and has been solved for the particular cases $\alpha\in (0,1)$, $\beta=\alpha,1$, and $s=-1/2,1$ via asymptotic analysis of Fox $H$-functions. The Littlewood-Paley theory provides a simpler proof that allows considering all values of $\beta,\gamma&gt;0$ and $s\in (-1,1]\setminus [-\alpha/2,\alpha/2]$. This enabled us to prove various key estimates for a general class of nonlocal space-time problems.</description>

      <title>On an entropy inequality for quadratic forms and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Frostman conditions for bivariate random variables and study discretized entropy sum-product phenomena in both independent and dependent regimes.
  In the independent setting, we show that for any non-degenerate rational quadratic form $\phi(x,y)$ and $0&lt;s&lt;1$, there exists some positive constant $\epsilon = \epsilon(\phi,s)$ such that any independent marginally $(s,C;s,C)$-Frostman random variable $(X,Y)$ satisfies
  $$\max\left\{H_n(X+Y),\,H_n(\phi(X,Y))\right\} \ge n(s+\epsilon)$$ for sufficiently large $n$. The proof introduces a novel multi-step entropy framework, combining the submodularity formula, the discretized entropy Balog-Szemer\'{e}di-Gowers theorem, and state-of-the-art results on the Falconer distance problem, to reduce general forms to a diagonal core case.
  In the dependent setting, we obtain analogous bounds for special polynomials. As an application, we derive that there exists $\epsilon=\epsilon(s)&gt;0$ such that, for any $\delta$-separated set $A\subset [0, 1]$ of cardinality $\delta^{-s}$ satisfying some non-concentration condition and any subset $G\subseteq A\times A$ with $|G|\geq \delta^\epsilon |A|^2$, the $\delta$-covering numbers satisfy $$ E_\delta(A+_GA) + E_\delta(\alpha \cdot A^{\wedge 2}+_G \beta\cdot A^{\wedge 2}) \gg_{\alpha,\beta,s} C^{-O_s(1)}\delta^{-\epsilon}|A|, $$ whenever $\delta$ is small enough.</description>

      <title>Convergence order of the quantization error for self-affine measures on Lalley-Gatzouras carpets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06875v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E$ be a Lalley-Gatzouras carpet determined by a set of contractive affine mappings $\{f_{ij}\}_{(i,j)\in G}$. We study the asymptotics of quantization error for the self-affine measures $\mu$ on $E$. We prove that the upper and lower quantization coefficient for $\mu$ are both bounded away from zero and infinity in the exact quantization dimension. This significantly generalizes the previous work concerning the quantization for self-affine measures on Bedford-McMullen carpets. The new ingredients lie in the method to bound the quantization error for $\mu$ from below and that to construct auxiliary measures by applying Prohorov's theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.02741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous papers, we tried to analyze the complete loop counting functions that count all the loops in an infinite random walk represented by digits of a real number. In this paper, the consideration will be restricted to the partial loop counting functions $V$ that count the returns to the origin only. This simplification allows us to find closed-form expressions for various integrals related to $V$. Some applications to the complete loop counting functions, in particular, their connections with Bernoulli polynomials, are also provided.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems and applications</title>

Abstract: This paper provides a practical approach to stochastic Lie systems, i.e. stochastic differential equations whose general solutions can be written as a function depending only on a generic family of particular solutions and some constants related to initial conditions. We correct the stochastic Lie theorem characterising stochastic Lie systems, proving that, contrary to previous claims, it retains its classical form in the Stratonovich approach. Meanwhile, we show that the form of stochastic Lie systems may significantly differ from the classical one in the It\^{o} formalism. New generalisations of stochastic Lie systems, like the so-called stochastic foliated Lie systems, are introduced. Subsequently, we focus on stochastic Lie systems that are Hamiltonian systems relative to different geometric structures. Special attention is paid to the symplectic case. We study their stability properties and lay the foundations of a stochastic energy-momentum method. A stochastic Poisson coalgebra method is developed to derive superposition rules for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. Potential applications of our results are presented for biological stochastic models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Lotka--Volterra systems, Palomba--Goodwin models, among others. Our findings complement previous approaches by using stochastic differential equations instead of deterministic equations designed to capture some of the features of models of stochastic nature.</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Independence of a Set of Generalized Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12123v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577215\ldots$, nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$, is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)})$ based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set $\{\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e\}_{n\geq0}$, and thus the transcendence of $\gamma^{\left(n\right)}+\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e$ for all $n\geq0$. This further implies the disjunctive transcendence of both pairs $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)}/e)$ and $(\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)})$ for all $n\geq1$.</description>
