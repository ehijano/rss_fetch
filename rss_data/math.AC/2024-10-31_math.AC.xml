      <title>A Geometric description of almost Gorensteinness for two-dimensional normal singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an excellent two-dimensional normal local ring containing an algebraically closed field. Then $A$ is called an elliptic singularity if $p_f(A)=1$, where $p_f$ denotes the fundamental genus. On the other hand, the concept of almost Gorenstein rings was introduced by Barucci and Fr\"oberg for one-dimensional local rings and generalized by Goto, Takahashi and Taniguchi to higher dimension. In this paper, we describe almost Gorenstein rings in geometric language using resolution of singularities and give criterions to be almost Gorenstein. In particular, we show that elliptic singularities are almost Gorenstein. Also, for every integer $g\ge 2$, we provide examples of singularities that is almost Gorenstein (resp. not almost Gorenstein) with $p_f(A)=g$. We also provide several examples of determinantal singularities associated with $2\times 3$ matrices, which include both almost Gorenstein singularities and non-almost Gorenstein singularities.</description>

      <title>Limits of saturated ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the question whether a given homogeneous ideal is a limit of saturated ones. We provide cohomological necessary criteria for this to hold and apply them to a range of examples. Our motivation comes from the theory of border apolarity and varieties of sums of powers, where the question above is tightly connected to proving new lower bounds for border ranks of tensors.</description>

      <title>Minimal cellular resolutions of powers of matching field ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10729v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a family of monomial ideals, called block diagonal matching field ideals, which arise as monomial Gr\"obner degenerations of determinantal ideals. Our focus is on the minimal free resolutions of these ideals and all of their powers. Initially, we establish their linear quotient property and compute their Betti numbers, illustrating that their minimal free resolution is supported on a regular CW complex. Our proof relies on the results of Herzog and Takayama, demonstrating that ideals with a linear quotient property have a minimal free resolution, and on the construction by Dochtermann and Mohammadi of cellular realizations of these resolutions. We begin by proving the linear quotient property for each power of such an ideal. Subsequently, we show that their corresponding decomposition map is regular, resulting in a minimal cellular resolution. Finally, we demonstrate that distinct decomposition maps lead to different cellular complexes with the same face numbers.</description>

      <title>New versions of Frobenius and integral closure of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we define two new versions of integral and Frobenius closures of ideals which incorporate an auxiliary ideal and a real parameter. These additional ingredients are common in adjusting old definitions of ideal closures in order to generalize them to pairs, with an eye towards further applications in algebraic geometry. In the case of tight closure, similar generalizations exist due to N. Hara and K.I. Yoshida, as well as A. Vraciu. We study their basic properties and give computationally effective calculations of the adjusted tight, Frobenius, and integral closures in the case of affine semigroup rings in terms of the convex geometry of the associated exponent sets.</description>

      <title>The stabilized bounded N-derived category of an exact category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Buchweitz related the singularity category of a (strongly) Gorenstein ring and the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules by a triangle equivalence. We phrase his result in a relative categorical setting based on N-complexes instead of classical 2-complexes. The role of Cohen-Macaulay modules is played by chains of monics in a Frobenius subcategory of an exact category. As a byproduct, we provide foundational results on derived categories of N-complexes over exact categories known from the Abelian case or for 2-complexes.</description>

      <title>Solvable and Nilpotent Matroids: Realizability and Irreducible Decomposition of Their Associated Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the families of solvable and nilpotent matroids, examining their realization spaces, closures, and associated matroid and circuit varieties. We establish sufficient conditions for both the realizability of these matroids and the irreducibility of their associated varieties. Additionally, we analyze the defining polynomial equations of these varieties using Grassmann-Cayley algebra and geometric liftability techniques. For several families within these matroid types, we provide a complete set of defining equations for matroid varieties, or equivalently, a finite generating set for their associated matroid ideals. This includes forest configurations, and a subfamily of nilpotent matroids, called weak nilpotent matroids, which may have arbitrary rank.</description>
