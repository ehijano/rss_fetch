      <title>Particle Scattering and Fusion for the Ablowitz-Ladik Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Ablowitz-Ladik chain is an integrable discretized version of the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. We report on a novel underlying Hamiltonian particle system with properties similar to the ones known for the classical Toda chain and Calogero fluid with $1/\sinh^2$ pair interaction. Boundary conditions are imposed such that, both in the distant past and future, particles have a constant velocity. We establish the many-particle scattering for the Ablowitz-Ladik chain and obtain properties known for generic integrable many-body systems. For a specific choice of the chain, real initial data remain real in the course of time. Then, asymptotically, particles move in pairs with a velocity-dependent size and scattering shifts are governed by the fusion rule.</description>

      <title>New cluster algebras from old: integrability beyond Zamolodchikov periodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00721</link>

Abstract: We consider discrete dynamical systems obtained as deformations of mutations in cluster algebras associated with finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras. The original (undeformed) dynamical systems provide the simplest examples of Zamolodchikov periodicity: they are affine birational maps for which every orbit is periodic with the same period. Following on from preliminary work by one of us with Kouloukas, here we present integrable maps obtained from deformations of cluster mutations related to the following simple root systems: $A_3$, $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$. We further show how new cluster algebras arise, by considering Laurentification, that is, a lifting to a higher-dimensional map expressed in a set of new variables (tau functions), for which the dynamics exhibits the Laurent property. For the integrable map obtained by deformation of type $A_3$, which already appeared in our previous work, we show that there is a commuting map of Quispel-Roberts-Thompson (QRT) type which is built from a composition of mutations and a permutation applied to the same cluster algebra of rank 6, with an additional 2 frozen variables. Furthermore, both the deformed $A_3$ map and the QRT map correspond to addition of a point in the Mordell-Weil group of a rational elliptic surface of rank two, and the underlying cluster algebra comes from a quiver that mutation equivalent to the $q$-Painlev\'e III quiver found by Okubo. The deformed integrable maps of types $B_2$, $B_3$ and $D_4$ are also related to elliptic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Simplifications of Lax pairs for differential-difference equations by gauge transformations and (doubly) modified integrable equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix differential-difference Lax pairs play an essential role in the theory of integrable nonlinear differential-difference equations. We present sufficient conditions for the possibility to simplify such a Lax pair by matrix gauge transformations. Furthermore, we describe a procedure for such a simplification and present applications of it to constructing new integrable equations connected by (non-invertible) discrete substitutions to known equations with Lax pairs.
  Suppose that one has three (possibly multicomponent) equations $E$, $E_1$, $E_2$, a discrete substitution from $E_1$ to $E$, and a discrete substitution from $E_2$ to $E_1$. Then $E_1$ and $E_2$ can be called a modified version of $E$ and a doubly modified version of $E$, respectively. We demonstrate how the above-mentioned procedure helps (in the considered examples) to construct modified and doubly modified versions of a given equation possessing a Lax pair satisfying certain conditions.
  The considered examples include scalar equations of Itoh-Narita-Bogoyavlensky type and $2$-component equations related to the Toda lattice. Several new integrable equations and discrete substitutions are presented.</description>
