      <title>A high-order regularized delta-Chebyshev method for computing spectral densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method for computing spectral densities, and apply it to the evaluation of the local density of states (LDOS) of sparse Hamiltonians derived from tight-binding models. The approach, which we call the high-order delta-Chebyshev method, can be viewed as a variant of the popular regularized Chebyshev kernel polynomial method (KPM), but it uses a high-order accurate approximation of the $\delta$-function to achieve rapid convergence to the thermodynamic limit for smooth spectral densities. The costly computational steps are identical to those for KPM, with high-order accuracy achieved by an inexpensive post-processing procedure. We apply the algorithm to tight-binding models of graphene and twisted bilayer graphene, demonstrating high-order convergence to the LDOS at non-singular points.</description>

      <title>Consistent Projection of Langevin Dynamics: Preserving Thermodynamics and Kinetics in Coarse-Grained Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coarse graining (CG) is an important task for efficient modeling and simulation of complex multi-scale systems, such as the conformational dynamics of biomolecules. This work presents a projection-based coarse-graining formalism for general underdamped Langevin dynamics. Following the Zwanzig projection approach, we derive a closed-form expression for the coarse grained dynamics. In addition, we show how the generator Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (gEDMD) method, which was developed in the context of Koopman operator methods, can be used to model the CG dynamics and evaluate its kinetic properties, such as transition timescales. Finally, we combine our approach with thermodynamic interpolation (TI), a generative approach to transform samples between thermodynamic conditions, to extend the scope of the approach across thermodynamic states without repeated numerical simulations. Using a two-dimensional model system, we demonstrate that the proposed method allows to accurately capture the thermodynamic and kinetic properties of the full-space model.</description>

      <title>Comparing time and frequency domain numerical methods with Born-Rytov approximations for far-field electromagnetic scattering from single biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Born-Rytov approximation estimates effective refractive index of biological cells from measurements of scattered light intensity, polarization and phase. Effective refractive index is useful for estimating a biological cell's dry mass, volume, and internal morphology directly from its elastic light scattering pattern. This work compares the Born-Rytov approximation with analytical, Yee-lattice finite-difference time-domain, and discrete-dipole approximations to Maxwell's equations in the cases of electromagnetic scattering from a sphere and a tomographic reconstruction of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Practical advantages and limitations of each numerical method are compared for modeling electromagnetic scattering of both near-field intensity and the far-field projected intensity, in terms of accuracy, memory, and compute time. When compared with a commercial software implementation of the Yee-lattice finite-difference time domain method, the Born-Rytov scattering approximation and discrete dipole approximation show better agreement with the far-field light scattering pattern from Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</description>

      <title>Refining Machine Learning Potentials through Thermodynamic Theory of Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundational Machine Learning Potentials can resolve the accuracy and transferability limitations of classical force fields. They enable microscopic insights into material behavior through Molecular Dynamics simulations, which can crucially expedite material design and discovery. However, insufficiently broad and systematically biased reference data affect the predictive quality of the learned models. Often, these models exhibit significant deviations from experimentally observed phase transition temperatures, in the order of several hundred kelvins. Thus, fine-tuning is necessary to achieve adequate accuracy in many practical problems. This work proposes a fine-tuning strategy via top-down learning, directly correcting the wrongly predicted transition temperatures to match the experimental reference data. Our approach leverages the Differentiable Trajectory Reweighting algorithm to minimize the free energy differences between phases at the experimental target pressures and temperatures. We demonstrate that our approach can accurately correct the phase diagram of pure Titanium in a pressure range of up to 5 GPa, matching the experimental reference within tenths of kelvins and improving the liquid-state diffusion constant. Our approach is model-agnostic, applicable to multi-component systems with solid-solid and solid-liquid transitions, and compliant with top-down training on other experimental properties. Therefore, our approach can serve as an essential step towards highly accurate application-specific and foundational machine learning potentials.</description>

      <title>Predicting parameters of a model cuprate superconductor using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational complexity of calculating phase diagrams for multi-parameter models significantly limits the ability to select parameters that correspond to experimental data. This work presents a machine learning method for solving the inverse problem - forecasting the parameters of a model Hamiltonian for a cuprate superconductor based on its phase diagram. A comparative study of three deep learning architectures was conducted: VGG, ResNet, and U-Net. The latter was adapted for regression tasks and demonstrated the best performance. Training the U-Net model was performed on an extensive dataset of phase diagrams calculated within the mean-field approximation, followed by validation on data obtained using a semi-classical heat bath algorithm for Monte Carlo simulations. It is shown that the model accurately predicts all considered Hamiltonian parameters, and areas of low prediction accuracy correspond to regions of parametric insensitivity in the phase diagrams. This allows for the extraction of physically interpretable patterns and validation of the significance of parameters for the system. The results confirm the promising potential of applying machine learning to analyze complex physical models in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Machine Learning for Steel Development: A Computational Framework and CCT Diagram Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for accelerating the computational design and production of materials. In materials science, ML has primarily supported large-scale discovery of novel compounds using first-principles data and digital twin applications for optimizing manufacturing processes. However, applying general-purpose ML frameworks to complex industrial materials such as steel remains a challenge. A key obstacle is accurately capturing the intricate relationship between chemical composition, processing parameters, and the resulting microstructure and properties. To address this, we introduce a computational framework that combines physical insights with ML to develop a physics-informed continuous cooling transformation (CCT) model for steels. Our model, trained on a dataset of 4,100 diagrams, is validated against literature and experimental data. It demonstrates high computational efficiency, generating complete CCT diagrams with 100 cooling curves in under 5 seconds. It also shows strong generalizability across alloy steels, achieving phase classification F1 scores above 88% for all phases. For phase transition temperature regression, it attains mean absolute errors (MAE) below 20 {\deg}C across all phases except bainite, which shows a slightly higher MAE of 27 {\deg}C. This framework can be extended with additional generic and customized ML models to establish a universal digital twin platform for heat treatment. Integration with complementary simulation tools and targeted experiments will further support accelerated materials design workflows.</description>

      <title>Understanding cold electron impact on parallel-propagating whistler chorus waves via moment-based quasilinear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth's magnetosphere hosts a wide range of collisionless particle populations that interact through various wave-particle processes. Among these, cold electrons, with energies below 100eV, often dominate the plasma density but remain poorly characterized due to measurement challenges such as spacecraft charging and photoelectron contamination. Understanding the contribution of these cold populations to wave-particle interaction is of significant interest. Recent kinetic simulations identified a secondary drift-driven instability in which parallel-propagating whistler-mode chorus waves excite oblique electrostatic whistler waves near the resonance cone and Bernstein-mode turbulence. These secondary modes enable a new channel of energy transfer from the parallel-propagating whistler wave to the cold electrons. In this work, we develop a moment-based quasilinear theory of the secondary instabilities to quantify such energy exchange. Our results show that these secondary instabilities persist for a wide range of parameters and, in many cases, lead to nearly complete damping of the primary wave. Such secondary instability might limit the amplitude of parallel-propagating whistler waves in Earth's magnetosphere and might explain why high-amplitude oblique whistler or electron Bernstein waves are rarely observed simultaneously with high-amplitude field-aligned whistler waves in the inner magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Simpson variational integrator for nonlinear systems: a tutorial on the Lagrange top</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution presents an integration method based on the Simpson quadrature. The integrator is designed for finite-dimensional nonlinear mechanical systems that derive from variational principles. The action is discretized using quadratic finite elements interpolation of the state and Simpson's quadrature, leading to discrete motion equations. The scheme is implicit, symplectic, and fourth-order accurate. The proposed integrator is compared with the implicit midpoint variational integrator on two examples of systems with inseparable Hamiltonians. First, the example of the nonlinear double pendulum illustrates how the method can be applied to multibody systems. The analytical solution of the Lagrange top is then used as a reference to analyze accuracy, convergence, and precision of the numerical method. A reduced Lagrange top system is also proposed and solved with a classical fourth-order method. Its solution is compared with the Simpson solution of the complete system, and the convergence order of the difference between both is consistent with the order of the classical method.</description>

      <title>Sketch Tomography: Hybridizing Classical Shadow and Matrix Product State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sketch Tomography, an efficient procedure for quantum state tomography based on the classical shadow protocol used for quantum observable estimations. The procedure applies to the case where the ground truth quantum state is a matrix product state (MPS). The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol. We also show that sketch tomography is more accurate in observable estimation than quantum states trained from the maximum likelihood estimation formulation.</description>

      <title>Generative Refinement:A New Paradigm for Determining Single Crystal Structures Directly from HKL Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SC-XRD) is the gold standard technique to characterize crystal structures in solid state. Despite significant advances in automation for structure solution, the refinement stage still depends heavily on expert intervention and subjective judgment, limiting accessibility and scalability. Herein, we introduce RefrActor, an end-to-end deep learning framework that enables crystal structure determination directly from HKL data. By coupling a physics-informed reciprocal-space encoder (ReciEncoder) with a symmetry-aware diffusion-based generator (StruDiffuser), RefrActor produces fully refined atomic models without requiring initial structural guesses or manual input. Comprehensive evaluations on the GenRef-10k benchmark demonstrates that RefrActor achieves low R1-factors across diverse systems, including low-symmetry, light-atom, and heavy-atom crystals. Case studies further confirm that RefrActor can correctly resolve hydrogen positions, elemental assignments, and moderate disorder. This work establishes a new data-driven paradigm for autonomous crystallographic analysis, offering a foundation for fully automated, high-throughput crystal structure determination.</description>

      <title>ATHENA: Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bridging the gap between theoretical conceptualization and computational implementation is a major bottleneck in Scientific Computing (SciC) and Scientific Machine Learning (SciML). We introduce ATHENA (Agentic Team for Hierarchical Evolutionary Numerical Algorithms), an agentic framework designed as an Autonomous Lab to manage the end-to-end computational research lifecycle. Its core is the HENA loop, a knowledge-driven diagnostic process framed as a Contextual Bandit problem. Acting as an online learner, the system analyzes prior trials to select structural `actions' ($A_n$) from combinatorial spaces guided by expert blueprints (e.g., Universal Approximation, Physics-Informed constraints). These actions are translated into executable code ($S_n$) to generate scientific rewards ($R_n$). ATHENA transcends standard automation: in SciC, it autonomously identifies mathematical symmetries for exact analytical solutions or derives stable numerical solvers where foundation models fail. In SciML, it performs deep diagnosis to tackle ill-posed formulations and combines hybrid symbolic-numeric workflows (e.g., coupling PINNs with FEM) to resolve multiphysics problems. The framework achieves super-human performance, reaching validation errors of $10^{-14}$. Furthermore, collaborative ``human-in-the-loop" intervention allows the system to bridge stability gaps, improving results by an order of magnitude. This paradigm shift focuses from implementation mechanics to methodological innovation, accelerating scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Preserving High-Order Compact OEDG Method for Spherically Symmetric Einstein-Euler System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of the spherically symmetric Einstein--Euler (EE) system faces severe challenges due to the stringent physical admissibility constraints of relativistic fluids and the geometric singularities inherent in metric evolution. This paper proposes a high-order Constraint-Preserving (CP) compact Oscillation-Eliminating Discontinuous Galerkin (cOEDG) method specifically tailored to address these difficulties. The method integrates a scale-invariant oscillation-eliminating mechanism [M. Peng, Z. Sun, K. Wu, Math. Comp., 94: 1147--1198, 2025] into a compact Runge--Kutta DG framework. By characterizing the convex invariant region of the hydrodynamic subsystem with general barotropic equations of state, we prove that the proposed scheme preserves physical realizability (specifically, positive density and subluminal velocity) directly in terms of conservative variables, thereby eliminating the need for complex primitive-variable checks. To ensure the geometric validity of the spacetime, we introduce a bijective transformation of the metric potentials. Rather than evolving the constrained metric components directly, the scheme advances unconstrained auxiliary variables whose inverse mapping automatically enforces strict positivity and asymptotic bounds without any limiters. Combined with a compatible high-order boundary treatment, the resulting CPcOEDG method exhibits robust stability and design-order accuracy in capturing strong gravity-fluid interactions, as demonstrated by simulations of black hole accretion and relativistic shock waves.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Solving Reservoir Seepage Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) for reservoir seepage is critical for optimizing oil and gas field development and predicting production performance. Traditional numerical methods suffer from mesh-dependent errors and high computational costs, while classical Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) face bottlenecks in parameter efficiency, high-dimensional expression, and strong nonlinear fitting. To address these limitations, we propose a Discrete Variable (DV)-Circuit Quantum-Classical Physics-Informed Neural Network (QCPINN) and apply it to three typical reservoir seepage models for the first time: the pressure diffusion equation for heterogeneous single-phase flow, the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett (BL) equation for two-phase waterflooding, and the convection-diffusion equation for compositional flow considering adsorption. The QCPINN integrates classical preprocessing/postprocessing networks with a DV quantum core, leveraging quantum superposition and entanglement to enhance high-dimensional feature mapping while embedding physical constraints to ensure solution consistency. We test three quantum circuit topologies (Cascade, Cross-mesh, Alternate) and demonstrate through numerical experiments that QCPINNs achieve high prediction accuracy with fewer parameters than classical PINNs. Specifically, the Alternate topology outperforms others in heterogeneous single-phase flow and two-phase BL equation simulations, while the Cascade topology excels in compositional flow with convection-dispersion-adsorption coupling. Our work verifies the feasibility of QCPINN for reservoir engineering applications, bridging the gap between quantum computing research and industrial practice in oil and gas engineering.</description>

      <title>Formation of abiogenic hydrocarbons in supercritical fluids under Earth's upper mantle conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of hydrocarbons in Earth's interior has traditionally been considered to have biogenic origins; however, growing evidence suggests that some hydrocarbons may instead originate abiotically in the deep carbon cycle. It is widely expected that the Fisher-Tropsch-type (FTT) process, which typically refers to the conversion of inorganic carbon to organic matter in geological settings,may also happen in Earth's interior, but the absence of industrial catalysts and aqueous conditions in deep environments suggest that the FTT process can be very different from that in the chemical industry. Here, we performed extensive \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations ($&gt;$ 2.4 ns) to investigate the FTT synthesis in dry mixture and in aqueous solutions at 10-13 GPa and 1000-1400 K.We found that large hydrocarbon-related species containing C, O, and H($&gt;$C$_2$) are abiotically synthesized via the polymerization of CO without any catalyst. Supercritical water, commonly found in the deep Earth, does not prevent organic molecule formation but restricts product size and carbon reduction.Our studies reveal a previously unrecognized abiogenic route for hydrocarbon synthesis in mantle geofluids. These carbon-containing fluids could potentially migrate from depth to shallower crustal reservoirs, thereby influencing Earth's surface carbon budget.</description>

      <title>Probing the partition function for temperature-dependent potentials with nested sampling</title>

Abstract: Thermodynamic properties can be in principle derived from the partition function, which, in many-atom systems, is hard to evaluate as it involves a sum on the accessible microscopic states. Recently, the partition function has been computed via nested sampling, relying on Bayesian statistics, which is able to provide the density of states as a function of the energy in a single run, independently of the temperature. This appealing property is lost whenever the potential energy that appears in the partition function is temperature-dependent: for instance, mean-field effective potential energies or the quantum partition function in the path-integral formalism. For these cases, the nested sampling must be carried out at each temperature, which results in a massive increase of computational time. Here, we introduce and implement a new method, that is based on an extended partition function where the temperature is considered as an additional parameter to be sampled. The extended partition function can be evaluated by nested sampling in a single run, so to restore this highly desirable property even for temperature-dependent effective potential energies. We apply this original method to compute the quantum partition function for harmonic potentials and Lennard-Jones clusters at low temperatures and show that it outperforms the straightforward application of nested sampling for each temperature within several temperature ranges.</description>

      <title>Photo-induced directional transport in extended SSH chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker framework.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Chern Insulator at Zero Electric Field in ABCB-Stacked Tetralayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ABCB-stacked tetralayer graphene, with intrinsic spontaneous polarization, offers a unique platform to explore electron correlation effects, whose interplay with spin-orbit coupling may engender topological phases. Here, employing a $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ model with self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate its electronic ground states. Remarkably, we find that the intrinsic polarization, in conjunction with strong interactions ($U=8 \text{ eV}$) and SOC, is sufficient to drive a $C=3$ quantum anomalous Hall state, obviating the need for an external electric field typical in ABCA stacks. Conversely, at moderate interactions ($U=6 \text{ eV}$), a minimal electric field is necessary. Furthermore, calculations predict other correlation-driven metallic phases such as quarter- and three-quarter-filled states. These results establish that the synergy of intrinsic polarization, correlations, and SOC governs the rich topological phenomena, suggesting ABCB-stacked graphene as a highly tunable platform for exploring emergent topological phenomena.</description>
