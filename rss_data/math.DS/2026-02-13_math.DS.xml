      <title>Traffic Flow Reconstruction from Limited Collected Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient method for reconstructing traffic density with low penetration rate of probe vehicles. Specifically, we rely on measuring only the initial and final positions of a small number of cars which are generated using microscopic dynamical systems. We then implement a machine learning algorithm from scratch to reconstruct the approximate traffic density. This approach leverages learning techniques to improve the accuracy of density reconstruction despite constraints in available data. For the sake of consistency, we will prove that, if only using data from dynamical systems, the approximate density predicted by our learned-based model converges to a well-known macroscopic traffic flow model when the number of vehicles approaches infinity.</description>

      <title>The circle method and pointwise ergodic theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is to discuss the circle method and its quantitative role in understanding pointwise almost everywhere convergence phenomena for polynomial ergodic averaging operators. Specifically, we will use the circle method to illustrate that pointwise almost everywhere convergence and norm convergence in ergodic theory can have fundamentally different natures. More importantly, these differences may necessitate the use of distinct types of tools, which can sometimes be more intriguing than the original problems themselves.</description>

      <title>On sets of pointwise recurrence and dynamically thick sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is a set of pointwise recurrence if for all minimal dynamical systems $(X, T)$, all $x \in X$, and all open neighborhoods $U \subseteq X$ of $x$, there exists a time $n \in A$ such that $T^n x \in U$. The set $A$ is dynamically thick if the same holds for all non-empty, open sets $U \subseteq X$. Our main results give combinatorial characterizations of sets of pointwise recurrence and dynamically thick sets that allow us to answer questions of Host, Kra, Maass and Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. We also introduce and study a local version of dynamical thickness called dynamical piecewise syndeticity. We show that dynamically piecewise syndetic sets are piecewise syndetic, generalizing results of Dong, Glasner, Huang, Shao, Weiss, and Ye. The proofs involve the algebra of families of large sets, dynamics on the space of ultrafilters, and our recent characterization of dynamically syndetic sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The number of distinct symbols appearing in digit expansions generated by full-branch affine countable iterated function systems is studied whose branch weights are regularly varying. The Hausdorff dimensions of the exceptional sets in which the distinct-digit count grows at a positive linear rate or at a prescribed sublinear rate are determined. The resulting dimension laws exhibit a sharp phase transition: imposing any positive linear rate forces the dimension to collapse to a value determined solely by the tail index, whereas under a broad class of sublinear growth rates, the exceptional sets retain full Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Tipping Bifurcations in Conceptual Ocean Circulation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is often analyzed using low-order box models to understand tipping points. Historically, these studies focus on freshwater flux as the primary bifurcation parameter, treating the temperature gradient as a fixed restoring target. However, the erosion of the equator-to-pole temperature contrast due to polar amplification suggests that thermal forcing should be treated as a dynamic control parameter. In this study, we use Cessi's reduced box model to map the global bifurcation structure of the thermohaline circulation. We relax the assumption of a fixed thermal background and analyze the system's behavior under joint thermal and haline forcing. We prove the existence of a cusp bifurcation, identifying the specific geometry of pitchfork and saddle-node bifurcations that bound the stable regime. This geometric characterization reveals that thermal erosion acts as a distinct mechanism for destabilization, capable of driving the system across critical thresholds even in the absence of anomalous freshwater forcing.</description>

      <title>Finite-time flocking of an infinite set of Cucker-Smale particles with sublinear velocity couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study finite-time flocking for an infinite set of Cucker-Smale particles with sublinear velocity coupling under fixed and switching sender networks. For this, we use a component-wise diameter framework and exploit sub-linear dissipation mechanisms, and derive sufficient conditions for finite-time flocking equipped with explicit alignment-time estimate. For a fixed sender network, we establish component-wise finite-time flocking results under both integrable and non-integrable communication weights. When communication weight function is non-integrable, finite-time flocking is guaranteed for any bounded initial configuration. We further extend the flocking analysis to switching sender networks and show that finite-time flocking persists under mild assumptions on the cumulative influence of time-varying sender weights. The proposed framework is also applicable to both finite and infinite systems, and it yields alignment-time estimates that do not depend on the number of agents.</description>

      <title>Stability of Phase-Locked States in Signed Kuramoto Networks: Structure versus Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Kuramoto models admit a variety of nontrivial phase-locked configurations, including antipodal and rotating-wave states. A central open question is whether the observed persistence of such configurations can be attributed to intrinsic properties of the associated signed interaction networks, or whether it relies essentially on adaptive coupling dynamics. To address this question, we study the stability of antipodal and rotating-wave phase configurations on fixed signed networks that preserve the same phase symmetries but are not generated by adaptive dynamics. We show that for two canonical classes of static signed networks, stability is highly constrained, with unstable modes persisting under parameter variations generically, and we characterize how adaptive coupling influences invariant sets and basins of attraction for the configurations where stability is permitted. Taken together, these results show that while static network structure imposes severe constraints on the stability of phase-locked configurations, adaptive coupling dynamics organize and delineate their robustness when stability is permitted.</description>

      <title>Twisted Pollicott--Ruelle resonances and zeta function at zero on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an orientable closed surface $(\Sigma,g)$ of genus $G$ with Anosov geodesic flow, we show the existence of an open subset $U_g$ of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the fundamental group of its unit tangent bundle, whose complement has complex codimension at least one and such that for any $\rho \in U_g$, the twisted Ruelle zeta function $\zeta_{g,\rho}(s)$ vanishes at $s=0$ to order ${\rm dim}(\rho)(2G-2)$ if $\rho$ factors through $\pi_1(\Sigma)$, and does not vanish otherwise. In the second case, we show that $\zeta_{g,\rho}(0)$ is given by the Reidemeister--Turaev torsion, thus extending Fried's conjecture to a generic set of acyclic (but not necessarily unitary) representations. Our proof relies on computing the dimensions of the spaces of generalized twisted Pollicott--Ruelle resonant states at zero for any $\rho\in U_g$.</description>

      <title>A Discrete-Time Model of the Academic Pipeline in Mathematical Sciences with Constrained Hiring in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of the mathematical sciences relies on a continuous academic pipeline in which individuals progress from undergraduate study through graduate training and postdoctoral program to long term faculty employment. National statistics report trends in bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degree awards, but these data alone do not explain how individuals move through the academic system or how structural constraints shape downstream career outcomes. Persistent growth in postdoctoral appointments alongside relatively stable faculty employment indicates that degree production alone is insufficient to characterize workforce dynamics. In this study, we develop a discrete time compartmental model of the academic pipeline in the field of the mathematical sciences that links observed degree flows to latent population stocks. Undergraduate and graduate populations are reconstructed directly from nationally reported degree data, allowing postdoctoral and faculty dynamics to be examined under completion, exit, and hiring processes. Advancement to faculty positions is modeled as vacancy limited, with competition for permanent positions depending on downstream population size. Numerical simulations show that increases in degree inflow do not translate into proportional faculty growth when hiring is constrained by limited turnover. Instead, excess supply accumulates primarily at the postdoctoral stage, leading to sustained congestion and elevated competition. Sensitivity analyses indicate that long run workforce outcomes are governed mainly by faculty exit rates and hiring capacity rather than by degree production alone. These results demonstrate the central role of vacancy limited hiring in shaping academic career trajectories within the field of the mathematical sciences.</description>

      <title>First variation of flat traces on negatively curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a closed negatively curved surface $(X,g)$ the flat trace of the geodesic Koopman operators $V_g^\tau f=f\circ G_g^\tau$ is the periodic orbit distribution \[ \mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g}(\tau)=\sum_{\gamma}\frac{L_\gamma^{\#}}{\lvert\det(I-P_\gamma)\rvert}\,\delta(\tau-L_\gamma), \qquad \tau&gt;0, \] supported on the length spectrum and weighted by the linearized Poincar\'e maps $P_\gamma$. For a smooth family of negatively curved metrics $g_t$ we compute the first variation $\partial_t\vert_{0}\,\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}$ as a distribution. At an isolated length $\ell$ the leading singularity is a multiple of $\delta'(\tau-\ell)$, and its coefficient is an explicit linear functional of the length variations $\dot L_{\gamma^m}$ of the closed geodesics with $L_{\gamma^m}=\ell$. This transport coefficient forces the marked lengths to be locally constant along any deformation with constant flat trace. As an application, if $\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_t}=\mathrm{Tr}^{\flat} V_{g_0}$ for all $t$ then $g_t$ is isometric to $g_0$ for all $t$. Together with Sunada-type constructions of non isometric pairs with equal flat traces, this shows that the flat trace is globally non-unique yet locally complete along smooth families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two longest-run statistics are studied: the longest run of a fixed value and the longest run over all values. Under quantitative mixing and exponential cylinder estimates for constant words, a general theorem is proved. Quantitative almost-sure logarithmic growth is obtained, and eventual two-sided bounds with double-logarithmic error terms are established. For continued-fraction partial quotients, explicit centring constants and double-logarithmic error bounds are derived for both statistics.</description>

      <title>What is a Fluctuation Theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book provides a modern review of Fluctuation Relations and Fluctuation Theorems in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. It focuses on the pioneering perspectives of Gallavotti and Cohen, according to which a fluctuation theorem describes the statistics of the deviations of entropy production from its expected value. For time-reversal invariant systems, these fluctuations obey a universal (i.e., model-independent) symmetry called the fluctuation relation. The probabilistic framework introduced in the first part of the book allows for a very general formulation of Fluctuation Relations and Theorems for both deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems. The authors further explore models of physical interest, illustrating this framework by concrete applications. The second part of the book focuses on chaotic dynamics. The formulation of two general Fluctuation Theorems, followed by the detailed study of a concrete example, provides the reader with an understanding of both the theoretical and practical aspects of the subject.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Antezana-Pujals-Stojanoff Theorem states that the iterated Aluthge transforms of an arbitrary matrix converge to a normal matrix. We introduce a family of matrix flows that share this convergence property by defining them through ordinary differential equations. The family includes a continuous analogue of the Aluthge transform, as well as a differential equation discussed by Haagerup in the context of II$_1$ factors. We also examine the same type of flows in the setting of Hilbert space operators equipped with unitarily invariant norms.</description>

      <title>Liquidation Dynamics in DeFi and the Role of Transaction Fees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquidation of collateral are the primary safeguard for solvency of lending protocols in decentralized finance. However, the mechanics of liquidations expose these protocols to predatory price manipulations and other forms of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). In this paper, we characterize the optimal liquidation strategy, via a dynamic program, from the perspective of a profit-maximizing liquidator when the spot oracle is given by a Constant Product Market Maker (CPMM). We explicitly model Oracle Extractable Value (OEV) where liquidators manipulate the CPMM with sandwich attacks to trigger profitable liquidation events. We derive closed-form liquidation bounds and prove that CPMM transaction fees act as a critical security parameter. Crucially, we demonstrate that fees do not merely reduce attacker profits, but can make such manipulations unprofitable for an attacker. Our findings suggest that CPMM transaction fees serve a dual purpose: compensating liquidity providers and endogenously hardening CPMM oracles against manipulation without the latency of time-weighted averages or medianization.</description>

Abstract: This paper details a generalization of the formalism presented in the author's 2024 paper, "The Collatz Conjecture and Non-Archimedean Spectral Theory - Part I - Arithmetic Dynamical Systems and Non-Archimedean Value Distribution Theory", to the case of Hydra maps on the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_{K}$ of a global field $K$. In addition to recounting these definitions, background material is presented for the necessary standard material in algebraic number theory and integration and Fourier analysis with respect to the $p$-adic Haar measure.

      <description>arXiv:1712.05167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Fluctuation Theorem (FT) for entropy production in chaotic discrete-time dynamical systems on compact metric spaces, and extend it to empirical measures, all continuous potentials, and all weak Gibbs states. In particular, we establish the FT in the phase transition regime. These results hold under minimal chaoticity assumptions (expansiveness and specification) and require no ergodicity conditions. They are also valid for systems that are not necessarily invertible and involutions other than time reversal. Further extensions involve asymptotically additive potential sequences and the corresponding weak Gibbs measures. The generality of these results allows to view the FT as a structural facet of the thermodynamic formalism of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Anosov contact metrics, Dirichlet optimization and entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15397v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first main result of this paper classifies contact 3-manifolds admitting critical metrics, i.e. adapted metrics which are the critical points of the Dirichlet energy functional. This gives a complete answer to a question raised by Chern-Hamilton in 1984. Secondly, we show that in the case of Anosov contact metrics, the optimization of such energy functional is closely related to Reeb dynamics and can be described in terms of its entropy. We also study the consequences in the curvature realization problem for such contact metrics.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap for surfaces of infinite volume with negative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the imaginary parts of scattering resonances for negatively curved asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces are uniformly bounded away from zero and provide a resolvent bound in the resulting resonance-free strip. This provides an essential spectral gap without the pressure condition. This is done by adapting the methods of [arXiv:1004.3361], [arXiv:1012.4391] and [arXiv:2201.08259] and answers a question posed in [arXiv:1504.06589].</description>

      <title>Bounded remainder sets, bounded distance equivalent cut-and-project sets, and equidecomposability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the measurable Hall's theorem due to Cie\'sla and Sabok to prove that (i) if two measurable sets $A,B \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of the same measure are bounded remainder sets with respect to a given irrational $d$-dimensional vector $\alpha$, then $A, B$ are equidecomposable with measurable pieces using translations from $\mathbb{Z} \alpha + \mathbb{Z}^d$; and (ii) given a lattice $\Gamma \subset \mathbb{R}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$ with projections $p_1$ and $p_2$ onto $\mathbb{R}^m$ and $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively, if two cut-and-project sets in $\mathbb{R}^m$ obtained from Riemann measurable windows $W, W' \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are bounded distance equivalent, then $W, W'$ are equidecomposable with measurable pieces using translations from $p_2(\Gamma)$. We also prove by a different method that for one-dimensional cut-and-project sets, if the windows $W, W' \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ are polytopes then the pieces can also be chosen to be polytopes; this fails in dimensions two and higher.</description>
