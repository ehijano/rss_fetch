      <title>CryoLVM: Self-supervised Learning from Cryo-EM Density Maps with Large Vision Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has revolutionized structural biology by enabling near-atomic-level visualization of biomolecular assemblies. However, the exponential growth in cryo-EM data throughput and complexity, coupled with diverse downstream analytical tasks, necessitates unified computational frameworks that transcend current task-specific deep learning approaches with limited scalability and generalizability. We present CryoLVM, a foundation model that learns rich structural representations from experimental density maps with resolved structures by leveraging the Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) integrated with SCUNet-based backbone, which can be rapidly adapted to various downstream tasks. We further introduce a novel histogram-based distribution alignment loss that accelerates convergence and enhances fine-tuning performance. We demonstrate CryoLVM's effectiveness across three critical cryo-EM tasks: density map sharpening, density map super-resolution, and missing wedge restoration. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple density map quality metrics, confirming its potential as a versatile model for a wide spectrum of cryo-EM applications.</description>

      <title>PA-MIL: Phenotype-Aware Multiple Instance Learning Guided by Language Prompting and Genotype-to-Phenotype Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has been extensively researched in the analysis of pathology whole-slide images (WSIs). However, most existing methods are limited to providing prediction interpretability by locating the model's salient areas in a post-hoc manner, failing to offer more reliable and accountable explanations. In this work, we propose Phenotype-Aware Multiple Instance Learning (PA-MIL), a novel ante-hoc interpretable framework that identifies cancer-related phenotypes from WSIs and utilizes them for cancer subtyping. To facilitate PA-MIL in learning phenotype-aware features, we 1) construct a phenotype knowledge base containing cancer-related phenotypes and their associated genotypes. 2) utilize the morphological descriptions of phenotypes as language prompting to aggregate phenotype-related features. 3) devise the Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) grounded in genotype-to-phenotype relationships, which provides multi-level guidance for PA-MIL. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that PA-MIL achieves competitive performance compared to existing MIL methods while offering improved interpretability. PA-MIL leverages phenotype saliency as evidence and, using a linear classifier, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we thoroughly analyze the genotype-phenotype relationships, as well as cohort-level and case-level interpretability, demonstrating the reliability and accountability of PA-MIL.</description>

      <title>hSNMF: Hybrid Spatially Regularized NMF for Image-Derived Spatial Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution spatial transcriptomics platforms, such as Xenium, generate single-cell images that capture both molecular and spatial context, but their extremely high dimensionality poses major challenges for representation learning and clustering. In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS &lt; 0.004, Moran's I &gt; 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette &gt; 0.12, DBI &lt; 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

      <title>On the consistent and scalable detection of spatial patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting spatial patterns is fundamental to scientific discovery, yet current methods lack statistical consensus and face computational barriers when applied to large-scale spatial omics datasets. We unify major approaches through a single quadratic form and derive general consistency conditions. We reveal that several widely used methods, including Moran's I, are inconsistent, and propose scalable corrections. The resulting test enables robust pattern detection across millions of spatial locations and single-cell lineage-tracing datasets.</description>

      <title>A Reproducible Framework for Bias-Resistant Machine Learning on Small-Sample Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a reproducible, bias-resistant machine learning framework that integrates domain-informed feature engineering, nested cross-validation, and calibrated decision-threshold optimization for small-sample neuroimaging data. Conventional cross-validation frameworks that reuse the same folds for both model selection and performance estimation yield optimistically biased results, limiting reproducibility and generalization. Demonstrated on a high-dimensional structural MRI dataset of deep brain stimulation cognitive outcomes, the framework achieved a nested-CV balanced accuracy of 0.660\,$\pm$\,0.068 using a compact, interpretable subset selected via importance-guided ranking. By combining interpretability and unbiased evaluation, this work provides a generalizable computational blueprint for reliable machine learning in data-limited biomedical domains.</description>

      <title>MARADONER: Motif Activity Response Analysis Done Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inferring the activities of transcription factors from high-throughput transcriptomic or open chromatin profiling, such as RNA-/CAGE-/ATAC-Seq, is a long-standing challenge in systems biology. Identification of highly active master regulators enables mechanistic interpretation of differential gene expression, chromatin state changes, or perturbation responses across conditions, cell types, and diseases. Here, we describe MARADONER, a statistical framework and its software implementation for motif activity response analysis (MARA), utilizing the sequence-level features obtained with pattern matching (motif scanning) of individual promoters and promoter- or gene-level activity or expression estimates. Compared to the classic MARA, MARADONER (MARA-done-right) employs an unbiased variance parameter estimation and a bias-adjusted likelihood estimation of fixed effects, thereby enhancing goodness-of-fit and the accuracy of activity estimation. Further, MARADONER is capable of accounting for heteroscedasticity of motif scores and activity estimates.</description>

      <title>smICA: Open-Source Software for Quantitative, Lifetime-Resolved Mapping of Absolute Fluorophore Concentrations in Living Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced microscopy techniques are essential in biomedical research for visualising and tracking biomolecules within living cells and their compartments. Conventional fluorescence microscopy methods, however, often struggle with accurately measuring the absolute concentrations of fluorescent probes in living cells. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an open-source analysis tool, smICA (Single-Molecule Image to Concentration Analyser). The smICA method offers quantitative mapping of absolute fluorophore concentrations, lifetime-resolved filtering methods of the signal, intensity-based cell segmentation, and requires only a few photons per pixel. Our approach also reduces the time required for the determination of the mean concentration per cell, compared to the standard FCS measurement performed in multiple posts. To highlight the robustness of the method, we validated it against standard fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements by performing in vitro (aqueous solutions of polymers) and in vivo (polymers and EGFP in living cells) experiments. The presented methodology, along with the software, is a promising tool for quantitative single-cell studies, including, but not limited to, protein expression, degradation of biomolecules (such as proteins and mRNA), and monitoring of enzymatic reactions.</description>

      <title>BioGen: An Evidence-Grounded Framework for Interpreting RNA-seq Gene Clusters in Antimicrobial Resistance Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16082v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpretation of gene clusters derived from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) experiments remains a persistent challenge in functional genomics, particularly in antimicrobial resistance studies where mechanistic context is essential. While clustering methods effectively identify co-expressed gene modules, their interpretation typically relies on enrichment statistics and manual literature review, limiting transparency, reproducibility, and scalability. We present BioGen, an agentic framework for post hoc interpretation of RNA-seq gene clusters that emphasizes evidence-grounded and traceable biological reasoning. Rather than introducing new predictive models or clustering algorithms, BioGen organizes existing biomedical knowledge through a structured pipeline that integrates literature retrieval, hypothesis formulation, and critic-based validation. The framework enforces explicit linkage between interpretive claims and external sources such as PubMed and UniProt, enabling systematic assessment of factual grounding and semantic consistency. We apply BioGen to RNA-seq data from Salmonella enterica, demonstrating that it produces concise, literature-supported cluster-level interpretations related to efflux regulation, virulence, and metabolic adaptation. Comparative and ablation analyses indicate that retrieval augmentation and critic-based filtering reduce unsupported statements relative to unconstrained large language model baselines albeit at the cost of reduced interpretive coverage. These results highlight the role of architectural constraints and verification logic in improving reliability of automated biological interpretation. Overall, BioGen is intended as an interpretive support layer that complements existing transcriptomic analysis workflows by improving auditability and reproducibility of RNA-seq cluster interpretation, rather than as a standalone discovery or predictive system.</description>

      <title>Rank-and-Reason: Multi-Agent Collaboration Accelerates Zero-Shot Protein Mutation Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-shot mutation prediction is vital for low-resource protein engineering, yet existing protein language models (PLMs) often yield statistically confident results that ignore fundamental biophysical constraints. Currently, selecting candidates for wet-lab validation relies on manual expert auditing of PLM outputs, a process that is inefficient, subjective, and highly dependent on domain expertise. To address this, we propose Rank-and-Reason (VenusRAR), a two-stage agentic framework to automate this workflow and maximize expected wet-lab fitness. In the Rank-Stage, a Computational Expert and Virtual Biologist aggregate a context-aware multi-modal ensemble, establishing a new Spearman correlation record of 0.551 (vs. 0.518) on ProteinGym. In the Reason-Stage, an agentic Expert Panel employs chain-of-thought reasoning to audit candidates against geometric and structural constraints, improving the Top-5 Hit Rate by up to 367% on ProteinGym-DMS99. The wet-lab validation on Cas12i3 nuclease further confirms the framework's efficacy, achieving a 46.7% positive rate and identifying two novel mutants with 4.23-fold and 5.05-fold activity improvements. Code and datasets are released on GitHub (https://github.com/ai4protein/VenusRAR/).</description>

      <title>Inferring stochastic dynamics with growth from cross-sectional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved single-cell omics data offers high-throughput, genome-wide measurements of cellular states, which are instrumental to reverse-engineer the processes underpinning cell fate. Such technologies are inherently destructive, allowing only cross-sectional measurements of the underlying stochastic dynamical system. Furthermore, cells may divide or die in addition to changing their molecular state. Collectively these present a major challenge to inferring realistic biophysical models. We present a novel approach, unbalanced probability flow inference, that addresses this challenge for biological processes modelled as stochastic dynamics with growth. By leveraging a Lagrangian formulation of the Fokker-Planck equation, our method accurately disentangles drift from intrinsic noise and growth. We showcase the applicability of our approach through evaluation on a range of simulated and real single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Comparing to several existing methods, we find our method achieves higher accuracy while enjoying a simple two-step training scheme.</description>

      <title>MGKAN: Predicting Asymmetric Drug-Drug Interactions via a Multimodal Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is essential for safe pharmacological treatments. Previous graph neural network (GNN) models leverage molecular structures and interaction networks but mostly rely on linear aggregation and symmetric assumptions, limiting their ability to capture nonlinear and heterogeneous patterns. We propose MGKAN, a Graph Kolmogorov-Arnold Network that introduces learnable basis functions into asymmetric DDI prediction. MGKAN replaces conventional MLP transformations with KAN-driven basis functions, enabling more expressive and nonlinear modeling of drug relationships. To capture pharmacological dependencies, MGKAN integrates three network views-an asymmetric DDI network, a co-interaction network, and a biochemical similarity network-with role-specific embeddings to preserve directional semantics. A fusion module combines linear attention and nonlinear transformation to enhance representational capacity. On two benchmark datasets, MGKAN outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies and case studies confirm its predictive accuracy and effectiveness in modeling directional drug effects.</description>
