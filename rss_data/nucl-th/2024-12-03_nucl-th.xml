      <title>In Search of Truth: In memory of Balraj Singh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Born in Punjab (India) in December 1941, Balraj Singh is not only the single most prolific nuclear data evaluator and disseminator of nuclear structure and decay data with 148 evaluations in Nuclear Data Sheets -- 85 as the first and often only author -- plus other journals, but his upmost curiosity and dedication brought him to be one of the finest nuclear physicists, with an everlasting influence on many of us. Balraj passed away about a year ago on 9 October 2023 in Ottawa, Ontario (Canada) at the age of 81, and at Atomic Data and Nuclear Data Tables we would like to commemorate some of his scientific achievements.</description>

      <title>Induced three-neutron interactions with low cutoffs for dilute neutron matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of dilute neutron matter are mostly determined by the s-wave two-body (2N) interaction, while three-body (3N) interactions are suppressed by the Pauli principle. In a previous work, we showed that it can be advantageous to use the renormalization group based effective interactions with cutoffs scaled with the Fermi momentum, especially at low densities. In that case, induced 3N interactions may become important. In this work, we compute the 3N interaction induced by the similarity renormalization group flow of the s-wave 2N interaction. We work in the momentum-space hyperspherical partial wave basis and investigate its convergence properties. Then we study the effect of the induced 3N interaction on the equation of state of dilute neutron matter. We observe that the cutoff dependence of the equation of state is strongly reduced when the effect of induced 3N interaction is included.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent microscopic calculations for electron captures on nuclei in core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculations for electron capture rates on nuclei with atomic numbers between $Z=20$ and $Z=52$ are performed in a self-consistent finite-temperature covariant energy density functional theory within the relativistic quasiparticle random-phase approximation. Electron captures on these nuclei contribute most to reducing the electron fraction during the collapse phase of core-collapse supernovae. The rates include contributions from allowed (Gamow-Teller) and first-forbidden (FF) transitions, and it is shown that the latter become dominant at high stellar densities and temperatures. Temperature-dependent effects such as Pauli unblocking and transitions from thermally excited states are also included. The new rates are implemented in a spherically symmetric 1D simulation of the core-collapse phase. The results indicate that the increase in electron capture rates, due to inclusion of FF transitions, leads to reductions of the electron fraction at nuclear saturation density, the peak neutrino luminosity, and enclosed mass at core bounce. The new rates reaffirm that the most relevant nuclei for the deleptonization situate around the $N = 50$ and $82$ shell closures, but compared to previous simulations, nuclei are less proton rich. The new rates developed in this work are available, and will be of benefit to improve the accuracy of multi-dimensional supernova simulations.</description>

      <title>Ab-initio Approach for Constructing Inverse Potentials for Resonant States of {\alpha}-3H and {\alpha}-3He Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the inverse potentials for the resonant f states of {\alpha}-3H and {\alpha}-3He are constructed using the phase function method by utilizing an ab-initio approach. A combination of three Morse functions are joined smoothly to prepare the reference potential. While the regular Morse function captures the nuclear and Coulomb interactions at short and medium ranges, an inverse Morse function is chosen to obtain the Coulomb barrier that arises because of the long-range Coulomb interaction. This reference potential is representative of a large family of curves consisting of eight distinct model parameters and two intermediate points that define the boundaries that exist between the three regions. The phase equation is solved using the Runge-Kutta 5th order method for the input reference potential to obtain the scattering phase shifts at various center of mass energies. The model parameters are then adjusted using the genetic algorithm in an iterative fashion to minimize the mean square error between the simulated and expected phase shift values. Our approach successfully constructed the inverse potentials for the resonant f states of the {\alpha}-3H and {\alpha}-3He systems, achieving convergence with a minimized mean square error. The resonance energies and widths for the {\alpha}-3H system for the f-5/2 and f-7/2 states are determined to be [4.19 (4.14), 1.225 (0.918)] MeV and [2.20 (2.18), 0.099 (0.069)] MeV, respectively. For the f-5/2 and f-7/2 states of the {\alpha}-3He system, the resonance energies and widths are [5.03 (5.14), 1.6 (1.2)] MeV and [2.99 (2.98), 0.182(0.175)] MeV, respectively. Our ab-initio approach to solve the phase equation utilizing a combination of smoothly joined Morse functions effectively captures both short-range nuclear and long-range Coulomb interactions, providing an accurate model for nuclear scattering involving charged particles.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of $\Delta$--isobars on Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We include the $\Delta$--isobars in the equation of state (EOS) of neutron star (NS) and study its effects with various parameter sets of the RMF model. We compare our results with the NS's constraints from the mass-radius measurement of PSR J0348+0432, PSR J1614-2230, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0952-0607, and tidal deformability of GW170817. We calculate the mass-radius profile and tidal deformabilities of the NS using 21 parameter sets of the RMF model.Analyzing the result with various parameters, it is clear that only few parameter sets can satisfy simultaneously the constraints from NICER and GW170817. NLD parameter set satisfy all the constraints of NICER and GW170817. For its strong predictive power for the bulk properties of the neutron star, we take NLD parameter set as a representative for the detailed calculation of effect of $\Delta$-isobar on neutron star properties. We demonstrate that it is possible that $\Delta$-isobar can produce at 2-3 times the saturation density by adjusting the coupling constants $X_{\sigma\Delta}$, $X_{\rho\Delta}$ and $X_{\omega\Delta}$ in an appropriate range. Bulk properties of the NS like mass-radius profile and tidal deformability is strongly affected by the interaction strength of $\Delta$-isobar. Our calculation shows that it is also possible that by choosing $X_{\sigma\Delta}$, $X_{\rho\Delta}$ and $X_{\omega\Delta}$ to a suitable range the threshold density of $\Delta^-$-isobar become lower than $\Lambda^0$ hyperon. For a particular value of $\Delta$-coupling constants, the $R_{1.4}$ decrease by 1.7 km. This manuscipt give an argumentative justification for allowing $\Delta$-isobar degrees of freedom in the calculation of the NS properties.</description>

      <title>A simultaneous explanation of XTE J1814-338 and HESS J1731-347 objects using ${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$ condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent observation of the compact star XTE J1814-338 with a mass of $M=1.2^{+0.05}_{-0.05}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=7^{+0.4}_{-0.4}$ km, together with the HESS J1731-347, which has a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, they provide evidence for the possible presence of exotic matter in the core of neutron stars and significantly enhance our understanding of the equation of state for the dense nuclear matter. In the present srtudy, we investigate the possible existence of neutral anti-kaons and negative charged kaons in neutron stars by employing the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaonic (${K^{-}}$ and ${\bar{K^{0}}}$) condensates. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the XTE J1814-338 object and at the same time the HESS J1731-347 object, using a mixture of kaons condensation in dense nuclear matter. In addition, we compare our analysis approach with the recent observation of PSR J0437-4715 and PSR J1231-1411 pulsars, proposing that to explain all objects simultaneously, it is essential to consider two distinct branches, each corresponding to a different composition of nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relation for hadronic light-by-light scattering: subleading contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present an evaluation of subleading effects in the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Using a recently derived optimized basis, we first study the matching of axial-vector contributions to short-distance constraints at the level of the scalar basis functions, finding that also the tails of the pseudoscalar poles and tensor mesons play a role. We then develop a matching strategy that allows for a combined evaluation of axial-vector and short-distance constraints, supplemented by an estimate of tensor-meson contributions based on simplified assumptions for their transition form factors. Uncertainties are primarily propagated from the axial-vector transition form factors and the variation of the matching scale, but we also consider estimates of the low-energy effect of hadronic states not explicitly included. In total, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{subleading}=33.2(7.2)\times 10^{-11}$, which in combination with previously evaluated contributions in the dispersive approach leads to $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}\big|_\text{total}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>A complete dispersive evaluation of hadronic light-by-light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hadronic light-by-light scattering (HLbL) defines one of the critical contributions in the Standard-Model prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In this work, we present a complete evaluation using a dispersive formalism, in which the HLbL tensor is reconstructed from its discontinuities, expressed in terms of simpler hadronic matrix elements that can be extracted from experiment. Profiting from recent developments in the determination of axial-vector transition form factors, short-distance constraints for the HLbL tensor, and the vector-vector-axial-vector correlator, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$, which meets the precision requirements set by the final result of the Fermilab experiment.</description>

      <title>Dispersion relations of relativistic radiation hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the linearised dispersion relations of shear waves, heat waves, and sound waves in relativistic ''matter+radiation'' fluids with grey absorption opacities. This is done by solving radiation hydrodynamics perturbatively in the ratio ''radiation stress-energy''/''matter stress-energy''. The resulting expressions $\omega \, {=} \, \omega(k)$ accurately describe the hydrodynamic evolution for any $k\, {\in}\, \mathbb{R}$. General features of the dynamics (e.g., covariant stability, propagation speeds, and damping of discontinuities) are argued directly from the analytic form of these dispersion relations.</description>

Abstract: The light, strange baryons have been studied through various approaches and attempted to be looked for rigorously in experiments. The screened potential has been applied to heavy baryon sector as well as meson systems in earlier works.

      <title>Impact of nonextensivity on the transport coefficients of strongly interacting QCD matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tsallis nonextensive statistics is applied to study the transport coefficients of strongly interacting matter within the Polyakov chiral SU(3) quark mean field model (PCQMF). Nonextensivity is introduced within the PCQMF model through a dimensionless $q$ parameter to examine the viscous properties such as shear viscosity ($\eta$), bulk viscosity ($\zeta_b$), and conductive properties, including electrical conductivity ($\sigma_{el}$) and thermal conductivity ($\kappa$). Additionally, some key thermodynamic quantities relevant to the transport coefficients, like the speed of sound ($c_{sq}^2$) and specific heat at constant volume ($c_{vq}$), are calculated. The temperature dependence of the transport coefficients is explored through a kinetic theory approach with the relaxation time approximation. The results are compared to the extensive case where $q$ approaches 1. The nonextensive $q$ parameter is found to have a significant effect on all transport coefficients. We find that the nonextensive behaviour of the medium enhances both specific shear viscosity $\eta/s_q$ as well as conductive coefficients $\sigma_{el}/T$ and $\kappa/T^2$. In contrast, the normalised bulk viscosity $\zeta_b/s_q$ is found to decrease as the nonextensivity of the medium increases. We have also studied the transport coefficients for finite values of chemical potentials. The magnitude of $\eta$, $\sigma_{el}$, and $\kappa$ increases at lower temperatures while $\zeta$ is found to decrease for systems with non-zero chemical potential.</description>

      <title>Extension of the integrated HydroKinetic Model to BES RHIC and GSI-FAIR nuclear collision energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The work presented is devoted to developing the integrated hydrokinetic approach (iHKM) for relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. While the previous cycle of works on this topic focused on ultra-relativistic collisions at the top RHIC and different LHC energies, the current work addresses relativistic collisions at lower energies, specifically ranging from approximately 1 to 50 GeV per nucleon pair in the center-of-mass colliding system. The formation times for the initial state of dense matter in such collisions can be up to three orders of magnitude longer than those in ultra-relativistic collisions. This reflects a fundamentally different nature and formation process, particularly concerning the possible stages of initial state evolution, including thermalization (which may be only partial at very low collision energies), subsequent hydrodynamic expansion, and the final transition of matter evolution into a hadronic cascade. These stages, which are fully realized in ultra-relativistic reactions, can also occur within the energy range of BES RHIC, albeit with distinct time scales. This publication not only advances the theoretical development of iHKM (referred to, if necessary, as the extended version of integrated Hydrokinetic Model, iHKMe), but also provides examples of model applications for calculating observables. A systematic description across a wide range of experimental energies, which is preliminary yet quite satisfactory, for spectra, flow, and femtoscopy, will follow this work.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions between baryons, especially hyperon-nucleon ($Y$-$N$) interactions, is crucial for comprehending the equation-of-state (EoS) of the nuclear matter and inner structure of neutron star. In these proceedings, we present the measurements of $p$-$\Xi^{-}$ ($\bar{p}$-$\bar{\Xi}^{+}$) correlation functions with high statistics in Isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 200 GeV by the STAR experiment. With the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approach, the source size and strong interaction parameters of $p$-$\Xi^{-}$ ($\bar{p}$-$\bar{\Xi}^{+}$) pairs are extracted.</description>

      <title>Production of Light Nuclei in Au+Au Collisions with the STAR BES-II Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The yields and ratios of light nuclei in heavy-ion collisions offer a method to distinguish between the thermal and coalescence models. Ratios such as $\rm N_t \times N_p/N_d^2$ and $\rm N_{^3He} \times N_p/N_d^2$ are suggested as potential probes to investigate critical phenomena within the QCD phase diagram. The significantly larger datasets from STAR BES-II compared to BES-I, combined with enhanced detector capabilities, allow for more precise measurements. In this proceeding, we present the centrality and energy dependence of transverse momentum spectra and particle yields of (anti-)proton, (anti-)deuteron, and $\rm ^3He$ at BES-II energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = $7.7 - 27$ GeV), as well as the light nuclei to proton yield ratios and coalescence parameters $(B_2(\rm d)$ and $B_3(\rm ^3He))$.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermalization of Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark gluon plasma created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions is a crucial theoretical question in understanding the onset of hydrodynamics, and in a broad sense, a key step to the exploration of thermalization in isolated quantum systems. Addressing this problem theoretically, in a first principle manner, requires a real-time, non-perturbative method. To this end, we carry out a fully quantum simulation on a classical hardware, of a massive Schwinger model, which well mimics QCD as it shares the important properties such as confinement and chiral symmetry breaking. We focus on the real-time evolution of the Wigner function, namely, the two-point correlation function, which approximates quark momentum distribution. In the context of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis and the evolution of entropy, our solution reveals the emergence of quantum thermalization in quark-gluon plasma with a strong coupling constant, while thermalization fails progressively as a consequence of the gradually increased significance of quantum many-body scar states in a more weakly coupled system. More importantly, we observe the non-trivial role of the topological vacuum in thermalization, as the thermalization properties differ dramatically in the parity-even and parity-odd components of the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Interacting quark matter and $f(Q)$ gravity: A new paradigm in exploring the properties of quark stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics corrections and the colour superconductivity indicate that strongly interacting matter can manifest unique physical behaviours under extreme conditions. Motivated by this notion, we investigate the interior structure and properties of quark stars composed of interacting quark matter, which provides a comprehensive avenue to explore the strong interaction effects, within the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity. A unified equation of state is formulated to describe various phases of quark matter, including up-down quark matter $(2SC)$, strange quark matter $(2SC+s)$, and the Colour-Flavor Locked $(CFL)$ phase. By employing a systematic reparametrisation and rescaling, the number of degrees of freedom in the equation of state is significantly reduced. Utilising the Buchdahl-I metric ansatz and a linear $f(Q)$ functional form, $f(Q)=\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1}Q$, we derive the exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in presence of the unified interacting quark matter equation of state. For the $2SC$ phase, we examine the properties of quark stars composed of up-down quark matter. For the $(2SC+s)$and $CFL$ phases, we incorporate the effects of a finite strange quark mass $(m_{s}\neq0)$. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations are numerically solved to determine the maximum mass-radius relations for each phase. Our results indicate that the model satisfies key physical criteria, including causality, energy conditions, and stability requirements, ensuring the viability of the configurations. Furthermore, the predicted radii for certain compact star candidates align well with observational data. The study highlights that quark stars composed of interacting quark matter within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework provide a robust and physically consistent stellar model across all considered phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the phase transition of the massive Thirring model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum computing technology has made it possible to study the thermodynamic properties of fermionic systems at finite temperatures through quantum simulations on a quantum computer. This provides a novel approach to the study of the chiral phase transition of fermionic systems. Among these, the quantum minimally entangled typical thermal states (QMETTS) algorithm has recently attracted considerable interest. The massive Thirring model, which exhibits a variety of phenomena at low temperatures, includes both a chiral phase transition and a topologically non-trivial ground state. It therefore raises the intriguing question of whether its phase transition can be studied using a quantum simulation approach. In this study, the chiral phase transition of the massive Thirring model and its dual topological phase transition are studied using the QMETTS algorithm. The results show that QMETTS is able to accurately reproduce the phase transition and thermodynamic properties of the massive Thirring model.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions III: coupled-channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formalism developed in Refs.\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal} that connects integrated correlation function of a trapped two-particle system to infinite volume scattering phase shift is further extended to coupled-channel systems in the present work. Using a trapped non-relativistic two-channel system as an example, a new relation is derived that retains the same structure as in the single channel, and has explicit dependence on the phase shifts in both channels but not on the inelasticity. The relation is illustrated by an exactly solvable coupled-channel quantum mechanical model with contact interactions. It is further validated by path integral Monte Carlo simulation of a quasi-one-dimensional model that can admit general interaction potentials. In all cases, we found rapid convergence to the infinite volume limit as the trap size is increased, even at short times, making it potentially a good candidate to overcome signal-to-noise issues in Monte Carlo applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying hyper-nuclei yields and their collectivity can shed light on their production mechanism as well as the hyperon-nucleon interactions. Heavy-ion collisions from the RHIC beam energy scan phase II (BES-II) provide an unique opportunity to understand these at high baryon densities.
  In these proceedings, we present a systematic study on energy dependence of the directed flow ($v_{1}$) for $\Lambda$ and hyper-nuclei ($^{3}_{\Lambda}{\rm H}$, $^{4}_{\Lambda}{\rm H}$) from mid-central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}$ = 3.2, 3.5, 3.9 and 4.5 GeV, collected by the STAR experiment with the fixed-target mode during BES-II. The rapidity (y) dependence of the hyper-nuclei $v_{1}$ is studied in mid-central collisions. The extracted $v_{1}$ slopes ($\mathrm{d}v_{1}/\mathrm{d}y|_{y=0}$) of the hyper-nuclei are positive and decrease gradually as the collision energy increases. These hyper-nuclei results are compared to that of light-nuclei including p, d, t/$\rm ^{3}He$ and $\rm ^{4}He$. Finally, these results are compared with a hadronic transport model including coalescence after-burner.</description>

      <title>Nucleon charges and $\sigma$-terms in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the nucleon axial, scalar and tensor charges and the nucleon $\sigma$-terms using twisted mass fermions. We employ three ensembles with approximately equal physical volume of about 5.5~fm, three values of the lattice spacing, approximately 0.06~fm, 0.07~fm and 0.08~fm, and with the mass of the degenerate up and down, strange and charm quarks tuned to approximately their physical values. We compute both isovector and isoscalar charges and $\sigma$-terms and their flavor decomposition including the disconnected contributions. We use the Akaike Information Criterion to evaluate systematic errors due to excited states and the continuum extrapolation. For the nucleon isovector axial charge we find $g_A^{u-d}=1.250(24)$, in agreement with the experimental value. Moreover, we extract the nucleon $\sigma$-terms and find for the light quark content $\sigma_{\pi N}=41.9(8.1)$~MeV and for the strange $\sigma_{s}=30(17)$~MeV.</description>

      <title>Extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model for quark and nuclear matters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the two-flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model to one capable of exploring quark and nuclear matter consistently. With an extra term standing for quark-nucleon interactions, nucleons could automatically emerge as color-singlet three-quark entities by following a process similar to mesons. Besides the quark part in mean field approximation, both mesons and nucleons could contribute to the thermodynamic potential thus possibly give rise to quarkyonic matter beyond mean field. In the study, two kinds of "confining" couplings are adopted for the new interaction term and two different quark masses are considered for comparison. It turns out that only confined nuclear matter or deconfined quark matter is possible for all the cases at zero temperature, thus quarkyonic matter is not favored at all. Even more strictly, only the case with stronger confinement effect and a smaller quark mass admits a physical first-order phase transition from nuclear matter to quark matter around twice saturation density.</description>

      <title>Three-body analysis reveals the significant contribution of minor $^{5}$He $s$-wave component in $^{6}$Li$(p,2p)^{5}$He cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $^6$Li is usually treated as an $\alpha+p+n$ three-body system, and the validity of this picture is important for understanding $^6$Li reactions. The ($p$,$2p$) reaction is a powerful method to study the structure of valence nucleons in $^6$Li. Recently, the new experimental data of the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction have been obtained and should be analyzed. We investigate the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction using the $\alpha+p+n$ three-body wave function of $^6$Li and study the validity of this model. We calculate the $^6$Li wave function by using Gaussian expansion method, and the function is used to obtain the relative wave function between $p$ and $^5$He. We combine the relative wave function with the distorted wave impulse approximation. Our results reproduce the experimental data of the triple differential cross section within about 10\% difference in the absolute values, and contributions from both $p$- and $s$-wave states of $^5$He in $^6$Li are found to be important. We can qualitatively understand the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction by describing $^6$Li with the three-body model. Contribution from the $s$-wave component is important in reproducing the experimental data in the zero recoil-momentum region.</description>

The obtained results are in good agreement with existing experimental data at 67 MeV/nucleon. We also demonstrate that the developed computational scheme can be used for investigation of nuclei spectral properties in low-energy breakup experiments on different targets.</description>

      <title>Why do newer degrees of freedom appear in higher-order truncated hydrodynamic theory?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exact derivation of relativistic hydrodynamics from an underlying microscopic theory has been shown to be an all-order theory. From the relativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of hydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all orders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that for maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must include all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation operator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of freedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders, but the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such that the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any higher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each increasing order.</description>

      <title>Configurational entropy and stability conditions of fermion and boson stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a remarkable study by M. Gleiser and N. Jiang [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92}, 044046, 2015], the authors demonstrated that the stability regions of neutron stars, within the framework of the simple Fermi gas model, and self-gravitating configurations of complex scalar field (boson stars) with various self couplings, obtained through traditional perturbation methods, correlate with critical points of the configurational entropy with an accuracy of a few percent. Recently, P. Koliogiannis \textit{et al.} [Phys. Rev. D {\bf 107}, 044069 2023] found that while the minimization of the configurational entropy generally anticipates qualitatively the stability point for neutron stars and quark stars, this approach lacks universal validity. In this work, we aim to further elucidate this issue by seeking to reconcile these seemingly contradictory findings. Specifically, we calculate the configurational entropy of bosonic and fermionic systems, described by interacting Fermi and boson gases, respectively, that form compact objects stabilized by gravity. We investigate whether the minimization of configurational entropy coincides with the stability point of the corresponding compact objects. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the stability points predicted by configurational entropy and those obtained through traditional methods, with the accuracy of this correlation showing a slight dependence on the interaction strength. Consequently, the stability of compact objects, composed of components obeying Fermi or boson statistics, can alternatively be assessed using the concept of configurational entropy.</description>

      <title>Small-$x$ gluon GPD constrained from deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production and gluon PDF through universal-moment parameterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We phenomenologically constrain the small-$x$ and small-$\xi$ gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) with the deeply virtual $J/\psi$ production (DV$J/\psi$P) in the framework of GPDs through universal moment parameterization (GUMP). We use a hybrid cross-section formula combining collinear factorization to the next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$, with corrections from non-relativistic QCD to account for the power corrections due to the heavy $J/\psi$ mass. We reach reasonable fit to the measured differential cross-sections of DV$J/\psi$P by H1 at Hadron-Electron Ring Accelerator (HERA) as well as forward gluon PDFs from JAM22 global analysis. We find that both NLO and non-relativistic corrections are significant for heavy vector meson productions. Of course, the gluon GPD we obtain still contain considerable freedom in need of inputs from other constraints, particularly in the distribution-amplitude-like region.</description>

Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>
