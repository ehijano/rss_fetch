      <title>Leslie Population Models in Predator-prey and Competitive populations: theory and applications by machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new predator-prey model by replacing the growth and predation constant by a square matrix, and the population density as a population vector. The classical Lotka-Volterra model describes a population that either modulates or converges. Stability analysis of such models have been extensively studied by the works of Merdan (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2007.06.062). The new model adds complexity by introducing an age group structure where the population of each age group evolves as prescribed by the Leslie matrix.
  The added complexity changes the behavior of the model such that the population either displays roughly an exponential growth or decay. We first provide an exact equation that describes a time evolution and use analytic techniques to obtain an approximate growth factor. We also discuss the variants of the Leslie model, i.e., the complex value predator-prey model and the competitive model. We then prove the Last Species Standing theorem that determines the dominant population in the large time limit.
  The recursive structure of the model denies the application of simple regression. We discuss a machine learning scheme that allows an admissible fit for the population evolution of Paramecium Aurelia and Paramecium Caudatum. Another potential avenue to simplify the computation is to use the machinery of quantum operators. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by computing the Hamiltonian of a simple Leslie system.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of the Time-Dependent Transmission Rate in Epidemiological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to improve the modeling, estimation, and prediction of how infectious diseases spread. SEIR-like models have been particularly successful in providing accurate short-term predictions. This study fills a notable literature gap by exploring the following question: Is it possible to incorporate a nonparametric susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) COVID-19 model into the inverse-problem regularization framework when the transmission coefficient varies over time? Our positive response considers varying degrees of disease severity, vaccination, and other time-dependent parameters. In addition, we demonstrate the continuity, differentiability, and injectivity of the operator that link the transmission parameter to the observed infection numbers. By employing Tikhonov-type regularization to the corresponding inverse problem, we establish the existence and stability of regularized solutions. Numerical examples using both synthetic and real data illustrate the model's estimation accuracy and its ability to fit the data effectively.</description>

      <title>Tractable size-structured fish growth models in natural environment with an application to an inland fish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling fish growth is an important research topic in ecological and fishery sciences because body weight statistics directly affect the total biomass of fish in a habitat, which in turn affects their population dynamics. Many models of fish growth assume that the fish population in a habitat is homogenous, meaning that there is no physiological spectrum and, therefore, no size spectrum. Moreover, models that account for the size spectrum are not always analytically tractable. We present novel mathematical models of fish growth in which the body weight of each fish is assumed to follow a von Bertalanffy-type model whose proportionality coefficient, representing the maximum body weight, may differ among individual fish. This probabilistic description introduces the size spectrum into the model, owing to which the time-dependent probability density of this model is obtained explicitly. We also consider a misspecified version and a stochastic version of the model as advanced cases. We apply the first model to the real growth data of Plecoglossus altivelis altivelis as a keystone fish species in Japan. The model successfully reproduces the skewed size spectrum of this fish species over multiple years. We further use the stochastic model to investigate how fish growth dynamics are affected by environmental fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic noise in the compartment model of time delays in evolutionary games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of strategy-dependent time delays in deterministic and stochastic compartment models of the Snowdrift game. In replicator dynamics with two compartments, adults and kindergarten, augmented by death rates, stationary states of population sizes and strategy frequencies depend continuously on time delays represented by transition rates between compartments. In the corresponding birth-death Markov jump processes we observe the novel behavior, time delays are beneficial for the cooperation strategy.</description>

      <title>Derivations of Animal Movement Models with Explicit Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly evolved animals continuously update their knowledge of social factors, refining movement decisions based on both historical and real-time observations. Despite its significance, research on the underlying mechanisms remains limited. In this study, we explore how the use of explicit memory shapes different mathematical models across various ecological dispersal scenarios. Specifically, we investigate three memory-based dispersal scenarios: gradient-based movement, where individuals respond to environmental gradients; environment matching, which promotes uniform distribution within a population; and location-based movement, where decisions rely solely on local suitability. These scenarios correspond to diffusion advection, Fickian diffusion, and Fokker-Planck diffusion models, respectively. We focus on the derivation of these memory-based movement models using three approaches: spatial and temporal discretization, patch models in continuous time, and discrete-velocity jump process. These derivations highlight how different ways of using memory lead to distinct mathematical models. Numerical simulations reveal that the three dispersal scenarios exhibit distinct behaviors under memory-induced repulsive and attractive conditions. The diffusion advection and Fokker-Planck models display wiggle patterns and aggregation phenomena, while simulations of the Fickian diffusion model consistently stabilize to uniform constant states.</description>

      <title>The asymptotic distribution of the $k$-Robinson-Foulds dissimilarity measure on labelled trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in medical bioinformatics, Khayatian et al. (2024) introduced a family of metrics on Cayley trees (the $k$-RF distance, for $k=0, \ldots, n-2$) and explored their distribution on pairs of random Cayley trees via simulations. In this paper, we investigate this distribution mathematically, and derive exact asymptotic descriptions of the distribution of the $k$-RF metric for the extreme values $k=0$ and $k=n-2$, as $n$ becomes large. We show that a linear transform of the $0$-RF metric converges to a Poisson distribution (with mean 2) whereas a similar transform for the $(n-2)$-RF metric leads to a normal distribution (with mean $\sim ne^{-2}$). These results (together with the case $k=1$ which behaves quite differently, and $k=n-3$) shed light on the earlier simulation results, and the predictions made concerning them.</description>
