      <title>EidetiCom: A Cross-modal Brain-Computer Semantic Communication Paradigm for Decoding Visual Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) facilitates direct communication between the human brain and external systems by utilizing brain signals, eliminating the need for conventional communication methods such as speaking, writing, or typing. Nevertheless, the continuous generation of brain signals in BCI frameworks poses challenges for efficient storage and real-time transmission. While considering the human brain as a semantic source, the meaningful information associated with cognitive activities often gets obscured by substantial noise present in acquired brain signals, resulting in abundant redundancy. In this paper, we propose a cross-modal brain-computer semantic communication paradigm, named EidetiCom, for decoding visual perception under limited-bandwidth constraint. The framework consists of three hierarchical layers, each responsible for compressing the semantic information of brain signals into representative features. These low-dimensional compact features are transmitted and converted into semantically meaningful representations at the receiver side, serving three distinct tasks for decoding visual perception: brain signal-based visual classification, brain-to-caption translation, and brain-to-image generation, in a scalable manner. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed paradigm facilitates the semantic communication under low bit rate conditions ranging from 0.017 to 0.192 bits-per-sample, achieving high-quality semantic reconstruction and highlighting its potential for efficient storage and real-time communication of brain recordings in BCI applications, such as eidetic memory storage and assistive communication for patients.</description>

      <title>Structure-Aware Residual-Center Representation for Self-Supervised Open-Set 3D Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods of 3D cross-modal retrieval heavily lean on category distribution priors within the training set, which diminishes their efficacy when tasked with unseen categories under open-set environments. To tackle this problem, we propose the Structure-Aware Residual-Center Representation (SRCR) framework for self-supervised open-set 3D cross-modal retrieval. To address the center deviation due to category distribution differences, we utilize the Residual-Center Embedding (RCE) for each object by nested auto-encoders, rather than directly mapping them to the modality or category centers. Besides, we perform the Hierarchical Structure Learning (HSL) approach to leverage the high-order correlations among objects for generalization, by constructing a heterogeneous hypergraph structure based on hierarchical inter-modality, intra-object, and implicit-category correlations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on four benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>CrossDehaze: Scaling Up Image Dehazing with Cross-Data Vision Alignment and Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, as computer vision tasks have increasingly relied on high-quality image inputs, the task of image dehazing has received significant attention. Previously, many methods based on priors and deep learning have been proposed to address the task of image dehazing. Ignoring the domain gap between different data, former de-hazing methods usually adopt multiple datasets for explicit training, which often makes the methods themselves be violated. To address this problem, we propose a novel method of internal and external data augmentation to improve the existing dehazing methodology. By using cross-data external augmentor. The dataset inherits samples from different domains that are firmly aligned, making the model learn more robust and generalizable features. By using the internal data augmentation method, the model can fully exploit local information within the images, thereby obtaining more image details. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we conduct training on both the Natural Image Dataset (NID) and the Remote Sensing Image Dataset (RSID). Experimental results show that our method clearly resolves the domain gap in different dehazing datasets and presents a new pipeline for joint training in the dehazing task. Our approach significantly outperforms other advanced methods in dehazing and produces dehazed images that are closest to real haze-free images.

      <title>Audio-visual training for improved grounding in video-text LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs, have led to several video-text models being proposed for critical video-related tasks. However, most of the previous works support visual input only, essentially muting the audio signal in the video. Few models that support both audio and visual input, are not explicitly trained on audio data. Hence, the effect of audio towards video understanding is largely unexplored. To this end, we propose a model architecture that handles audio-visual inputs explicitly. We train our model with both audio and visual data from a video instruction-tuning dataset. Comparison with vision-only baselines, and other audio-visual models showcase that training on audio data indeed leads to improved grounding of responses. For better evaluation of audio-visual models, we also release a human-annotated benchmark dataset, with audio-aware question-answer pairs.</description>

      <title>Arondight: Red Teaming Large Vision Language Models with Auto-generated Multi-modal Jailbreak Prompts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) extend and enhance the perceptual abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite offering new possibilities for LLM applications, these advancements raise significant security and ethical concerns, particularly regarding the generation of harmful content. While LLMs have undergone extensive security evaluations with the aid of red teaming frameworks, VLMs currently lack a well-developed one. To fill this gap, we introduce Arondight, a standardized red team framework tailored specifically for VLMs. Arondight is dedicated to resolving issues related to the absence of visual modality and inadequate diversity encountered when transitioning existing red teaming methodologies from LLMs to VLMs. Our framework features an automated multi-modal jailbreak attack, wherein visual jailbreak prompts are produced by a red team VLM, and textual prompts are generated by a red team LLM guided by a reinforcement learning agent. To enhance the comprehensiveness of VLM security evaluation, we integrate entropy bonuses and novelty reward metrics. These elements incentivize the RL agent to guide the red team LLM in creating a wider array of diverse and previously unseen test cases. Our evaluation of ten cutting-edge VLMs exposes significant security vulnerabilities, particularly in generating toxic images and aligning multi-modal prompts. In particular, our Arondight achieves an average attack success rate of 84.5\% on GPT-4 in all fourteen prohibited scenarios defined by OpenAI in terms of generating toxic text. For a clearer comparison, we also categorize existing VLMs based on their safety levels and provide corresponding reinforcement recommendations. Our multimodal prompt dataset and red team code will be released after ethics committee approval. CONTENT WARNING: THIS PAPER CONTAINS HARMFUL MODEL RESPONSES.</description>

      <title>Feeling the Grass Grow: Making Midair Haptic Parameters Visible, Touchable and Controllable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an ultrasound mid-air haptic interaction system that integrates a designed visualization of haptic parameters while maintaining ease of control. The design of corresponding haptic parameters for real-world tactile textures is a complex task. Furthermore, users often face difficulties in simultaneously controlling multi-dimensional haptic parameters to achieve the desired vibration feedback. To address these challenges, the SLS optimization method facilitates user control of these multi-dimensional parameters through a simple one-dimensional slider. Concurrently, our system employs the "Growing Grass" metaphor to visualize haptic parameter adjustments in real-time. This approach combining visual and haptic sensations can bring richer experiences and generate a realistic sensation of touching a grassy surface. Our objective is to enhance users' intuitive comprehension of haptic parameters through this innovative system.</description>

      <title>Distilling Vision-Language Foundation Models: A Data-Free Approach via Prompt Diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) has shown great potential in creating a compact student model while alleviating the dependency on real training data by synthesizing surrogate data. However, prior arts are seldom discussed under distribution shifts, which may be vulnerable in real-world applications. Recent Vision-Language Foundation Models, e.g., CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot out-of-distribution generalization, yet consuming heavy computation resources. In this paper, we discuss the extension of DFKD to Vision-Language Foundation Models without access to the billion-level image-text datasets. The objective is to customize a student model for distribution-agnostic downstream tasks with given category concepts, inheriting the out-of-distribution generalization capability from the pre-trained foundation models. In order to avoid generalization degradation, the primary challenge of this task lies in synthesizing diverse surrogate images driven by text prompts. Since not only category concepts but also style information are encoded in text prompts, we propose three novel Prompt Diversification methods to encourage image synthesis with diverse styles, namely Mix-Prompt, Random-Prompt, and Contrastive-Prompt. Experiments on out-of-distribution generalization datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with Contrastive-Prompt performing the best.</description>

      <title>Knowledge Acquisition Disentanglement for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KVQA) requires both image and world knowledge to answer questions. Current methods first retrieve knowledge from the image and external knowledge base with the original complex question, then generate answers with Large Language Models (LLMs). However, since the original question contains complex elements that require knowledge from different sources, acquiring different kinds of knowledge in a coupled manner may confuse models and hinder them from retrieving precise knowledge. Furthermore, the ``forward-only'' answering process fails to explicitly capture the knowledge needs of LLMs, which can further hurt answering quality. To cope with the above limitations, we propose DKA: Disentangled Knowledge Acquisition from LLM feedback, a training-free framework that disentangles knowledge acquisition to avoid confusion and uses LLM's feedback to specify the required knowledge. Specifically, DKA requires LLMs to specify what knowledge they need to answer the question and decompose the original complex question into two simple sub-questions: Image-based sub-question and Knowledge-based sub-question. Then we use the two sub-questions to retrieve knowledge from the image and knowledge base, respectively. In this way, two knowledge acquisition models can focus on the content that corresponds to them and avoid disturbance of irrelevant elements in the original complex question, which can help to provide more precise knowledge and better align the knowledge needs of LLMs to yield correct answers. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that DKA significantly outperforms SOTA models. To facilitate future research, our data and code are available at \url{https://github.com/Lackel/DKA}.</description>

      <title>Integrating IP Broadcasting with Audio Tags- Workflow and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broadcasting industry is increasingly adopting IP techniques, revolutionising both live and pre-recorded content production, from news gathering to live music events. IP broadcasting allows for the transport of audio and video signals in an easily configurable way, aligning with modern networking techniques. This shift towards an IP workflow allows for much greater flexibility, not only in routing signals but with the integration of tools using standard web development techniques. One possible tool could include the use of live audio tagging, which has a number of uses in the production of content. These include from automated closed captioning to identifying unwanted sound events within a scene. In this paper, we describe the process of containerising an audio tagging model into a microservice, a small segregated code module that can be integrated into a multitude of different network setups. The goal is to develop a modular, accessible, and flexible tool capable of seamless deployment into broadcasting workflows of all sizes, from small productions to large corporations. Challenges surrounding latency of the selected audio tagging model and its effect on the usefulness of the end product are discussed.</description>

      <title>HaloQuest: A Visual Hallucination Dataset for Advancing Multimodal Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hallucination has been a major problem for large language models and remains a critical challenge when it comes to multimodality in which vision-language models (VLMs) have to deal with not just textual but also visual inputs. Despite rapid progress in VLMs, resources for evaluating and addressing multimodal hallucination are limited and mostly focused on evaluation. This work introduces HaloQuest, a novel visual question answering dataset that captures various aspects of multimodal hallucination such as false premises, insufficient contexts, and visual challenges. A novel idea from HaloQuest is to leverage synthetic images, apart from real ones, to enable dataset creation at scale. With over 7.7K examples spanning across a wide variety of categories, HaloQuest was designed to be both a challenging benchmark for VLMs and a fine-tuning dataset for advancing multimodal reasoning. Our experiments reveal that current models struggle with HaloQuest, with all open-source VLMs achieving below 36% accuracy. On the other hand, fine-tuning on HaloQuest significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving performance on standard reasoning tasks. Our results discover that benchmarking with generated images is highly correlated (r=0.97) with real images. Last but not least, we propose a novel Auto-Eval mechanism that is highly correlated with human raters (r=0.99) for evaluating VLMs. In sum, this work makes concrete strides towards understanding, evaluating, and mitigating hallucination in VLMs, serving as an important step towards more reliable multimodal AI systems in the future.</description>

      <title>Exploring Transferability of Multimodal Adversarial Samples for Vision-Language Pre-training Models with Contrastive Learning</title>

Abstract: The integration of visual and textual data in Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) models is crucial for enhancing vision-language understanding. However, the adversarial robustness of these models, especially in the alignment of image-text features, has not yet been sufficiently explored. In this paper, we introduce a novel gradient-based multimodal adversarial attack method, underpinned by contrastive learning, to improve the transferability of multimodal adversarial samples in VLP models. This method concurrently generates adversarial texts and images within imperceptive perturbation, employing both image-text and intra-modal contrastive loss. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on image-text retrieval and visual entailment tasks, using publicly available datasets in a black-box setting. Extensive experiments indicate a significant advancement over existing single-modal transfer-based adversarial attack methods and current multimodal adversarial attack approaches.</description>

      <title>Reply with Sticker: New Dataset and Model for Sticker Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Using stickers in online chatting is very prevalent on social media platforms, where the stickers used in the conversation can express someone's intention/emotion/attitude in a vivid, tactful, and intuitive way. Existing sticker retrieval research typically retrieves stickers based on context and the current utterance delivered by the user. That is, the stickers serve as a supplement to the current utterance. However, in the real-world scenario, using stickers to express what we want to say rather than as a supplement to our words only is also important. Therefore, in this paper, we create a new dataset for sticker retrieval in conversation, called \textbf{StickerInt}, where stickers are used to reply to previous conversations or supplement our words\footnote{We believe that the release of this dataset will provide a more complete paradigm than existing work for the research of sticker retrieval in the open-domain online conversation.}. Based on the created dataset, we present a simple yet effective framework for sticker retrieval in conversation based on the learning of intention and the cross-modal relationships between conversation context and stickers, coined as \textbf{Int-RA}. Specifically, we first devise a knowledge-enhanced intention predictor to introduce the intention information into the conversation representations. Subsequently, a relation-aware sticker selector is devised to retrieve the response sticker via cross-modal relationships. Extensive experiments on the created dataset show that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance in sticker retrieval\footnote{The dataset and source code of this work are released at \url{https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/Int-RA}.}.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Pre-training Framework for Sequential Recommendation via Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current multimodal sequential recommendation models are often unable to effectively explore and capture correlations among behavior sequences of users and items across different modalities, either neglecting correlations among sequence representations or inadequately capturing associations between multimodal data and sequence data in their representations. To address this problem, we explore multimodal pre-training in the context of sequential recommendation, with the aim of enhancing fusion and utilization of multimodal information. We propose a novel Multimodal Pre-training for Sequential Recommendation (MP4SR) framework, which utilizes contrastive losses to capture the correlation among different modality sequences of users, as well as the correlation among different modality sequences of users and items. MP4SR consists of three key components: 1) multimodal feature extraction, 2) a backbone network, Multimodal Mixup Sequence Encoder (M2SE), and 3) pre-training tasks. After utilizing pre-trained encoders to generate initial multimodal features of items, M2SE adopts a complementary sequence mixup strategy to fuse different modality sequences, and leverages contrastive learning to capture modality interactions at the sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-item levels. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MP4SR outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both normal and cold-start settings. We further highlight the efficacy of incorporating multimodal pre-training in sequential recommendation representation learning, serving as an effective regularizer and optimizing the parameter space for the recommendation task.</description>

      <title>A Survey on 3D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03890v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (GS) has recently emerged as a transformative technique in the realm of explicit radiance field and computer graphics. This innovative approach, characterized by the utilization of millions of learnable 3D Gaussians, represents a significant departure from mainstream neural radiance field approaches, which predominantly use implicit, coordinate-based models to map spatial coordinates to pixel values. 3D GS, with its explicit scene representation and differentiable rendering algorithm, not only promises real-time rendering capability but also introduces unprecedented levels of editability. This positions 3D GS as a potential game-changer for the next generation of 3D reconstruction and representation. In the present paper, we provide the first systematic overview of the recent developments and critical contributions in the domain of 3D GS. We begin with a detailed exploration of the underlying principles and the driving forces behind the emergence of 3D GS, laying the groundwork for understanding its significance. A focal point of our discussion is the practical applicability of 3D GS. By enabling unprecedented rendering speed, 3D GS opens up a plethora of applications, ranging from virtual reality to interactive media and beyond. This is complemented by a comparative analysis of leading 3D GS models, evaluated across various benchmark tasks to highlight their performance and practical utility. The survey concludes by identifying current challenges and suggesting potential avenues for future research in this domain. Through this survey, we aim to provide a valuable resource for both newcomers and seasoned researchers, fostering further exploration and advancement in applicable and explicit radiance field representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital sports media necessitates sophisticated information retrieval systems that can efficiently parse extensive multimodal datasets. This paper introduces SoccerRAG, an innovative framework designed to harness the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract soccer-related information through natural language queries. By leveraging a multimodal dataset, SoccerRAG supports dynamic querying and automatic data validation, enhancing user interaction and accessibility to sports archives. Our evaluations indicate that SoccerRAG effectively handles complex queries, offering significant improvements over traditional retrieval systems in terms of accuracy and user engagement. The results underscore the potential of using RAG and LLMs in sports analytics, paving the way for future advancements in the accessibility and real-time processing of sports data.</description>

Abstract: The rapid evolution of digital sports media necessitates sophisticated information retrieval systems that can efficiently parse extensive multimodal datasets. This paper demonstrates SoccerRAG, an innovative framework designed to harness the power of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract soccer-related information through natural language queries. By leveraging a multimodal dataset, SoccerRAG supports dynamic querying and automatic data validation, enhancing user interaction and accessibility to sports archives. We present a novel interactive user interface (UI) based on the Chainlit framework which wraps around the core functionality, and enable users to interact with the SoccerRAG framework in a chatbot-like visual manner.</description>

      <title>MidiCaps: A large-scale MIDI dataset with text captions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models guided by text prompts are increasingly becoming more popular. However, no text-to-MIDI models currently exist due to the lack of a captioned MIDI dataset. This work aims to enable research that combines LLMs with symbolic music by presenting, the first openly available large-scale MIDI dataset with text captions. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files are widely used for encoding musical information and can capture the nuances of musical composition. They are widely used by music producers, composers, musicologists, and performers alike. Inspired by recent advancements in captioning techniques, we present a curated dataset of over 168k MIDI files with textual descriptions. Each MIDI caption describes the musical content, including tempo, chord progression, time signature, instruments, genre, and mood, thus facilitating multi-modal exploration and analysis. The dataset encompasses various genres, styles, and complexities, offering a rich data source for training and evaluating models for tasks such as music information retrieval, music understanding, and cross-modal translation. We provide detailed statistics about the dataset and have assessed the quality of the captions in an extensive listening study. We anticipate that this resource will stimulate further research at the intersection of music and natural language processing, fostering advancements in both fields.</description>

      <title>360VFI: A Dataset and Benchmark for Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the development of VR-related techniques, viewers can enjoy a realistic and immersive experience through a head-mounted display, while omnidirectional video with a low frame rate can lead to user dizziness. However, the prevailing plane frame interpolation methodologies are unsuitable for Omnidirectional Video Interpolation, chiefly due to the lack of models tailored to such videos with strong distortion, compounded by the scarcity of valuable datasets for Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. In this paper, we introduce the benchmark dataset, 360VFI, for Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. We present a practical implementation that introduces a distortion prior from omnidirectional video into the network to modulate distortions. We especially propose a pyramid distortion-sensitive feature extractor that uses the unique characteristics of equirectangular projection (ERP) format as prior information. Moreover, we devise a decoder that uses an affine transformation to facilitate the synthesis of intermediate frames further. 360VFI is the first dataset and benchmark that explores the challenge of Omnidirectional Video Frame Interpolation. Through our benchmark analysis, we presented four different distortion conditions scenes in the proposed 360VFI dataset to evaluate the challenge triggered by distortion during interpolation. Besides, experimental results demonstrate that Omnidirectional Video Interpolation can be effectively improved by modeling for omnidirectional distortion.</description>
