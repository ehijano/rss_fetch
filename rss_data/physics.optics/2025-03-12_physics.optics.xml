      <title>An integrated widely tunable linear isolator based on electro-optic Autler-Townes splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical isolators are essential for laser protection and robust signal routing, but the incorporation of the necessary magneto-optic (MO) materials in foundries has remained a challenge. As an alternative, several integrated non-magnetic isolators based on acousto-optic (AO) and electro-optic (EO) spatio-temporal modulation have been proposed. Unlike MO isolators, these solutions are wavelength agnostic, though few published demonstrations reach performance that is comparable to MO devices. The most significant remaining concerns are on mitigating undesirable sidebands, lowering power consumption, achieving wide bandwidth or wide tunability, and having a design that is practical to deploy. Here we demonstrate a compact EO optical isolator, using thin film lithium niobate, that produces a very high isolation figure of merit (&gt;32 dB contrast per dB of insertion loss) with THz-scale (8 nm) tunability and, due to its architecture, achieves linear operation with negligible sideband generation. The device uses a 20x smaller interaction length and consumes 64x less power compared to the state-of-the-art EO and AO architectures, without being subject to many of their technical constraints.</description>

      <title>Identification and Removal of System-Induced Autofluorescence in Miniaturized Fiber-optic Fluorescence Endoscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Miniaturized fiber-optic fluorescence endoscopes play a crucial role in medical diagnostics and research, but system-induced autofluorescence remains a significant challenge, particularly in single-fiber setups. While recent advances, such as double-clad fiber (DCF) and DCF couplers, have reduced background noise, complete elimination remains challenging. Research on the various sources of system-induced autofluorescence and the methods to remove them are scarce. This study seeks to fulfill this need by proposing practical approaches to removal of system-induced autofluorescence. This study presents the methods to suppress static background noise and proposes an algorithm based on least-squares linear spectral unmixing to remove variable system-induced autofluorescence artifacts. The algorithm was evaluated on a single-fiber DCF intravascular imaging system, with phantom and rodent in vivo experiments confirming its effectiveness. Results showed accurate differentiation between true sample fluorescence and system-induced autofluorescence artifacts through the validation with optical coherence tomography images and histology results, further verified by statistical analysis. Unlike simple background subtraction, the method addresses dynamic variations in background noise and incidental artifacts, providing robust performance under varying conditions. Our method may be adapted to various fiber-based endoscopy setups and be compatible with different fluorescent agents and autofluorescence imaging, broadening its applicability in biomedical imaging.</description>

      <title>Observation of Topological Armchair Edge States in Photonic Biphenylene Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge states in 2D materials are vital for advancements in spintronics, quantum computing, and logic transistors. For graphene nanoribbons, it is well known that the zigzag edges can host edge states, but realization of armchair edge states has been challenging without breaking the time-reversal symmetry. Here, by using a photonic analog of recently synthesized graphene-like biphenylene network (BPN), we demonstrate topological in-gap edge states particularly at the armchair edges. Interestingly, several bulk states preserve the characteristics of edge states along the armchair boundaries, manifesting an unusual hybridization between the edge and bulk states. Experimentally, we observe both zigzag and armchair edge states in photonic BPN lattices written in a nonlinear crystal. Furthermore, we clarify the different features of the armchair boundary between the BPN and graphene lattices. Our results demonstrated here may be applicable to carbon-based BPNs and other artificial platforms beyond photonics, holding promise for expanding the application scope of 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Phase-matching of high harmonic generation in twisted solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic generation (HHG) in solids could enable attosecond and ultraviolet light sources with high compactness, great controllability and rich functions. However, the HHG process is accompanied by a quite large wavevector mismatch that is uncompensated by any traditional phase-matching method, directly limiting its energy conversion efficiency. Here, we propose an effective strategy for phase-matching of HHG with arbitrary harmonic orders in solids. Two flakes of solids with an interlayer twist induce a nonlinear optical phase that depends on the crystal symmetry, twist angle and harmonic order, which can be accurately designed to compensate for the phase mismatch in HHG. Guided by the twist-phase-matching theory, we achieved a record-high conversion efficiency of $~1.5\times10^{-5}$ for the fifth HHG in twisted hexagonal boron nitride crystals with a total thickness of only 1 ${\mu}m$. Our work establishes a foundation for developing ultrashort-wavelength and ultrafast-pulse laser sources in compact solid-state tabletop systems for fundamental and applied sciences.</description>

      <title>In-situ dynamic spatial reconfiguration of nanoplasmonics using photothermal-shock tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic reconfiguration is crucial for nanoplasmonic structures to achieve diversified functions and optimize performances; however, the dynamic reconfiguration of spatial arrangements remains a formidable technological challenge. Here, we showcase in-situ dynamic spatial reconfiguration of plasmonic nanowire devices and circuits on dry solid substrates, by harnessing a photothermal-shock tweezers platform. Owing to its versatility, nanoscale precision, real-time operation, and large external output force, the multimodal platform enables dexterous fine-tuning of positions, overlap lengths, and coupling distances and orientations of discrete components in situ. Spatial position-dependent optical properties that have not been reported before or are challenging to achieve through traditional micro/nanomanipulation are easily tuned and observed, such as the intensity evolution of axial photon-plasmon coupling from near field to far field, and the resonant mode evolution of photonic cavity-plasmonic cavity coupling from weak to strong. We also employ the nanorobotic probe-based operation mode to optimize the side-mode suppression ratios of single-mode lasers and the intensity splitting ratios of 3-dB couplers. Our results are general and applicable to materials of almost any size, structure, and material type, as well as other narrow or curved micro/nano-waveguide surfaces, which opens new avenues for reconfigurable nanoplasmonic structures with dynamically tunable spatial features.</description>

      <title>70 MW-level picosecond mid-infrared radiation generation by difference frequency generation in AgGaS2, BaGa4Se7, LiGaSe2, and LiGaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparative study of nonlinear crystals for picosecond difference frequency generation in mid-IR is presented. Nonlinear crystals of AgGaS$_2$, BaGa$_4$Se$_7$, LiGaSe$_2$, and LiGaS$_2$ were studied. Samples of AgGaS$_2$, BaGa$_4$Se$_7$, LiGaSe$_2$, and LiGaS$_2$ were tested in thee sets having lengths of 2, 4, or 8 mm. In order to investigate the dependence of efficiency on the crystal length, three sets of crystals with lengths of 2, 4, or 8 mm were tested. The developed tunable DFG system was driven by the 1.03 $\mu$m, 1.8 ps, Yb:YAG thin-disk laser system operated at the repetition rate of 10 or 100 Hz. As the best result, picosecond mid-IR pulses at a wavelength of $\sim$7 $\mu$m with the energy up to 130 $\mu$J corresponding to the peak power of $\sim$72 MW were generated using the 8 mm long LiGaS$_2$ crystal. Using the BaGa$_4$Se$_7$ crystal, DFG tunability in the wavelength range from 6 up to 13 $\mu$m was achieved.</description>

      <title>Design and Construction of an Affordable Adjustable Repetition Rate Optical Frequency Comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed and built an adjustable repetition rate optical frequency comb using off-the-shelf components with several improvements to an established erbium fiber design. This design, built fully by an undergraduate, was assembled at a fraction of the cost of a commercial comb. This comb has a repetition rate of roughly 100 MHz with a tuning range of 3 MHz. A stabilization control loop for $f_{rep}$ achieved long term drifts of &lt; 1 Hz over several days. This comb will eventually be implemented for use in dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Effect of imaginary gauge on wave transport in driven-dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wave transport in disordered media is a fundamental problem with direct implications in condensed matter, materials science, optics, atomic physics, and even biology. The majority of studies are focused on Hermitian systems to understand disorder-induced localization. However, recent studies of non-Hermitian disordered media have revealed unique behaviors, with a universal principle emerging that links the eigenvalue spectrum of the disordered Hamiltonian and its statistics with its transport properties. In this work we show that the situation can be very different in driven-dissipative lattices of cavities, where a uniform gain applied equally to all the components of the system can act as a knob for controlling the wave transport properties without altering the eigenvalue statistics of the underlying Hamiltonian. Our results open a new avenue for developing a deeper insight into the transport properties in disordered media and will aid in building new devices as well. Our work which is presented in the context of optics generalizes to any physical platforms where gain can be implemented. These include acoustics, electronics, and coupled quantum oscillators such as atoms, diamond centers and superconducting qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel methodology for extracting material parameters from spectroscopic optical data using a physics-based neural network. The proposed model integrates classical optimization frameworks with a multi-scale object detection framework, specifically exploring the effect of incorporating physics into the neural network. We validate and analyze its performance on simulated transmission spectra at terahertz and infrared frequencies. Compared to traditional model-based approaches, our method is designed to be autonomous, robust, and time-efficient, making it particularly relevant for industrial and societal applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Bragg microcavities in collisions of unipolar light pulses of unusual shape in two- and three-level medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unipolar light pulses with a non-zero electric area due to the unidirectional action on charged particles can be used for the ultrafast control of the properties of quantum systems. To control atomic properties in an efficient way, it is necessary to vary the temporal shape of the pulses used. This has led to the problem of obtaining pulses of an unusual shape, such as a rectangular one. A number of new phenomena, not possible with conventional multi-cycle pulses, were discovered by analyzing the interaction of such unipolar pulses with matter. These include the formation of dynamic microcavities at each resonant transition of a multilevel medium when such pulses collide with the medium. In this work, we compare the behavior of dynamic microcavities in a two-level and a three-level medium when unipolar pulses of unusual shape (rectangular) are collided with the medium. We do this on the basis of the numerical solution of the system for the density matrix of the medium and the wave equation for the electric field. Medium parameters correspond to atomic hydrogen. It is shown that for rectangular pulses in a three-level medium, the dynamics of the cavities can be very different from the two-level model, as opposed to pulses of other shapes (e.g. Gaussian shape). When the third level of the medium is taken into account, the self-induced transparency-like regime disappears. Differences in the dynamics of resonators in a three-level medium are revealed when the pulses behave like 2{\pi} pulses of self-induced transparency.</description>

Abstract: Multi-node optical clock networks will enable future studies of fundamental physics and enable applications in quantum and classical communications as well as navigation and geodesy. We implement the first ever multi-node optical clock network with real-time, relative synchronization over free-space communication channels and precision on the order of 10 fs, realized as a three-node system in a hub-and-spoke topology. In this paper we describe the system and its performance, including a new, independent, out-of-loop verification of two-way optical time synchronization.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Noise Quenching of An Integrated Frequency Comb</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrated frequency combs promise transformation of lab-based metrology into disruptive real-world applications. These microcombs are, however, sensitive to stochastic thermal fluctuations of the integrated cavity refractive index, with its impact becoming more significant as the cavity size becomes smaller. This tradeoff between microcomb noise performance and footprint stands as a prominent obstacle to realizing applications beyond a controlled lab environment. Here, we demonstrate that small footprint and low noise become compatible through the all-optical Kerr-induced synchronization (KIS) method. Our study unveils that the phase-locking nature of the synchronization between the cavity soliton and the injected reference pump laser enables the microcomb to no longer be limited by internal noise sources. Instead, the microcomb noise is mostly limited by external sources, namely, the frequency noise of the two pumps that doubly pin the microcomb. First, we theoretically and experimentally show that the individual comb tooth linewidths of an octave-spanning microcomb remain within the same order-of-magnitude as the pump lasers, contrary to the single-pumped case that exhibits a more than two order-of-magnitude increase from the pump to the comb edge. Second, we theoretically show that intrinsic noise sources such as thermorefractive noise in KIS are quenched at the cavity decay rate, greatly decreasing its impact. Experimentally, we show that even with free-running lasers, the KIS microcomb can exhibit better repetition rate noise performance than the predicted thermorefractive noise limitation in absence of KIS.</description>

      <title>Quasiannealed Monte Carlo method for light transport in strongly heterogeneous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random-walk Monte Carlo simulations are widely used to predict the optical properties of complex, disordered materials. In presence of large heterogeneities (e.g., spatially-extended nonscattering regions in a turbid environment), an explicit description of the micro and macrostructures and of the light propagation therein is generally required, in addition to a statistical average over a representative set of microstructures, thereby making simulations in so-called ``quenched'' disorder particularly time-consuming. We explore here the possibility to model light transport in finite-size strongly heterogeneous media without an explicit description of the underlying microstructure but from the knowledge of typical random-walk trajectories in infinite-size media, that take correlations between successive interaction events into account. Simulations may thus be performed for media of any macroscopic shape and size more efficiently. We illustrate this approach, coined ``quasiannealed'', with the case of a two-phase emulsion consisting of transparent spherical droplets dispersed in a turbid medium. Good agreement with predictions from simulations in quenched disorder on the reflectance of finite-thickness slab is found for a large set of microstructure properties and thicknesses with typical errors on the reflectance on the order of a percent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a powerful and robust coherent imaging method providing access to the complex object and probe (illumination). Ptychography reconstruction is typically performed using first-order methods due to their computational efficiency. Higher-order methods, while potentially more accurate, are often prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. In this study, we present a mathematical framework for reconstruction using second-order information, derived from an efficient computation of the bilinear Hessian and Hessian operator. The formulation is provided for Gaussian based models, enabling the simultaneous reconstruction of the object, probe, and object positions. Synthetic data tests, along with experimental near-field ptychography data processing, demonstrate a ten-fold reduction in computation time compared to first-order methods. The derived formulas for computing the Hessians, along with the strategies for incorporating them into optimization schemes, are well-structured and easily adaptable to various ptychography problem formulations.</description>

      <title>Designing Refractive Index Fluids of Food Dye for Light Propagation through Scattering Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scattering and absorption are fundamental processes in optical engineering and applications. This study investigates the use of the food dye tartrazine to design refractive index fluids that enhance light propagation through scattering media. The optical properties of the solutions were carefully examined using spectrometry and ellipsometry under two extreme conditions, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive understanding of dye solutions. Additionally, we demonstrated using dye molecules to control light propagation through scattering media. Our findings highlight the potential of food dyes as cost-effective, environmentally friendly alternatives for future advancements in biomedical imaging, optical communication, and photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Entropy Computing: A Paradigm for Optimization in an Open Quantum System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04512v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern quantum technologies using matter are designed as closed quantum systems to isolate them from interactions with the environment. This design paradigm greatly constrains the scalability and limits practical implementation of such systems. Here, we introduce a novel computing paradigm, entropy computing, that works by conditioning a quantum reservoir thereby enabling the stabilization of a ground state. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses measurement-based feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Parameter-Efficient Electromagnetic Surrogate Solver for Broadband Field Prediction using Discrete Wavelength Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, electromagnetic surrogate solvers, trained on solutions of Maxwell's equations under specific simulation conditions, enabled real-time inference of computationally expensive simulations. However, conventional surrogate solvers often consider only a narrow range of simulation parameters and fail when encountering even slight variations in simulation conditions. To address this limitation, we propose a broadband surrogate solver capable of providing solutions across a continuous range of wavelengths, even when trained on discrete wavelength data. Our approach leverages a Wave-Informed element-wise Multiplicative Encoding and a Fourier Group Convolutional Shuffling operator to mitigate overfitting while capturing the fundamental characteristics of Maxwell's equations. Compared to the state-of-the-art surrogate solver, our model achieves a 74% reduction in parameters, an 80.5% improvement in prediction accuracy for untrained wavelengths, demonstrating superior generalization and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Synthetic-lattice Bloch wave dynamics in a single-mode microwave resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Frequency-based synthetic dimensions are a promising avenue to extend the dimensionality of photonic systems. In this work, we show how a tilted synthetic lattice is naturally realised by periodically modulating a single-mode resonator under a coherent monochromatic drive. We theoretically study the Bloch wave dynamics in the tilted synthetic lattice, which gives rise to peculiar features in the spectral distribution of the cavity field. Our predictions are experimentally confirmed using a planar tunable superconducting microwave resonator.</description>

      <title>Characterizing topological pumping of charges in exactly solvable Rice-Mele chains of the non-Hermitian variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the nature of the Thouless charge-pumping for a non-Hermitian (NH) generalization of the one-dimensional (1d) Rice-Mele model, considering a variety which allows closed-form analytical solutions for the eigensystems. The two-band system is subjected to an ``adiabatic'' time-periodic drive, which effectively gives us a closed two-dimensional (2d) manifold in the momentum-frequency space, mimicking a 2d Brillouin zone (BZ) for periodic boundary conditions. For open boundary conditions, we formulate the non-Bloch generalized Brillouin zone (GBZ). All these allow us to compute the Chern numbers of the 2d manifolds emerging for various parameter values, using the BZ or GBZ, which are well-defined integers in the gapped regions of the spectra. If Thouless pumping still holds for NH situations, the expectation values of the net displacement for the particles occupying a given band within a cycle, calculated using the right and left eigenvectors of a biorthogonal basis for the complex Hamiltonians, would coincide with the Chern numbers. However, we find that there are deviations from the expected quantized values whenever the spectra exhibit strongly-fluctuating magnitudes of the imaginary parts of the (generically) complex eigenvalues. This implies that we need to address the question of how to meaningfully define time-evolution, as well as adiabaticity, in the context of NH systems.</description>

      <title>A novel spectroscopic probe of ultrafast magnetization dynamics in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18312v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of spectroscopic techniques in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral range has significantly advanced the understanding of ultrafast interactions in magnetic systems triggered by optical excitation. In this work, we introduce a previously missing geometry that facilitates the observation of the ultrafast magnetization dynamics of magnetic systems with an out-of-plane magnetization grown on XUV opaque substrates. This novel approach to probe ultrafast magnetization dynamics combines the magneto-optical Kerr effect with the strong dependence of a sample's reflectance near its Brewster angle. It therefore works with linearly polarized light and does not require any additional polarizing optics. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the technique by presenting both simulations and experimental data as a function of the energy and the polarization of the XUV probe radiation as well as of the delay time after optical excitation.</description>
