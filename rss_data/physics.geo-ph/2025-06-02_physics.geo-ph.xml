      <title>Real-time processing of distributed acoustic sensing data for earthquake monitoring operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modular software framework designed to integrate distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data into operational earthquake monitoring systems. Building on the infrastructure of the Advanced National Seismic System (ANSS) and the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN), which employs the ANSS Quake Monitoring Software (AQMS), our solution supports real-time DAS waveform streaming and machine-learning-based traveltime picking to leverage the dense spatial sampling of DAS arrays. To enable seamless compatibility with the AQMS, our approach uses standardized seismic data formats to incorporate predetermined DAS channels. We demonstrate the integration of data from a 100-km-long DAS array deployed in Ridgecrest, California, and provide a detailed description of the software components and deployment strategy. This work represents a step toward incorporating DAS into routine seismic monitoring and opens new possibilities for real-time hazard assessment using fiber-optic networks.</description>

      <title>On nonlinear transitions, minimal seeds and exact solutions for the geodynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly fifty years ago, Roberts (1978) postulated that Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent motions of liquid metal in its outer core, likely results from a subcritical (finite-amplitude) dynamo instability characterised by a dominant balance between Coriolis, pressure and Lorentz forces. Here we numerically explore subcritical convective dynamo action in a spherical shell, using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems theory to uncover the nonlinear dynamics of magnetic field generation. Through nonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal seed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo solution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable and unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining these two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are revealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the geodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark of Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more extreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches a nonlinear dynamo solution by first approaching an unstable travelling wave solution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a magnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost functional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can systematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior knowledge of its structure.</description>
