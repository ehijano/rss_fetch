      <title>A kinetic-magnetohydrodynamic model with adaptive mesh refinement for modeling heliosphere neutral-plasma interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The charge exchange between the interstellar medium (ISM) and the solar wind plasma is crucial for determining the structures of the heliosphere. Since both the neutral-ion and neutral-neutral collision mean free paths are either comparable to or larger than the size of the heliosphere, the neutral phase space distribution can deviate far away from the Maxwellian distribution. A kinetic description for the neutrals is crucial for accurately modeling the heliosphere. It is computationally challenging to run three-dimensional (3D) time-dependent kinetic simulations due to the large number of macro-particles. In this paper, we present the new highly efficient SHIELD-2 model with a kinetic model of neutrals and a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model for the ions and electrons. To improve the simulation efficiency, we implement adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) and particle splitting and merging algorithms for the neutral particles to reduce the particle number that is required for an accurate simulation. We present several tests to verify and demonstrate the capabilities of the model.</description>

      <title>Statistical analysis of IUVB values in Mexico City from 2000 to 2022</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar radiation are electromagnetic waves, composed of infrared, visible spectrum and ultraviolet. The infrared component is the cause of thermal energy, the visible spectrum allows to see and the ultraviolet component is the most energetic part and dangerous for the human body (skin and eyes). The ultraviolet rays are divided in a wavelength range, in three parts; called UVA (100-280 nm), UVB (280-315 nm) and UVC (315-400 nm). The UVC are the most energetic (followed by the UVB rays ), however are stopped in the ozone layer. In this work it shown a statistical analysis of the UVB index measured by five station in Mexico City, from the years 2000 to 2022. Through a Gaussian fit distribution, it was found that the range when the IUVB value exceeds the value of seven, which is from 11:00 to 16:00, having an average mean value of 13:09 hrs. $\pm$ 4 min. i.e. the time at which the UVB index reaches its maximum value. This occurs in the months from February to October. More than 80% of radiation is for UVB values less than 7 and less than the remaining 20% is for IUVB values greater than 7. Finally, it was possible to observe that the mean value per year, reaches its maximum when the solar cycles occurs, which was in the years 2003 and 2013.</description>

      <title>Plasma motions in the solar corona and solar wind to 1 au, as inferred from radio wave scattering observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio signals propagating via the solar corona and solar wind are significantly affected by compressive waves, impacting solar burst properties as well as sources viewed through the turbulent atmosphere. While static fluctuations scatter radio waves elastically, moving, turbulent or oscillating density irregularities act to broaden the frequency of the scattered waves. Using a new anisotropic density fluctuation model based on solar radio bursts, we deduce the plasma velocities required to explain observations of spacecraft signal frequency broadening. The frequency broadening is consistent with motions that are dominated by the solar wind at distances $\gtrsim 10$ $R_\odot$, but the levels of frequency broadening for $\lesssim 10$ $R_\odot$ require additional radial speeds $\sim (100-300)$ km s$^{-1}$ and/or transverse speeds $\sim (20-70)$ km s$^{-1}$. The inferred radial velocities appear consistent with the sound or proton thermal speeds, while the speeds perpendicular to the radial direction are consistent with non-thermal motions measured via coronal Doppler-line broadening, interpreted as Alfv\'enic fluctuations. Landau damping of parallel propagating ion-sound (slow MHD) waves allow an estimate of the proton heating rate. The energy deposition rates due to ion-sound wave damping peak at a heliocentric distance of $\sim(1-3)$ $R_\odot$ are comparable to the rates available from a turbulent cascade of Alfv\'enic waves at large scales, suggesting a coherent picture of energy transfer, via the cascade or/and parametric decay of Alfv\'en waves to the small scales where heating takes place.</description>

      <title>Complexity Heliophysics: A lived and living history of systems and complexity science in Heliophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This review examines complexity science in Heliophysics, describing it not as a discipline, but as a paradigm. In the context of Heliophysics, complexity science is the study of a star, interplanetary environment, magnetosphere, upper and terrestrial atmospheres, and planetary surface as interacting subsystems. Complexity science studies entities in a system (e.g., electrons in an atom, planets in a solar system, individuals in a society) and their interactions, and is the nature of what emerges from these interactions. It is a paradigm that employs systems approaches and is inherently multi- and cross-scale. Heliophysics processes span at least 15 orders of magnitude in space and another 15 in time, and its reaches go well beyond our own solar system and Earth's space environment to touch planetary, exoplanetary, and astrophysical domains. It is an uncommon domain within which to explore complexity science.
  This review article excavates the lived and living history of complexity science in Heliophysics. It identifies five dimensions of complexity science. It then proceeds in three epochal parts: 1) A pivotal year in the Complexity Heliophysics paradigm: 1996; 2) The transitional years that established foundations of the paradigm (1996-2010); and 3) The emergent literature largely beyond 2010.
  The history reveals a grand challenge that confronts most physical sciences to understand the research intersection between fundamental science (e.g., complexity science) and applied science (e.g., artificial intelligence and machine learning). A risk science framework is suggested as a way of formulating the challenges in a way that the two converge.
  The intention is to provide inspiration and guide future research. It will be instructive to Heliophysics researchers, but also to any reader interested in or hoping to advance the frontier of systems and complexity science.</description>
