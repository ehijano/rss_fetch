      <title>Anomalous Spontaneous Emission Enhancement by Non-Hermitian Momentum-Space Bound States in the Continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional Purcell theory emphasizes high quality factors (Q) for spontaneous emission (SE) enhancement in cavities, but overlooks collective Bloch mode effects in periodic nanostructures like photonic crystal slabs. We introduce a unified temporal coupled-mode framework to compute Purcell and photoluminescence factors through momentum-space integration, revealing anomalous SE enhancement by non-Hermitian momentum-space bound states in the continuum (BICs). In silicon gratings with comparable effective mode volumes, this yields substantial SE enhancement in low-Q regimes--defying the traditional high-Q paradigm and inversely correlated with system Q--while emission rates are stably twice the photoluminescence, eliminating critical coupling requirements. Unique spectral profiles, contradicting Lorentzian/Fano assumptions, arise from collective mode interactions. Full-wave simulations confirm these challenges to conventional wisdom, with non-Hermitian BICs outperforming high-Q designs across broad numerical apertures. This establishes a novel paradigm leveraging non-Hermiticity and topological protection for robust, bright emitters, redefining nanophotonic applications in lasers and light-emitting diodes</description>

      <title>High resolution Fluorescence lifetime IMaging Micro-Endoscopy (FLIMME) using a single multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endoscopic optical imaging using a single multimode fiber (MMF) has emerged as a promising approach for highly compact, minimally invasive, and high-resolution imaging. Unlike conventional fiber bundles, MMF-based endomicroscopes exploit the controlled excitation of multiple spatially overlapping modes in a single MMF. of core diameters of tens of micrometers. to deliver and collect light to form images with sub-micrometer resolution. Here, we introduce a fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) modality to the MMF endomicroscope. We use amplitude modulation of a 405 nm single-mode light source at radio frequency (RF) and lock-in detection of autofluorescence to obtain intensity and lifetime images at sub-micrometer resolution. We experimentally demonstrate the capability of the ultrathin endomicroscope to perform label-free imaging in thick ex vivo murine submandibular gland tissue. With a temporal resolution of 0.03 ns, the FLIM images show distinguished structures of lifetime differences down to 0.5 ns. The combination of sub-micrometer fluorescence intensity and lifetime images in a minimally invasive endomicroscope opens new avenues for label-free cancer detection.</description>

      <title>Unitary transformation approach to the paraxial wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for the paraxial wave equation based on propagation-dependent unitary transformations closely related to the Lewis-Ermakov invariant. This approach establishes a formal equivalence between free-space propagation and the dynamics in a quadratic gradient index (GRIN) medium. In this context, the dynamical invariant and the free-space Hamiltonian do not commute at the initial propagation stage due to Gaussian modulation, which imposes an effective quadratic confinement. Exact commutativity would only be possible for an infinitely wide, nonsquare-integrable optical field; therefore, any finite-energy beam propagates as if it were subject to a quadratic GRIN-like potential. The unitary transformation approach reveals how the Gaussian envelope of physical beams leads to effective harmonic confinement and connects the propagation dynamics to oscillator-like invariants. This method enables the derivation of stationary solutions in different coordinate systems by mapping to an effective quadratic-like medium and establishes a direct link to the zero-frequency Ermakov equation and the Lewis-Ermakov invariants.</description>

      <title>Data driven approaches in nanophotonics: A review of AI-enabled metadevices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven approaches have revolutionized the design and optimization of photonic metadevices by harnessing advanced artificial intelligence methodologies. This review takes a model-centric perspective that synthesizes emerging design strategies and delineates how traditional trial-and-error and computationally intensive electromagnetic simulations are being supplanted by deep learning frameworks that efficiently navigate expansive design spaces. We discuss artificial intelligence implementation in several metamaterial design aspects from high-degree-of-freedom design to large language model-assisted design. By addressing challenges such as transformer model implementation, fabrication limitations, and intricate mutual coupling effects, these AI-enabled strategies not only streamline the forward modeling process but also offer robust pathways for the realization of multifunctional and fabrication-friendly nanophotonic devices. This review further highlights emerging opportunities and persistent challenges, setting the stage for next-generation strategies in nanophotonic engineering.</description>

      <title>Simple Method for Stripping Polyimide-Coated Optical Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple method for removing polyimide coatings from optical fibers using inexpensive and readily available solvents. Impacts of solvent mixing ratios, soak temperature, material expansion, wicking, and drying are described to provide empirical context for the method. We find that soaking fibers for six hours in a 2:1 mixture of methanol to acetone at room temperature enables easy stripping of a length slightly greater than the soak length.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Quasi-BIC Metasurfaces for Ultra-Sensitive Biosensing and High-Speed Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a revolutionary paradigm in terahertz (THz) photonics, enabling metasurfaces with theoretically infinite quality factors (Q-factors) and unprecedented light-matter control. This review synthesizes a decade of progress in THz-BIC research, tracing the evolution from foundational symmetry-protected designs to application-optimized quasi-BICs. We dissect multipolar origins, topological robustness, and symmetry-breaking strategies underpinning high-Q resonances, alongside computational frameworks for predictive design. The timeline highlights key milestones: early dielectric metasurfaces with high Q-factor, flexible biosensors achieving microgram detection limits, and Kerker-conditioned gas spectrometers reducing path lengths by few orders of magnitude. Emerging frontiers in reconfigurable MEMS-BICs and chiral quantum photonics are critically evaluated. Despite breakthroughs, scalability barriers persist for 6G integration, including nano-fabrication tolerances, material loss trade-offs, and dynamic control gaps. This review establishes BIC metasurfaces as pivotal enablers of compact, high-efficiency THz technologies poised to bridge the gap between fundamental discovery and commercialization of THz-based 6G communication and MedTech.</description>

      <title>Electrically-pumped soliton microcombs on thin-film lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has enabled efficient on-chip electro-optic modulation and frequency conversion for information processing and precision measurement. Extending these capabilities with optical frequency combs unlocks massively parallel operations and coherent optical-to-microwave transduction, which are achievable in TFLN microresonators via Kerr microcombs. However, fully integrated Kerr microcombs directly driven by semiconductor lasers remain elusive, which has delayed integration of these technologies. Here we demonstrate electrically pumped TFLN Kerr microcombs without optical amplification. With optimized laser-to-chip coupling and optical quality factors, we generate soliton microcombs at a 200 GHz repetition frequency with an optical span of 180 nm using only 25 mW of pump power. Moreover, self-injection locking enables turnkey initiation and substantially narrows the laser linewidth. Our work provides integrated comb sources for TFLN-based communicational, computational, and metrological applications.</description>

      <title>Higher-order exceptional points unveiled by nilpotence and mathematical induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can have peculiar degeneracies of eigenstates called exceptional points (EPs). An EP of $n$ degenerate states is said to have order $n$, and higher-order EPs (HEPs) with $n \ge 3$ exhibit rich intrinsic features potential for applications. However, traditional eigenvalue-based searches for HEPs are facing fundamental limitations in terms of complexity and implementation. Here, we propose a design paradigm for HEPs based on a simple property for matrices termed nilpotence and concise inductive procedure. The nilpotence always guarantees a HEP with designated order and helps divide the problem. Our inductive routine can repeatedly double EP order starting from known designs, such as a $2 \times 2$ parity-time-symmetric Hamiltonian. By applying our framework, we readily design reciprocal photonic cavity systems operating at HEPs with up to $n=14$ and find their unconventionally chiral, transparent, and enhanced responses. Our work opens up extensive possibilities for investigations and applications of HEPs in various physical systems.</description>

      <title>All-optical logic gates for extreme ultraviolet switching via attosecond four-wave mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All-optical logic-gate-based switching is a prerequisite for photonic computing. This article introduces a logic-gate protocol for noncollinear four-wave mixing (FWM) of one attosecond extreme ultraviolet (XUV) with two few-femtosecond near infrared (NIR) pulses. Simulations show that the NIR carrier-envelope phases (CEPs) alter the spatial distribution of the XUV FWM emission, using doubly-excited states of gas-phase helium as an example. A complete set of logic gates$-$X(N)OR, (N)AND, and (N)OR$-$is realized for the 2s3p FWM signal at 63.66 eV with switching contrasts of 3.6 to 10.4. This theoretical study extends all-optical logic switching to the XUV and x-ray regimes and opens a new pathway for ultrafast photonic logic.</description>

      <title>Full-Field Brillouin Microscopy with a Scanning Fabry-Perot Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brillouin microscopy is an emerging optical technique for probing mechanical properties with submicron resolution, offering fully non-contact, label-free operation. Despite its unique capabilities, broader adoption has been limited by slow acquisition speeds, particularly in systems based on scanning Fabry-Perot interferometers (FPIs). Based on prior implementations, FPIs have typically been considered too slow for practical imaging, particularly when both spatial and spectral precision are required. Here, we demonstrate that a standard multi-pass tandem FPI can be repurposed for full-field Brillouin imaging when operated in a spectral filtering mode. Combined with light-sheet illumination for uniform, low-dose excitation, this configuration enables rapid, spatially resolved acquisition of Brillouin spectra. By restricting scanning to a narrow frequency range around the Brillouin peak, we acquired a full 2D image within one minute, achieving millisecond-scale single pixel dwell times and micrometer-scale spatial resolution. The system uniquely supports Brillouin emission imaging at selected frequency shifts, a capability not available with other spontaneous Brillouin implementations. Results from synthetic and biological specimens demonstrate how existing FPI-based setups can be extended to full-field imaging and outline a pathway toward future dedicated FPI instruments optimized for high-speed, high-contrast Brillouin microscopy.</description>

      <title>Color2Struct: efficient and accurate deep-learning inverse design of structural color with controllable inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized many fields such as materials design and protein folding. Recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of DL in the inverse design of structural colors, by effectively learning the complex nonlinear relations between structure parameters and optical responses, as dictated by the physical laws of light. While several models, such as tandem neural networks and generative adversarial networks, have been proposed, these methods can be biased and are difficult to scale up to complex structures. Moreover, the difficulty in incorporating physical constraints at the inference time hinders the controllability of the model-predicted spectra. In this work, we propose Color2Struct, a universal framework for efficient and accurate inverse design of structural colors with controllable predictions. By utilizing sampling bias correction, adaptive loss weighting, and physics-guided inference, Color2Struct improves the prediction of tandem networks by 65% (color difference) and 48% (short-wave near-infrared reflectivity) in designing RGB primary colors. These improvements make Color2Struct highly promising for applications in high-end display technologies and solar thermal energy harvesting. In experiments, the nanostructure samples are fabricated using a standard thin-film deposition method and their reflectance spectra are measured to validate the designs. Our work provides an efficient and highly optimized method for controllable inverse design, benefiting future explorations of more intricate structures. The proposed framework can be further generalized to a wide range of fields beyond nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Fractional-order Fourier transformations as pseudo-differential operators. Applications to diffraction and imaging by optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular and hyperbolic fractional-order Fourier transformations are actually Weyl pseudo-differential operators. Their associated kernels and symbols are written explicitly. Products of fractional-order Fourier transformations are obtained by composing their kernels or symbols, in accordance with the Weyl calculus. On the other hand, optical field transfers by diffraction, from spherical emitters to receivers, are mathematically expressed using fractional-order Fourier transforms and are classified into three categories, for which we provide geometrical characterizations. Respecting the Huygens-Fresnel principle requires that the associated transformations be adequately composed, which is achieved through the composition rules of pseudo-differential operators. By applying the Weyl calculus, we prove that, in general, imaging through a refracting spherical cap can be described as the composition of two fractional-order Fourier transformations, but only if those transformations are of the same kind. Basic laws of coherent geometrical imaging are thus deduced from the composition of two circular fractional-order Fourier transformations. We also prove that the arrangement of a sequence of points along the axis of a centered optical system is preserved by imaging, up to a circular permutation. This recovers a classical result from geometrical optics, but here it is derived within the framework of diffraction theory.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Design of a Reconfigurable Metasurface based on Chalcogenide Phase-Change Material for Operation in the Near and Mid Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze, design and assess the performance of a reflective reconfigurable metasurface (MS) architecture for optical wireless communications. The device is based on the Ge-Sb-Te (GST225) phase-change material (PCM) alloy, thermally toggled between highly distinct amorphous and crystalline phase-states. We employ simple conductive MS patterns to tune its resonance frequency, while allowing the unit cell response to be analytically predicted using transmission line theory and equivalent circuits. The GST material dispersion is computed in its two extreme phase-states using a Drude/Tauc-Lorentz model (DTLM), whose parameters are fitted to state-of-the-art experimental data; the dispersion in intermediate partially crystallized phase-states is computed using the Lorentz-Lorenz formula. Our results, corroborated by full-wave simulations, demonstrate the potential of PCM materials for the implementation of continuously reconfigurable holographic metasurfaces operating in the infrared bands.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Gaussian process regression, partial least squares, random forest and support vector machines for a near infrared calibration of paracetamol samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the near-infrared (NIR) spectra of fifty-eight (58) commercial tablets of 500 mg of paracetamol from different origins (that is, with different batch numbers) in the local markets in Bamako. The NIR spectra were recorded in the spectral range 930 nm-1700 nm. The samples are divided into forty-eight (48) samples forming the set of calibration (training set) and ten (10) samples used as the validation or test set. To perform multivariate calibration, we apply-three nonlinear regression techniques (Gaussian processes regression (GPR), Random Forest (RF), Support vector machine (KSVM)), along with the traditional linear partial least-squares regression (PLSR) to several data pretreatments of the 58 samples. The results show that the three nonlinear regression calibrations have better prediction performance than PLS as far as RMSE is concerned. To decide the best regression model, we avoid R2 since this quantity is not a good parameter for this purpose. We will instead consider RMSE when comparing the different multivariate models. Additionally, to assess the impact of data preprocessing, we apply the above regression techniques to the original data, Multi-scattering correction (MSC), standard variate normalization (SNV) correction, smoothing correction, first derivative (FD), and second derivative correction (SD). The overall results reveal that Gaussian Processes Regression (GPR) applied to smooth correction gives the lowest RMSEP = 2.303053e-06 for validation (prediction) and RMSEC = 2.112316e-06 for calibration. In our investigation, one also notices that the developed GPR model is more accurate and exhibits enhanced behavior no matter which data preprocessing is used.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approach of Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) together with Chemometric techniques are used in order to analyze sixty (60) tablets of paracetamol of different batch numbers in the local markets in Bamako. The primary objective is to model these samples by doing multivariate regression computation. Prior to this, various statistical pretreatment methods such as second derivative (SD) correction, first derivative correction (FD), multiple scattering correction (MSC), smoothing the spectra (smooth), the standard variate normalization (SNV) correction and some combinations are performed. The Partial least square (PLS) regression on the SNV data preprocessing resulted in the detection of two outliers. Additionally, the presence of nonlinear effects is conducted. Its presence compels one to consider nonlinear regression such as the artificial neural network ANN or relevance vector machine RVM. A supporting fact of the use of these types of regressions is that ANN regression applied to the spectra under consideration significantly improves the RMSEP and the relative standard error of prediction RSEP. To further analyze the samples, the selection of wavelengths based on the p-value approach proved its usefulness in this investigation. The best calibration of the PLS multivariate regression model is obtained with the MSC combined with FD correction, and its statistical values for the fourteen wavelengths, having the smallest individual p-value, are R2= 85.26%, RMSEP= 2.38x10-4 and finally RSEP=1.45%.</description>

      <title>How many channels can a photonic system support?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a general method to bound the ordered singular values (channel amplitudes) of the electromagnetic Green function for arbitrarily structured linear photonic systems. The approach yields computable, quantitatively predictive, upper bounds on the $n^{th}$ singular value that capture the complexity of multi-channel tradeoffs from the device perspective. As an illustration of the practical value of the framework, indexed channel bounds are obtained for multi-wavelength scale three-dimensional volumes (up to $64\,\lambda^3$) and applied to common application classes related to waveguides, metasurfaces, and planewave detection. These results are immediately applicable to the calculation of information theoretic objectives such as Shannon capacity and Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Cavity Enhanced Emission from Telecom Rare-Earth System in Colloidal Host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erbium incorporated in a ceria (CeO2) host offers strong potential as a spin qubit platform, providing a pathway toward telecom-compatible quantum memory. But erbium is a dim emitter due to its long excited state lifetime. Methods to enhance its emission rate and efficiency through nanophotonic cavity integration are therefore essential. In this work, we demonstrate cavity-enhanced emission from erbium doped CeO2. We couple colloidally synthesized erbium doped CeO2 nanocrystals to a silicon nanobeam cavity and show a 30-fold improvement in emitter brightness combined with a 2-fold lifetime enhancement. We estimate a lower bound of 12 for the Purcell factor of cavity-coupled emitters after accounting for non-radiative decay. These results pave the way towards utilizing colloidally synthesized optically addressable spin qubits emitting at telecom wavelength for quantum networking and distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Spectral Control of a Cavity-Based X-ray Free-Electron Laser via Active Mode Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise spectral control in the hard X-ray regime remains a long-standing challenge that limits applications in atomic-scale science and ultrafast spectroscopy. We present an actively mode-locked cavity-based X-ray free-electron laser that achieves deterministic spectral programmability with phase-locked pulse trains and comb-like spectra, by coherently modulating the electron-beam energy. Three-dimensional time-dependent simulations predict \SI{700}{\micro\joule} total energy, \SI{30}{\giga\watt} peak power, and frequency-comb spacing of \SI{1.55}{\electronvolt} set by the modulation frequency. We further develop selective single-line amplification via undulator tapering and absolute frequency positioning through modulation-laser tuning with better than $2 \times 10^{-5}$ relative precision. Importantly, stable mode-locked operation persists under &gt;80\% peak-to-peak cavity-reflectivity variations, substantially relaxing requirements on X-ray optics. These results establish active mode locking as a practical route to fully coherent, spectrally agile hard X-ray sources and enable new opportunities in time-resolved core-level spectroscopy, X-ray quantum optics, and precision metrology.</description>

      <title>Possible evidence for Harper broadening in the yellow exciton series of Cu2O at ultrahigh magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-like systems in ultra-high magnetic fields are of significant interest in interdisciplinary research. Previous studies have focused on the exciton wavefunction shrinkage under magnetic fields down to artificial crystal lattices (e.g., quantum wells, superlattices), where the effective mass approximation remains valid. However, further compression toward the natural crystal lattice scale remains experimentally challenging. In this study, we report magneto-absorption measurements on the yellow-exciton series in Cu2O using pulsed magnetic fields of up to 500 T. The strong low energy absorption features are assigned to the spin Zeeman split 2p0 and 3p0 exciton states. The high field data provides a value for the reduced effective mass of the exciton u* = 0.415 \pm 0.01me. Intriguingly, the broadening of the 2p0 ground state transition exhibits a sudden increase for ultrahigh magnetic fields above 300 T, providing possible evidence for Harper broadening - an indication of the breakdown of the effective mass approximation when the magnetic length becomes comparable to the lattice constant of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Mechanical loss and stability analysis of NEXCERA in ultra-stable optical cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NEXCERA has emerged as a ceramic-based material for spacers in ultra-stable optical cavities, with a coefficient of thermal expansion that crosses zero near room temperature. In such cavities, frequency stability is ultimately limited by Brownian thermal noise in the cavity components. A key parameter in this context is the mechanical loss, which has remained unknown for NEXCERA. In this work, we investigate the mechanical loss of NEXCERA N117B at room temperature for various resonances using the gentle nodal suspension technique. We measure a promising minimum mechanical loss of $\phi = 1.89\times 10^{-5}$, indicating the suitability of NEXCERA for low-noise optical cavities. Using this value, we calculate the thermal noise of a cavity with a NEXCERA spacer and compare its performance to established materials such as ULE and Zerodur, taking into account different mirror substrate options. Our analysis shows that NEXCERA is a strong candidate for ultra-stable cavities due to its low thermal noise. Combined with its previously reported low linear drift, it offers a highly attractive option for long-term stable optical frequency references.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08635v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We designed and built an adjustable repetition rate optical frequency comb using off-the-shelf components with several improvements to an established erbium fiber design. This design, built fully by an undergraduate, was assembled at a fraction of the cost of a commercial comb. This comb has a repetition rate of roughly 100 MHz with a tuning range of 3 MHz. A stabilization control loop for $f_{rep}$ achieved long term drifts of &lt; 1 Hz over several days. This comb will eventually be implemented for use in dual-comb spectroscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging has been extensively studied in X-ray microtomography to improve the sensitivity and specificity of measurements, especially for low atomic number materials. However, obtaining quantitative phase images typically requires additional measurements or assumptions, which significantly limits the practical applicability. Here, we present preconditioned Wirtinger flow (PWF): an assumption-free, single-shot quantitative X-ray phase imaging method. Accurate phase retrieval is demonstrated using a specialized gradient-based algorithm with an accurate physical model. Partial coherence of the source is taken into account, extending the potential applications to bench-top sources. Improved accuracy and spatial resolution over conventional speckle tracking methods are experimentally demonstrated. The various samples are explored to demonstrate the robustness and versatility of PWF.</description>

      <title>SEMPO -- Retrieving poles, residues and zeros in the complex frequency plane from an arbitrary spectral response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Singularity Expansion Method Parameter Optimizer -- SEMPO -- is a toolbox to extract the complex poles, zeros and residues of an arbitrary response function acquired along the real frequency axis. SEMPO allows to determine this full set of complex parameters of linear physical systems from their spectral responses only, without prior information about the system. The method leverages on the Singularity Expansion Method of the physical signal. This analytical expansion of the meromorphic function in the complex frequency plane motivates the use of the Cauchy method and auto-differentiation-based optimization approach to retrieve the complex poles, zeros and residues from the knowledge of the spectrum over a finite and real spectral range. Both approaches can be sequentially associated to provide highly accurate reconstructions of physical signals in large spectral windows. The performances of SEMPO are assessed and analysed in several configurations that include the dielectric permittivity of materials and the optical response spectra of various optical metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Turbulence Impacted Beam Statistics and Image Topology with Lorentz Dipole Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous statistical and geometric framework for analyzing turbulence-impacted beam propagation and image topology with results obtained using a PMMA slab. The approach models beam intensity distributions as n-dimensional data set represented through Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), embedding them into the manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices. By employing information geometric tools, geodesic distances, and affine-invariant Riemannian metrics, we establish a principled methodology for quantifying similarity and dissimilarity among beam images. Experimental results demonstrate topological distance trends, distance statistics, and correlation measures for different turbulence scenarios, including polarized and unpolarized cases. Histograms of distance statistics reveal stable statistical features, with correlation coefficients highlighting the turbulence-induced variability in PMMA-based beam propagation. The framework not only provides a systematic foundation for analyzing optical beam statistics under turbulence but also opens avenues for advanced applications such as deep learning-based feature reduction, image compression, and secure free-space optical (FSO) communication. Future directions include refining the GMM-EM based distance measures, comparative scatter analysis, and developing robust statistical tools for turbulence imaging. Overall, this study bridges theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and potential technological applications in adaptive and applied optics.</description>

      <title>Entropy Computing, A Paradigm for Optimization in Open Photonic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04512v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding better solutions to combinatorial optimization problems could have a large positive impact on many real-world application areas, such as logistics. For this reason, significant efforts have been made to design novel optimisation paradigms. Here we show an early instance of such paradigm in an optical setting, the entropy computing paradigm. Specifically, we experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of entropy computing by building a hybrid photonic-electronic computer that uses optical measurement and feedback to solve non-convex optimization problems. The system functions by using temporal photonic modes to create qudits in order to encode probability amplitudes in the time-frequency degree of freedom of a photon. This scheme, when coupled with with electronic interconnects, allows us to encode an arbitrary Hamiltonian into the system and solve non-convex continuous variables and combinatorial optimization problems. We show that the proposed entropy computing paradigm can act as a scalable and versatile platform for tackling a large range of NP-hard optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Tracking the photoinduced dynamics of a dark excitonic state in single-layer WS$_2$ via resonant Autler-Townes splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excitons in a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (1L-TMD) are highly bound states characterized by a Rydberg-like spectrum of discrete energy levels. Among these, states with odd-parity are known as dark excitons due to selection rules, which make their stationary and transient characterization challenging using linear optical techniques. Here, we demonstrate that the dynamics of a 2p dark excitonic state in 1L-WS$_2$ can be directly retrieved by measuring the Autler-Townes splitting of bright states in a three-pulse experiment. The splitting of the bright 1s excitonic state, observed by detuning a mid-infrared control field across the 1s-2p transition, provides an accurate characterization of the 2p state. Following carrier photoinjection, we observe a qualitatively different dynamics of the 1s and 2p levels, which is indicative of symmetry-dependent screening and exciton-exciton interactions. These findings provide new insights into many-body effects in TMDs, offering potential avenues for advancing the next generation optoelectronics.</description>
