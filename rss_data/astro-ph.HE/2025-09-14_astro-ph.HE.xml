      <title>GW231109_235456: A Sub-threshold Binary Neutron Star Merger in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O4a Observing Run?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a sub-threshold search for gravitational-wave inspirals from binary neutron stars using data from the first part of the fourth observing run of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. To enhance sensitivity to this targeted population, we incorporate a redshift-corrected population model based on radio observations of Galactic double neutron star systems. The search identifies a significant trigger with a false-alarm rate of about one per 50 years and a network signal-to-noise ratio of 9.7, which was first reported by the LVK in low-latency processing as S231109ci and subsequently in the GWTC-4.0 catalog as GW231109_235456, a sub-threshold candidate. Accounting for a trials factor of five from the four LVK searches in GWTC-4.0 and this new search, the false-alarm rate of the reported candidate is approximately one per 10 years. If this event is of astrophysical origin, the inferred source properties indicate component masses of 1.40 to 2.24 solar masses for the primary and 0.97 to 1.49 solar masses for the secondary, yielding a total mass of 2.95 (+0.38, -0.07) solar masses. The event was localized to a region of 450 square degrees (90 percent probability) at a luminosity distance of 165 (+70, -69) megaparsecs.</description>

      <title>Discovery and Analysis of Afterglows from Poorly Localised GRBs with the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO) All-sky Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), particularly those detected by wide-field instruments such as the Fermi/GBM, pose a challenge for optical follow-up due to their large initial localisation regions, leaving many GRBs without identified afterglows. The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), with its wide field of view, dual-site coverage, and robotic rapid-response capability, bridges this gap by rapidly identifying and localising afterglows from alerts issued by space-based facilities including Fermi, SVOM, Swift, and the EP, providing early optical positions for coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we present optical afterglow localisation and multi-band follow-up of seven Fermi/GBM and MAXI/GSC triggered long GRBs (240122A, 240225B, 240619A, 240910A, 240916A, 241002B, and 241228B) discovered by GOTO in 2024. Spectroscopy for six GRBs (no spectroscopic data for GRB 241002B) with VLT/X-shooter and GTC/OSIRIS yields precise redshifts spanning $z\approx0.40-$3.16 and absorption-line diagnostics of host and intervening systems. Radio detections for four events confirm the presence of long-lived synchrotron emission. Prompt-emission analysis with Fermi and MAXI data reveals a spectrally hard population, with two bursts lying $&gt;3\sigma$ above the Amati relation. Although their optical afterglows resemble those of typical long GRBs, the prompt spectra are consistently harder than the long-GRB average. Consistent modelling of six GOTO-discovered GRB afterglows yields jet half-opening angles of a few degrees and beaming-corrected kinetic energies ($E_{jet}\sim10^{51-52}$) erg, consistent with the canonical long-GRB population. These findings suggest that optical discovery of poorly localised GRBs may be subject to observational biases favouring luminous events with high spectral peak energy, while also providing insight into jet microphysics and central engine diversity.</description>

      <title>Propeller effect in action: unveiling quenched accretion in the transient X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Be/X-ray pulsar 4U 0115+63 underwent a type II outburst in 2023. After the outburst, similar to the outbursts in 2015 and 2017, the source decayed into a quiescent state. Two out of three XMM-Newton observations conducted after the 2023 outburst confirmed the source to be in a low-luminosity state at a level of $L_{\rm X} \sim 10^{33}\,\rm erg\,s^{-1}$. X-ray pulsations were detected at $\approx$0.277 Hz in both observations with a pulsed fraction exceeding 50%. The power density spectra show no significant low-frequency red noise in both observations, suggesting that the radiation is not driven by accretion. The energy spectra in this state can be described by a single blackbody component, with an emitting area smaller than the typical size of the polar caps during the accretion phase. Based on the timing and spectral properties, we suggest that the propeller effect is active during the quiescent state, resulting in a total quenching of accretion. We discuss possible mechanisms for the generation of pulsations in this regime and consider the scenario of neutron star crust cooling.</description>

      <title>Trends in the Population of Binary Black Holes Following the Fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog: a Data-Driven Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current population models of binary black hole distributions are difficult to interpret because standard population inferences hinge on modeling choices, which can mask or mimic real structure. The maximum population likelihood ``$\pistroke$ formalism'' provides a means to investigate and interpret features in the distribution of binary black holes using only data -- without specifying a population model. It tells us if features inferred from current population models are truly present in the data or if they arise from model misspecification. It also provides guidance for developing new models by highlighting previously unnoticed features. In this study, we utilize the $\pistroke$ formalism to examine the binary black hole population in the LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA (LVK) fourth Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-4). Our analysis supports the existence of a gap around $45\,M_\odot$ in the secondary black hole mass distribution and identifies a widening in the distribution of the effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\text{eff}$ near this mass as recently reported by Tong et al. (2025). Similar to earlier studies, we find support for an anti-correlation between $\chi_\text{eff}$ and mass ratio. However, we argue that this may be a spurious correlation arising from misspecification of the joint distribution of black hole masses. Furthermore, we identify support for dimensionless black hole spin magnitudes at approximately $\chi \approx 0.2$ and $\chi\approx0.7$. The data support the existence of a correlation between the spin magnitudes $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$, though subsequent study is required to determine if this feature is statistically significant. The accompanying data release includes $\pistroke$ samples, which can be used to compare theoretical predictions to LVK data and to assess assumptions in parameterised models.</description>

      <title>Laplace-Fourier linear stability analysis of non-relativistic magnetized rotational jets: mode identification by Hamiltonian analysis and the occurrence of mode transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a linear stability analysis of magnetized and/or rotating jets propagating in ambient matter that is also magnetized and/or rotating, having in mind the application to the jet penetrating the core/envelope of a massive star. We solve the linearized magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) equations in the non-relativistic regime by Laplace transform in time and Fourier transform in space. In this formulation all unstable modes with the same translational and azimuthal wave numbers can be obtained simultaneously by searching for pole singularities in the complex plane. In order to determine unambiguously their driving mechanisms, we evaluate the second-order perturbation of the MHD Hamiltonian for individual eigenfunctions derived at these singular points. We identify in our non-rotating models the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) as one of the shear-driven modes and the current-driven instability such as the kink instability (KKI). In rotational models we also find the magnetorotational instability (MRI) as another shear-driven mode. In some cases, we find that a mode changes its character continuously from KKI to KHI (and vice versa) or from MRI to KHI as the jet velocity is increased.</description>

      <title>Rotating twisted magnetosphere of magnetars: approximate analytical solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An approximate analytical solution for the rotating twisted magnetosphere of magnetars is presented. The poloidal flux is approximated by the self-similar twisted dipole field. The toroidal field is obtained by the minimum torque model. Under this approximation, it is found that: (1) The Y-point radius decreases with the increase of twist of the magnetic field. (2) The polar cap is larger for larger twist. (3) The particle outflow luminosity is larger for larger twist. (4) The maximum acceleration potential, pulse width of magnetar radio emission etc all increase with the twist. (5) For an untwisting magnetosphere, the physical properties general evolves towards that of the normal pulsars. The above findings are consistent with previous analytical and numerical results. The larger polar cap may corresponds to the hot spot during magnetar outburst. In general, a rotating twisted magnetosphere has larger open field line regions. The radio emission of magnetars and fast radio burst may both originates in the larger and evolving open field line regions of magnetars.</description>

      <title>Multi-GeV Fermi-LAT Detection of PSR B1259-63</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PSR B1259-63 is a classical gamma-ray binary detected from radio to TeV energies near periastron. In the GeV band, it had previously been detected only up to a few GeV, with the extrapolation of the TeV spectrum overestimating the measured GeV flux. Using over 17 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we report the first detection of PSR B1259-63 in the 10 GeV to $\gtrsim 100$ GeV range, from -400 to +100 days relative to periastron. The Fermi-LAT spectrum is well described by a hard power law with index $\Gamma = 1.9 \pm 0.1$, and has a flux level consistent with that measured at TeV energies by H.E.S.S. The apparent transition from the hard Fermi-LAT spectrum to the softer TeV spectrum suggests that the detected GeV emission traces the rising tail of the inverse-Compton component extending into the TeV regime. We note that the detection of PSR B1259-63 as early as -400 days before periastron is difficult to reconcile with existing theoretical models.</description>

      <title>An ultraviolet burst oscillation candidate from the low-mass X-ray binary EXO 0748-676</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray burst oscillations are quasi-coherent periodic signals at frequencies close to the neutron star spin frequency. They are observed during thermonuclear Type I X-ray bursts from a number of low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) hosting a fast-spinning, weakly magnetic neutron star. Besides measuring the spin frequencies, burst oscillations hold the potential to accurately measure neutron star mass and radius, thus providing constraints on the equation of state of matter at nuclear densities. Based on far-ultraviolet (FUV) observations of the X-ray binary EXO 0748-676 taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 2003, we report a possible indication of ultraviolet burst oscillations at the neutron star spin frequency ($\sim$552 Hz), potentially the first such case for an LMXB. The candidate signal is observed during an $\sim$8 s interval in the rising phase of an FUV burst, which occurred $\sim$4 s after a Type I X-ray burst. Through simulations, we estimated that the probability of detecting the observed signal power from pure random noise is 3.7$\%$, decreasing to 0.3$\%$ if only the burst rise interval is considered, during which X-ray burst oscillations had already been observed in this source. The background-subtracted folded pulse profile of the candidate FUV oscillations in the (120-160 nm) band is nearly sinusoidal with a $\sim$16$\%$ pulsed fraction, corresponding to a pulsed luminosity of $\sim$8$\times$10$^{33}$ erg/s. Interpreting the properties of this candidate FUV burst oscillations in the light of current models for optical-ultraviolet emission from neutron star LMXBs faces severe problems. If signals of this kind are confirmed in future observations, they might point to an unknown coherent emission process as the origin of the FUV burst oscillations observed in EXO 0748-676.</description>

      <title>Magnetic effects on fundamental modes in rotating neutron stars with a purely toroidal magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals from neutron stars are shaped by rapid rotation and strong magnetic fields. Determining these properties is essential to interpret such signals, but current measurements are limited: rotation estimates rely on electromagnetic detections and assume uniform rotation, while inferring interior magnetic fields remains ambiguous due to a lack of direct observations. Measuring the excited fundamental modes of neutron stars in gravitational-wave signals offers a promising solution, as these modes encode information about stellar composition, structure, and dynamics. Previous studies have examined the individual effects of rotation and magnetic fields on these modes, identifying magnetic suppression and establishing linear relations for the frequencies of the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial mode $f_F$ and $l=2$ quadrupolar mode $f_{^2f}$. However, few have investigated the combined influence of rotation and magnetic fields. Here, for the first time, we consider both rotation and a toroidal magnetic field to construct linear relations for quantifying $f_F$ and $f_{^2f}$, showing that their combined effects can be constrained by detecting these modes. Using 2D axisymmetric simulations, we demonstrate that quasi-linear relations between $f_F$, $f_{^2f}$, stellar compactness $M/R$, and kinetic-to-binding energy ratio $T/|W|$ persist even with a toroidal magnetic field. The slope of these relations depends on the toroidal magnetization constant $K_\mathrm{m}$. Additionally, measuring the frequency ratio $f_{^2f}/f_F$ enables inference of $T/|W|$ and the maximum magnetic field strength $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$. Lastly, we show that differential rotation causes only minor deviations from predictions for uniform rotation. Thus, this work demonstrates that rotational and magnetic properties of neutron stars can be inferred from their fundamental modes.</description>

      <title>Interaction between disk and extended corona in general relativistic framework. I. Static slab corona in global energy balance with the underlying disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy equilibrium between the corona and the underlying disk in a two-phase accretion flow sets a lower limit on the achievable photon index. A slab corona may not explain the hard state observations of X-ray binaries (XRBs). We incorporate energy feedback to the accretion disk resulting from illumination by an extended corona, and vice versa. The interaction between these two components allows for the possibility of finding an energetically self-consistent equilibrium solution for a given disk-corona system. We have upgraded the existing Monte Carlo radiative transfer code, MONK, to incorporate the interaction between the disk and the extended corona within the general relativistic framework. We introduce an albedo parameter to specify the fraction of the incident flux that is reflected by the disk, while the remainder is absorbed and added to the intrinsic dissipation. Reflection is modeled assuming a semi-infinite electron atmosphere. We find global equilibrium solutions by iterating interaction between disk and extended slab corona. A higher black hole spin, higher coronal temperature, and higher albedo all lead to harder spectra. For typical coronal temperatures and disk albedo, the lowest achievable photon index with a static slab corona fully covering the disk is approximately 1.7-1.8. With the upgraded version of MONK, we are now able to achieve global energy equilibrium for a given disk-corona system. This approach holds significant potential for constraining the coronal geometry using not only the observed flux but also polarization. A static slab does not appear to be a favorable coronal geometry for the hard state of XRBs, even when global energy balance is taken into account. In future work, we will explore truncated disk geometries and outflowing coronae as potential alternatives. (shortened)</description>

      <title>Further evidence for natal kick segregation by spectral type in high-mass X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) are systems in which a neutron star or black hole accretes material from a massive companion. HMXBs are expected to have experienced a supernova in their evolution. The impulsive kick associated with this event should affect the space velocity of the system in a way that depends on the nature and state of the progenitor binary. Here, we test whether the different evolutionary histories of HMXBs have left a detectable imprint on their peculiar velocities ($V_{\rm pec}$). Using data from Gaia Data Release 3 (Gaia DR3), we first calculate the $V_{\rm pec}$ values for 63 well-known HMXBs hosting a black hole or neutron star and estimate the associated uncertainties via Monte Carlo re-sampling. We then analyse their distribution and check for differences between classes. Overall, $V_{\rm pec}$ estimates extend up to 100 km s$^{-1}$, but with Be/X-ray binaries (BeXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\lesssim 40$ km s$^{-1}$ and supergiant X-ray binaries (SgXRBs) favouring $V_{\rm pec}$ $\gtrsim 40$ km s$^{-1}$. Based on a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, the null hypothesis that the peculiar velocities of both classes are drawn from the same parent distribution can be robustly rejected, irrespective of the background stellar velocity dispersion. Tests with binary population synthesis demonstrate that SgXRBs typically have shorter orbital periods and higher fractional mass loss than BeXRBs at supernova. We argue that the magnitude of $V_{\rm pec}$ could be used as a complementary feature to distinguish between Be and supergiant systems. These findings extend previous inferences based on two-dimensional kinematics from Hipparcos, and may be explained by the differing nature of the respective progenitors systems between the source classes at the instant of supernova.</description>

      <title>A MeerKAT view of the parsec-scale jets in the black-hole X-ray binary GRS 1758-258</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets from accreting black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs) are powerful outflows that release a large fraction of the accretion energy to the surrounding environment, providing a feedback mechanism that may alter the interstellar medium (ISM) properties. Studying accretion and feedback together enables estimates of matter and energy input/output around accreting BHs. We focus on the extended jet structures of the BH-XRB GRS1758-258. First seen in VLA data, these parsec-scale jets arise from jet-ISM interaction and show a Z-shaped morphology. Using the MeerKAT telescope we observed GRS1758-258 in L-band for a total exposure of 7 hr. Applying a calorimetry-based method developed for AGN and later used for XRBs, we estimated the properties of the jets and of the surrounding ISM. We detect a jet and counter-jet terminating in bow-shocks. Within the northern jet lobe we identify synchrotron and bremsstrahlung emission, while the southern lobe is dominated by thermal emission. We measure ISM densities between 10-40 cm-3 across both jets, slightly lower in the northern region. The estimated ages of the two lobes range from 6-51 kyr. The time-averaged jet power lies between 4.4x10^33 and 3.3x10^36 erg/s, with differences between north and south likely due to different local ISM conditions. Comparing new MeerKAT with archival VLA data, we measured a proper motion of 130 mas/yr in a portion of the northern jet. Jet-ISM interaction structures on both sides of GRS1758-258 reveal different ISM properties. The comparison between these structures and those from other XRBs suggests that the lobes in GRS1758-258 are younger and may result from different jet activity phases. The time-averaged energy transferred to the environment is slightly lower than in other XRBs, consistent with the younger age of the lobes in GRS1758-258 relative to those of other systems.</description>

      <title>The merger of spinning, accreting supermassive black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>The electron temperature distribution and the high ionization just behind the shock in the Cygnus Loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical processes behind astrophysical collisionless shocks, such as thermal relaxation and ionization after shock passage, remain poorly understood. To investigate these processes, we analyze the northeastern region of the Cygnus Loop with XMM-Newton. The electron temperature is found to increase towards the interior of the remnant ranging from 0.15-0.19 keV energy range within a spatial scale of 6 arcmin (or 1.27 pc at a distance of 725 pc) from the shock front. This can be explained well by a modified Sedov solution with radiative cooling. We also show that the ionization timescales determined from our spectroscopy are significantly larger than those estimated based on the electron density of the surrounding materials and the shock velocity. This excess can be qualitatively explained by a mixing of inner multiple plasma components with different ionization states due to turbulence.</description>

      <title>Can a gamma-ray dim radio blazar produce a 200-PeV neutrino? The case of PMN J0606$-$0724 and KM3-230213A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extremely energetic muon has been recently detected by the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT), indicating the observation of a neutrino with the estimated energy of $\left( 2.2^{+5.7}_{-1.0} \right)\times 10^{17}$~eV. Radio blazar PMN~J0606$-$0724, not detected in gamma rays, is located within the reported error region of the neutrino arrival direction, and was flaring at the time of the event. Here we demonstrate that the neutrino could be produced in a photohadronic interaction in its radio core. The necessary proton power is of order of the source's photon luminosity, and protons can be accelerated to the required energies in the core, while high-energy gamma rays cannot leave the source because of intense production of electron-positron pairs. Expected contribution of the population of similar flaring sources matches non-observation of energetic events by other neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>Testing the nature of compact objects in the lower mass gap using gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the compact binary catalog continues to grow rapidly, developing and refining tests to probe the nature of compact objects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of both the observed data and the underlying astrophysics of the binary population. We investigate the effectiveness of spin-induced multipole moments (SIQM) and tidal deformability measurements in distinguishing lower mass-gap black hole (BH) binaries from non-BH binaries with different mass and spin configurations. We perform model-agnostic tests on binary BH (BBH) simulations using full Bayesian inference, evaluating the independent and joint measurability of SIQM and tidal parameters across the parameter space. We extend the analysis to simulations of self-interacting spinning boson stars, using synthetic signals that exhibit (a) both SIQM and tidal effects and (b) each effect individually. For case (a), recovery is performed using (i) a BBH model, (ii) a model incorporating both SIQM and tidal effects, and (iii) models including either SIQM or tidal effects. For case (b), we employ (i) a BBH model and (ii) models incorporating either SIQM or tidal effects, consistent with the injection. Simulations employ TaylorF2 waveform model and consider binaries in the low mass gap with varying spin magnitudes. We find that employing an incorrect model to analyze the signal can lead to biases in parameter inference. Notably, when analyzing a simulated binary boson star-like signal with component masses $\rm{(4, 4) \, M_{\odot}}$ using a BBH model, the system is incorrectly identified as having masses $\rm{(8, 2) \, M_{\odot}}$. In contrast, using the correct recovery model that includes both SIQM and tidal deformability effects successfully recovers the true masses, highlighting the significance of waveform model accuracy in performing reliable distinguishability tests for compact objects in the low-mass gap.</description>

      <title>Early Stages of Dusty Tori: The First Infrared Spectra from a Highly Multiscale Quasar Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first infrared spectral predictions from a self-consistent simulation of the formation of a quasar in a starburst galaxy, spanning cosmological to innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) scales. The infrared emission is dominated by a torus-like dust structure composed of the highly magnetized, turbulence-supported outer accretion disk and of accreting gas tidally torn from the interstellar medium (ISM). At these early stages, the AGN is buried and Compton-thick. The near- to mid-IR escaping luminosity varies by almost an order of magnitude across sightlines, largely due to extinction from the inflowing stream of cold dust. Self-absorption within the torus suppresses silicate emission features, and further reprocessing by the ambient ISM leads to prominent silicate absorption and colder IR emission. The sublimation structure is stratified by composition and size, producing sightline-dependent extinction curves that intrinsically vary in shape. However, after repeated scattering in the optically thick dusty medium, these curves emerge substantially grayed. We also demonstrate that bipolar outflows from the central black hole that carve biconical cavities and reveal the central engine in later stages can preserve IR anisotropy and silicate features. These results suggest that dusty starburst quasars can undergo a buried, IR-bright phase early in their evolution.</description>

      <title>PeV particle acceleration and non-thermal emission in the `minimalist' model of the extended jets in W50/SS433</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The W50 nebula around microquasar SS~433, powered by supercritical accretion, features two `extended jets' (tens of pc long and a few pc wide) from which polarized X-ray and very high energy radiation above 100 TeV is detected. Here we present a model of very high energy particle acceleration in these extended jets. In the `minimalist' model (discussed in Churazov, Khabibullin, and Bykov, 2024), a collimated outflow aligned with the rotation axis is propagating through a more isotropic wind produced by the accretion disk. The observed extended X-ray jets with bright knots in this model are associated with the formation of strong recollimation MHD shocks after the collision of the collimated outflow with the isotropic wind termination surface. The spectra of electrons and protons up to PeV energies are simulated with a nonlinear Monte Carlo model of diffusive shock acceleration with turbulent magnetic field amplification. The overall efficiency of the jets power transfer to accelerated protons in this model is above 10\% and about 0.5\% for electrons above 50 TeV. The magnetic field amplification by Bell's instability due to the electric current of cosmic rays escaping the accelerator produces highly anisotropic magnetic turbulence in the shock downstream. This results in the polarized synchrotron X-ray emission with the photon electric vector predominantly transverse to the jet direction and the degree of polarization above 20\%. The model is able to reproduce the observed spectra and intensity profiles of non-thermal X-ray and gamma-ray emission, which are both dominated by the leptonic radiation.</description>

      <title>A star-by-star correspondence between X-ray activity and rotation in the young open cluster NGC 2516 with eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coronal soft X-ray emission of cool stars, especially when taken in combination with their measured rotation periods, offers insights into their levels of magnetic activity and related transitions. We study the X-ray properties of low-mass members of the open cluster NGC 2516 to explicate their detailed dependencies on mass and rotation. We analysed the pointed SRG/eROSITA satellite observations of NGC 2516 obtained during the calibration and performance verification phase of the mission. We found 1561 X-ray sources within the field of view and related 1007 of them to their optical stellar counterparts, including 655 members of NGC 2516 (433 with rotation periods). We combined these detections with auxiliary optical data to facilitate their interpretation. Furthermore, we extracted X-ray spectra for all sources and fit two-component APEC models to them. To aid the analysis, we grouped stars with similar mass and rotational properties together, which allowed us to investigate the influence of rotation on various X-ray properties. The colour-activity diagram of NGC 2516 displays a general increase in the fractional X-ray luminosity with spectral type change from F through G and K to M-type. However, the behaviour of K-type stars, representing the ones that best sample the fast-to-slow rotational transition, is more complex, with both increased and decreased X-ray emission relative to G-type stars for fast and slow rotators, respectively. The rotation-activity diagram is analogous, with an identifiable desaturated group of X-ray emitters that corresponds to stars in the rotational gap between the fast and slow rotator sequences. We prefer to describe the normalised X-ray emission for all cluster stars as declining logarithmically with Rossby number over those using broken power laws. Coronal temperatures appear to be largely independent of mass or rotation. (abridged)</description>

      <title>High Power Accretion in Massive Binary Systems and the Impact of Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During a giant eruption of a very massive star in the binary system, the companion star can accrete a large amount of mass that can change its properties and potentially its subsequent evolution. The effect depends on the companion mass, metallicity, the amount of mass it accreted, orbital parameters and other parameters. We simulate individual companion stars assuming they undergo such accretion events. We study the envelope properties of 20 $\rm M_\odot$ and 30 $\rm M_\odot$ single massive stars at different matallicities ($Z= 0.02$, $Z=0.008$ and $Z=0.004$) during accretion at different rates, from $\rm 10^{-5}$ to $\rm 10^{-2}~M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. For the lower accretion rates we simulate, the stars remains hot, while at higher accretion rates, it becomes cooler and inflates. This behavior is observed in both stars but occurs at different accretion rates. Higher metallicity stars exhibit greater variations in accretion luminosity for the same accretion rate and stellar mass compared to lower metallicity stars. While higher metallicity stars typically have larger stellar envelopes, suggesting smaller variations in luminosity at Galactic metallicity compared to the LMC and SMC, our results show the opposite.</description>

Abstract: Anisotropic phases potentially play a role in the internal composition of neutron stars, the main laboratory for the phase structure of QCD at high baryon densities. We review the study of such a phase, the chiral density wave, within a phenomenological nucleon-meson model, including nucleonic vacuum fluctuations within a renormalization scheme recently developed. Neutron stars in this model and within our approximations either do not contain a chiral density wave core or they are too light to agree with observations.</description>

      <title>Effective Mass in Quantum Hadrodynamics-I and its Impact on the Equation of State of Neutron Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective nucleon mass (M^*) plays a central role in Quantum Hadrodynamics-I (QHD-I), linking scalar meson interactions at the microscopic level to the macroscopic properties of dense nuclear matter. In this work, we re-derive the scalar density integral in detail and validate it numerically using Gaussian quadrature. The numerical and analytic results are found to be in excellent agreement, confirming the robustness of both approaches. We then investigate the sensitivity of M^* to different parameter sets, highlighting its strong influence on nuclear saturation, compressibility, and the resulting equation of state (EoS). The analysis shows that variations in meson-nucleon couplings propagate directly into differences in pressure and energy density, affecting the stiffness of the EoS. While QHD-I produces characteristically stiff EoS, the effective mass evaluation provides a transparent framework for connecting microscopic meson dynamics to macroscopic neutron star properties. These findings underline the relevance of M^* as a microscopic-macroscopic bridge and demonstrate the utility of numerical methods for extending relativistic mean-field models in nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>A Differentiable Surrogate Model for the Generation of Radio Pulses from In-Ice Neutrino Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planned IceCube-Gen2 radio neutrino detector at the South Pole will enhance the detection of cosmic ultra-high-energy neutrinos. It is crucial to utilize the available time until construction to optimize the detector design. A fully differentiable pipeline, from signal generation to detector response, would allow for the application of gradient descent techniques to explore the parameter space of the detector. In our work, we focus on the aspect of signal generation, and propose a modularized deep learning architecture to generate radio signals from in-ice neutrino interactions conditioned on the shower energy and viewing angle. The model is capable of generating differentiable signals with amplitudes spanning multiple orders of magnitude, as well as consistently producing signals corresponding to the same underlying event for different viewing angles. The modularized approach ensures physical consistency of the samples and leads to advantageous computational properties when using the model as part of a bigger optimization pipeline.</description>

Abstract: The fermionic nature of neutrinos and the origin of their tiny masses remain unresolved issues in particle physics, intrinsically connected to lepton number symmetry-conserved for Dirac, violated for Majorana, and effectively pseudo-Dirac when global symmetries invoked for conservation are broken by quantum gravity. We investigate whether distinctive gravitational-wave (GW) signatures can illuminate the nature of neutrino masses and their underlying symmetries, particularly in scenarios where Yukawa couplings are not unnaturally small. To this end, we consider the minimal $B-L$ gauge extension of the Standard Model, where quantum numbers of beyond-SM states determine the neutrino nature and the scale of spontaneous $B-L$ breaking governs mass generation. In this framework, we show that neutrinos yield characteristic GW spectra: Majorana neutrinos with high-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{14}$ GeV) produce local cosmic strings and a flat spectrum across broad frequencies, Dirac neutrinos with low-scale breaking ($\sim 10^{7}$ GeV) generate peaked spectra from first-order phase transitions, and pseudo-Dirac scenarios give kink-like features from domain wall annihilation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures from the phase-transition-induced collapse of a magnetized neutron star</title>

Abstract: Strong magnetic fields make neutron stars potential sources of detectable electromagnetic and gravitational-wave signals. Hence, inferring these magnetic fields is critical to understand the emissions of neutron stars. However, due to the lack of direct observational evidence, the interior magnetic field configuration remains ambiguous. Here, for the first time, we show that the internal magnetic field strength along with the composition of a neutron star can be directly constrained by detecting the gravitational waves from the \emph{phase-transition-induced collapse} of a magnetized neutron star. By dynamically simulating this collapsing event, we first find that the dominant peaks in the gravitational waveform are the fundamental $l=0$ quasi-radial $F$ mode and the fundamental $l=2$ quadrupolar $^2f$ mode. We next show that the maximum gravitational wave amplitude $|h|_\mathrm{max}$ increases with the maximum magnetic field strength of the interior toroidal field $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$ until the maximum rest-mass density at bounce $\rho_\mathrm{max,b}$ decreases due to the increasing $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$. We then demonstrated that the magnetic suppression of fundamental modes found in our previous work remains valid for the hybrid stars formed after the phase-transition-induced collapses. We finally show that measuring the frequency ratio between the two fundamental modes $f_{^2f}/f_{F}$ allows one to infer $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$ and the baryonic mass fraction of matter in the mixed phase $M_\mathrm{mp} / M_{0}$ of the resulting hybrid star. Consequently, taking $\mathcal{B}_\mathrm{max}$ and $M_\mathrm{mp} / M_{0}$ as examples, this work has demonstrated that much information inside neutron stars could be extracted similarly through measuring the oscillation modes of the stars.</description>

      <title>Bridging the micro-Hz gravitational wave gap via Doppler tracking with the Uranus Orbiter and Probe Mission: Massive black hole binaries, early universe signals and ultra-light dark matter</title>

Abstract: With the recent announcement by NASA's \textit{Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey 2023-2032}, a priority flagship mission to the planet Uranus is anticipated. Here, we explore the prospects of using the mission's radio Doppler tracking equipment to detect gravitational waves (GWs) and other analogous signals related to dark matter (DM) over the duration of its interplanetary cruise. We develop a methodology to stack tracking data and account for time varying detector geometry, thereby constructing the sensitivity of the mission to GWs over the wide frequency range of $3\times 10^{-9}$ Hz to $10^{-4}$ Hz. We find that the mission has the potential to fill the gap between pulsar timing and space-based-interferometry GW observatories. If improvements in reducing \textit{Cassini} era noise by a factor of $\sim$10 are implemented, we forecast the detection of $\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}(\rm{few})$ individual massive black hole binaries using two independent population models. Additionally, we determine the mission's sensitivity to both astrophysical and primordial stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds, as well as its capacity to test, or even confirm via detection, ultralight DM models. In all these cases, the tracking of the spacecraft over its interplanetary cruise would enable coverage of unexplored regions of parameter space, where signals from new phenomena in our Universe may be lurking.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars: From Static Structure to Rotational Deformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impacts of dark matter (DM) on the properties of both static and rotating neutron stars utilizing a self-interacting DM model, motivated by the neutron decay anomaly. DM-admixed NSs are modeled by assuming chemical equilibrium between ordinary matter and the dark sector, treating a single-fluid Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) framework. By treating the DM interaction strength ($G$) as a free parameter, we explore its influence on NS properties, considering a broad range of equations of state (EoSs). Using the mass-radius constraints from NICER pulsar measurements, we constrain the DM interaction strength for each EoS via a likelihood analysis. Extending this model to rotating NSs, we analyze how centrifugal forces associated with increasing angular velocity ($\Omega$) enhance both mass and radius, causing deformation. We assess the impact of DM on rotational deformation by calculating the eccentricity, highlighting the interplay between DM and rotational forces. Since both DM and rotation simultaneously influence NS properties, we compute the relative changes in mass and radius across varying $G$ and $\Omega$ values to quantify their combined effects.</description>

      <title>Influence of the Galactic Halo on the UHECR Multipoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the effects of a giant magnetized halo around the Galaxy on the angular distribution of the arriving ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECR) observed at Earth. We investigate three injection scenarios for UHECRs, and track them through isotropic turbulent magnetic fields of varying strengths in the Galactic halo. We calculate the resultant dipole and quadrupole amplitudes for the arriving UHECRs detected by an observer in the Galactic plane region. We find that, regardless of the injection scenario considered, when the scattering length of the particles is comparable to the size of the halo, the UHECRs skymap resembles a dipole. However, as the scattering length is increased, the dipolar moment always increases, and the quadrupolar moment increases rapidly for two of the three cases considered. Additionally, the quadrupole amplitude is highlighted to be a key discriminator in discerning the origin of the observed dipole. We conclude that, to understand the origin of the UHECR dipole, one has to measure the strength of the quadrupole amplitude as well.</description>

      <title>Study of mass outflows from magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes with thermal conduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine mass outflows from a low-angular momentum, viscous, advective, and magnetized accretion disk around a rotating black hole in presence of thermal conduction. We consider the disk is primarily threaded by the toroidal component of the magnetic field and an effective potential satisfactorily mimicked the spacetime geometry around the rotating black hole. With this, we self-consistently solve the coupled governing equations for inflow and outflow and compute the mass outflow rate $R_{\dot m}$ (ratio of mass flux of inflow to outflow) in terms of the inflow parameters, namely energy ($\mathcal{E}$), angular momentum ($\lambda$), plasma-$\beta$ and conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}$) around weakly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) as well as rapidly rotating ($a_{\rm k} =0.99$) black holes. Our findings reveal that the present formalism admits coupled inflow-outflow solutions across a wide range of inflow parameters yielding substantial mass loss. We observe that $R_{\dot m}$ monotonically increases with $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, irrespective of black hole spin. We also find that for a fixed $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, when energy, angular momentum, and magnetic field strength of the inflowing matter is increased, $R_{\dot{\rm m}}$ is enhanced resulting the outflows even more pronounced. We further estimate the maximum outflow rate ($R^{\rm max}_{\dot{\rm m}}$) by varying the inflow parameters and find that thermal conduction leads to maximum mass outflow rate $R^{\rm max}_{\dot{\rm m}} \sim 25\%$ for rapidly rotating black hole of spin $a_{\rm k} = 0.99$. Finally, we employ our formalism to explain the kinetic jet power of $68$ radio-loud low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs), indicating that it is potentially promising to account for the observed jet power of substantial number of LLAGNs.</description>

      <title>Rapid Construction of Joint Pulsar Timing Array Datasets: The Lite Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)'s second data release (IPTA DR2) combines decades of observations of 65 millisecond pulsars from 7 radio telescopes. IPTA datasets should be the most sensitive datasets to nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs), but take years to assemble, often excluding valuable recent data. To address this, we introduce the IPTA "Lite" analysis, where a Figure of Merit is used to select an optimal PTA dataset to analyze for each pulsar, enabling immediate access to new data and preliminary results prior to full combination. We test the capabilities of the Lite analysis using IPTA DR2, finding that "DR2 Lite" can be used to detect the common red noise process with an amplitude of $A = 4.8^{+1.8}_{-1.8} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$. This amplitude is slightly large in comparison to the combined analysis, and likely biased high as DR2 Lite is more sensitive to systematic errors from individual pulsars than the full dataset. Furthermore, although there is no strong evidence for Hellings-Downs correlations in IPTA DR2, we still find the full dataset is better at resolving Hellings-Downs correlations than DR2 Lite. Alongside the Lite analysis, we also find that analyzing a subset of pulsars from IPTA DR2, available at a hypothetical "early" stage of combination (EDR2), yields equally competitive results as the full dataset. Looking ahead, the Lite method will enable rapid synthesis of the latest PTA data, offering preliminary GW constraints before the superior full dataset combinations are available.</description>

      <title>A universal natal spin in stellar-mass black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A stellar mass black hole (BH) is believed to be formed as the result of the core collapse of a massive star at the end of its evolution. For a class of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), it is widely believed that their centre engines are just these stellar-mass BHs, which accrete the collapsing matter in hyper-accretion mode. In such systems, a popular scenario is that the magnetic field supported in the accretion disk extracts the rotational energy of the spinning BH and launches a jet on one hand, and the accretion of the infalling matter of the collapse will increase the BH's rotational energy on the other hand. Here we report that when the accretion process is dominated by a Magnetically-Arrested-Disk (MAD), the above-mentioned two competing processes link to each other, so that the spin evolution of the BH can be written in a simple form. Most interestingly, when the total accreted mass is enough, the BH spin will always reach an equilibrium value. This value does not depend on the initial mass and spin of the BH, as well as the history of accretion but is a function of the accretion physics near the event horizon. This model predicts that there is a population of stellar-mass BH that possess a universal spin at the end of the collapsing accretion. We test this prediction against the 4th gravitational wave (GW) catalogue (GWTC-4.0) and found that there is a dominating population with high significance, in which the distribution of the spin of the secondary BH is centred narrowly around a single value ~0.017. The above-mentioned scenario is supported and the parameters of the accretion physics near the event horizon can be thus constrained. The result is also consistent with previous numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Variability of X-ray polarization of Cyg X-1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a three-year X-ray, optical, and radio polarimetric monitoring campaign of the prototypical black hole X-ray binary Cyg X-1, conducted from 2022 to 2024. The X-ray polarization of Cyg X-1 was measured 13 times with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), covering both hard and soft spectral states. The X-ray polarization degree (PD) in the hard state was found to be $\approx4.0\%$, roughly twice as high as in the soft state, where it was around $2.2\%$. In both states, a statistically significant increase of PD with the energy was found. Moreover, a linear relation between PD and spectral hardness suggests a gradual and continuous evolution of the polarization properties, rather than an abrupt change of polarization production mechanism between states. The polarization angle (PA) was independent of the spectral state and showed no trend with the photon energy. The X-ray PA is well aligned with the orientation of the radio jet, as well as the optical and radio PAs. We find significant orbital changes of PA in the hard state, which we attribute to scattering of X-ray emission at intrabinary structure. No significant superorbital variability in PD or PA was found at the period $P_{\rm{so}}$ = 294 d. We also find no correlation between the X-ray and optical polarization; if any, there is a long-term anti-correlation between the X-ray PD and the radio PD.</description>

      <title>General-relativistic magnetar magnetospheres in 3D with physics-informed neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetar phenomena are likely intertwined with the location and structure of magnetospheric currents. General-relativistic effects are important in shaping the force-free equilibria describing static configurations, though most studies have quantified their impact only in cases of axial symmetry. Using a novel methodology based on physics-informed neural networks, fully three-dimensional configurations of varying stellar compactness are constructed. Realistic profiles for surface currents, qualitatively capturing the geometry of observed hotspots, are applied as boundary conditions to deduce the amount of free energy available to fuel outburst activity. It is found that the lowest-energy solution branches permit only a $\approx 30\%$ excess relative to current-starved solutions in axisymmetric cases with global twists, regardless of compactness, reducing to $\approx 5\%$ in 3D models with localised spots. Accounting for redshift reductions to their inferred dipole moments from timing data, explaining magnetar burst energetics therefore becomes more difficult unless the field hosts non-negligible multipoles. Discussions on other aspects of magnetar phenomena are also provided.</description>

      <title>A double-degenerate scenario with a merger to explosion delay time to explain type Ia supernova SN 2020aeuh</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I suggest the double-degenerate (DD) scenario with a merger-to-explosion delay (MED) time (the DD-MED scenario) of about 1-2 years to explain the rare properties of the recently analyzed type Ia supernova (SN Ia) SN 2020aeuh. The rare properties are the SN Ia ejecta interacting with a carbon-oxygen (CO)-rich circumstellar material (CSM) at approximately 50 days post-explosion. In this DD-MED scenario, two massive CO white dwarfs (WDs), masses of M1=1.1Mo and M2=1Mo, merge to leave a rapidly rotating lonely WD of about the Chandrasekhar mass. The merger process ejects ~0.7Mo to form a nonspherical CO-rich CSM. At the explosion, there is a lonely WD and a detached hydrogen- and helium-deficient CSM. Studies proposed the other lonely WD scenario, the core-degenerate (CD) scenario, to explain several specific SNe Ia and SN Ia remnants. SN 2020aeuh is the first particular SN Ia that is attributed to the DD-MED scenario. Besides being slightly brighter than typical SNe Ia and the CSM interaction, SN 2020aeuh is a normal SN Ia. Therefore, this study strengthens the claim of earlier studies, which are based on other arguments, like the properties of SN Ia remnants, that the lonely WD scenarios, i.e., the DD-MED and CD scenarios, might account for most, if not all, normal SNe Ia. These earlier studies also argue that all SN Ia scenarios, whether lonely WD or not, might contribute to peculiar SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Machine learning classification of black holes in the mass--spin diagram</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the mass--spin diagram for classifying black holes and studying their formation pathways providing an analogue to the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This allows for black hole evolutionary tracks as a function of redshift, combining formation, accretion, and merger histories for the variety of black hole populations. A realistic black hole continuum constructed from initial mass and spin functions and approximate redshift evolution reveals possible black hole main sequences, such as sustained coherent accretion through cosmic time or hierarchical merger trees. In the stellar-mass regime, we use a binary population synthesis software to compare three spin prescriptions for tidal evolution of Wolf-Rayet progenitors, showing how the mass--spin diagram exposes interesting modeling differences. We then classify black hole populations by applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning clustering methods to mass--spin datasets. While bare unsupervised clustering can nearly recover canonical population boundaries (stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive), a more sophisticated approach utilizing deep learning via variational autoencoders for latent space representation learning aids in clustering of realistic datasets with subclasses that highly overlap in mass--spin space. We find that a supervised random forest can accurately recover the correct clusters from the learned latent space representation depending on the complexity of the underlying dataset, semi-supervised methods show potential for further development, and the performance of unsupervised classifiers is a great challenge. Our findings motivate future machine learning applications and demonstrate that the mass--spin diagram can be used to connect gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>A Universal Bound on QCD Axions from Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a new production channel for QCD axions in supernova environments that contributes to axion emissivity for all models solving the strong CP problem. This channel arises at tree-level from a shift-symmetry-breaking operator constructed at next-to-leading order in Chiral Perturbation Theory. In scenarios where model-dependent derivative couplings to nucleons are absent, this sets the strongest model-independent constraint on the axion mass, improving on existing bounds by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Polymorphism and superconductivity in the liquid drop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>

Abstract: Within the liquid drop model built up with the nuclear interaction parametrization Sk$\chi$450, which is based on the chiral effective field theory, we calculate numerically the internal energy density for each of nuclear pasta phases and for the uniform nuclear matter. We provide quantitative arguments in favor of coexistence of various nuclear matter phases at a significant range of total pressure within the inner crust of neutron stars, a concept known as crystal polymorphism. Specifically, we find that differences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically less than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about $10^8$--$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of state of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions are described using the same parametrization Sk$\chi$450 for the bulk, plain surface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature correction changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood as a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which significantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated structural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical consequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In this case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the three-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we study the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between superfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop naturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Analytical Expressions for Gray-Body Factors and Application to Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) is a machine learning approach that explores the space of mathematical expressions to identify those that best fit a given dataset, balancing both accuracy and simplicity. We apply SR to the study of Gray-Body Factors (GBFs), which play a crucial role in the derivation of Hawking radiation and are recognized for their computational complexity. We explore simple analytical forms for the GBFs of the Schwarzschild Black Hole (BH). We compare the results obtained with different approaches and quantify their consistency with those obtained by solving the Teukolsky equation. As a case study, we apply our pipeline, which we call \texttt{ReGrayssion}, to the study of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) as Dark Matter (DM) candidates, deriving constraints on the abundance from observations of diffuse extragalactic $\gamma$-ray background. These results highlight the possible role of SR in providing human-interpretable, approximate analytical GBF expressions, offering a new pathway for investigating PBH as a DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Bulk Viscosity of Two-Flavor Color Superconducting Quark Matter in Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the bulk viscosity of warm, dense, neutrino-transparent, color-superconducting quark matter, where damping of density oscillations in the kHz frequency range arises from weak-interaction-driven direct Urca processes involving quarks. We study the two-flavor red-green paired color-superconducting (2SC) phase, while allowing for the presence of unpaired strange quarks and blue color light quarks of all flavors. Our calculations are based on the SU(3) Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model, extended to include both vector interactions and the `t Hooft determinant term. The primary focus is on how variations in the NJL Lagrangian parameters -- specifically, the diquark and vector coupling strengths -- affect both the static properties of quark matter, such as its equation of state and composition, and its dynamical behavior, including bulk viscosity and associated damping timescales. We find that the bulk viscosity and corresponding damping timescale can change by more than an order of magnitude upon varying the vector coupling by a factor of two at high densities and by a lesser degree at lower densities. This sensitivity primarily arises from the susceptibility of 2SC matter, with a smaller contribution from modifications to the weak interaction rates. In comparison, changes in the diquark coupling have a more limited impact. The damping of density oscillations in 2SC matter is similar quantitatively to nucleonic matter and can be a leading mechanism of dissipation in merging hybrid stars containing color superconducting cores.

      <title>Reconstruction of the depth of the shower maximum of air showers with the SD-750 surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) is one of the intriguing mysteries in astroparticle physics. In order to identify their sources, we need precise knowledge of the mass composition of UHECRs. The direct detection of UHECRs is not feasible at energies above 0.1 PeV, necessitating the use of mass-sensitive observables of extended air showers induced by UHECRs interacting with the atmosphere. One way to achieve high statistics for these mass-sensitive observables is to use ground-based detector arrays, such as the Surface Detector (SD) of the Pierre Auger Observatory. The SD consists of three sub-arrays of independent detector stations arranged in triangular grids with different spacings. Recently, it has been shown that neural networks (NNs) can extract mass-sensitive observables from data taken by the SD-1500, the largest sub-detector of the SD. In this contribution, we demonstrate the feasibility of using NNs to reconstruct a high-level shower observable, the depth of the shower maximum, from data simulated for and observed by the SD-750, the second-largest detector array nested within the SD-1500. A simulation study shows that the SD-750 NN exhibits behavior similar to that of an SD-1500 NN and outperforms the latter in the energy range [1, 10) EeV. Moreover, we show that, after performing a correction and calibration procedure, the predictions of the SD-750 NN are consistent with the measurement of the depth of the shower maximum obtained by the Fluorescence Detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Boson Ionization from Comparable-Mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons around comparable-mass binaries can form gravitationally bound states analogous to molecules once the binary separation decreases below the boson's Bohr radius, with the inner region co-moving with the binary. We simulate the formation of these gravitational molecules, determine their co-moving regions, and compute ionization fluxes induced by orbital motion for various binary eccentricities. We develop semi-analytic formalisms to describe the ionization dynamics of both the co-moving and non-co-moving regions, demonstrating consistency with numerical simulation results. From ionization fluxes, we estimate their backreaction on binary orbital evolution. At early stages, molecule ionization can dominate over gravitational wave emission, producing a spectral turnover in the gravitational wave background. Additionally, ionization of the co-moving component occurs solely due to binary eccentricity, causing orbital circularization.</description>
