      <title>Index growth not imputable to topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ partitioning methods, in the spirit of Montiel--Ros but here recast for general actions of compact Lie groups, to prove effective lower bounds on the Morse index of certain families of closed minimal hypersurfaces in the round four-dimensional sphere, and of free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in the Euclidean four-dimensional ball. Our analysis reveals, in particular, phenomena of linear index growth for sequences of minimal hypersurfaces of fixed topological type, in strong contrast to the three-dimensional scenario.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,J)$ be a $n$-dimensional complex manifold: a $p$-K\"ahler structure (resp. $p$-symplectic structure) on $M$ is a real, closed $(p,p)$-transverse form $\Omega$ (resp. real, closed $2p$-form whose $(p,p)$-component is transverse). We give obstructions to the existence of such structures on compact complex manifolds. We provide several families of compact complex manifolds which admit both $(n-1)$-symplectic structures and special Hermitian metrics.</description>

      <title>A Topological Reimagining of Integration and Exterior Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel, highly general construction of integration, function calculus, and exterior calculus was achieved in this paper, allowing for integration of unital magma valued functions against (compactified) unital magma valued measures over arbitrary topological spaces. The Riemann integral, geometric product integral, and Lebesgue integral were all shown as special cases. Notions similar to chain complexes were developed to allow this general form of integration to define notions of exterior derivative for differential forms, and of derivatives of functions too. Fundamental realizations, some quite surprising, were achieved on the deepest natures of key concepts of analysis including integration, orientation, differentiation, and more. It's clear that further applications such as calculus on fractals, stochastic calculus, discrete calculus, and many other novel forms of analysis can all be achieved as special cases of this theory.</description>

Abstract: In this expository article we revisit the Bernstein problem for several geometric PDEs including the minimal surface, Monge-Amp\`{e}re, and special Lagrangian equations. We also discuss the minimal surface system where appropriate.

      <title>Min-max theory and existence of H-spheres with arbitrary codimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of branched immersed 2-spheres with prescribed mean curvature, with controlled Morse index and with arbitrary codimensions in closed Riemannian manifold $N$ admitting finite fundamental group, where $\pi_k(N) \neq 0$ and $k \geq 2$, for certain generic choice of prescribed mean curvature vector. Moreover, we enhance this existence result to encompass all possible choices of prescribed mean curvatures under certain Ricci curvature condition on $N$ when $\dim{N} = 3$. When $\dim{N} \geq 4$, we establish a Morse index lower bound while $N$ satisfies some isotropic curvature condition. As a consequence, we can leverage latter strengthened result to construct 2-spheres with parallel mean curvature when $N$ has positive isotropic curvature and $\dim{N} \geq 4$. At last, we partially resolve the homotopy problem concerning the existence of a representative surface with prescribed mean curvature type vector field in some given homotopy classes.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework of intelligence and consciousness based on Riemannian Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding intelligence is a central pursuit in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Intelligence encompasses learning, problem-solving, creativity, and even consciousness. Recent advancements in geometric analysis have revealed new insights into high-dimensional information representation and organisation, exposing intrinsic data structures and dynamic processes within neural and artificial systems. However, a comprehensive framework that unifies the static and dynamic aspects of intelligence is still lacking. This manuscript proposes a mathematical framework based on Riemannian geometry to describe the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence elements are conceptualised as tokens embedded in a high-dimensional space. The learned token embeddings capture the interconnections of tokens across various scenarios and tasks, forming manifolds in the intelligence space. Thought flow is depicted as the sequential activation of tokens along geodesics within these manifolds. During the navigation of geodesics, consciousness, as a self-referential process, perceives the thought flow, evaluates it against predictions, and provides feedback through prediction errors, adjusting the geodesic: non-zero prediction errors, such as learning, lead to the restructuring of the curved manifolds, thus changing the geodesic of thought flow. This dynamic interaction integrates new information, evolves the geometry and facilitates learning. The geometry of intelligence guides consciousness, and consciousness structures the geometry of intelligence. By integrating geometric concepts, this proposed theory offers a unified, mathematically framework for describing the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Applicable to biological and artificial intelligence, this framework may pave the way for future research and empirical validation.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Voxelization and Mesh Morphing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the differentiable voxelization of 3D meshes via the winding number and solid angles. The proposed approach achieves fast, flexible, and accurate voxelization of 3D meshes, admitting the computation of gradients with respect to the input mesh and GPU acceleration. We further demonstrate the application of the proposed voxelization in mesh morphing, where the voxelized mesh is deformed by a neural network. The proposed method is evaluated on the ShapeNet dataset and achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Singular Nakano positivity of direct image sheaves of adjoint bundles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a proper K\"ahler fibration $f \colon X \to Y$ and a singular Hermitian line bundle $(L, h)$ on $X$ with semi-positive curvature. We prove that the direct image sheaf $f_{*}(\mathcal{O}_{X}(K_{X/Y}+L) \otimes \mathcal{I}(h))$, equipped with the Narasimhan-Simha metric, is singular Nakano semi-positive in the sense that the $\overline{\partial}$-equation can be solved with optimal $L^{2}$-estimate. Our proof does not rely on the theory of Griffiths positivity for the direct image sheaf.</description>

      <title>Moduli stacks of quiver bundles with applications to Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a general method for constructing moduli stacks whose points are diagrams of vector bundles over a fixed base, indexed by a fixed simplicial set -- that is, quiver bundles of a fixed shape. We discuss some constraints on the base for these moduli stacks to be algebraic and observe that a large class of interesting schemes satisfy these constraints. Using this construction, we provide an alternate construction of moduli stacks of Higgs bundles along with a proof of algebraicity following readily from the algebraicity of moduli stacks of quiver bundles. One feature of our approach is that, for each of the moduli stacks we discuss, there are algebraic moduli stacks parametrizing morphisms of the objects being classified. We discuss some potential applications of this in categorifying non-abelian Hodge theory in a sense we will make precise. We also discuss potential applications of our methods and perspectives to the subjects of quiver modifications, abstract moduli theory, and homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>A Hodge filtration of logarithmic vector fields for well-generated complex reflection groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:1809.05026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given an irreducible well-generated complex reflection group, we construct an explicit basis for the module of vector fields with logarithmic poles along its reflection arrangement. This construction yields in particular a Hodge filtration of that module. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of a flat connection applied to the primitive vector field. This generalizes and unifies analogous results for real reflection groups.</description>

      <title>Horizontality with infinite complexity in the twistor spaces on tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02748v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of horizontality in the twistor space $\hat{E}$ associated with an oriented vector bundle $E$ of rank $4$ with a positive-definite metric over a torus. If the horizontality has finite complexity of degree $d&gt;2$ for an element of a fiber of $\hat{E}$, then the complexity is expressed in terms of a finite subgroup of $SO(3)$ ([2]). In the present paper, we observe that if the horizontality has infinite complexity derived from one of the cases studied in [2], then the complexity is expressed by a dense subset of $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and scattering for wave equations on hyperbolic spaces with singular data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the wave and Klein-Gordon equations on the real hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ ($n \geq2$) in a framework based on weak-$L^{p}$ spaces. First, we establish dispersive estimates on Lorentz spaces in the context of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$. Then, employing those estimates, we prove global well-posedness of solutions and an exponential asymptotic stability property. Moreover, we develop a scattering theory and construct wave operators in such singular framework.</description>

      <title>On the Ohsawa-Takegoshi $L^2$ extension theorem and removable singularities of plurisubharmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The celebrated Ohsawa--Takegoshi extension theorem for $L^2$ holomorphic functions on bounded pseudoconvex domains in $\mathbb C^n$ is a fundamental result in several complex variables and complex geometry. Ohsawa conjectured in 1995 that the same theorem still holds for more general bounded complete K\"ahler domains in $\mathbb C^n$. Recently, Chen--Wu--Wang confirmed this conjecture in a special case. In this paper we extend their result to the case of holomorphic sections of twisted canonical bundles over relatively compact complete K\"{a}hler domains in Stein manifolds. As an application we prove a Hartogs type extension theorem for plurisubharmonic functions across a compact complete pluripolar set, which is complementary to a classical result of Shiffman and can be seen as an analogue of the Skoda--El Mir extension theorem for plurisubharmonic functions -- a result that has been vacant since at least 1985.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: R. Thom's gradient conjecture states that if a gradient flow of an analytic function converges to a limit, it does so along a unique limiting direction. In this paper, we extend and settle this conjecture in the context of infinite dimensional problems. Building on the foundational works of {\L}ojasiewicz, L. Simon, and the resolution of the conjecture for finite dimensional cases by Kurdyka-Mostowski-Parusinski, we focus on nonlinear evolutions on Riemannian manifolds as studied by L. Simon. This framework includes geometric PDEs such as minimal surface, harmonic map, mean curvature flow, and normalized Yamabe flow. Our main result not only confirms the uniqueness of the limiting direction but also characterizes the rate of convergence and possible limiting directions for both classical and infinite dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian metric geometry with Riemannian bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study collections of exact Lagrangian submanifolds respecting some uniform Riemannian bounds, which we equip with a metric naturally arising in symplectic topology (e.g. the Lagrangian Hofer metric or the spectral metric). We exhibit many metric and symplectic properties of these spaces, such that they have compact completions and that they contain only finitely many Hamiltonian isotopy classes. We then use this to exclude many unusual phenomena from happening in these bounded spaces. Taking limits in the bounds, we also conclude that there are at most countably many Hamiltonian isotopy classes of exact Lagrangian submanifolds in a Liouville manifold. Under some mild topological assumptions, we get analogous results for monotone Lagrangian submanifolds with a fixed monotonicity constant. Finally, in the process of showing these results, we get new results on the Riemannian geometry of cotangent bundles and surfaces which might be of independent interest.</description>
