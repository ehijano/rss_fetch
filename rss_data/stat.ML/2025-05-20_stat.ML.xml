      <title>Data Balancing Strategies: A Survey of Resampling and Augmentation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imbalanced data poses a significant obstacle in machine learning, as an unequal distribution of class labels often results in skewed predictions and diminished model accuracy. To mitigate this problem, various resampling strategies have been developed, encompassing both oversampling and undersampling techniques aimed at modifying class proportions. Conventional oversampling approaches like SMOTE enhance the representation of the minority class, whereas undersampling methods focus on trimming down the majority class. Advances in deep learning have facilitated the creation of more complex solutions, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), which are capable of producing high-quality synthetic examples. This paper reviews a broad spectrum of data balancing methods, classifying them into categories including synthetic oversampling, adaptive techniques, generative models, ensemble-based strategies, hybrid approaches, undersampling, and neighbor-based methods. Furthermore, it highlights current developments in resampling techniques and discusses practical implementations and case studies that validate their effectiveness. The paper concludes by offering perspectives on potential directions for future exploration in this domain.</description>

      <title>Continuous Domain Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world data distributions often shift continuously across multiple latent factors such as time, geography, and socioeconomic context. However, existing domain generalization approaches typically treat domains as discrete or evolving along a single axis (e.g., time), which fails to capture the complex, multi-dimensional nature of real-world variation. This paper introduces the task of Continuous Domain Generalization (CDG), which aims to generalize predictive models to unseen domains defined by arbitrary combinations of continuous variation descriptors. We present a principled framework grounded in geometric and algebraic theory, showing that optimal model parameters across domains lie on a low-dimensional manifold. To model this structure, we propose a Neural Lie Transport Operator (NeuralLTO), which enables structured parameter transitions by enforcing geometric continuity and algebraic consistency. To handle noisy or incomplete domain descriptors, we introduce a gating mechanism to suppress irrelevant dimensions and a local chart-based strategy for robust generalization. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets-including remote sensing, scientific documents, and traffic forecasting-demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in generalization accuracy and robustness under descriptor imperfections.</description>

      <title>Randomised Optimism via Competitive Co-Evolution for Matrix Games with Bandit Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning in games is a fundamental problem in machine learning and artificial intelligence, with numerous applications~\citep{silver2016mastering,schrittwieser2020mastering}. This work investigates two-player zero-sum matrix games with an unknown payoff matrix and bandit feedback, where each player observes their actions and the corresponding noisy payoff. Prior studies have proposed algorithms for this setting~\citep{o2021matrix,maiti2023query,cai2024uncoupled}, with \citet{o2021matrix} demonstrating the effectiveness of deterministic optimism (e.g., \ucb) in achieving sublinear regret. However, the potential of randomised optimism in matrix games remains theoretically unexplored.
  We propose Competitive Co-evolutionary Bandit Learning (\coebl), a novel algorithm that integrates evolutionary algorithms (EAs) into the bandit framework to implement randomised optimism through EA variation operators. We prove that \coebl achieves sublinear regret, matching the performance of deterministic optimism-based methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first theoretical regret analysis of an evolutionary bandit learning algorithm in matrix games.
  Empirical evaluations on diverse matrix game benchmarks demonstrate that \coebl not only achieves sublinear regret but also consistently outperforms classical bandit algorithms, including \exptr~\citep{auer2002nonstochastic}, the variant \exptrni~\citep{cai2024uncoupled}, and \ucb~\citep{o2021matrix}. These results highlight the potential of evolutionary bandit learning, particularly the efficacy of randomised optimism via evolutionary algorithms in game-theoretic settings.</description>

      <title>Scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo: fast uncertainty estimation beyond deep ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new method called scalable Bayesian Monte Carlo (SBMC). The model interpolates between a point estimator and the posterior, and the algorithm is a parallel implementation of a consistent (asymptotically unbiased) Bayesian deep learning algorithm: sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) or Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The method is motivated theoretically, and its utility is demonstrated on practical examples: MNIST, CIFAR, IMDb. A systematic numerical study reveals that parallel implementations of SMC and MCMC are comparable to serial implementations in terms of performance and total cost, and they achieve accuracy at or beyond the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like deep ensembles at convergence, along with substantially improved uncertainty quantification (UQ)--in particular, epistemic UQ. But even parallel implementations are expensive, with an irreducible time barrier much larger than the cost of the MAP estimator. Compressing time further leads to rapid degradation of accuracy, whereas UQ remains valuable. By anchoring to a point estimator we can recover accuracy, while retaining valuable UQ, ultimately delivering strong performance across metrics for a cost comparable to the SOTA.</description>

      <title>Backward Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\textit{Backward Conformal Prediction}$, a method that guarantees conformal coverage while providing flexible control over the size of prediction sets. Unlike standard conformal prediction, which fixes the coverage level and allows the conformal set size to vary, our approach defines a rule that constrains how prediction set sizes behave based on the observed data, and adapts the coverage level accordingly. Our method builds on two key foundations: (i) recent results by Gauthier et al. [2025] on post-hoc validity using e-values, which ensure marginal coverage of the form $\mathbb{P}(Y_{\rm test} \in \hat C_n^{\tilde{\alpha}}(X_{\rm test})) \ge 1 - \mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ up to a first-order Taylor approximation for any data-dependent miscoverage $\tilde{\alpha}$, and (ii) a novel leave-one-out estimator $\hat{\alpha}^{\rm LOO}$ of the marginal miscoverage $\mathbb{E}[\tilde{\alpha}]$ based on the calibration set, ensuring that the theoretical guarantees remain computable in practice. This approach is particularly useful in applications where large prediction sets are impractical such as medical diagnosis. We provide theoretical results and empirical evidence supporting the validity of our method, demonstrating that it maintains computable coverage guarantees while ensuring interpretable, well-controlled prediction set sizes.</description>

      <title>Graphon Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social networks have a small number of large hubs, and a large number of small dense communities. We propose a generative model that captures both hub and dense structures. Based on recent results about graphons on line graphs, our model is a graphon mixture, enabling us to generate sequences of graphs where each graph is a combination of sparse and dense graphs. We propose a new condition on sparse graphs (the max-degree), which enables us to identify hubs. We show theoretically that we can estimate the normalized degree of the hubs, as well as estimate the graphon corresponding to sparse components of graph mixtures. We illustrate our approach on synthetic data, citation graphs, and social networks, showing the benefits of explicitly modeling sparse graphs.</description>

      <title>An Asymptotic Equation Linking WAIC and WBIC in Singular Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical learning, models are classified as regular or singular depending on whether the mapping from parameters to probability distributions is injective. Most models with hierarchical structures or latent variables are singular, for which conventional criteria such as the Akaike Information Criterion and the Bayesian Information Criterion are inapplicable due to the breakdown of normal approximations for the likelihood and posterior. To address this, the Widely Applicable Information Criterion (WAIC) and the Widely Applicable Bayesian Information Criterion (WBIC) have been proposed. Since WAIC and WBIC are computed using posterior distributions at different temperature settings, separate posterior sampling is generally required. In this paper, we theoretically derive an asymptotic equation that links WAIC and WBIC, despite their dependence on different posteriors. This equation yields an asymptotically unbiased expression of WAIC in terms of the posterior distribution used for WBIC. The result clarifies the structural relationship between these criteria within the framework of singular learning theory, and deepens understanding of their asymptotic behavior. This theoretical contribution provides a foundation for future developments in the computational efficiency of model selection in singular models.</description>

      <title>A Probabilistic Perspective on Model Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, model collapse has become a critical issue in language model training, making it essential to understand the underlying mechanisms driving this phenomenon. In this paper, we investigate recursive parametric model training from a probabilistic perspective, aiming to characterize the conditions under which model collapse occurs and, crucially, how it can be mitigated. We conceptualize the recursive training process as a random walk of the model estimate, highlighting how the sample size influences the step size and how the estimation procedure determines the direction and potential bias of the random walk. Under mild conditions, we rigorously show that progressively increasing the sample size at each training step is necessary to prevent model collapse. In particular, when the estimation is unbiased, the required growth rate follows a superlinear pattern. This rate needs to be accelerated even further in the presence of substantial estimation bias. Building on this probabilistic framework, we also investigate the probability that recursive training on synthetic data yields models that outperform those trained solely on real data. Moreover, we extend these results to general parametric model family in an asymptotic regime. Finally, we validate our theoretical results through extensive simulations and a real-world dataset.</description>

      <title>Computational Efficiency under Covariate Shift in Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the covariate shift problem in the context of nonparametric regression within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Covariate shift arises in supervised learning when the input distributions of the training and test data differ, presenting additional challenges for learning. Although kernel methods have optimal statistical properties, their high computational demands in terms of time and, particularly, memory, limit their scalability to large datasets. To address this limitation, the main focus of this paper is to explore the trade-off between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy under covariate shift. We investigate the use of random projections where the hypothesis space consists of a random subspace within a given RKHS. Our results show that, even in the presence of covariate shift, significant computational savings can be achieved without compromising learning performance.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional Nonparametric Contextual Bandit Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the kernelized contextual bandit problem with a large feature space. This problem involves $K$ arms, and the goal of the forecaster is to maximize the cumulative rewards through learning the relationship between the contexts and the rewards. It serves as a general framework for various decision-making scenarios, such as personalized online advertising and recommendation systems. Kernelized contextual bandits generalize the linear contextual bandit problem and offers a greater modeling flexibility. Existing methods, when applied to Gaussian kernels, yield a trivial bound of $O(T)$ when we consider $\Omega(\log T)$ feature dimensions. To address this, we introduce stochastic assumptions on the context distribution and show that no-regret learning is achievable even when the number of dimensions grows up to the number of samples. Furthermore, we analyze lenient regret, which allows a per-round regret of at most $\Delta &gt; 0$. We derive the rate of lenient regret in terms of $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Bernstein Normalizing Flows for Flexible Multivariate Density Regression with Interpretable Marginals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density regression models allow a comprehensive understanding of data by modeling the complete conditional probability distribution. While flexible estimation approaches such as normalizing flows (NF) work particularly well in multiple dimensions, interpreting the input-output relationship of such models is often difficult, due to the black-box character of deep learning models. In contrast, existing statistical methods for multivariate outcomes such as multivariate conditional transformation models (MCTM) are restricted in flexibility and are often not expressive enough to represent complex multivariate probability distributions. In this paper, we combine MCTM with state-of-the-art and autoregressive NF to leverage the transparency of MCTM for modeling interpretable feature effects on the marginal distributions in the first step and the flexibility of neural-network-based NF techniques to account for complex and non-linear relationships in the joint data distribution. We demonstrate our method's versatility in various numerical experiments and compare it with MCTM and other NF models on both simulated and real-world data.</description>

      <title>From stability of Langevin diffusion to convergence of proximal MCMC for non-log-concave sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of sampling distributions stemming from non-convex potentials with Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm (ULA). We prove the stability of the discrete-time ULA to drift approximations under the assumption that the potential is strongly convex at infinity. In many context, e.g. imaging inverse problems, potentials are non-convex and non-smooth. Proximal Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm (PSGLA) is a popular algorithm to handle such potentials. It combines the forward-backward optimization algorithm with a ULA step. Our main stability result combined with properties of the Moreau envelope allows us to derive the first proof of convergence of the PSGLA for non-convex potentials. We empirically validate our methodology on synthetic data and in the context of imaging inverse problems. In particular, we observe that PSGLA exhibits faster convergence rates than Stochastic Gradient Langevin Algorithm for posterior sampling while preserving its restoration properties.</description>

      <title>A system identification approach to clustering vector autoregressive time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustering of time series based on their underlying dynamics is keeping attracting researchers due to its impacts on assisting complex system modelling. Most current time series clustering methods handle only scalar time series, treat them as white noise, or rely on domain knowledge for high-quality feature construction, where the autocorrelation pattern/feature is mostly ignored. Instead of relying on heuristic feature/metric construction, the system identification approach allows treating vector time series clustering by explicitly considering their underlying autoregressive dynamics. We first derive a clustering algorithm based on a mixture autoregressive model. Unfortunately it turns out to have significant computational problems. We then derive a `small-noise' limiting version of the algorithm, which we call k-LMVAR (Limiting Mixture Vector AutoRegression), that is computationally manageable. We develop an associated BIC criterion for choosing the number of clusters and model order. The algorithm performs very well in comparative simulations and also scales well computationally.</description>

Abstract: The Determinantal Point Process (DPP) is a parameterized model for multivariate binary variables, characterized by a correlation kernel matrix. This paper proposes a closed form estimator of this kernel, which is particularly easy to implement and can also be used as a starting value of learning algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation.

      <title>High-Dimensional Analysis of Bootstrap Ensemble Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bootstrap methods have long been a cornerstone of ensemble learning in machine learning. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of bootstrap techniques applied to the Least Square Support Vector Machine (LSSVM) ensemble in the context of large and growing sample sizes and feature dimensionalities. Leveraging tools from Random Matrix Theory, we investigate the performance of this classifier that aggregates decision functions from multiple weak classifiers, each trained on different subsets of the data. We provide insights into the use of bootstrap methods in high-dimensional settings, enhancing our understanding of their impact. Based on these findings, we propose strategies to select the number of subsets and the regularization parameter that maximize the performance of the LSSVM. Empirical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>End-to-end fully-binarized network design: from Generic Learned Thermometer to Block Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing works on Binary Neural Network (BNN) mainly focus on model's weights and activations while discarding considerations on the input raw data. This article introduces Generic Learned Thermometer (GLT), an encoding technique to improve input data representation for BNN, relying on learning non linear quantization thresholds. This technique consists in multiple data binarizations which can advantageously replace a conventional Analog to Digital Conversion (ADC) that uses natural binary coding. Additionally, we jointly propose a compact topology with light-weight grouped convolutions being trained thanks to block pruning and Knowledge Distillation (KD), aiming at reducing furthermore the model size so as its computational complexity. We show that GLT brings versatility to the BNN by intrinsically performing global tone mapping, enabling significant accuracy gains in practice (demonstrated by simulations on the STL-10 and VWW datasets). Moreover, when combining GLT with our proposed block-pruning technique, we successfully achieve lightweight (under 1Mb), fully-binarized models with limited accuracy degradation while being suitable for in-sensor always-on inference use cases.</description>

      <title>Online Decision-Focused Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) is an increasingly popular paradigm for training predictive models whose outputs are used in decision-making tasks. Instead of merely optimizing for predictive accuracy, DFL trains models to directly minimize the loss associated with downstream decisions. This end-to-end strategy holds promise for tackling complex combinatorial problems; however, existing studies focus solely on scenarios where a fixed batch of data is available and the objective function does not change over time. We instead investigate DFL in dynamic environments where the objective function and data distribution evolve over time. This setting is challenging because the objective function has zero or undefined gradients -- which prevents the use of standard first-order optimization methods -- and is generally non-convex. To address these difficulties, we (i) regularize the objective to make it differentiable and (ii) make use of the optimism principle, based on a near-optimal oracle along with an appropriate perturbation. This leads to a practical online algorithm for which we establish bounds on the expected dynamic regret, both when the decision space is a simplex and when it is a general bounded convex polytope. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm by comparing its performance with a classic prediction-focused approach on a simple knapsack experiment.</description>

      <title>Minimax Rates of Estimation for Optimal Transport Map between Infinite-Dimensional Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the estimation of an optimal transport map between probability measures on an infinite-dimensional space and reveal its minimax optimal rate. Optimal transport theory defines distances within a space of probability measures, utilizing an optimal transport map as its key component. Estimating the optimal transport map from samples finds several applications, such as simulating dynamics between probability measures and functional data analysis. However, some transport maps on infinite-dimensional spaces require exponential-order data for estimation, which undermines their applicability. In this paper, we investigate the estimation of an optimal transport map between infinite-dimensional spaces, focusing on optimal transport maps characterized by the notion of $\gamma$-smoothness. Consequently, we show that the order of the minimax risk is polynomial rate in the sample size even in the infinite-dimensional setup. We also develop an estimator whose estimation error matches the minimax optimal rate. With these results, we obtain a class of reasonably estimable optimal transport maps on infinite-dimensional spaces and a method for their estimation. Our experiments validate the theory and practical utility of our approach with application to functional data analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) is a powerful tool for automating architecture design. One-Shot NAS techniques, such as DARTS, have gained substantial popularity due to their combination of search efficiency with simplicity of implementation. By design, One-Shot methods have high GPU memory requirements during the search. To mitigate this issue, we propose to prune the search space in an efficient automatic manner to reduce memory consumption and search time while preserving the search accuracy. Specifically, we utilise Zero-Shot NAS to efficiently remove low-performing architectures from the search space before applying One-Shot NAS to the pruned search space. Experimental results on the DARTS search space show that our approach reduces memory consumption by 81% compared to the baseline One-Shot setup while achieving the same level of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Bounds and Random Estimates of Metric Tensors on Neuromanifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high dimensional parameter space of modern deep neural networks -- the neuromanifold -- is endowed with a unique metric tensor defined by the Fisher information, estimating which is crucial for both theory and practical methods in deep learning. To analyze this tensor for classification networks, we return to a low dimensional space of probability distributions -- the core space -- and carefully analyze the spectrum of its Riemannian metric. We extend our discoveries there into deterministic bounds of the metric tensor on the neuromanifold. We introduce an unbiased random estimate of the metric tensor and its bounds based on Hutchinson's trace estimator. It can be evaluated efficiently through a single backward pass and can be used to estimate the diagonal, or block diagonal, or the full tensor. Its quality is guaranteed with a standard deviation bounded by the true value up to scaling.</description>

      <title>Sobolev Gradient Ascent for Optimal Transport: Barycenter Optimization and Convergence Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new constraint-free concave dual formulation for the Wasserstein barycenter. Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA) algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal transport barycenter solvers.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging Gaussian Process Inference with Approximate Sketch-and-Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) play an essential role in biostatistics, scientific machine learning, and Bayesian optimization for their ability to provide probabilistic predictions and model uncertainty. However, GP inference struggles to scale to large datasets (which are common in modern applications), since it requires the solution of a linear system whose size scales quadratically with the number of samples in the dataset. We propose an approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm ($\texttt{ADASAP}$) for solving these linear systems, which improves scalability. We use the theory of determinantal point processes to show that the posterior mean induced by sketch-and-project rapidly converges to the true posterior mean. In particular, this yields the first efficient, condition number-free algorithm for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral basis functions, showing that our approach is principled for GP inference. $\texttt{ADASAP}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on conjugate gradient and coordinate descent across several benchmark datasets and a large-scale Bayesian optimization task. Moreover, $\texttt{ADASAP}$ scales to a dataset with $&gt; 3 \cdot 10^8$ samples, a feat which has not been accomplished in the literature.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Non-stationary Data Streams for Recognition of the Unknown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of data non-stationarity is commonly addressed in data stream processing. In a dynamic environment, methods should continuously be ready to analyze time-varying data -- hence, they should enable incremental training and respond to concept drifts. An equally important variability typical for non-stationary data stream environments is the emergence of new, previously unknown classes. Often, methods focus on one of these two phenomena -- detection of concept drifts or detection of novel classes -- while both difficulties can be observed in data streams. Additionally, concerning previously unknown observations, the topic of open set of classes has become particularly important in recent years, where the goal of methods is to efficiently classify within known classes and recognize objects outside the model competence. This article presents a strategy for synthetic data stream generation in which both concept drifts and the emergence of new classes representing unknown objects occur. The presented research shows how unsupervised drift detectors address the task of detecting novelty and concept drifts and demonstrates how the generated data streams can be utilized in the open set recognition task.</description>

      <title>Panda: A pretrained forecast model for universal representation of chaotic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaotic systems are intrinsically sensitive to small errors, challenging efforts to construct predictive data-driven models of real-world dynamical systems such as fluid flows or neuronal activity. Prior efforts comprise either specialized models trained separately on individual time series, or foundation models trained on vast time series databases with little underlying dynamical structure. Motivated by dynamical systems theory, we present Panda, Patched Attention for Nonlinear DynAmics. We train Panda on a novel synthetic, extensible dataset of $2 \times 10^4$ chaotic dynamical systems that we discover using an evolutionary algorithm. Trained purely on simulated data, Panda exhibits emergent properties: zero-shot forecasting of unseen real world chaotic systems, and nonlinear resonance patterns in cross-channel attention heads. Despite having been trained only on low-dimensional ordinary differential equations, Panda spontaneously develops the ability to predict partial differential equations without retraining. We demonstrate a neural scaling law for differential equations, underscoring the potential of pretrained models for probing abstract mathematical domains like nonlinear dynamics.</description>

      <title>Consistency Conditions for Differentiable Surrogate Losses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The statistical consistency of surrogate losses for discrete prediction tasks is often checked via the condition of calibration. However, directly verifying calibration can be arduous. Recent work shows that for polyhedral surrogates, a less arduous condition, indirect elicitation (IE), is still equivalent to calibration. We give the first results of this type for non-polyhedral surrogates, specifically the class of convex differentiable losses. We first prove that under mild conditions, IE and calibration are equivalent for one-dimensional losses in this class. We construct a counter-example that shows that this equivalence fails in higher dimensions. This motivates the introduction of strong IE, a strengthened form of IE that is equally easy to verify. We establish that strong IE implies calibration for differentiable surrogates and is both necessary and sufficient for strongly convex, differentiable surrogates. Finally, we apply these results to a range of problems to demonstrate the power of IE and strong IE for designing and analyzing consistent differentiable surrogates.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Online RL with Offline Data is All You Need: A Unified Hybrid RL Algorithm Design and Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a hybrid learning framework for reinforcement learning (RL) in which the agent can leverage both an offline dataset and online interactions to learn the optimal policy. We present a unified algorithm and analysis and show that augmenting confidence-based online RL algorithms with the offline dataset outperforms any pure online or offline algorithm alone and achieves state-of-the-art results under two learning metrics, i.e., sub-optimality gap and online learning regret. Specifically, we show that our algorithm achieves a sub-optimality gap $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)+N_1}) )$, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^*|\rho)$ is a new concentrability coefficient, $N_0$ and $N_1$ are the numbers of offline and online samples, respectively. For regret minimization, we show that it achieves a constant $\tilde{O}( \sqrt{N_1/(N_0/\mathtt{C}(\pi^{-}|\rho)+N_1)} )$ speed-up compared to pure online learning, where $\mathtt{C}(\pi^-|\rho)$ is the concentrability coefficient over all sub-optimal policies. Our results also reveal an interesting separation on the desired coverage properties of the offline dataset for sub-optimality gap minimization and regret minimization. We further validate our theoretical findings in several experiments in special RL models such as linear contextual bandits and Markov decision processes (MDPs).</description>

      <title>Ice Cream Doesn't Cause Drowning: Benchmarking LLMs Against Statistical Pitfalls in Causal Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reliable causal inference is essential for making decisions in high-stakes areas like medicine, economics, and public policy. However, it remains unclear whether large language models (LLMs) can handle rigorous and trustworthy statistical causal inference. Current benchmarks usually involve simplified tasks. For example, these tasks might only ask LLMs to identify semantic causal relationships or draw conclusions directly from raw data. As a result, models may overlook important statistical pitfalls, such as Simpson's paradox or selection bias. This oversight limits the applicability of LLMs in the real world. To address these limitations, we propose CausalPitfalls, a comprehensive benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the capability of LLMs in overcoming common causal inference pitfalls. Our benchmark features structured challenges across multiple difficulty levels, each paired with grading rubrics. This approach allows us to quantitatively measure both causal reasoning capabilities and the reliability of LLMs' responses. We evaluate models using two protocols: (1) direct prompting, which assesses intrinsic causal reasoning, and (2) code-assisted prompting, where models generate executable code for explicit statistical analysis. Additionally, we validate the effectiveness of this judge by comparing its scoring with assessments from human experts. Our results reveal significant limitations in current LLMs when performing statistical causal inference. The CausalPitfalls benchmark provides essential guidance and quantitative metrics to advance the development of trustworthy causal reasoning systems.</description>

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) provides a powerful framework for estimating the value of a counterfactual policy using observational data, without the need for additional experimentation. Despite recent progress in robust and efficient OPE across various settings, rigorous efficiency analysis of OPE under an estimated optimal policy remains limited. In this paper, we establish a concise characterization of the efficient influence function for the value function under optimal policy within canonical Markov decision process models. Specifically, we provide the sufficient conditions for the existence of the efficient influence function and characterize its expression. We also give the conditions under which the EIF does not exist.</description>

Abstract: Although adversarial training is known to be effective against adversarial examples, training dynamics are not well understood. In this study, we present the first theoretical analysis of adversarial training in random deep neural networks without any assumptions on data distributions. We introduce a new theoretical framework based on mean field theory, which addresses the limitations of existing mean field-based approaches. Based on this framework, we derive (empirically tight) upper bounds of $\ell_q$ norm-based adversarial loss with $\ell_p$ norm-based adversarial examples for various values of $p$ and $q$. Moreover, we prove that networks without shortcuts are generally not adversarially trainable and that adversarial training reduces network capacity. We also show that network width alleviates these issues. Furthermore, we present the various impacts of the input and output dimensions on the upper bounds and time evolution of the weight variance.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Pretrained Transformers may be Universally Robust In-Context Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial training is one of the most effective adversarial defenses, but it incurs a high computational cost. In this study, we show that transformers adversarially pretrained on diverse tasks can serve as robust foundation models and eliminate the need for adversarial training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we theoretically demonstrate that through in-context learning, a single adversarially pretrained transformer can robustly generalize to multiple unseen tasks without any additional training, i.e., without any parameter updates. This robustness stems from the model's focus on robust features and its resistance to attacks that exploit non-predictive features. Besides these positive findings, we also identify several limitations. Under certain conditions (though unrealistic), no universally robust single-layer transformers exist. Moreover, robust transformers exhibit an accuracy--robustness trade-off and require a large number of in-context demonstrations. The code is available at https://github.com/s-kumano/universally-robust-in-context-learner.</description>

      <title>Regularized least squares learning with heavy-tailed noise is minimax optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the performance of ridge regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces in the presence of noise that exhibits a finite number of higher moments. We establish excess risk bounds consisting of subgaussian and polynomial terms based on the well known integral operator framework. The dominant subgaussian component allows to achieve convergence rates that have previously only been derived under subexponential noise - a prevalent assumption in related work from the last two decades. These rates are optimal under standard eigenvalue decay conditions, demonstrating the asymptotic robustness of regularized least squares against heavy-tailed noise. Our derivations are based on a Fuk-Nagaev inequality for Hilbert-space valued random variables.</description>

      <title>The Post Double LASSO for Efficiency Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big data and machine learning methods have become commonplace across economic milieus. One area that has not seen as much attention to these important topics yet is efficiency analysis. We show how the availability of big (wide) data can actually make detection of inefficiency more challenging. We then show how machine learning methods can be leveraged to adequately estimate the primitives of the frontier itself as well as inefficiency using the `post double LASSO' by deriving Neyman orthogonal moment conditions for this problem. Finally, an application is presented to illustrate key differences of the post-double LASSO compared to other approaches.</description>

      <title>Mixing times of data-augmentation Gibbs samplers for high-dimensional probit regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of popular data-augmentation samplers for Bayesian probit regression. Leveraging recent results on Gibbs samplers for log-concave targets, we provide simple and explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the associated mixing times (in Kullback-Leibler divergence). The bounds depend explicitly on the design matrix and the prior precision, while they hold uniformly over the vector of responses. We specialize the results for different regimes of statistical interest, when both the number of data points $n$ and parameters $p$ are large: in particular we identify scenarios where the mixing times remain bounded as $n,p\to\infty$, and ones where they do not. The results are shown to be tight (in the worst case with respect to the responses) and provide guidance on choices of prior distributions that provably lead to fast mixing. An empirical analysis based on coupling techniques suggests that the bounds are effective in predicting practically observed behaviours.</description>

      <title>Just One Layer Norm Guarantees Stable Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spite of their prevalence, the behaviour of Neural Networks when extrapolating far from the training distribution remains poorly understood, with existing results limited to specific cases. In this work, we prove general results -- the first of their kind -- by applying Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory to analyse infinitely-wide neural networks trained until convergence and prove that the inclusion of just one Layer Norm (LN) fundamentally alters the induced NTK, transforming it into a bounded-variance kernel. As a result, the output of an infinitely wide network with at least one LN remains bounded, even on inputs far from the training data. In contrast, we show that a broad class of networks without LN can produce pathologically large outputs for certain inputs. We support these theoretical findings with empirical experiments on finite-width networks, demonstrating that while standard NNs often exhibit uncontrolled growth outside the training domain, a single LN layer effectively mitigates this instability. Finally, we explore real-world implications of this extrapolatory stability, including applications to predicting residue sizes in proteins larger than those seen during training and estimating age from facial images of underrepresented ethnicities absent from the training set.</description>

      <title>Inference with correlated priors using sisters cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common view of sensory processing is as probabilistic inference of latent causes from receptor activations. Standard approaches often assume these causes are a priori independent, yet real-world generative factors are typically correlated. Representing such structured priors in neural systems poses architectural challenges, particularly when direct interactions between units representing latent causes are biologically implausible or computationally expensive. Inspired by the architecture of the olfactory bulb, we propose a novel circuit motif that enables inference with correlated priors without requiring direct interactions among latent cause units. The key insight lies in using sister cells: neurons receiving shared receptor input but connected differently to local interneurons. The required interactions among latent units are implemented indirectly through their connections to the sister cells, such that correlated connectivity implies anti-correlation in the prior and vice versa. We use geometric arguments to construct connectivity that implements a given prior and to bound the number of causes for which such priors can be constructed. Using simulations, we demonstrate the efficacy of such priors for inference in noisy environments and compare the inference dynamics to those experimentally observed. Finally, we show how, under certain assumptions on latent representations, the prior used can be inferred from sister cell activations. While biologically grounded in the olfactory system, our mechanism generalises to other natural and artificial sensory systems and may inform the design of architectures for efficient inference under correlated latent structure.</description>

      <title>CSTS: A Benchmark for the Discovery of Correlation Structures in Time Series Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series clustering promises to uncover hidden structural patterns in data with applications across healthcare, finance, industrial systems, and other critical domains. However, without validated ground truth information, researchers cannot objectively assess clustering quality or determine whether poor results stem from absent structures in the data, algorithmic limitations, or inappropriate validation methods, raising the question whether clustering is "more art than science" (Guyon et al., 2009). To address these challenges, we introduce CSTS (Correlation Structures in Time Series), a synthetic benchmark for evaluating the discovery of correlation structures in multivariate time series data. CSTS provides a clean benchmark that enables researchers to isolate and identify specific causes of clustering failures by differentiating between correlation structure deterioration and limitations of clustering algorithms and validation methods. Our contributions are: (1) a comprehensive benchmark for correlation structure discovery with distinct correlation structures, systematically varied data conditions, established performance thresholds, and recommended evaluation protocols; (2) empirical validation of correlation structure preservation showing moderate distortion from downsampling and minimal effects from distribution shifts and sparsification; and (3) an extensible data generation framework enabling structure-first clustering evaluation. A case study demonstrates CSTS's practical utility by identifying an algorithm's previously undocumented sensitivity to non-normal distributions, illustrating how the benchmark enables precise diagnosis of methodological limitations. CSTS advances rigorous evaluation standards for correlation-based time series clustering.</description>

      <title>Sequential Kernelized Independence Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.07383v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Independence testing is a classical statistical problem that has been extensively studied in the batch setting when one fixes the sample size before collecting data. However, practitioners often prefer procedures that adapt to the complexity of a problem at hand instead of setting sample size in advance. Ideally, such procedures should (a) stop earlier on easy tasks (and later on harder tasks), hence making better use of available resources, and (b) continuously monitor the data and efficiently incorporate statistical evidence after collecting new data, while controlling the false alarm rate. Classical batch tests are not tailored for streaming data: valid inference after data peeking requires correcting for multiple testing which results in low power. Following the principle of testing by betting, we design sequential kernelized independence tests that overcome such shortcomings. We exemplify our broad framework using bets inspired by kernelized dependence measures, e.g., the Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion. Our test is also valid under non-i.i.d., time-varying settings. We demonstrate the power of our approaches on both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Meta-Learning Can Guarantee Faster Rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10870v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many recent theoretical works on \emph{meta-learning} aim to achieve guarantees in leveraging similar representational structures from related tasks towards simplifying a target task. The main aim of theoretical guarantees on the subject is to establish the extent to which convergence rates -- in learning a common representation -- \emph{may scale with the number $N$ of tasks} (as well as the number of samples per task). First steps in this setting demonstrate this property when both the shared representation amongst tasks, and task-specific regression functions, are linear. This linear setting readily reveals the benefits of aggregating tasks, e.g., via averaging arguments. In practice, however, the representation is often highly nonlinear, introducing nontrivial biases in each task that cannot easily be averaged out as in the linear case. In the present work, we derive theoretical guarantees for meta-learning with nonlinear representations. In particular, assuming the shared nonlinearity maps to an infinite dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space, we show that additional biases can be mitigated with careful regularization that leverages the smoothness of task-specific regression functions, yielding improved rates that scale with the number of tasks as desired.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epilepsy affects around 50 million people globally. Electroencephalography (EEG) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) based spike detection plays a crucial role in diagnosis and treatment. Manual spike identification is time-consuming and requires specialized training that further limits the number of qualified professionals. To ease the difficulty, various algorithmic approaches have been developed. However, the existing methods face challenges in handling varying channel configurations and in identifying the specific channels where the spikes originate. A novel Nested Deep Learning (NDL) framework is proposed to overcome these limitations. NDL applies a weighted combination of signals across all channels, ensuring adaptability to different channel setups, and allows clinicians to identify key channels more accurately. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on real EEG/MEG datasets, NDL is shown to improve prediction accuracy, achieve channel localization, support cross-modality data integration, and adapt to various neurophysiological applications.</description>

Abstract: Sampling from high-dimensional distributions has wide applications in data science and machine learning but poses significant computational challenges. We introduce Subspace Langevin Monte Carlo (SLMC), a novel and efficient sampling method that generalizes random-coordinate Langevin Monte Carlo and preconditioned Langevin Monte Carlo by projecting the Langevin update onto subsampled eigenblocks of a time-varying preconditioner at each iteration. The advantage of SLMC is its superior adaptability and computational efficiency compared to traditional Langevin Monte Carlo and preconditioned Langevin Monte Carlo. Using coupling arguments, we establish error guarantees for SLMC and demonstrate its practical effectiveness through a few experiments on sampling from ill-conditioned distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive bandwidth selection is a fundamental challenge in nonparametric regression. This paper introduces a new bandwidth selection procedure inspired by the optimality criteria for $\ell_0$-penalized regression. Although similar in spirit to Lepski's method and its variants in selecting the largest interval satisfying an admissibility criterion, our approach stems from a distinct philosophy, utilizing criteria based on $\ell_2$-norms of interval projections rather than explicit point and variance estimates. We obtain non-asymptotic risk bounds for the local polynomial regression methods based on our bandwidth selection procedure which adapt (near-)optimally to the local H\"{o}lder exponent of the underlying regression function simultaneously at all points in its domain. Furthermore, we show that there is a single ideal choice of a global tuning parameter in each case under which the above-mentioned local adaptivity holds. The optimal risks of our methods derive from the properties of solutions to a new ``bandwidth selection equation'' which is of independent interest. We believe that the principles underlying our approach provide a new perspective to the classical yet ever relevant problem of locally adaptive nonparametric regression.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid growth in the number of Large Language Models (LLMs), there has been a recent interest in LLM routing, or directing queries to the cheapest LLM that can deliver a suitable response. We conduct a minimax analysis of the routing problem, providing a lower bound and finding that a simple router that predicts both cost and accuracy for each question can be minimax optimal. Inspired by this, we introduce CARROT, a Cost AwaRe Rate Optimal rouTer that selects a model based on estimates of the models' cost and performance. Alongside CARROT, we also introduce the Smart Price-aware ROUTing (SPROUT) dataset to facilitate routing on a wide spectrum of queries with the latest state-of-the-art LLMs. Using SPROUT and prior benchmarks such as Routerbench and open-LLM-leaderboard-v2 we empirically validate CARROT's performance against several alternative routers.</description>

      <title>Does Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Improve the Robustness of Amortized Bayesian Inference? A Systematic Evaluation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural networks are fragile when confronted with data that significantly deviates from their training distribution. This is true in particular for simulation-based inference methods, such as neural amortized Bayesian inference (ABI), where models trained on simulated data are deployed on noisy real-world observations. Recent robust approaches employ unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to match the embedding spaces of simulated and observed data. However, the lack of comprehensive evaluations across different domain mismatches raises concerns about the reliability in high-stakes applications. We address this gap by systematically testing UDA approaches across a wide range of misspecification scenarios in silico and practice. We demonstrate that aligning summary spaces between domains effectively mitigates the impact of unmodeled phenomena or noise. However, the same alignment mechanism can lead to failures under prior misspecifications - a critical finding with practical consequences. Our results underscore the need for careful consideration of misspecification types when using UDA to increase the robustness of ABI.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Gradient-based Discrete Sampling via Parallel Tempering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While gradient-based discrete samplers are effective in sampling from complex distributions, they are susceptible to getting trapped in local minima, particularly in high-dimensional, multimodal discrete distributions, owing to the discontinuities inherent in these landscapes. To circumvent this issue, we combine parallel tempering, also known as replica exchange, with the discrete Langevin proposal and develop the Parallel Tempering enhanced Discrete Langevin Proposal (PTDLP), which are simulated at a series of temperatures. Significant energy differences prompt sample swaps, which are governed by a Metropolis criterion specifically designed for discrete sampling to ensure detailed balance is maintained. Additionally, we introduce an automatic scheme to determine the optimal temperature schedule and the number of chains, ensuring adaptability across diverse tasks with minimal tuning. Theoretically, we establish that our algorithm converges non-asymptotically to the target energy and exhibits faster mixing compared to a single chain. Empirical results further emphasize the superiority of our method in sampling from complex, multimodal discrete distributions, including synthetic problems, restricted Boltzmann machines, and deep energy-based models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce CO2, an efficient algorithm to produce convexly-weighted coresets with respect to generic smooth divergences. By employing a functional Taylor expansion, we show a local equivalence between sufficiently regular losses and their second order approximations, reducing the coreset selection problem to maximum mean discrepancy minimization. We apply CO2 to the Sinkhorn divergence, providing a novel sampling procedure that requires poly-logarithmically many data points to match the approximation guarantees of random sampling. To show this, we additionally verify several new regularity properties for entropically regularized optimal transport of independent interest. Our approach leads to a new perspective linking coreset selection and kernel quadrature to classical statistical methods such as moment and score matching. We showcase this method with a practical application of subsampling image data, and highlight key directions to explore for improved algorithmic efficiency and theoretical guarantees.</description>

Abstract: Stochastic rising rested bandit (SRRB) is a setting where the arms' expected rewards increase as they are pulled. It models scenarios in which the performances of the different options grow as an effect of an underlying learning process (e.g., online model selection). Even if the bandit literature provides specifically crafted algorithms based on upper-confidence bounds for such a setting, no study about Thompson sampling TS-like algorithms has been performed so far. The strong regularity of the expected rewards in the SRRB setting suggests that specific instances may be tackled effectively using adapted and sliding-window TS approaches. This work provides novel regret analyses for such algorithms in SRRBs, highlighting the challenges and providing new technical tools of independent interest. Our results allow us to identify under which assumptions TS-like algorithms succeed in achieving sublinear regret and which properties of the environment govern the complexity of the regret minimization problem when approached with TS. Furthermore, we provide a regret lower bound based on a complexity index we introduce. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations comparing TS-like algorithms with state-of-the-art approaches for SRRBs in synthetic and real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Minimum-Excess-Work Guidance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a regularization framework inspired by thermodynamic work for guiding pre-trained probability flow generative models (e.g., continuous normalizing flows or diffusion models) by minimizing excess work, a concept rooted in statistical mechanics and with strong conceptual connections to optimal transport. Our approach enables efficient guidance in sparse-data regimes common to scientific applications, where only limited target samples or partial density constraints are available. We introduce two strategies: Path Guidance for sampling rare transition states by concentrating probability mass on user-defined subsets, and Observable Guidance for aligning generated distributions with experimental observables while preserving entropy. We demonstrate the framework's versatility on a coarse-grained protein model, guiding it to sample transition configurations between folded/unfolded states and correct systematic biases using experimental data. The method bridges thermodynamic principles with modern generative architectures, offering a principled, efficient, and physics-inspired alternative to standard fine-tuning in data-scarce domains. Empirical results highlight improved sample efficiency and bias reduction, underscoring its applicability to molecular simulations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Gated Recurrent Neural Networks with Weighted Time-Delay Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.00228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.00228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data by introducing a gated recurrent unit (GRU) with a weighted time-delay feedback mechanism. Our proposed model, named $\tau$-GRU, is a discretized version of a continuous-time formulation of a recurrent unit, where the dynamics are governed by delay differential equations (DDEs). We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the continuous-time model and show that the proposed feedback mechanism can significantly improve the modeling of long-term dependencies. Our empirical results indicate that $\tau$-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art recurrent units and gated recurrent architectures on a range of tasks, achieving faster convergence and better generalization.</description>

      <title>Conformal Convolution and Monte Carlo Meta-learners for Predictive Inference of Individual Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04906v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating probabilistic forecasts of potential outcomes and individual treatment effects (ITE) is essential for risk-aware decision-making in domains such as healthcare, policy, marketing, and finance. We propose two novel methods: the conformal convolution T-learner (CCT) and the conformal Monte Carlo (CMC) meta-learner, that generate full predictive distributions of both potential outcomes and ITEs. Our approaches combine weighted conformal predictive systems with either analytic convolution of potential outcome distributions or Monte Carlo sampling, addressing covariate shift through propensity score weighting. In contrast to other approaches that allow the generation of potential outcome predictive distributions, our approaches are model agnostic, universal, and come with finite-sample guarantees of probabilistic calibration under knowledge of the propensity score. Regarding estimating the ITE distribution, we formally characterize how assumptions about potential outcomes' noise dependency impact distribution validity and establish universal consistency under independence noise assumptions. Experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve probabilistically calibrated predictive distributions while maintaining narrow prediction intervals and having performant continuous ranked probability scores. Besides probabilistic forecasting performance, we observe significant efficiency gains for the CCT- and CMC meta-learners compared to other conformal approaches that produce prediction intervals for ITE with coverage guarantees.</description>

      <title>Self Supervised Correlation-based Permutations for Multi-View Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combining data from different sources can improve data analysis tasks such as clustering. However, most of the current multi-view clustering methods are limited to specific domains or rely on a suboptimal and computationally intensive two-stage process of representation learning and clustering. We propose an end-to-end deep learning-based multi-view clustering framework for general data types (such as images and tables). Our approach involves generating meaningful fused representations using a novel permutation-based canonical correlation objective. We provide a theoretical analysis showing how the learned embeddings approximate those obtained by supervised linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Cluster assignments are learned by identifying consistent pseudo-labels across multiple views. Additionally, we establish a theoretical bound on the error caused by incorrect pseudo-labels in the unsupervised representations compared to LDA. Extensive experiments on ten multi-view clustering benchmark datasets provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed model.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Learning of Computational Resource Usage as Graph Structured Multimarginal Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schr\"odinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal prediction has become increasingly popular for quantifying the uncertainty associated with machine learning models. Recent work in graph uncertainty quantification has built upon this approach for conformal graph prediction. The nascent nature of these explorations has led to conflicting choices for implementations, baselines, and method evaluation. In this work, we analyze the design choices made in the literature and discuss the tradeoffs associated with existing methods. Building on the existing implementations, we introduce techniques to scale existing methods to large-scale graph datasets without sacrificing performance. Our theoretical and empirical results justify our recommendations for future scholarship in graph conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Fine-Grained Uncertainty Quantification via Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12127v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new and intuitive metric for aleatoric uncertainty quantification (UQ), the prevalence of class collisions defined as the same input being observed in different classes. We use the rate of class collisions to define the collision matrix, a novel and uniquely fine-grained measure of uncertainty. For a classification problem involving $K$ classes, the $K\times K$ collision matrix $S$ measures the inherent difficulty in distinguishing between each pair of classes. We discuss several applications of the collision matrix, establish its fundamental mathematical properties, as well as show its relationship with existing UQ methods, including the Bayes error rate (BER). We also address the new problem of estimating the collision matrix using one-hot labeled data by proposing a series of innovative techniques to estimate $S$. First, we learn a pair-wise contrastive model which accepts two inputs and determines if they belong to the same class. We then show that this contrastive model (which is PAC learnable) can be used to estimate the Gramian matrix of $S$, defined as $G=S^TS$. Finally, we show that under reasonable assumptions, $G$ can be used to uniquely recover $S$, a new result on non-negative matrices which could be of independent interest. With a method to estimate $S$ established, we demonstrate how this estimate of $S$, in conjunction with the contrastive model, can be used to estimate the posterior class portability distribution of any point. Experimental results are also presented to validate our methods of estimating the collision matrix and class posterior distributions on several datasets.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning in the general setting of nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, their ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.</description>

      <title>Exploring Non-Convex Discrete Energy Landscapes: An Efficient Langevin-Like Sampler with Replica Exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based Discrete Samplers (GDSs) are effective for sampling discrete energy landscapes. However, they often stagnate in complex, non-convex settings. To improve exploration, we introduce the Discrete Replica EXchangE Langevin (DREXEL) sampler and its variant with Adjusted Metropolis (DREAM). These samplers use two GDSs at different temperatures and step sizes: one focuses on local exploitation, while the other explores broader energy landscapes. When energy differences are significant, sample swaps occur, which are determined by a mechanism tailored for discrete sampling to ensure detailed balance. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed samplers satisfy detailed balance and converge to the target distribution under mild conditions. Experiments across 2d synthetic simulations, sampling from Ising models and restricted Boltzmann machines, and training deep energy-based models further confirm their efficiency in exploring non-convex discrete energy landscapes.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Synthetic Data via APIs 3: Using Simulators Instead of Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05505v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which closely resembles the original private data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, has become a key tool for unlocking the value of private data without compromising privacy. Recently, Private Evolution (PE) has emerged as a promising method for generating DP synthetic data. Unlike other training-based approaches, PE only requires access to inference APIs from foundation models, enabling it to harness the power of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models. However, a suitable foundation model for a specific private data domain is not always available. In this paper, we discover that the PE framework is sufficiently general to allow APIs beyond foundation models. In particular, we demonstrate that many SoTA data synthesizers that do not rely on neural networks--such as computer graphics-based image generators, which we refer to as simulators--can be effectively integrated into PE. This insight significantly broadens PE's applicability and unlocks the potential of powerful simulators for DP data synthesis. We explore this approach, named Sim-PE, in the context of image synthesis. Across four diverse simulators, Sim-PE performs well, improving the downstream classification accuracy of PE by up to 3x, reducing FID by up to 80%, and offering much greater efficiency. We also show that simulators and foundation models can be easily leveraged together within PE to achieve further improvements. The code is open-sourced in the Private Evolution Python library: https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</description>

      <title>Sharper Risk Bound for Multi-Task Learning with Multi-Graph Dependent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL) with each task involving graph-dependent data, existing generalization analyses yield a \emph{sub-optimal} risk bound of $O(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})$, where $n$ is the number of training samples of each task. However, to improve the risk bound is technically challenging, which is attributed to the lack of a foundational sharper concentration inequality for multi-graph dependent random variables. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes a new Bennett-type inequality, enabling the derivation of a sharper risk bound of $O(\frac{\log n}{n})$. Technically, building on the proposed Bennett-type inequality, we propose a new Talagrand-type inequality for the empirical process, and further develop a new analytical framework of the local fractional Rademacher complexity to enhance generalization analyses in MTL with multi-graph dependent data. Finally, we apply the theoretical advancements to applications such as Macro-AUC optimization, illustrating the superiority of our theoretical results over prior work, which is also verified by experimental results.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneity Matters even More in Distributed Learning: Study from Generalization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the performance of distributed learning systems, i.e., one-round Federated Learning, as measured by the associated generalization error. Specifically, $K$ clients have each $n$ training samples generated independently according to a possibly different data distribution, and their individually chosen models are aggregated by a central server. We study the effect of the discrepancy between the clients' data distributions on the generalization error of the aggregated model. First, we establish in-expectation and tail upper bounds on the generalization error in terms of the distributions. In part, the bounds extend the popular Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) bound, which was developed for the centralized learning setting, i.e., $K=1$, to the distributed learning setting with an arbitrary number of clients $K \geq 1$. Then, we connect with information-theoretic rate-distortion theory to derive possibly tighter \textit{lossy} versions of these bounds. Next, we apply our lossy bounds to study the effect of data heterogeneity across clients on the generalization error for the distributed classification problem in which each client uses Support Vector Machines (DSVM). In this case, we establish explicit generalization error bounds that depend explicitly on the data heterogeneity degree. It is shown that the bound gets smaller as the degree of data heterogeneity across clients increases, thereby suggesting that DSVM generalizes better when the dissimilarity between the clients' training samples is bigger. This finding, which goes beyond DSVM, is validated experimentally through several experiments.</description>

      <title>Property Inheritance for Subtensors in Tensor Train Decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor dimensionality reduction is one of the fundamental tools for modern data science. To address the high computational overhead, fiber-wise sampled subtensors that preserve the original tensor rank are often used in designing efficient and scalable tensor dimensionality reduction. However, the theory of property inheritance for subtensors is still underdevelopment, that is, how the essential properties of the original tensor will be passed to its subtensors. This paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor properties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train setting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise sampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated under various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be well preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling. Overall, this paper provides several handy analytic tools for developing efficient tensor analysis methods.</description>

      <title>Walk the Talk? Measuring the Faithfulness of Large Language Model Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are capable of generating plausible explanations of how they arrived at an answer to a question. However, these explanations can misrepresent the model's "reasoning" process, i.e., they can be unfaithful. This, in turn, can lead to over-trust and misuse. We introduce a new approach for measuring the faithfulness of LLM explanations. First, we provide a rigorous definition of faithfulness. Since LLM explanations mimic human explanations, they often reference high-level concepts in the input question that purportedly influenced the model. We define faithfulness in terms of the difference between the set of concepts that LLM explanations imply are influential and the set that truly are. Second, we present a novel method for estimating faithfulness that is based on: (1) using an auxiliary LLM to modify the values of concepts within model inputs to create realistic counterfactuals, and (2) using a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify the causal effects of concepts at both the example- and dataset-level. Our experiments show that our method can be used to quantify and discover interpretable patterns of unfaithfulness. On a social bias task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations hide the influence of social bias. On a medical question answering task, we uncover cases where LLM explanations provide misleading claims about which pieces of evidence influenced the model's decisions.</description>

      <title>How Effective Can Dropout Be in Multiple Instance Learning ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) is a popular weakly-supervised method for various applications, with a particular interest in histological whole slide image (WSI) classification. Due to the gigapixel resolution of WSI, applications of MIL in WSI typically necessitate a two-stage training scheme: first, extract features from the pre-trained backbone and then perform MIL aggregation. However, it is well-known that this suboptimal training scheme suffers from "noisy" feature embeddings from the backbone and inherent weak supervision, hindering MIL from learning rich and generalizable features. However, the most commonly used technique (i.e., dropout) for mitigating this issue has yet to be explored in MIL. In this paper, we empirically explore how effective the dropout can be in MIL. Interestingly, we observe that dropping the top-k most important instances within a bag leads to better performance and generalization even under noise attack. Based on this key observation, we propose a novel MIL-specific dropout method, termed MIL-Dropout, which systematically determines which instances to drop. Experiments on five MIL benchmark datasets and two WSI datasets demonstrate that MIL-Dropout boosts the performance of current MIL methods with a negligible computational cost.

      <title>Uncertainty quantification of neural network models of evolving processes via Langevin sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a scalable, approximate inference hypernetwork framework for a general model of history-dependent processes. The flexible data model is based on a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) representing the evolution of internal states together with a trainable observation model subcomponent. The posterior distribution corresponding to the data model parameters (weights and biases) follows a stochastic differential equation with a drift term related to the score of the posterior that is learned jointly with the data model parameters. This Langevin sampling approach offers flexibility in balancing the computational budget between the evaluation cost of the data model and the approximation of the posterior density of its parameters. We demonstrate performance of the ensemble sampling hypernetwork on chemical reaction and material physics data and compare it to standard variational inference.</description>

      <title>Practical Efficiency of Muon for Pretraining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02222v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Muon, the simplest instantiation of a second-order optimizer, explicitly expands the Pareto frontier over AdamW on the compute-time tradeoff. We find that Muon is more effective than AdamW in retaining data efficiency at large batch sizes, far beyond the so-called critical batch size, while remaining computationally efficient, thus enabling more economical training. We study the combination of Muon and the maximal update parameterization (muP) for efficient hyperparameter transfer and present a simple telescoping algorithm that accounts for all sources of error in muP while introducing only a modest overhead in resources. We validate our findings through extensive experiments with model sizes up to four billion parameters and ablations on the data distribution and architecture.</description>

      <title>New affine invariant ensemble samplers and their dimensional scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new affine invariant ensemble samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing algorithms, especially for high-dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a derivative-free ensemble side move sampler that performs favorably compared to popular samplers in the $\texttt{emcee}$ package. Additionally, we develop a class of derivative-based ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers with affine invariance, which outperform standard HMC without affine invariance when sampling highly skewed distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.</description>

      <title>Direct Density Ratio Optimization: A Statistically Consistent Approach to Aligning Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial for safe deployment, yet existing methods assume specific preference models like Bradley-Terry model. This assumption leads to statistical inconsistency, where more data doesn't guarantee convergence to true human preferences. To address this critical gap, we introduce a novel alignment method Direct Density Ratio Optimization (DDRO). DDRO directly estimates the density ratio between preferred and unpreferred output distributions, circumventing the need for explicit human preference modeling. We theoretically prove that DDRO is statistically consistent, ensuring convergence to the true preferred distribution as the data size grows, regardless of the underlying preference structure. Experiments demonstrate that DDRO achieves superior performance compared to existing methods on many major benchmarks. DDRO unlocks the potential for truly data-driven alignment, paving the way for more reliable and human-aligned LLMs.</description>

      <title>Whitened Score Diffusion: A Structured Prior for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional score-based diffusion models (DMs) may struggle with anisotropic Gaussian diffusion processes due to the required inversion of covariance matrices in the denoising score matching training objective \cite{vincent_connection_2011}. We propose Whitened Score (WS) diffusion models, a novel framework based on stochastic differential equations that learns the Whitened Score function instead of the standard score. This approach circumvents covariance inversion, extending score-based DMs by enabling stable training of DMs on arbitrary Gaussian forward noising processes. WS DMs establish equivalence with flow matching for arbitrary Gaussian noise, allow for tailored spectral inductive biases, and provide strong Bayesian priors for imaging inverse problems with structured noise. We experiment with a variety of computational imaging tasks using the CIFAR and CelebA ($64\times64$) datasets and demonstrate that WS diffusion priors trained on anisotropic Gaussian noising processes consistently outperform conventional diffusion priors based on isotropic Gaussian noise. Our code is open-sourced at \href{https://github.com/jeffreyalido/wsdiffusion}{\texttt{github.com/jeffreyalido/wsdiffusion}}.</description>

      <title>Variance-Optimal Arm Selection: Regret Minimization and Best Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on selecting the arm with the highest variance from a set of $K$ independent arms. Specifically, we focus on two settings: (i) regret setting, that penalizes the number of pulls of suboptimal arms in terms of variance, and (ii) fixed-budget BAI setting, that evaluates the ability of an algorithm to determine the arm with the highest variance after a fixed number of pulls. We develop a novel online algorithm called \texttt{UCB-VV} for the regret setting and show that its upper bound on regret for bounded rewards evolves as $\mathcal{O}\left(\log{n}\right)$ where $n$ is the horizon. By deriving the lower bound on the regret, we show that \texttt{UCB-VV} is order optimal. For the fixed budget BAI setting, we propose the \texttt{SHVV} algorithm. We show that the upper bound of the error probability of \texttt{SHVV} evolves as $\exp\left(-\frac{n}{\log(K) H}\right)$, where $H$ represents the complexity of the problem, and this rate matches the corresponding lower bound. We extend the framework from bounded distributions to sub-Gaussian distributions using a novel concentration inequality on the sample variance. Leveraging the same, we derive a concentration inequality for the empirical Sharpe ratio (SR) for sub-Gaussian distributions, which was previously unknown in the literature. Empirical simulations show that \texttt{UCB-VV} consistently outperforms \texttt{$\epsilon$-greedy} across different sub-optimality gaps, though it is surpassed by \texttt{VTS}, which exhibits the lowest regret, albeit lacking in theoretical guarantees. We also illustrate the superior performance of \texttt{SHVV}, for a fixed budget setting under 6 different setups against uniform sampling. Finally, we conduct a case study to empirically evaluate the performance of the \texttt{UCB-VV} and \texttt{SHVV} in call option trading on $100$ stocks generated using geometric Brownian motion (GBM).</description>

      <title>A Dataless Reinforcement Learning Approach to Rounding Hyperplane Optimization for Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Maximum Cut (MaxCut) problem is NP-Complete, and obtaining its optimal solution is NP-hard in the worst case. As a result, heuristic-based algorithms are commonly used, though their design often requires significant domain expertise. More recently, learning-based methods trained on large (un)labeled datasets have been proposed; however, these approaches often struggle with generalizability and scalability. A well-known approximation algorithm for MaxCut is the Goemans-Williamson (GW) algorithm, which relaxes the Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation into a semidefinite program (SDP). The GW algorithm then applies hyperplane rounding by uniformly sampling a random hyperplane to convert the SDP solution into binary node assignments. In this paper, we propose a training-data-free approach based on a non-episodic reinforcement learning formulation, in which an agent learns to select improved rounding hyperplanes that yield better cuts than those produced by the GW algorithm. By optimizing over a Markov Decision Process (MDP), our method consistently achieves better cuts across large-scale graphs with varying densities and degree distributions.</description>
