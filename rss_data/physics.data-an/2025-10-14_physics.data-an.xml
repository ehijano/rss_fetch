      <title>Information-theoretic analysis of temporal dependence in discrete stochastic processes: Application to precipitation predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the temporal dependence of precipitation is key to improving weather predictability and developing efficient stochastic rainfall models. We introduce an information-theoretic approach to quantify memory effects in discrete stochastic processes and apply it to daily precipitation records across the contiguous United States. The method is based on the predictability gain, a quantity derived from block entropy that measures the additional information provided by higher-order temporal dependencies. This statistic, combined with a bootstrap-based hypothesis testing and Fisher's method, enables a robust memory estimator from finite data. Tests with generated sequences show that this estimator outperforms other model-selection criteria such as AIC and BIC. Applied to precipitation data, the analysis reveals that daily rainfall occurrence is well described by low-order Markov chains, exhibiting regional and seasonal variations, with stronger correlations in winter along the West Coast and in summer in the Southeast, consistent with known climatological patterns. Overall, our findings establish a framework for building parsimonious stochastic descriptions, useful when addressing spatial heterogeneity in the memory structure of precipitation dynamics, and support further advances in real-time, data-driven forecasting schemes.</description>

      <title>Ensemble-Based Data Assimilation for Material Model Characterization in High-Velocity Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations are essential for understanding and predicting the behavior of materials under high-velocity impact (HVI) in both fundamental research and practical applications. However, their accuracy relies on material models and parameters that are traditionally obtained through manual fitting to multiple time- and labor-intensive experiments. This study presents an ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) framework to automatically and simultaneously calibrate plasticity, fracture, and equation of state (EOS) parameters from a single HVI test. The framework integrates Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics for HVI simulations, the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) for parameter refinement, and adaptive covariance inflation to mitigate uncertainty underestimation. The approach is demonstrated using synthetic back-face deflection data from an AZ31B magnesium plate to identify Johnson-Cook plasticity/fracture and Mie-Gruneisen EOS parameters. Test cases with biased initial guesses and limited data show the EnKF-based framework accurately recovers sensitive parameters in few iterations, indicated by a convergent ensemble standard deviation. Conversely, insensitive parameters converge to incorrect values with persistently large standard deviations. Limited observational data can still achieve convergence but requires more iterations. Under extreme prior bias, sensitive parameters may exhibit a drift-then-stall behavior with small residual biases. In practice, the ensemble standard deviation thus provides a diagnostic tool to assess parameter sensitivity and calibration accuracy. This study demonstrates the proposed DA framework is a robust and efficient tool for HVI material model characterization.</description>

      <title>Large scale statistically validated comorbidity networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain comorbidity networks starting from medical information stored in electronic health records collected by the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland (Varha). Based on the data, we associate each patient to one or more diseases and construct complex comorbidity networks associated with large patient cohorts characterized by an age interval and sex. The information about diseases in electronic health records is coded using the highest granularity present in the international classification of diseases (ICD codes) provided by the World Health Organization. We statistically validate links in each cohort comorbidity network and furthermore partition the networks into communities of diseases. These are characterized by the over-expression of a few disease categories, and communities from different age or sex cohorts show various similarities in terms of these disease classes. Moreover, all the detected communities for all the cohorts can be organized into a hierarchical tree. This allows us to observe a number of clusters of communities, originating from diverse age and sex cohorts, that group together communities characterized by the same disease classes. We also perform a dismantling procedure of statistically validated comorbidity networks to highlight those categories of diseases that are most responsible for the compactedness of the comorbidity networks for a given cohort of patients.</description>

      <title>A Large-Language-Model Assisted Automated Scale Bar Detection and Extraction Framework for Scanning Electron Microscopic Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG) model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii) information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.</description>

      <title>Universal emergence of local Zipf-Mandelbrot law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15946v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plethora of natural and socio-economic phenomena share a striking statistical regularity, that is the magnitude of elements decreases with a power law as a function of their position in a ranking of magnitude. Such regularity is known as Zipf-Mandelbrot law (ZM), and plenty of problem-specific explanations for its emergence have been provided in different fields. Yet, an explanation for ZM ubiquity is currently lacking. In this paper we first provide an analytical expression for the cumulants of any ranked sample of i.i.d. random variables once sorted in decreasing order. Then we make use of this result to rigorously demonstrate that, whenever a small fraction of such ranked dataset is considered, it becomes statistically indistinguishable from a ZM law. We finally validate our results against several relevant examples.</description>

      <title>Learning Selection Cuts With Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many analyses in high-energy physics rely on selection thresholds (cuts) applied to detector, particle, or event properties. Initial cut values can often be guessed from physical intuition, but cut optimization, especially for multiple features, is commonly performed by hand, or skipped entirely in favor of multivariate algorithms like BDTs or neural networks. We revisit this problem, and develop a cut optimization approach based on gradient descent. Cut thresholds are learned as parameters of a network with a simple architecture, and can be tuned to achieve a target signal efficiency through the use of custom loss functions. Contractive terms in the loss can be used to ensure a smooth evolution of cuts as functions of efficiency, particle kinematics, or event features. The method is used to classify events in a search for Supersymmetry, and the performance is compared with common classification tools. An implementation of this approach is available in a public code repository and python package.</description>

      <title>Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs for Interpretable Learning and Symbolic Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental challenge across science and engineering. Deep learning has shown remarkable potential for capturing complex system behavior, yet achieving models that are both accurate and physically interpretable remains difficult. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). Within a Neural ODE architecture, SKANODE employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to interpretable physical quantities such as displacements and velocities. Leveraging KAN's symbolic regression capability, SKANODE then extracts compact, interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior predictive accuracy, discovers physics-consistent dynamics, and reveals complex nonlinear behavior. Notably, it identifies hysteretic behavior in an F-16 aircraft and recovers a concise symbolic equation describing this phenomenon. SKANODE thus enables interpretable, data-driven discovery of physically grounded models for complex nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough Asymmetries across Disciplines and Countries: A Network approach to Structural Complexity of Scientific Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is driven by community endeavors across diverse fields and specializations, forming a complex structure that renders conventional performance evaluation methods inadequate. Using established indicators, the network-based normalized citation score and the disruptive index, combined with the GENEPY algorithm, we evaluate the complexity rank of countries based on their breakthrough performance across 89 subfields of physical sciences, drawing on nearly 60 million articles (1900-2023). This quality-focused integrated approach reveals pronounced asymmetries: while countries such as the United States, Israel, and several in Europe sustain long-term structural advantages, emerging nations show rapid gains in later decades. A power-law relationship between aggregated breakthrough performance and countries' R&amp;D expenditure underscores the unequal and scale-dependent nature of global science. These results demonstrate that scientific advancement arises not from uniform growth but from asymmetric complexity, offering actionable insights for policymakers and funding agencies aiming to foster sustainable, high-quality research ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph: a model for generating realistic time-varying hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-varying group interactions constitute the building blocks of many complex systems. The framework of temporal hypergraphs makes it possible to represent them by taking into account the higher-order and temporal nature of the interactions. However, the corresponding datasets are often incomplete and/or limited in size and duration, and surrogate time-varying hypergraphs able to reproduce their statistical features constitute interesting substitutions, especially to understand how dynamical processes unfold on group interactions. Here, we present a new temporal hypergraph model, the Emerging Activity Temporal Hypergraph (EATH), which can be fed by parameters measured in a dataset and create synthetic datasets with similar properties. In the model, each node has an independent underlying activity dynamic and the overall system activity emerges from the nodes dynamics, with temporal group interactions resulting from both the activity of the nodes and memory mechanisms. We first show that the EATH model can generate surrogate hypergraphs of several empirical datasets of face-to-face interactions, mimicking temporal and topological properties at the node and hyperedge level. We also showcase the possibility to use the resulting synthetic data in simulations of higher-order contagion dynamics, comparing the outcome of such process on original and surrogate datasets. Finally, we illustrate the flexibility of the model, which can generate synthetic hypergraphs with tunable properties: as an example, we generate "hybrid" temporal hypergraphs, which mix properties of different empirical datasets. Our work opens several perspectives, from the generation of synthetic realistic hypergraphs describing contexts where data collection is difficult to a deeper understanding of dynamical processes on temporal hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Robust Causal Discovery in Real-World Time Series with Power-Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring causal relationships in stochastic time series is a challenging yet crucial task with a vast range of applications, including finance, economics, neuroscience, and climate science. Many algorithms for Causal Discovery (CD) have been proposed, but they often exhibit a high sensitivity to noise, resulting in misleading causal inferences when applied to real data. In this paper, we observe that the frequency spectra of typical real-world time series follow a power-law distribution, notably due to an inherent self-organizing behavior. Leveraging this insight, we build a robust CD method based on the extraction of power -law spectral features that amplify genuine causal signals. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets with known causal structures, demonstrating its robustness and practical relevance.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal networks consist of timestamped directed interactions that may appear continuously in time, yet few studies have directly tackled the continuous-time modeling of networks. Here, we introduce a maximum-entropy approach to temporal networks and with basic assumptions on constraints, the corresponding network ensembles admit a modular and interpretable representation: a set of global time processes and a static maximum-entropy edge, e.g. node pair, probability. This time-edge labels factorization yields closed-form log-likelihoods, degree, clustering and motif expectations, and yields a whole class of effective generative models. We provide maximum-entropy derivation of an inhomogeneous Poisson edge intensity for temporal networks via functional optimization over path entropy, connecting NHPP modeling to maximum-entropy network ensembles. NHPP consistently improve log-likelihood over generic Poisson processes, while the maximum-entropy edge labels recover strength constraints and reproduce expected unique-degree curves. We discuss the limitations of this framework and how it can be integrated with multivariate Hawkes calibration procedures, renewal theory, and neural kernel estimation in graph neural networks.</description>
