      <title>Self-Exciting Random Evolutions (SEREs) and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a new so-called self-exciting random evolutions (SEREs) and their applications. We introduce a new random process $x(t)$ such that it is based on a superposition of a Markov chain $x_n$ and a Hawkes process $N(t)$; i.e., $x(t) := x_{N(t)}$. We call this process self-walking imbedded semi-Hawkes process (Swish Process or SwishP). Then the self-exciting REs (SEREs) can be constructed in similar way as, e.g., semi-Markov REs, but instead of semi-Markov process $x(t)$ we have SwishP. We give classifications and examples of self-exciting REs (SEREs). Then we consider limit theorems for SEREs such as averaging, diffusion approximation, normal deviations and rates of convergence of SEREs. Applications of SEREs are devoted to the so-called self-exciting traffic/transport process and self-exciting summation on a Markov chain, which are examples of continuous and discrete SERE, respectively. From these processes we can construct many other self-exciting processes, e.g., such as impulse traffic/transport process, self-exciting risk process, etc. We present averaged, diffusion and normal deviated self-exciting processes. Rates of convergence in these cases are presented as well. The originality and novelty of the paper associated with new features of REs and their many applications, namely, self-exciting and clustering effects.</description>

      <title>Coupling of stochastic differential equations on the Wiener space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the coupling method introduced in Geiss-Ylinen (Memoirs AMS 1335, 2021), we investigate regularity properties of stochastic differential equations, where we consider the Lipschitz case in $\R^d$ and allow for H\"older continuity of the diffusion coefficient of scalar valued stochastic differential equations. Two cases of the coupling method are of special interest: The uniform coupling to treat the space $\D_{1,2}$ and real interpolation spaces, and secondly a cut-off coupling to treat the $L_p$-variation of backward stochastic differential equations where the forward process is the investigated stochastic differential equation.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of eigenvalues of GUE and its minors at fixed index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the distribution of normalized gaps of eigenvalues of $N \times N$ GUE matrix in the bulk, that do not lose logarithmic factors of $N$ in the limit $N \to \infty$. As an application, we obtain fixed index universality results for the GUE minor process, which in turn are useful for establishing limiting results for random hives with GUE boundary data.</description>

      <title>Hypocoercivity meets lifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We unify the variational hypocoercivity framework established by D. Albritton, S. Armstrong, J.-C. Mourrat, and M. Novack, with the notion of second-order lifts of reversible diffusion processes, recently introduced by A. Eberle and F. L\"orler. We give an abstract, yet fully constructive, presentation of the theory, so that it can be applied to a large class of linear kinetic equations. As this hypocoercivity technique does not twist the reference norm, we can recover accurate and sharp convergence rates in various models. Among those, adaptive Langevin dynamics (ALD) is discussed in full detail and we show that for near-quadratic potentials, with suitable choices of parameters, it is a near-optimal second-order lift of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. As a further consequence, we observe that the Generalised Langevin Equation (GLE) is a also a second-order lift, as the standard (kinetic) Langevin dynamics are, of the overdamped Langevin dynamics. Then, convergence of (GLE) cannot exceed ballistic speed, i.e.~the square root of the rate of the overdamped regime. We illustrate this phenomenon with explicit computations in a benchmark Gaussian case.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of the Stochastic OGTT Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) is one of many way to produce data in the study of the diabetes dynamic. In a recent paper [1.]:\textit{ Estimating insulin sensitivity and $ \beta $-cell function from the oral glucose tolerance test: validation of a new insulin sensitivity and secretion (ISS) model, \textit{J. American Physiological Society },(2024)},Ha J., Chung S.T., and al. proposed a comprehensive OGTT model under the form of a dynamic system. But their model was fully deterministic. Yet, our natural environment interacts with noise; thus taking into account that inherent perturbation could potentially improve the model, which in turn could lead to a better estimation of the parameters of the system. The current paper endeavors to explore the OGTT model proposed by Ha and al. but this time with the addition of white noise perturbations to the system.\
  The work is organized as follow: we first establish the existence and uniqueness of a global positive solution to the proposed stochastic model. Then follows the study the statistical stability of the model by examining the existence of an invariant measure to the perturbed system. Once done with the well-posedness and the stability of the stochastic model, we then examine a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) scheme to estimate the parameters involved in the model. The paper ends with a brief discussion on potential future developments follows by an appendix whose goal is to make the paper as self contained as possible.</description>

      <title>Limit error distributions of Milstein scheme for stochastic Volterra equations with singular kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For stochastic Volterra equations driven by standard Brownian and with singular kernels $K(u)=u^{H-\frac{1}{2}}/\Gamma(H+1/2), H\in (0,1/2)$, it is known that the Milstein scheme has a convergence rate of $n^{-2H}$. In this paper, we show that this rate is optimal. Moreover, we show that the error normalized by $n^{-2H}$ converge stably in law to the (nonzero) solution of a certain linear Volterra equation of random coefficients with the same fractional kernel.</description>

      <title>Small-time asymptotics for hypoelliptic diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An inductive procedure is developed to calculate the asymptotic behavior at time zero of a diffusion with polynomial drift and degenerate, additive noise. The procedure gives rise to two different rescalings of the process; namely, a functional law of the iterated logarithm rescaling and a distributional rescaling. The limiting behavior of these rescalings is studied, resulting in two related control problems which are solved in nontrivial examples using methods from geometric control theory. The control information from these problems gives rise to a practical criteria for points to be regular on the boundary of a domain in $\mathbf{R}^n$ for such diffusions.</description>

      <title>Laws of large numbers and central limit theorem for Ewens-Pitman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ewens-Pitman model is a distribution for random partitions of the set $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, with $n\in\mathbb{N}$, indexed by parameters $\alpha \in [0,1)$ and $\theta&gt;-\alpha$, such that $\alpha=0$ is the Ewens model in population genetics. The large $n$ asymptotic behaviour of the number $K_{n}$ of blocks in the Ewens-Pitman random partition has been extensively investigated in terms of almost-sure and Gaussian fluctuations, which show that $K_{n}$ scales as $\log n$ and $n^{\alpha}$ depending on whether $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha\in(0,1)$, providing non-random and random limiting behaviours, respectively. In this paper, we study the large $n$ asymptotic behaviour of $K_{n}$ when the parameter $\theta$ is allowed to depend linearly on $n\in\mathbb{N}$, a non-standard asymptotic regime first considered for $\alpha=0$ in Feng (\textit{The Annals of Applied Probability}, \textbf{17}, 2007). In particular, for $\alpha\in[0,1)$ and $\theta=\lambda n$, with $\lambda&gt;0$, we establish a law of large numbers (LLN) and a central limit theorem (CLT) for $K_{n}$, which show that $K_{n}$ scales as $n$, providing non-random limiting behaviours. Depending on whether $\alpha=0$ or $\alpha\in(0,1)$, our results rely on different arguments. For $\alpha=0$ we rely on the representation of $K_{n}$ as a sum of independent, but not identically distributed, Bernoulli random variables, which leads to a refinement of the CLT in terms of a Berry-Esseen theorem. Instead, for $\alpha\in(0,1)$, we rely on a compound Poisson construction of $K_{n}$, leading to prove LLNs, CLTs and Berry-Esseen theorems for the number of blocks of the negative-Binomial compound Poisson random partition, which are of independent interest.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backwards geodesics for TASEP were introduced in [Fer18]. We consider flat initial conditions and show that under proper scaling its end-point converges to maximizer argument of the Airy$_2$ process minus a parabola. We generalize its definition to generic non-integrable models including ASEP and speed changed ASEP (call it quasi-geodesics). We numerically verify that its end-point is universal, where the scaling coefficients are analytically computed through the KPZ scaling theory.</description>

      <title>On loops in the complement to dimers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ergodic translation-invariant Gibbs measures for the dimer model (i.e. perfect matchings) on the hexagonal lattice. The complement to a dimer configuration is a fully-packed loop configuration: each vertex has degree two. This is also known as the loop $O(1)$ model at $x=\infty$. We show that, if the measure is non-frozen, then it exhibits either infinitely many loops around every face or a unique bi-infinite path.
  Our main tool is the flip (or XOR) operation: if a hexagon contains exactly three dimers, one can replace them by the other three edges. Classical results in the dimer theory imply that such hexagons appear with a positive density. Up to some extent, this replaces the finite-energy property and allows to make use of tools from the percolation theory, in particular the Burton--Keane argument, to exclude existence of more than one bi-infinite path.</description>

      <title>A localisation phase transition for the catalytic branching random walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the existence of a phase transition between a localisation and a non-localisation regime for a branching random walk with a catalyst at the origin. More precisely, we consider a continuous-time branching random walk that jumps at rate one, with simple random walk jumps on $\mathbb Z^d$, and that branches (with binary branching) at rate $\lambda&gt;0$ everywhere, except at the origin, where it branches at rate $\lambda_0&gt;\lambda$. We show that, if $\lambda_0$ is large enough, then the occupation measure of the branching random walk localises (i.e. converges almost surely without spatial renormalisation), whereas, if $\lambda_0$ is close enough to $\lambda$, then localisation cannot occur, at least not in a strong sense. The case $\lambda = 0$ (when branching only occurs at the origin) has been extensively studied in the literature and a transition between localisation and non-localisation was also exhibited in this case. Strikingly, the transition that we observe, conjecture, and partially prove in this paper occurs at the same threshold as in the case $\lambda=0$.</description>

      <title>Random Sums of Weighted Orthogonal Polynomials in ${\mathbb C}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider random polynomials of the form $G_n(z):= \sum_{|\alpha|\leq n} \xi^{(n)}_{\alpha}p_{n,\alpha}(z)$ where $\{\xi^{(n)}_{\alpha}\}_{|\alpha|\leq n}$ are i.i.d. (complex) random variables and $\{p_{n,\alpha}\}_{|\alpha|\leq n}$ form a basis for $\mathcal P_n$, the holomorphic polynomials of degree at most $n$ in ${\mathbb C}^d$. In particular, this includes the setting where $\{p_{n,\alpha}\}$ are orthonormal in a space $L^2(e^{-2n Q} \tau)$, where $\tau$ is a compactly supported Bernstein-Markov measure and $Q$ is a continuous weight function. Under an optimal moment condition on the random variables $\{\xi^{(n)}_{\alpha}\}$, in dimension $d=1$ we prove convergence in probability of the zero measure to the weighted equilibrium measure, and in dimension $d \ge 2$ we prove convergence of zero currents.</description>

      <title>Rotating random trees with Skorokhod's $M_1$ topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the classical coding of measured $\mathbb R$-trees by continuous excursion-type functions to c\`adl\`ag excursion-type functions through the notion of parametric representations. The main feature of this extension is its continuity properties with respect to the \textsc{Gromov-Hausdorff-Prokhorov} topology for $\mathbb R$-trees and \textsc{Skorokhod}'s $M_1$ topology for c\`adl\`ag functions. As a first application, we study the $\mathbb R$-trees $\mathcal T_{x^{(\alpha)}}$ encoded by excursions of spectrally positive $\alpha$-stable \textsc{L\'evy} processes for $\alpha \in (1,2]$. In a second time, we use this setting to study the large-scale effects of a well-known bijection between plane trees and binary trees, the so-called rotation. \textsc{Marckert} has proved that the rotation acts as a dilation on large uniform trees, and we show that this remains true when the rotation is applied to large critical \textsc{Bienaym\'e} trees with offspring distribution attracted to a Gaussian distribution. However, this does not hold anymore when the offspring distribution falls in the domain of attraction of an $\alpha$-stable law with $\alpha \in (1,2)$, and instead we prove that the scaling limit of the rotated trees is $\mathcal T_{x^{(\alpha)}}$.</description>

      <title>Large deviation principle for the stationary measures of open asymmetric simple exclusion processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the stationary measure of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on a finite interval in $\mathbb{Z}$ with open boundaries. Fixing all the jump rates and letting the system size approach infinity, the height profile of such a sequence of stationary measures satisfies a large deviation principle (LDP), whose rate function was predicted in the physics work arXiv:cond-mat/0205353. In this paper, we provide the first rigorous proof of the large deviation principle in the "fan region" part of the phase diagram. Our proof relies on two key ingredients: a two-layer expression of the stationary measure of open ASEP, arising from the Enaud-Derrida representation arXiv:cond-mat/0307023 of the matrix product ansatz, and the large deviation principle of the open totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) recently established in arXiv:2403.03275.</description>

      <title>On Random Simplex Picking Beyond the Blashke Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New selected values of odd random simplex volumetric moments (moments of the volume of a random simplex picked from a given body) are derived in an exact form in various bodies in dimensions three, four, five, and six. In three dimensions, the well-known Efron's formula was used by Buchta &amp; Reitzner and Zinani to deduce the mean volume of a random tetrahedron in a tetrahedron and a cube. However, for higher moments and/or in higher dimensions, the method fails. As it turned out, the same problem is also solvable using the Blashke-Petkantschin formula in Cartesian parametrisation in the form of the Canonical Section Integral (Base-height splitting). In our presentation, we show how to derive the older results mentioned above using our base-height splitting method and also touch on the essential steps of how the method translates to higher dimensions and for higher moments.</description>

Although notoriously hard to tackle, these properties are crucially related to the excluded-volume effect and other central features of real polymers. Our main purpose will be to study ideal chains (Random Walks) on lattice where the ratio between the number of self-intersections and the total length is fixed to some number.</description>

      <title>Hiring Strategies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the hiring problem where a sequence of applicants is sequentially interviewed, and a decision on whether to hire an applicant is immediately made based on the applicant's score. For the maximal and average improvement strategies, the decision depends on the applicant's score and the scores of all employees, i.e., previous successful applicants. For local improvement strategies, an interviewing committee randomly chosen for each applicant makes the decision depending on the score of the applicant and the scores of the members of the committee. These idealized hiring strategies capture the challenges of decision-making under uncertainty. We probe the average score of the best employee, the probability of hiring all first $N$ applicants, the fraction of superior companies in which, throughout the evolution, every hired applicant has a score above expected, etc.</description>

Abstract: We study transitions between the three universal limiting kernels Airy, Pearcey and sine kernel, arising in Random Matrix Theory at edge, cusp and bulk points of the spectrum. Under appropriate rescalings, we provide complete asymptotic expansions of the extended Airy kernel and the extended Pearcey kernel approaching the extended sine kernel, expliciting the fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that in one dimension the environment viewed by the particle process (EVP process) in quasi periodic random environment is uniquely ergodic and mixing under mild additional assumptions. Here we construct an analytic quasi periodic environment on higher dimensional torus such that the EVP process is not uniquely ergodic. The stationary measures in this counterexample are necessarily atomless. We show also that the EVP process is mixing with respect to any ergodic stationary measure under some smoothness assumption.</description>

      <title>Boundary-preserving weak approximations of some semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a boundary-preserving numerical scheme for the weak approximations of some stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with bounded state-space. We impose regularity assumptions on the drift and diffusion coefficients only locally on the state-space. In particular, the drift and diffusion coefficients may be non-globally Lipschitz continuous and superlinearly growing. The scheme consists of a finite difference discretisation in space and a Lie--Trotter splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration in time. We prove weak convergence of optimal order 1/4 for globally Lipschitz continuous test functions of the scheme by proving strong convergence towards a strong solution driven by a different noise process. Boundary-preservation is ensured by the use of Lie--Trotter time splitting followed by exact simulation and exact integration. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed Lie--Trotter-Exact (LTE) scheme compared to existing methods for SPDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the diffusion model as a method to generate new samples. Generative models have been recently adopted for tasks such as art generation (Stable Diffusion, Dall-E) and text generation (ChatGPT). Diffusion models in particular apply noise to sample data and then "reverse" this noising process to generate new samples. We will formally define the noising and denoising processes, then introduce algorithms to train and generate with a diffusion model. Finally, we will explore a potential application of diffusion models in improving classifier performance on imbalanced data.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Limit of the Low-Density Magnetic Lorentz Gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the magnetic Lorentz gas proposed by Bobylev et al. [4], which describes a point particle moving in a random distribution of hard-disk obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^2$ under the influence of a constant magnetic field perpendicular to the plane. We show that, in the coupled low-density and diffusion limit, when the intensity of the magnetic field is smaller than $\frac{8\pi}{3}$, the non-Markovian effects induced by the magnetic field become sufficiently weak. Consequently, the particle's probability distribution converges to the solution of the heat equation with a diffusion coefficient dependent on the magnetic field and given by the Green-Kubo formula. This formula is derived from the generator of the generalized Boltzmann process associated with the generalized Boltzmann equation, as predicted in [4].</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with (1) the truncated matrix Hamburger moment problem from the point of view of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of vector valued entire functions of the kind introduced and extensively studied by Louis de Branges and (2) the truncated matrix trigonometric moment problem viewed through an analogous class of spaces that are formulated with respect to the open unit disc rather than the open upper half-plane. In this approach projections are computed via appropriately chosen reproducing kernels instead of orthogonal bases. This approach eases the bookkeeping and leads to pleasing formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling complex regression and classification tasks, yet its success often hinges on the quality of training data. This study introduces a novel ML paradigm inspired by domain knowledge of the structure of output function, akin to physics-informed ML, but rooted in probabilistic principles rather than physical laws. The proposed approach integrates the probabilistic structure of the target variable (such as its cumulative distribution function) into the training process. This probabilistic information is obtained from historical data or estimated using structural reliability methods during experimental design. By embedding domain-specific probabilistic insights into the learning process, the method enhances model accuracy and mitigates risks of overfitting and underfitting. Applications in regression, image denoising, and classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in addressing real-world problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lov\'asz Local Lemma (the LLL for short) is a powerful tool in probabilistic combinatorics that is used to verify the existence of combinatorial objects with desirable properties. Recent years saw the development of various "constructive" versions of the LLL. A major success of this research direction is the Borel version of the LLL due to Cs\'oka, Grabowski, M\'ath\'e, Pikhurko, and Tyros, which holds under a subexponential growth assumption. A drawback of their approach is that it only applies when the underlying random variables take values in a finite set. We present an alternative proof of a Borel version of the LLL that holds even if the underlying random variables are continuous and applies to dependency graphs of limited exponential growth.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Environment Seen from Geodesics in Exponential Last-Passage Percolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known question in planar first-passage percolation concerns the convergence of the empirical distribution of weights as seen along geodesics. We demonstrate this convergence for an explicit model, directed last-passage percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with i.i.d. exponential weights, and provide explicit formulae for the limiting distributions, which depend on the asymptotic direction. For example, for geodesics in the direction of the diagonal, the limiting weight distribution has density $(1/4+x/2+x^2/8)e^{-x}$, and so is a mixture of Gamma($1,1$), Gamma($2,1$) and Gamma($3,1$) distributions with weights $1/4$, $1/2$, and $1/4$ respectively. More generally, we study the local environment as seen from vertices along geodesics (including information about the shape of the path and about the weights on and off the path in a local neighborhood). We consider finite geodesics from $(0,0)$ to $n\boldsymbol{\rho}$ for some vector $\boldsymbol{\rho}$ in the first quadrant, in the limit as $n\to\infty$, as well as semi-infinite geodesics in direction $\boldsymbol{\rho}$. We show almost sure convergence of the empirical distributions of the environments along these geodesics, as well as convergence of the distributions of the environment around a typical point in these geodesics, to the same limiting distribution, for which we give an explicit description.
  We make extensive use of a correspondence with TASEP as seen from an isolated second-class particle for which we prove new results concerning ergodicity and convergence to equilibrium. Our analysis relies on geometric arguments involving estimates for last-passage times, available from the integrable probability literature.</description>

      <title>The fewest-big-jumps principle and an application to random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.14627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a large deviation principle for the sum of n independent heavy-tailed random variables, which are subject to a moving cut-off boundary at location n. Conditional on the sum being large at scale n, we show that a finite number of summands take values near the cut-off boundary, while the remaining variables still obey the law of large numbers. This generalises the well-known single-big-jump principle for random variables without cut-off to a situation where just the minimal necessary number of jumps occur. As an application, we consider a random graph with vertex set given by the lattice points of a torus with sidelength 2N+1. Every vertex is the centre of a ball with random radius sampled from a heavy-tailed distribution. Oriented edges are drawn from the central vertex to all other vertices in this ball. When this graph is conditioned on having an exceptionally large number of edges we use our main result to show that, as N goes to infinity, the excess outdegrees condense in a fixed, finite number of randomly scattered vertices of macroscopic outdegree. By contrast, no condensation occurs for the indegrees of the vertices, which all remain microscopic in size.</description>

Abstract: Given a sequence of deterministic matrices $A = A_N$ and a sequence of deterministic nonnegative matrices $\Sigma=\Sigma_N$ such that $A\to a$ and $\Sigma\to \sigma$ in $\ast$-distribution for some operators $a$ and $\sigma$ in a finite von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{A}$. Let $U =U_N$ and $V=V_N$ be independent Haar-distributed unitary matrices. We use free probability techniques to prove that, under mild assumptions, the empirical eigenvalue distribution of $U\Sigma V^*+A$ converges to the Brown measure of $T+a$, where $T\in\mathcal{A}$ is an $R$-diagonal operator freely independent from $a$ and $\vert T\vert$ has the same distribution as $\sigma$. The assumptions can be removed if $A$ is Hermitian or unitary. By putting $A= 0$, our result removes a regularity assumption in the single ring theorem by Guionnet, Krishnapur and Zeitouni. We also prove a local convergence on optimal scale, extending the local single ring theorem of Bao, Erd\H{o}s and Schnelli.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative SHE limit of random walks in space-time random environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that under a certain moderate deviation scaling, the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation (SHE) arises as the fluctuations of the quenched density of a 1D random walk whose transition probabilities are iid [0,1]-valued random variables. In contrast to the case of directed polymers in the intermediate disorder regime, the variance of our weights is fixed rather than vanishing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time. Consequently, taking a naive limit of the chaos expansion fails for this model, and a nontrivial noise coefficient is observed in the limit. Rather than using chaos techniques, our proof instead uses the fact that in this regime the quenched density solves a discrete SPDE which resembles the SHE. As a byproduct of our techniques, it is shown that independent noise is generated in the limit, in the sense that the prelimiting noise field does not converge to the driving noise of the limiting SPDE.</description>

Abstract: The Euler-Maclaurin formula which relates a discrete sum with an integral, is generalised to the setting of Riemann-Stieltjes sums and integrals on stochastic processes whose paths are a.s. rectifiable, namely, continuous and with bounded variation. For this purpose, new variants of the signature are introduced, such as the flip and the sawtooth signature. The counterparts of the Bernoulli numbers that arise in the classical Euler-Maclaurin formula are shown to be the integration constants in the repeated integration by parts which ``recursively minimise the error'' at every truncation level.</description>

      <title>Distribution-flow dependent SDEs driven by (fractional) Brownian motion and Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the probabilistic representation for solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations, we introduce a novel class of stochastic differential equations that depend on the entire flow of its time marginals. We establish the existence and uniqueness of both strong and weak solutions under one-sided Lipschitz conditions and for singular drifts. These newly proposed distribution-flow dependent stochastic differential equations are closely connected to quasilinear backward Kolmogorov equations and Fokker-Planck equations. Furthermore, we investigate a stochastic version of the 2D-Navier-Stokes equation associated with fractional Brownian noise. We demonstrate the global well-posedness and smoothness of solutions when the Hurst parameter $H$ lies in the range $(0, \frac12)$ and the initial vorticity is a finite signed measure.</description>

Abstract: Using the theory of stochastic integration developed recently by the authors, in this paper we prove an It\^{o} formula for Hilbert space-valued It\^{o} processes defined with respect to a cylindrical-martingale valued measure. As part of our study, we develop some tools from stochastic analysis as are the predictable and optional quadratic variation of the stochastic integral, the continuous and purely discontinuous parts of the integral process, and a Riemann representation formula. Finally, as an application of It\^{o}'s formula we prove a Burkholder inequality for the stochastic integral defined with respect to a cylindrical-martingale valued measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus in the infinite volume limit. This measure is an invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by B. Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. We show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by B. Rider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known that the edge limit of Gaussian/Laguerre Beta ensembles is given by Airy($\beta$) point process. We prove an universality result that this also holds for a general class of additions of Gaussian and Laguerre ensembles. In order to make sense of $\beta$-addition, we introduce type A Bessel function as the characteristic function of our matrix ensemble following the line of Gorin-Marcus, Benaych Georges-Cuenca-Gorin. Then we extract its moment information through the action of Dunkl operators, a class of differential operators originated from special function theory. We do the action explicitly on the Bessel generating functions of our additions, and after the asymptotic analysis, we obtain certain limiting functional in terms of conditional Brownian bridges of the Laplace transform of Airy($\beta$), which is universal up to proper rescaling among all our additions.</description>

      <title>A new approach to strong convergence II. The classical ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first paper in this series introduced a new approach to strong convergence of random matrices that is based primarily on soft arguments. This method was applied to achieve a refined qualitative and quantitative understanding of strong convergence of random permutation matrices and of more general representations of the symmetric group. In this paper, we introduce new ideas that make it possible to achieve stronger quantitative results and that facilitate the application of the method to new models.
  When applied to the Gaussian GUE/GOE/GSE ensembles of dimension $N$, these methods achieve strong convergence for noncommutative polynomials with matrix coefficients of dimension $\exp(o(N))$. This provides a sharp form of a result of Pisier on strong convergence with coefficients in a subexponential operator space. Analogous results up to logarithmic factors are obtained for Haar-distributed random matrices in $\mathrm{U}(N)/\mathrm{O}(N)/\mathrm{Sp}(N)$. We further illustrate the methods of this paper in the following applications.
  1. We obtain improved rates for strong convergence of random permutations.
  2. We obtain a quantitative form of strong convergence of the model introduced by Hayes for the solution of the Peterson-Thom conjecture.
  3. We prove strong convergence of tensor GUE models of $\Gamma$-independence.
  4. We prove strong convergence of all nontrivial representations of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ of dimension up to $\exp(N^{1/3-\delta})$, improving a result of Magee and de la Salle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to show the probabilistically strong well-posedness of rough differential equations with distributional drifts driven by the Gaussian rough path lift of fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in(1/3,1/2)$. We assume that the noise is nondegenerate and the drift lies in the Besov-H\"older space $\mathcal{C}^\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;1-1/(2H)$. The latter condition matches the one of the additive noise case, thereby providing a multiplicative analogue of Catellier-Gubinelli in the regime $H\in(1/3,1/2)$.</description>

      <title>Geodesic Trees and Exceptional Directions in FPP on Hyperbolic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue the study of the geometry of infinite geodesics in first passage percolation (FPP) on Gromov-hyperbolic groups G, initiated by Benjamini-Tessera and developed further by the authors. It was shown earlier by the authors that, given any fixed direction $\xi\in \partial G$, and under mild conditions on the passage time distribution, there exists almost surely a unique semi-infinite FPP geodesic from each $v\in G$ to $\xi$. Also, these geodesics coalesce to form a tree. Our main topic of study is the set of (random) exceptional directions for which uniqueness or coalescence fails. We study these directions in the context of two random geodesics trees: one formed by the union of all geodesics starting at a given base point, and the other formed by the union of all semi-infinite geodesics in a given direction $\xi\in \partial G$. We show that, under mild conditions, the set of exceptional directions almost surely has a strictly smaller Hausdorff dimension than the boundary, and hence has measure zero with respect to the Patterson-Sullivan measure. We also establish an upper bound on the maximum number of disjoint geodesics in the same direction. For groups that are not virtually free, we show that almost surely exceptional directions exist and are dense in $\partial G$. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is greater than one, we establish the existence of uncountably many exceptional directions. When the topological dimension of $\partial G$ is $n$, we prove the existence of directions $\xi$ with at least $(n+1)$ disjoint geodesics. Our results hinge on deep facts about hyperbolic groups. En route, we also establish facts about the structure of random bigeodesics that substantially strengthen prior results.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider subordinate symmetric Markov processes which correspond to non-killing Dirichlet forms enjoying heat kernel estimates on a metric measure space with the volume doubling property. We obtain estimates of the jump kernel of the subordinate process and establish equivalent conditions for the jump kernel following Liu-Murugan. In particular, we clarify the scale of the jump kernel, which is different from the diffusion type. This result is appliable to non-subordinate processes by the transferring method, which uses stability of Dirichlet forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the following combinatorial two-player game: On the random tree arising from a branching process, each round one player (Breaker) deletes an edge and by that removes the descendant and all its progeny, while the other (Maker) fixates an edge to permanently secure it from deletion. Breaker has won once the tree's root is contained in a finite component, otherwise Maker wins by building an infinite path starting at the root. It will be analyzed both as a positional game (the tree is known to both players at the start) and with more restrictive levels of information (the players essentially explore the tree during the game). Reading the number of available edges for play as a random walk on $\mathbb{Z}$ allows us to derive the winning probability of Breaker via fixed point equations in three natural information regimes. These results provide new insights into combinatorial game theory and random structures, with potential applications to network theory, algorithmic game design and probability theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study and solve the worst-case optimal portfolio problem as pioneered by Korn and Wilmott (2002) of an investor with logarithmic preferences facing the possibility of a market crash with stochastic market coefficients by enhancing the martingale approach developed by Seifried in 2010. With the help of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), we are able to characterize the resulting indifference optimal strategies in a fairly general setting. We also deal with the question of existence of those indifference strategies for market models with an unbounded market price of risk. We therefore solve the corresponding BSDEs via solving their associated PDEs using a utility crash-exposure transformation. Our approach is subsequently demonstrated for Heston's stochastic volatility model, Bates' stochastic volatility model including jumps, and Kim-Omberg's model for a stochastic excess return.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08243v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper primarily establishes a novel asymptotic variance estimate for smooth linear statistics associated with zero sets of systems of random holomorphic sections in a sequence of positive Hermitian holomorphic line bundles on a compact K\"ahler manifold $(X, \omega)$. Using this variance estimate and the expected distribution, we derive an equidistribution result for zeros of these random systems, which, in terms of approximation theory, proves that the smooth positive closed form $\omega^{k}$ can be approximated by currents of integration along analytic subsets of $X$ of codimension $k$, $k \in \{1, \ldots, n\}$. The probability measures taken into consideration in this paper are sufficiently general to include a wide range of the measures commonly encountered in the literature, for which we give equidistribution results at the end, such as the standard Gaussian measure, Fubini-Study measure, the area measure of spheres, probability measures whose distributions have bounded densities with logarithmically decaying tails and locally moderate measures among others.</description>

      <title>State-Space Systems as Dynamic Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A probabilistic framework to study the dependence structure induced by deterministic discrete-time state-space systems between input and output processes is introduced. General sufficient conditions are formulated under which output processes exist and are unique once an input process has been fixed, a property that in the deterministic state-space literature is known as the echo state property. When those conditions are satisfied, the given state-space system becomes a generative model for probabilistic dependences between two sequence spaces. Moreover, those conditions guarantee that the output depends continuously on the input when using the Wasserstein metric. The output processes whose existence is proved are shown to be causal in a specific sense and to generalize those studied in purely deterministic situations. The results in this paper constitute a significant stochastic generalization of sufficient conditions for the deterministic echo state property to hold, in the sense that the stochastic echo state property can be satisfied under contractivity conditions that are strictly weaker than those in deterministic situations. This means that state-space systems can induce a purely probabilistic dependence structure between input and output sequence spaces even when there is no functional relation between those two spaces.</description>

Abstract: Assuming the generalized Lindel\"{o}f hypothesis (GLH), a weak version of the generalized Ramanujan conjecture and a Rankin--Selberg type partial sum estimate, we establish the normality of the sum of coefficients of a general $L$-function in short intervals of appropriate length. The novelty lies in the degree aspect under GLH. In particular, this generalizes the result of Hughes and Rudnick on lattice point counts in thin annuli.</description>

Abstract: We construct a point set in the Euclidean plane that elucidates the relationship between the fine-scale statistics of the fractional parts of $\sqrt n$ and directional statistics for a shifted lattice. We show that the randomly rotated, and then stretched, point set converges in distribution to a lattice-like random point process. This follows closely the arguments in Elkies and McMullen's original analysis for the gap statistics of $\sqrt{n}$ mod 1 in terms of random affine lattices [Duke Math. J. 123 (2004), 95-139]. There is, however, a curious subtlety: the limit process emerging in our construction is NOT invariant under the standard $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$-action on $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Subleading correction to the Asian options volatility in the Black-Scholes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The short maturity limit $T\to 0$ for the implied volatility of an Asian option in the Black-Scholes model is determined by the large deviations property for the time-average of the geometric Brownian motion. In this note we derive the subleading $O(T)$ correction to this implied volatility, using an asymptotic expansion for the Hartman-Watson distribution. The result is used to compute subleading corrections to Asian options prices in a small maturity expansion, sharpening the leading order result obtained using large deviations theory. We demonstrate good numerical agreement with precise benchmarks for Asian options pricing in the Black-Scholes model.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Brownian motion with dependent components: turning angle analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06374v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brownian motion in one or more dimensions is extensively used as a stochastic process to model natural and engineering signals, as well as financial data. Most works dealing with multidimensional Brownian motion consider the different dimensions as independent components. In this article, we investigate a model of correlated Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^2$, where the individual components are not necessarily independent. We explore various statistical properties of the process under consideration, going beyond the conventional analysis of the second moment. Our particular focus lies on investigating the distribution of turning angles. This distribution reveals particularly interesting characteristics for processes with dependent components that are relevant to applications in diverse physical systems. Theoretical considerations are supported by numerical simulations and analysis of two real-world datasets: the financial data of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor's 500, and trajectories of polystyrene beads in water. Finally, we show that the model can be readily extended to trajectories with correlations that change over time.</description>

      <title>Relative volume of comparable pairs under semigroup majorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any semigroup $\mathcal{S}$ of stochastic matrices induces a semigroup majorization relation $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$ on the set $\Delta_{n-1}$ of probability $n$-vectors. Pick $X,Y$ at random in $\Delta_{n-1}$: what is the probability that $X$ and $Y$ are comparable under $\prec^{\mathcal{S}}$? We review recent asymptotic ($n\to\infty$) results and conjectures in the case of majorization relation (when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of bistochastic matrices), discuss natural generalisations, and prove new exact finite-$n$ results in the case of UT-majorization relation, i.e., when $\mathcal{S}$ is the set of upper-triangular stochastic matrices.</description>

      <title>Capital Asset Pricing Model with Size Factor and Normalizing by Volatility Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relates a well-diversified stock portfolio to a benchmark portfolio. We insert size effect in CAPM, capturing the observation that small stocks have higher risk and return than large stocks, on average. Dividing stock index returns by the Volatility Index makes them independent and normal. In this article, we combine these ideas to create a new discrete-time model, which includes volatility, relative size, and CAPM. We fit this model using real-world data, prove the long-term stability, and connect this research to Stochastic Portfolio Theory. We fill important gaps in our previous article on CAPM with the size factor.</description>
