      <title>Tangency counting for well-spaced circles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a discretized variant of the circle tangency counting problem introduced by Tom Wolff in his expository article on the Kakeya conjecture. For collections of well-spaced circles, we introduce a stopping time argument to extract maximal information from a refined decoupling theorem for the cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$, leading to sharp bounds on the number of $\mu$-rich tangency rectangles. As a consequence, we break the $N^{3/2}$-barrier for exact circle tangencies when the circles are well-spaced.</description>

      <title>On a minimisation problem related to the solenoidal uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Hamamoto's expanding square argument towards a 1-D minimisation problem related to the sharp solenoidal uncertainty principle. Working in the right function space, we recast the involved interpolation type inequality into an exact equality, where the vanishing of the remainder term characterises the extremisers via the confluent hypergeometric functions. In the process we also remove some unnecessary constraints on the prescribed parameters.</description>

      <title>Additive energy, uncertainty principle and signal recovery mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a signal $f:G\to\mathbb{C}$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group, under what reasonable assumptions can we guarantee the exact recovery of $f$ from a proper subset of its Fourier coefficients? In 1989, Donoho and Stark established a result \cite{DS89} using the classical uncertainty principle, which states that $|\text{supp}(f)|\cdot|\text{supp}(\hat{f})|\geq |G|$ for any nonzero signal $f$. Another result, first proven by Santose and Symes \cite{SS86}, was based on the Logan phenomenon \cite{L65}. In particular, the result showcases how the $L^1$ and $L^2$ minimizing signals with matching Fourier frequencies often recovers the original signal.
  The purpose of this paper is to relate these recovery mechanisms to additive energy, a combinatorial measure denoted and defined by $$\Lambda(A)=\left| \left\{ (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4) \in A^4 \mid x_1 + x_2 = x_3 + x_4 \right\} \right|,$$ where $A\subset\mathbb{Z}_N^d$. In the first part of this paper, we use combinatorial techniques to establish an improved variety of the uncertainty principle in terms of additive energy. In a similar fashion as the Donoho-Stark argument, we use this principle to establish an often stronger recovery condition. In the latter half of the paper, we invoke these combinatorial methods to demonstrate two $L^p$ minimizing recovery results.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the author establishes a wavelet characterization of inhomogeneous Lipschitz space $\mathrm{lip}_{\theta}(\mathcal{X})$ via Carlson sequence, where $\mathcal{X}$ is a space of homogeneous type introduced by R. R. Coifman and G. Weiss. As applications, characterizations of several geometric conditions on $\mathcal{X}$, involving the upper bound, the lower bound, and the Ahlfors regular condition, are obtained.</description>

      <title>A few identities and integrals involving Pochhammer symbol, Jacobi polynomials and hypergeometric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we find some identities involving Pochhammer symbol (rising factorial) and apply them to find a closed form for some integrals of the Jacobi polynomials as well as a hypergeometric function multiplied by the product of Jacobi polynomial and the Beta density that makes this polynomial member of the family of orthogonal polynomials. In other words, we expand a hypergeometric function in an orthogonal series of Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Dynamic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based methods for sampling and generative modeling use continuous-time dynamical systems to represent a {transport map} that pushes forward a source measure to a target measure. The introduction of a time axis provides considerable design freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this freedom. Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero acceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved'' trajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning. In particular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given transport map $T$ and seek the schedule $\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ that minimizes the spatial Lipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t \in [0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation error when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad class of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \emph{optimal schedule} can be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal Lipschitz constant is \emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an identity schedule (corresponding to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic). Our proof technique relies on the calculus of variations and $\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the aforementioned degenerate objective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.</description>

      <title>On the Rudin-Blass Ordering of Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Rudin-Blass (and the Rudin-Keisler) ordering on the finite additive measures on $\omega$. We propose a generalization of the notion of Q-point and selective ultrafilter to measures: Q-measures and selective measures. We show some symmetries between Q-points and Q-measures but also we show where those symmetries break up. In particular we present an example of a measure which is minimal in the sense of Rudin-Blass but which is not a Q-measure.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of orbits of Vanhaecke system on integral surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the 1990s, P. Vanhecke described a Hamiltonian system with two degrees of freedom and a polynomial Hamiltonian integrable in Abelian functions of two variables. This system provides a convenient example of an integrable system in which integral curves are wound on a two-dimensional manifold, an algebraic surface in a 4-dimensional phase space. In this report, we show that all necessary calculations can be performed in the Sage system. The role of periods of Abelian integrals and their commensurability in describing the nature of the winding of integral curves on an algebraic integral surface is discussed. The results of numerical experiments performed in fdm for Sage are presented.</description>

      <title>Realizing trees of configurations in thin sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11597v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\phi(x,y)$ be a continuous function, smooth away from the diagonal, such that, for some $\alpha&gt;0$, the associated generalized Radon transforms \begin{equation} \label{Radon} R_t^{\phi}f(x)=\int_{\phi(x,y)=t} f(y) \psi(y) d\sigma_{x,t}(y) \end{equation} map $L^2({\mathbb R}^d) \to L^2_{\alpha}({\mathbb R}^d)$ for all $t&gt;0$. Let $E$ be a compact subset of ${\mathbb R}^d$ for some $d \ge 2$, and suppose that the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is $&gt;d-\alpha$. We show that any tree graph $T$ on $k+1$ ($k \ge 1$) vertices is \new{stably} realizable in $E$, in the sense that \new{for each $t$ in some open interval} there exist distinct $x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1} \in E$ %and $t&gt;0$ such that the $\phi$-distance $\phi(x^i, x^j)=t$ for all pairs $(i,j)$ corresponding to the edges of $T$.
  We extend this result to trees whose edges are prescribed by more complicated point configurations, such as congruence classes of triangles.

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Probability Flow ODE for Score-based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09730v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful approach for sampling high-dimensional probability distributions. Despite their effectiveness, their theoretical underpinnings remain relatively underdeveloped. In this work, we study the convergence properties of deterministic samplers based on probability flow ODEs from both theoretical and numerical perspectives. Assuming access to $L^2$-accurate estimates of the score function, we prove the total variation between the target and the generated data distributions can be bounded above by $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2})$ in the continuous time level, where $d$ denotes the data dimension and $\delta$ represents the $L^2$-score matching error. For practical implementations using a $p$-th order Runge-Kutta integrator with step size $h$, we establish error bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/4}\delta^{1/2} + d\cdot(dh)^p)$ at the discrete level. Finally, we present numerical studies on problems up to 128 dimensions to verify our theory.</description>
