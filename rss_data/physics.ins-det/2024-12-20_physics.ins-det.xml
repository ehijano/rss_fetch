      <title>Experimental validation of the Gaseous Proton Recoil Telescope for quasi-absolute neutron flux measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of neutronics simulations of actual or future reactor cores is nowadays driven by the precision of the nuclear data used as input. Among the most important neutron-induced fission cross sections to understand well are the actinides. It is, indeed, of primary importance to know accurately these cross sections around 1 MeV for the safety of Generation IV reactors. High accuracy measurements of neutron flux are essential for accurate cross section measurements; measurements of this flux with respect to the 1 H(n,n)p cross section can be made with the proton recoil technique. For an accurate measurement below 1 MeV, the Gaseous Proton Recoil Telescope (GPRT) is developed and characterized, with the aim to provide quasi-absolute neutron flux measurements with an accuracy better than 2%. This detector is composed of a double ionization chamber with a Micromegas segmented detection plane. The pressure of the gas can be adjusted to protons stopping range -and therefore to neutrons energy. An accurate neutron flux measurement requires that the GPRT has an intrinsic efficiency of 100%, and thus an important effort has been made to verify this. An alpha source and proton micro-beam have been used and the intrinsic efficiency is confirmed to be 100%. Additionally, the dead-time of the detector has been investigated on a test bench, and is found to be 7.3 ms.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of cosmogenic Ge-68 background in a high purity germanium detector via a time series fitting method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge-68 is a cosmogenic isotope in germanium with a half-life of 270.9 days. Ge-68 and its decay daughter Ga-68 contribute considerable background with energy up to 3 MeV to low background $\gamma$ spectrometers using high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors. In this paper, we evaluated the background of Ge-68 and Ga-68 in a p-type coaxial HPGe detector operated at China Jinping underground laboratory (CJPL) via a time series fitting method. Under the assumption that Ge-68 and Ga-68 are in radioactive equilibrium and airborne radon daughters are uniformly distributed in the measurement chamber of the spectrometer, we fit the time series of count rate in 1-3 MeV to calculate the Ge-68 activity, radon daughter concentrations, and the time-invariant background component. Total 90 days measured data were used in analysis, a hypothesis test confirmed a significant Ge-68 signal at 99.64% confidence level. The initial activity of Ge-68 is fitted to be 477.0$\pm$112.4 $\mu$Bq/kg, corresponding to an integral count rate of 55.9 count/day in 1-3 MeV range. During the measurement, Ge-68 activity decreased by about 30%, contributing about 62% of the total background in 1-3 MeV range. Our method also provides an estimation of the variation of airborne radon daughter concentrations in the measurement chamber, which could be used to monitor the performance of radon reduction measures.</description>

      <title>Global track finding based on the Hough transform in the STCF detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proposed Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF) is an electron-positron collider designed to operate in a center-of-mass energy range from 2 to 7 GeV. It provides a unique platform for physics research in the tau-charm energy region. To fulfill the physics goals of STCF, high tracking efficiency and good momentum resolution is required for charged particles with momenta from 50 MeV/c to 3.5 GeV/c. A global track finding algorithm based on Hough transform has been developed and implemented in the STCF software framework to meet this requirement. The design of the algorithm and its performance with simulation are presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Long-term stability of scientific X-ray CMOS detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) sensors have been demonstrated to have significant potential in X-ray astronomy, where long-term reliability is crucial for space X-ray telescopes. This study examines the long-term stability of a scientific CMOS sensor, focusing on its bias, dark current, readout noise, and X-ray spectral performance. The sensor was initially tested at -30 $^\circ$C for 16 months, followed by accelerated aging at 20 $^\circ$C. After a total aging period of 610 days, the bias map, dark current, readout noise, gain, and energy resolution exhibited no observable degradation. There are less than 50 pixels within the 4 k $\times$ 4 k array which show a decrease of the bias under 50 ms integration time by over 10 digital numbers (DNs). First-order kinetic fitting of the gain evolution predicts a gain degeneration of 0.73% over 3 years and 2.41% over 10 years. These results underscore the long-term reliability of CMOS sensors for application in space missions.</description>

      <title>The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment aimed at determining the neutrino mass hierarchy and the CP-violating phase. The DUNE physics program also includes the detection of astrophysical neutrinos and the search for signatures beyond the Standard Model, such as nucleon decays. DUNE consists of a near detector complex located at Fermilab and four 17 kton Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) far detector modules to be built 1.5 km underground at SURF, approximately 1300 km away. The detectors are exposed to a wideband neutrino beam generated by a 1.2 MW proton beam with a planned upgrade to &gt; 2 MW. Two 770 ton LArTPCs (ProtoDUNEs) have been operated at CERN for over 2 years as a testbed for DUNE far detectors and have been optimized to take new cosmic and test-beam data in 2024-2025. The DUNE and ProtoDUNE experiments and physics goals, as well as recent progress and results, are presented.</description>

      <title>A parallel algorithm for fast reconstruction of proton collisions on heterogeneous architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics programme of the LHCb experiment at the Large Hadron Collider requires an efficient and precise reconstruction of the particle collision vertices. The LHCb Upgrade detector relies on a fully software-based trigger with an online reconstruction rate of 30 MHz, necessitating fast vertex finding algorithms. This paper describes a new approach to vertex reconstruction developed for this purpose. The algorithm is based on cluster finding within a histogram of the particle trajectory projections along the beamline and on an adaptive vertex fit. Its implementations and optimisations on x86 and GPU architectures and its performance on simulated samples are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Constraints and Sensitivities for Dipole-Portal Heavy Neutral Leptons from ND280 and its Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints and sensitivities to heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) with transition magnetic moments, also known as dipole-portal HNLs. This is accomplished using data from the T2K ND280 near detector in addition to the projected three-year dataset of the upgraded ND280 detector. Dipole-portal HNLs have been extensively studied in the literature and offer a potential explanation for the $4.8\sigma$ MiniBooNE anomaly. To perform our analysis, we simulate HNL decays to $e^+e^-$ pairs in the gaseous time projection chambers of the ND280 detector and its upgrade. Recasting an ND280 search for mass-mixed HNLs, we find that ND280 data places world-leading constraints on dipole-portal HNLs in the 390-743\,{\rm MeV} mass range, disfavoring the region of parameter space favored by the MiniBooNE anomaly. The addition of three years of ND280 upgrade data will be able to disfavor the MiniBooNE solution at the $5 \sigma$ confidence level and extend the world-leading constraints to dipole-portal HNLs in the 148-860\,{\rm MeV} mass range. Our analysis suggests that ND280 data excludes dipole-portal HNLs as a solution to the MiniBooNE excess, motivating a dedicated search within the T2K collaboration and potentially highlighting the need for alternative explanations for the MiniBooNE anomaly.</description>

      <title>Expected Tracking Performance of the ATLAS Inner Tracker at the High-Luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-luminosity phase of LHC operations (HL-LHC), will feature a large increase in simultaneous proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing up to 200, compared with a typical leveling target of 64 in Run 3. Such an increase will create a very challenging environment in which to perform charged particle trajectory reconstruction, a task crucial for the success of the ATLAS physics program, and will exceed the capabilities of the current ATLAS Inner Detector (ID). A new all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk) will replace the current ID in time for the start of the HL-LHC. To ensure successful use of the ITk capabilities in Run 4 and beyond, the ATLAS tracking software has been successfully adapted to achieve state-of-the-art track reconstruction in challenging high-luminosity conditions with the ITk detector. This paper presents the expected tracking performance of the ATLAS ITk based on the latest available developments since the ITk technical design reports.</description>

      <title>ProtoDUNE Photon Detection System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment aiming to measure the oscillation parameters with an unprecedented precision that will allow determining the CP violation phase in the leptonic sector and the neutrino mass ordering. The Far Detector of DUNE will consist of four 17 kton liquid argon Time Projection Chambers (LAr-TPC). Inside a LAr-TPC, a Photon Detection System (PDS) is needed to detect the scintillation light produced by the interacting particles. The PDS signal provides the interaction time for non-beam events and improves the calorimetric reconstruction. To validate DUNE technology, two large-scale prototypes, of 750 ton of LAr each, have been constructed at CERN, ProtoDUNE-HD and ProtoDUNE-VD. The PDS of both prototypes is based on the XArapuca concept, a SiPM-based device that provides good detection efficiency covering large surfaces at a reasonable cost. This document presents the preliminary performance of the ProtoDUNE-HD Photon Detection System, which has taken data from April to November 2024.</description>

Abstract: The Beryllium Electron capture in Superconducting Tunnel junctions (BeEST) experiment searches for evidence of heavy neutrino mass eigenstates in the nuclear electron capture decay of $^7$Be by precisely measuring the recoil energy of the $^7$Li daughter. In Phase-III, the BeEST experiment has been scaled from a single superconducting tunnel junction (STJ) sensor to a 36-pixel array to increase sensitivity and mitigate gamma-induced backgrounds. Phase-III also uses a new continuous data acquisition system that greatly increases the flexibility for signal processing and data cleaning. We have developed procedures for signal processing and spectral fitting that are sufficiently robust to be automated for large data sets. This article presents the optimized procedures before unblinding the majority of the Phase-III data set to search for physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enabled Measurements of Astrophysical (p,n) Reactions with the SECAR Recoil Separator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of heavy elements in supernovae is affected by low-energy (n,p) and (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei, yet experimental data on such reaction rates are scarce. The SECAR (SEparator for CApture Reactions) recoil separator at FRIB (Facility for Rare Isotope Beams) was originally designed to measure astrophysical reactions that change the mass of a nucleus significantly. We used a novel approach that integrates machine learning with ion-optical simulations to find an ion-optical solution for the separator that enables the measurement of (p,n) reactions, despite the reaction leaving the mass of the nucleus nearly unchanged. A new measurement of the $^{58}$Fe(p,n)$^{58}$Co reaction in inverse kinematics with a 3.66$\pm$0.12 MeV/nucleon $^{58}$Fe beam (corresponding to 3.69$\pm$0.12 MeV proton energy in normal kinematics) yielded a cross-section of 20.3$\pm$6.3 mb and served as a benchmark for the new technique demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving the required performance criteria. This novel approach marks a significant advancement in experimental nuclear astrophysics, as it paves the way for studying astrophysically important (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei produced at FRIB.</description>

      <title>Near-to mid-IR spectral purity transfer with a tunable frequency comb: methanol frequency metrology over a record frequency span</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the upgrade and operation of a frequency-comb-assisted high-resolution mid-infrared molecular spectrometer allowing us to combine high spectral purity, SI-traceability, wide tunability and high sensitivity. An optical frequency comb is used to transfer the spectral purity of a SI-traceable 1.54 $\mu$m metrology-grade frequency reference to a 10.3 $\mu$m quantum cascade laser (QCL). The near-infrared reference is operated at the French time/frequency metrology institute, calibrated there to primary frequency standards, and transferred to Laboratoire de Physique des Lasers via the REFIMEVE fiber network. The QCL exhibits a line width of $\delta\nu\sim 0.1$ Hz, a sub-$10^{-15}$ relative frequency stability from 0.1 to 10 s and its frequency is traceable to the SI with a total relative uncertainty better than $4\times10^{-14}$ after 1-s averaging time. We have developed the instrumentation allowing comb modes to be continuously tuned over 9 GHz resulting in a QCL of record spectral purity uninterruptedly tunable at the precision of the reference over an unprecedented span of $\Delta\nu$ = 1.4 GHz. We have used our apparatus to conduct sub-Doppler spectroscopy of methanol in a multi-pass cell, demonstrating state-of-art frequency uncertainties down to the few kilohertz level ($\sim10^{-10}$ in relative value). We have observed weak intensity resonances unreported so far, resolved subtle doublets never seen before and brought to light discrepancies with the HITRAN database. This demonstrates the potential of our apparatus for probing subtle internal molecular processes, building accurate spectroscopic models of polyatomic molecules of atmospheric or astrophysical interest, and carrying out precise spectroscopic tests of fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative surrogate for particle-calorimeter interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22870v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle collisions at accelerators such as the Large Hadron Collider, recorded and analyzed by experiments such as ATLAS and CMS, enable exquisite measurements of the Standard Model and searches for new phenomena. Simulations of collision events at these detectors have played a pivotal role in shaping the design of future experiments and analyzing ongoing ones. However, the quest for accuracy in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collisions comes at an imposing computational cost, with projections estimating the need for millions of CPU-years annually during the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) run \cite{collaboration2022atlas}. Simulating a single LHC event with \textsc{Geant4} currently devours around 1000 CPU seconds, with simulations of the calorimeter subdetectors in particular imposing substantial computational demands \cite{rousseau2023experimental}. To address this challenge, we propose a conditioned quantum-assisted deep generative model. Our model integrates a conditioned variational autoencoder (VAE) on the exterior with a conditioned Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) in the latent space, providing enhanced expressiveness compared to conventional VAEs. The RBM nodes and connections are meticulously engineered to enable the use of qubits and couplers on D-Wave's Pegasus-structured \textit{Advantage} quantum annealer (QA) for sampling. We introduce a novel method for conditioning the quantum-assisted RBM using \textit{flux biases}. We further propose a novel adaptive mapping to estimate the effective inverse temperature in quantum annealers. The effectiveness of our framework is illustrated using Dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge \cite{calochallenge}.</description>

      <title>Reusable Verification Components for High-Energy Physics readout ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03478</link>

Abstract: Verification is a critical aspect of designing front-end (FE) readout ASICs for High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. These ASICs share several similar functional features, resulting in similar verification objectives, which can be addressed using comparable verification strategies. This contribution presents a set of re-usable verification components for addressing common verification tasks, such as clock generation, reset handling, configuration, as well as hit and fault injections. The components were developed as part of the CHIPS initiative and they have been successfully used in the verification of multiple HEP ASICs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Offline Pileup Correction to Improve the Accuracy of Microdosimetric Characterization in Clinical Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microdosimetry investigates the energy deposition of ionizing radiation at microscopic scales, beyond the assessment capabilities of macroscopic dosimetry. This contributes to an understanding of the biological response in radiobiology, radiation protection and radiotherapy. Microdosimetric pulse height spectra are usually measured using an ionization detector in a pulsed readout mode. This incorporates and a charge-sensitive amplifier followed by a shaping network. At high particle rates, the pileup of multiple pulses leads to distortions in the recorded spectra. Especially for gas-based detectors, this is a significant issue, that can be reduced by using solid-state detectors with smaller cross-sectional areas and faster readout speeds. At particle rates typical for ion therapy, however, such devices will also experience pileup. Mitigation techniques often focus on avoiding pileup altogether, while post-processing approaches are rarely investigated. This work explores pileup effects in microdosimetric measurements and presents a stochastic resampling algorithm, allowing for offline simulation and correction of spectra. Initially it was developed for measuring neutron spectra with tissue equivalent proportional counters and is adapted for the use with solid-state microdosimeters in a clinical radiotherapy setting. The algorithm was tested on data acquired with solid-state microdosimeters at the MedAustron ion therapy facility. The successful simulation and reduction of pileup counts is achieved by establishing of a limited number of parameters for a given setup. The presented results illustrate the potential of offline correction methods in situations where a direct pileup-free measurement is currently not practicable.</description>
