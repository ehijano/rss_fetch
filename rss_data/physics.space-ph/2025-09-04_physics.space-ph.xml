      <title>Introduction to the Sky Survey Schedule (SSS) framework</title>

Abstract: To fulfill the requirements of space object cataloging and enable automated intelligent responses to anomalous events, we designed a novel observation scheduling system named Sky Survey Schedule (SSS). This framework facilitates coordinated operations across multi-site observational networks comprising dozens of instruments, while simultaneously supporting asteroid monitoring and time-domain astronomy studies. The system implements two principal observation modes: fixed sky regions and target-centered tracking. The former is used for sidereal or static observation, while the latter provides dedicated follow-up capabilities for transient targets. The sky regions are divided into latitude bands, each of which is subdivided into sectors to ensure minimal overlap and comprehensive coverage. These sectors are mapped to high-level HEALPix sky grids, enabling rapid cross-referencing and correlation between instruments. At the core of SSS lies an adaptive weighting architecture that integrates multiple parameters. Initial target priorities are determined from orbital catalogs containing both known and uncorrelated objects according to cataloging requirements. The system implements dynamic weight adjustments through feedback mechanisms: confirmed stable objects receive decaying weights, long-unobserved targets experience weight recovery, while anomalies (e.g., newly detected or lost objects) trigger priority escalation. These target-specific weights combine with observational factors - including phase angle constraints, lunar interference, Earth shadowing, and elevation limits - to generate space-time priority matrices. This quantitative framework systematically incorporates operator-defined priorities for specific regions/targets through configurable weight modifiers. Observation plans are dynamically optimized considering:....</description>

      <title>Material parameter influence on the expression of Solitary-Wave-Induced Surface Dilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a method for predicting peak particle forces in a Solitary Wave (SW) wavefront within a randomly filled 3D granular channel. The SW in our simulation are driven by a sustained impact originating in the bumpy floor of the channel. We show that, when generated in this manner, forces in the driven SW wavefront within the 3D assembly follow the same power law scaling on material properties and impact velocity as in a 1D chain. A simple scaling of the 1D forces matches results from simulated impact tests we conduct using Soft Sphere Discrete Element method simulations. We then quantify the magnitude of Solitary Wave Induced Surface Dilation (SID) that occurs as a result of varied material properties and gravitational environments, giving an equation that can be used to predict the lofting depth (depth to which particles experience bulk density changes as a result of a laterally propagating SW wavefront). As predicted by our equation and confirmed with simulated results, SID is amplified as particle material properties become closer to lunar regolith grains, supporting the hypothesis that SID is the Lunar Cold Spot formation mechanism.</description>

      <title>First detection of ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde in hot core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1: Tracing prebiotic oxygen chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethylene oxide (c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O) and its isomer, acetaldehyde (CH$_{3}$CHO), are important complex organic molecules owing to their potential role in the formation of amino acids (R-CH(NH$_{2}$)-COOH) in ISM. The detection of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O in hot molecular cores suggests that the possible existence of larger ring-shaped molecules containing more than three carbon atoms, such as furan (c-C$_{4}$H$_{4}$O), which shares structural similarities with ribose (C$_{5}$H$_{10}$O5), the sugar component of DNA. In this study, we report the first detection of the rotational emission lines of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO towards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1, based on observations from the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) in band 7. The fractional abundances of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO relative to H$_{2}$ are $(2.1\pm0.2)\times10^{-9}$ and $(7.1\pm0.9)\times10^{-9}$, respectively. The column density ratio between CH$_{3}$CHO and c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O is $3.4\pm0.7$. A Pearson correlation heat map reveals strong positive correlations ($r$ $&gt;$ 0.5) between the abundances and excitation temperatures of c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O and CH$_{3}$CHO, suggesting a possible chemical connection between those two molecules. To investigate this further, we conducted a two-phase warm-up chemical model using the gas-grain chemical code UCLCHEM. A comparison between our derived abundances and the predictions from our chemical model and existence model demonstrates good agreement within factors of 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. We propose that c-C$_{2}$H$_{4}$O may form in G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 via the grain surface reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{4}$ and O, but CH$_{3}$CHO may be produced through the surface reaction between CH$_{3}$ and HCO.</description>
