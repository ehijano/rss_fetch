      <title>Effective Field Theory and In-In Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictions of inflation are usually defined in terms of equal time in-in correlation functions in an accelerating cosmological background. These same observables exist for quantum field theory in other spacetimes, including flat space. In this paper, we will explore how the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) and effective field theory (EFT) apply to these observables in both flat and de Sitter space. Specifically, we show that matching the short- and long-distance calculations requires additional terms localized at the time of the measurement that are not captured by the effective action of the EFT. These additional terms only correct the local and semi-local terms in the EFT correlators. In flat space, we give an explicit demonstration by matching in-in correlators of light scalars interacting with a heavy field with the EFT result. We then show how these additional terms arise generically via exact RG. We also compare these explicit results in flat space with the corresponding theory in de Sitter and show that the local terms typically redshift away. Our results are closely related to momentum space entanglement that arises from tracing over short-wavelength modes.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3\times$S$^3$ magnons in the symmetric orbifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The AdS$_3\times$S$^3$ excitations of string theory on AdS$_3\times$S$^3\times \mathbb{T}^4$ are identified with certain collective modes in the dual symmetric orbifold. Our identification follows from a careful study of the conformal eigenstates in the perturbed orbifold theory. We find that, in addition to the fractional torus modes (that correspond to the torus excitations in the dual AdS spacetime), there are `long' collective eigenmodes that involve a superposition of products of fractional torus modes, and that are in natural one-to-one correspondence with the expected AdS$_3\times$S$^3$ excitations. These collective modes are deformations of (fractional) $\mathcal{N}=4$ modes, to which they reduce for integer momentum.</description>

      <title>From the Unification of Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with Internal Interactions to the $SO(10)$ GUT and the Particle Physics Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, the unification of the Conformal and Fuzzy Gravities with the Internal Interactions is based on the observation that the tangent space of a curved space and the space itself do not have necessarily the same dimensions. Moreover, the construction is based on the fact that the gravitational theories can be formulated in a gauge-theoretical way. In the present work we study the various consecutive breakings through which these unified theories can ultimately result into the Standard Model. We estimate the scales of the breakings in each case using one-loop RGEs.</description>

      <title>Quantum scalar field theory on equal-angular-momenta Myers-Perry-AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the canonical quantization of a massive scalar field on a five dimensional, rotating black hole space-time. We focus on the case where the space-time is asymptotically anti-de Sitter and the black hole's two angular momentum parameters are equal. In this situation the geometry possesses additional symmetries which simplify both the mode solutions of the scalar field equation and the stress-energy tensor. When the angular momentum of the black hole is sufficiently small that there is no speed-of-light surface, there exists a Killing vector which is time-like in the region exterior to the event horizon. In this case classical superradiance is absent and we construct analogues of the usual Boulware and Hartle-Hawking quantum states for the quantum scalar field. We compute the differences in expectation values of the square of the quantum scalar field operator and the stress-energy tensor operator between these two quantum states.</description>

      <title>Probability Distribution for Vacuum Energy Flux Fluctuations in Two Spacetime Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability distribution for vacuum fluctuations of the energy flux in two dimensions will be constructed, along with the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density. Our approach will be based on previous work on probability distributions for the energy density in two dimensional conformal field theory. In both cases, the relevant stress tensor component must be averaged in time, and the results are sensitive to the form of the averaging function. Here we present results for two classes of such functions, which include the Gaussian and Lorentzian functions. The distribution for the energy flux is symmetric, unlike that for the energy density. In both cases, the distribution may possess an integrable singularity. The functional form of the flux distribution function involves a modified Bessel function, and is distinct from the shifted Gamma form for the energy density. By considering the joint distribution of energy flux and energy density, we show that the distribution of energy flux tends to be more centrally concentrated than that of the energy density. We also determine the distribution of energy fluxes, conditioned on the energy density being negative. Some applications of the results will be discussed.</description>

      <title>On numerators of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series and $q,t$-Kostka Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the numerators of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series are the (transpose of the) matrix of $q,t$-Kostka Macdonald coefficients $K_d = \left( K_{\lambda \mu} \left( q,t \right) \right)_{\lambda, \mu \in \mathcal{P}_d}$ for partitions $\lambda = \mu$ in the set of partitions $\mathcal{P}_d$ of odd positive numbers $d$ with $d=2n-1$ and $n \in \mathbb{N}$, such that $\lambda = \mu = \left( 1 \right)$ if $n=1$, and $\lambda = \mu = \left( n, 1^{n-1} \right)$ if $n &gt; 1$. These polynomials are also shown to be eigenvalues of a differential operator arising from a recurrence relation and acting on the Hilbert series.</description>

      <title>Mirror symmetry for 4d $A_1$ class-$\mathcal{S}$ theories: modularity, defects and Coulomb branch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the companion paper of the letter arXiv:2410.15695, containing all the details and series of examples on a 4d mirror symmetry for the class-$\mathcal{S}$ theories which relates the representation theory of the chiral quantization of the Higgs branch and the geometry of the Coulomb branch. We study the representation theory by using the 4d/VOA correspondence, (defect) Schur indices and (flavor) modular differential equations, and match the data with the fixed manifolds of the Hitchin moduli spaces. This correspondence extends the connection between Higgs and Coulomb branch of Argyres-Douglas theories, and can provide systematic guidance for the study of the representation theory of vertex operator algebras by exploiting results from Hitchin systems.</description>

      <title>The anti-de Sitter supergeometry revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a supergravity framework, the $\cal N$-extended anti-de Sitter (AdS) superspace in four spacetime dimensions, $\text{AdS}^{4|4\cal N} $, is a maximally symmetric background that is described by a curved superspace geometry with structure group $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{U}({\cal N})$. On the other hand, within the group-theoretic setting, $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ is realised as the coset superspace $\mathsf{OSp}(\cal{N}|4;\mathbb{R}) /\big[ \mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}(\cal{N}) \big]$, with its structure group being $\mathsf{SL}(2, \mathbb{C}) \times \mathsf{O}({\cal N})$. Here we explain how the two frameworks are related. We give explicit realisations of $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $ as a conformally flat superspace, thus extending the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ results available in the literature. As applications, we describe: (i) the $\kappa$-symmetric action for a superparticle in $\text{AdS}^{4|4{\cal N}} $; and (ii) some implications of conformal flatness in the ${\cal N}=2$ case.</description>

      <title>Holographic reconstruction for AdS Wilson line networks and scalar Witten diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find a holographic reconstruction formula for gravitational Wilson line network operators in AdS$_2$ evaluated between Ishibashi states of the algebra $sl(2,\mathbb{R})$. It is given in integral form where the integrand is the global conformal block multiplied by a smearing function which is the product of the scalar bulk-to-boundary propagators. The integral can be explicitly calculated as multidimensional series which arguments are rational functions of endpoint coordinates. In the case of two and three endpoints the resulting expressions allow one to establish a number of relations between the gravitational Wilson line networks and Witten diagrams for massive scalar fields in AdS$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal effective action and particle creation in $D$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the particle creation rate in the context of quantum fields in curved spacetimes, by evaluating the imaginary part of the effective action up to second order in the curvatures. For arbitrary metrics in dimensions $D\geq4$, we express the vacuum persistence amplitude in terms of the Ricci scalar and the Weyl tensor, showing that, up to their second power, no particle creation occurs for conformal fields in conformally flat spacetimes. We pinpoint an analogy with the electromagnetic pair creation, by writing the squared Weyl tensor invariant in terms of its electric and magnetic parts. In addition, we present an alternative expression for the imaginary part of the effective action employing the Cotton tensor. This is particularly useful in $D=3$, where the Weyl tensor trivially vanishes and the Cotton tensor is related to conformal flatness. Finally, we highlight the importance of the threshold for particle creation, a point that has been overlooked in some recent studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ehlers and Kundt [1] argued in favor of the velocity effect: particles initally at rest hit by a burst of gravitational waves should fly apart with constant velocity after the wave has passed. Zel'dovich and Polnarev [2] suggested instead that waves generated by flyby would be merely displaced. Their prediction is confirmed provided the wave parameters take some particular values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate energy correlators in a general holographic model of confinement, involving an asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) warped extra dimension. Building on a recent computation in a minimal hard-wall model of confinement, we show that the shockwave method for efficiently computing energy correlators in AdS generalizes to an arbitrary warped geometry. This is possible because exact, linear shockwave solutions to the 5D field equations exist in any warped background. We apply our formalism to compute the two-point energy correlator for two simple models of confinement with interesting infrared spectra -- one with a gapped continuum spectrum and one with linear Regge trajectories. The results differ from the simple hard-wall model and from each other, demonstrating that the details of the confining dynamics affect the shape of the energy correlator observables.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes from thin-shell collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish that regular black holes can form from gravitational collapse. Our model builds on a recent construction that realized regular black holes as exact solutions to purely gravitational theories that incorporate an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections in any dimension $D \ge 5$ [arXiv:2403.04827]. We identify a two-dimensional Horndeski theory that captures the spherically symmetric dynamics of the theories in question and use this to prove a Birkhoff theorem and obtain the generalized Israel junction conditions. Armed with these tools, we consider the collapse of thin shells of pressureless matter, showing that this leads generically to the formation of regular black holes. The interior dynamics we uncover is intricate, consisting of shell bounces and white hole explosions into a new universe. The result is that regular black holes are the unique spherically symmetric solutions of the corresponding theories and also the endpoint of gravitational collapse of matter. Along the way, we establish evidence for a solution-independent upper bound on the curvature, suggestive of Markov's limiting curvature hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Formation of Regular Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dynamical gravitational collapse in a theory with an infinite tower of higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert action and we show that, under very general conditions, it leads to the formation of regular black holes. Our results are facilitated by the use of a class of theories that possess second-order equations on spherically symmetric metrics, but which are general enough to provide a basis for the gravitational effective action. We analytically solve the collapse of a thin shell of dust and show that it inevitably experiences a bounce at small radius and that its motion can be extended to arbitrary proper time. The collapse of the shell always gives rise to a singularity-free, geodesically complete spacetime that contains horizons if the total mass is above a critical value. In that case, the shell bounces into a new universe through a white hole explosion. Our construction provides, to the best of our knowlege, the first fully dynamical description of formation of regular black holes, and it suggests that higher-derivative corrections may be the most natural way to resolve the singularities of Einstein's theory.</description>

      <title>Intertwined order of generalized global symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of generalized global symmetries in 2+1 dimensions by introducing a lattice model that couples a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ clock model to a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory via a topological interaction. This coupling binds the charges of one symmetry to the disorder operators of the other, and when these composite objects condense, they give rise to emergent generalized symmetries with mixed 't Hooft anomalies. These anomalies result in phases with ordinary symmetry breaking, topological order, and symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, where the different types of order are not independent but intimately related. We further explore the gapped boundary states of these exotic phases and develop theories for phase transitions between them. Additionally, we extend our lattice model to incorporate a non-invertible global symmetry, which can be spontaneously broken, leading to domain walls with non-trivial fusion rules.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information in Riemannian Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a diffeomorphism-invariant formulation of differential entropy in Riemannian spaces, addressing the lack of an observer-independent notion of information for continuous variables in physical space. We extend this formulation to the quantum level by generalizing Wigner's quasiprobability density function to arbitrary Riemannian spaces and analytically continuing Shannon's differential entropy formula to incorporate contributions from intermediate virtual quantum states. We demonstrate this framework with the computation of the quantum phase space entropy of the harmonic oscillator in Minkowski and anti-de Sitter geometries. Additionally, we derive a generalized quantum entropic uncertainty relation, extending the Bialynicki-Birula and Mycielski inequality to curved spaces. Our work bridges concepts from information theory, geometry, and quantum physics to establish a foundation for studying quantum information in continuous and curved spaces.</description>

      <title>Generalized susceptibilities of net-baryon number based on the 3-dimensional Ising universality class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming the equilibrium of the QCD system, we have investigated the critical behavior of sixth-, eighth- and tenth-order susceptibilities of net-baryon number, through mapping the results in the three-dimensional Ising model to that of QCD. Both the leading critical contribution as well as sub-leading critical contribution from the Ising model are discussed. When considering only the leading critical contribution, the density plots for susceptibilities of the same order demonstrate a consistent general pattern independent on values of mapping parameters. As the critical point is approached from the crossover side, a negative dip followed by a positive peak is observed in the $\mu_B$ dependence of the three different orders of susceptibilities. When sub-leading critical contribution is taken into account, modifications become apparent in the density plots of the susceptibilities. The emergence of negative dips in the $\mu_B$ dependence of the susceptibilities is not an absolute phenomenon, while the positive peak structure is a more robust feature of the critical point.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Torque on an Inhomogeneous Chiral Body out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper we showed that an inhomogeneous body in vacuum will experience a spontaneous force if it is not in thermal equilibrium with its environment. This is due to the asymmetric asymptotic radiation pattern such an object emits. We demonstrated this self-propulsive force by considering an expansion in powers of the electric susceptibility: A torque arises in first order, but only if the material constituting the body is nonreciprocal. No force arises in first order. A force does occur for bodies made of ordinary (reciprocal) materials in second order. Here we extend these considerations to the torque. As one would expect, a spontaneous torque will also appear on an inhomogeneous chiral object if it is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment. Once a chiral body starts to rotate, it will experience a small quantum frictional torque, but much more important, unless a mechanism is provided to maintain the nonequilibrium state, is thermalization: The body will rapidly reach thermal equilibrium with the vacuum, and the angular acceleration will essentially become zero. For a small, or even a large, inhomogeneous chiral body, a terminal angular velocity will result, which seems to be in the realm of observability.</description>

      <title>The Dirac Vacuum in Discrete Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider introducing the Dirac sea in a discrete spacetime model of fermions which approximates the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, if we attempt to fill up the `negative' energy states, we run into a problem. A new boundary is created between positive and negative energy states, at which pair creation seems energetically favourable. This happens because of the modular nature of energy in discrete time models. We then suggest a possible remedy by amending the model, in order to pull states away from the new boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the suggestion that it is possible to eliminate the Big Bang curvature singularity of the Friedman cosmological solution by considering a particular type of degenerate spacetime metric. Specifically, we take the 4-dimensional spacetime metric to have a 3-dimensional defect with a vanishing determinant of the metric. This new solution suggests the existence of another "side" of the Big Bang (perhaps a more appropriate description than "pre-big-bang" phase used in our original paper). The corresponding new solution for defect wormholes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

Abstract: The global magnificent four theory is the homological version of a maximally supersymmetric $(8+1)$-dimensional gauge theory on a Calabi-Yau fourfold fibered over a circle. In the case of a toric fourfold we conjecture the formula for its twisted Witten index. String-theoretically we count the BPS states of a system of $D0$-$D2$-$D4$-$D6$-$D8$-branes on the Calabi-Yau fourfold in the presence of a large Neveu-Schwarz $B$-field. Mathematically, we develop the equivariant $K$-theoretic DT4 theory, by constructing the four-valent vertex with generic plane partition asymptotics. Physically, the vertex is a supersymmetric localization of a non-commutative gauge theory in $8+1$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Canonical Quantization of the U(1) Gauge Field in the right Rindler-wedge in the Rindler Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, the canonical quantization of the U(1) gauge field in the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the right Rindler-wedge (RRW) of the four-dimensional Rindler coordinates is performed. Specifically, we obtain the gauge-fixed Lagrangian by the Lorentz-covariant gauge in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, which is composed of the U(1) gauge field and B-field. Then, we obtain the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field and B-field by solving the equations of motion obtained from that gauge-fixed Lagrangian. Subsequently, defining the Klein-Gordon inner-product in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates, we determine the normalization constants of all directions of the mode-solutions of the U(1) gauge field and B-field. Then, for the U(1) gauge field given by those normalized mode-expanded solutions, we obtain the commutation relations of the creation and annihilation operators defined in the RRW of the Rindler coordinates by formulating the canonical commutation relations. In addition, we provide a polarization vector for the annihilation operators obtained in this way. Using these result, we show that the Minkowski ground state can be expressed as the outer-product of the left and right Rindler-wedges state on which those creation and annihilation operators act. Then, tracing out the left Rindler states of that Minkowski ground state, we obtain the density matrix of the U(1) gauge field in the RRW. From this, we show that the U(1) gauge field in a constant accelerated system will feel the Unruh temperature as well.</description>

Abstract: We consider asymptotically free gauge theories with gauge group $SU(N_c)$ and $N_f$ quarks with mass $m_q\ll \Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$ that undergo chiral symmetry breaking and confinement. We propose a bootstrap method to compute the S-matrix of the pseudo-Goldstone bosons (pions) that dominate the low energy physics. For the important case of $N_c=3$, $N_f=2$, a numerical implementation of the method gives the phase shifts of the $S0$, $P1$ and $S2$ waves in good agreement with experimental results. The method incorporates gauge theory information ($N_c$, $N_f$, $m_q$, $\Lambda_{\text{QCD}}$) by using the form-factor bootstrap recently proposed by Karateev, Kuhn and Penedones together with a finite energy version of the SVZ sum rules. At low energy we impose constraints from chiral symmetry breaking. The only low energy numerical inputs are the pion mass $m_\pi$ and the quark and gluon condensates.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new type of holographic correspondence between non-relativistic string theory in String Newton-Cartan AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ and Galilean Electrodynamics supplemented with 5 uncharged massless free scalar fields living on the 3+1 dimensional Penrose conformal boundary. In our derivation, we start with Maldacena's setting of a stack of $N$ coincident D3-branes and we show that the near-horizon/decoupling limit commutes with the non-relativistic limit, giving a unique answer both from the gravity and gauge theory perspectives. As a first evidence, we systematically compute the Killing vectors on the string theory side, and find that they match the symmetries of the dual gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent advances in the understanding of integrability for $AdS_3$ backgrounds, we present a lightning review of this approach, with particular attention to the "tensionless" limits (with zero and one unit of NSNS flux), and to the many integrable deformations of the supergravity backgrounds. Our aim is to concisely but comprehensively take stock of the state of the art in the field, in a way accessible to non-experts, and to highlight outstanding challenges. Along the way we reference where the various derivation of these results, which we mostly omit, can be found in full detail.</description>

      <title>Current density induced by a cosmic string in de Sitter spacetime in the presence of two flat boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the vacuum bosonic current density induced by a carrying-magnetic-flux cosmic string in a $(D+1)$-de Sitter spacetime considering the presence of two flat boundaries perpendicular to it. In this setup, the Robin boundary conditions are imposed on the scalar charged quantum field on the boundaries. The particular cases of Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are studied separately. Due to the coupling of the quantum scalar field with the classical gauge field, corresponding to a magnetic flux running along the string's core, a nonzero vacuum expectation value for the current density operator along the azimuthal direction is induced. The two boundaries divide the space in three regions with different properties of the vacuum states. In this way, our main objective is to calculate the induced currents in these three regions. In order to develop this analysis we calculate, for both regions, the positive frequency Wightman functions. Because the vacuum bosonic current in dS space has been investigated before, in this paper we consider only the contributions induced by the boundaries. We show that for each region the azimuthal current densities are odd functions of the magnetic flux along the string. To probe the correctness of our results, we take the particular cases and analyze some asymptotic limits of the parameters of the model. Also some graphs are presented exhibiting the behavior of the current with relevant physical parameter of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study D4 brane domain walls in the scale-separated 4d $\mathcal{N}$=1 AdS$_4$ DGKT scenario. Classically, these are BPS and satisfy a no-force condition since their tension equals their charge. We show that this property is not stable against quantum corrections and that these increase the brane tension-to-charge ratio, rendering the branes self-attractive. As a result, DGKT seems to be in tension with the Weak Gravity Conjecture for membranes. The quantum effects we consider include non-perturbative gaugino condensation on the D4-brane worldvolume and Euclidean D2 brane instantons, which correct the tension-to-charge ratio because the DGKT construction breaks all parity symmetries. Similar results hold in other 4d $\mathcal{N}$=1 setups not protected by parity symmetries.</description>

      <title>Dynamical black hole entropy beyond general relativity from the Einstein frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>

Abstract: We study the one-loop corrections in power spectrum of long gravitational waves induced from small scale modes in the models of single field inflation undergoing a phase of ultra-slow-roll (USR). We show that the spectrum of long tensor perturbations are largely unaffected by the loop corrections from the short scalar modes. In particular, the spectrum of long tensor perturbations is insensitive to the sharpness of the transition from the USR phase to the final slow-roll phase. This is in contrast to the case of scalar power spectrum in which the loop corrections can be large for a sharp transition while it is slow-roll suppressed in a mild transition. We study the tensor-scalar-scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit and demonstrate that the Maldacena consistency condition does hold.</description>

      <title>Quantum strong cosmic censorship and black hole evaporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is common folklore that semiclassical arguments suggest that in black hole evaporation an initially pure state can become mixed. This is known as the \emph{information loss puzzle} (or {\it paradox}). Here we argue that, if taken at face value, semiclassical gravity suggests the formation of a final singularity instead of information loss. A quantum strong cosmic censorship conjecture, for which we give a rigorous statement, supports this conclusion. Thus, there are no reasons to expect a failure of unitarity in black hole evaporation or for any quantum gravity theory that can `cure' singularities.</description>

      <title>Late-time tails in nonlinear evolutions of merging black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonlinear evolutions of binary black hole mergers, uncovering power-law contributions generated by the long-range behaviour of the highly-curved dynamical spacetime. The result is achieved by exploiting the strong increase of the tail relevance due to binary eccentricity, recently observed in perturbative evolutions of a small-mass-ratio binary under accurate radiation reaction by Albanesi and collaborators [PhysRevD.108.084037]. We demonstrate the presence of this enhancement even in the nonlinear case of comparable-mass binary mergers in eccentric orbits, using the public RIT waveform catalog. The instantaneous frequency of the simulations displays large oscillations at intermediate to late-times, due to interference terms in the transition between a fast-decaying, constant-frequency quasinormal-mode driven regime, and a power-law, slowly-decaying one. The power-law exponent displays broad convergence with perturbative predictions, although longer and more accurate simulations will be needed to pinpoint the asymptotic value. Our results offer yet another confirmation of the highly predictive power of black hole perturbation theory in the presence of a source, even when applied to nonlinear solutions. The magnitude of the tail signal is within reach of gravitational-wave detectors measurements, unlocking the possibility of observationally investigating an additional set of general relativistic predictions on the long-range dynamics of relaxing compact objects.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the tension between cosmological models and JWST red candidate massive galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Python tool to estimate the tail distribution of the number of dark matter halos beyond a mass threshold and in a given volume in a light-cone. The code is based on the extended Press-Schechter model and is computationally efficient, typically taking a few seconds on a personal laptop for a given set of cosmological parameters. The high efficiency of the code allows a quick estimation of the tension between cosmological models and the red candidate massive galaxies released by the James Webb Space Telescope, as well as scanning the theory space with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method. As an example application, we use the tool to study the cosmological implication of the candidate galaxies presented in Labb\'e et al. (2023). The standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model is well consistent with the data if the star formation efficiency can reach $\sim 0.3$ at high redshift. For a low star formation efficiency $\epsilon \sim 0.1$, $\Lambda$CDM model is disfavored at $\sim 2\sigma$-$3\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Motion of spinning particles around a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the curved spacetime background, the trajectory of a spinning test particle will deviate from the geodesic. Using the effective potential method, we study the motion of a spinning test particle on the equatorial plane of a polymer black hole in loop quantum gravity described by the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations with minimal spin-gravity interaction. We find that for the bounded orbits in the radial direction, the particle's motion is timelike when its spin is small. The radial range of the orbit and its eccentricity decrease with the loop quantum gravity parameter. However, when the particle takes a large enough spin, we observe an interesting phenomenon that the timelike and spacelike motions alternately appear while are separated by a critical radius. Outside the critical radius, the motion is timelike, however inside it is spacelike, and on the radius $r_c$ it is null. This property shares similarities with the event horizon radius. However, unlike the event horizon radius, the value of $r_c$ is related to both the particle's motion and the black hole parameters. To explore more observable effects of the loop quantum gravity parameter on the motion of the spinning particle, we focus our attention on the circular orbits, particularly the innermost stable circular orbits, near the black hole. The result shows that for the same spin, there are two different innermost stable circular orbits, one with a larger radius and the other with a smaller radius. Both the radii decrease as the loop quantum gravity parameter increases. More significantly, with the increase of the spin of the particle, the small innermost stable circular orbit transition from timelike to spacelike, while the one with large radius does not. Instead, it terminates at a certain value of spin.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamical topology of quantum BTZ black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the study of black hole thermodynamics, topology offers a novel approach and perspective for classifying black hole systems. In this work, we explore the thermodynamical topology of the quantum BTZ black hole by employing the concept of the generalized free energy. To fully characterize the thermodynamics, we introduce two distinct topological numbers. The first one is determined by an expression, denoted by $z$, derived from the free energy. Although it can provide us with some local physical explanations, sufficient physical significance still lacks from a global perspective. On the other hand, the second topological number is based on the entropy expression of the generalized free energy, leading to a more meaningful interpretation of its physical implications. This result highlights the natural choice of entropy as the domain variable for the generalized free energy. Regarding the second topological number, our analysis reveals a topological transition that is associated with the thermodynamical stability of the ``cold" black hole state of the quantum BTZ black hole. And the thermodynamical topology of BTZ black hole and quantum BTZ black hole can be different, which implies a significant impact of quantum effects on thermodynamics. Furthermore, our study suggests the existence of topological numbers beyond the conventional values of $\pm 1,0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the maximal Bell violation for a generic qubit-qudit system, obtaining easily computable expressions in arbitrary qudit dimension. This work generalizes the well-known Horodeckis's result for a qubit-qubit system. We also give simple lower and upper bounds on that violation. We apply our general results to address a number of issues. Namely, we obtain a bound on the degree of purity required in a system to exhibit nonlocality and study the statistics of nonlocality in random density matrices. Besides, we show the impossibility of improving the amount of Bell-violation by embedding the qudit in a Hilbert space of larger dimension. We also discuss how the results are generalized to POVM measurements. Finally, the general result is illustrated with a family of density matrices in the context of a qubit-qutrit system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review the notion of symplectic duality earlier introduced in the context of topological recursion. We show that the transformation of symplectic duality can be expressed as a composition of $x-y$ dualities in a broader context of log topological recursion. As a corollary, we establish nice properties of symplectic duality: various convenient explicit formulas, invertibility, group property, compatibility with topological recursion and KP integrability. As an application of these properties, we get a new and uniform proof of topological recursion for large families of weighted double Hurwitz numbers; this encompasses and significantly extends all previously known results on this matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has emerged as a novel tool for probing nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics (QCD) phenomena, such as color confinement in protons. While recent studies have demonstrated its significant capability in describing hadron production in deep inelastic scatterings, the QCD evolution of entanglement entropy remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the differential rapidity-dependent entanglement entropy within the proton and its connection to final-state hadrons, aiming to elucidate its QCD evolution. Our analysis reveals a strong agreement between the rapidity dependence of von Neumann entropy, obtained from QCD evolution equations, and the corresponding experimental data on hadron entropy. These findings provide compelling evidence for the emergence of a maximally entangled state, offering new insights into the nonperturbative structure of protons.</description>

      <title>Decoherence due to the Casimir effect?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Open system dynamics of an electron is studied in the presence of radiation field, confined between two parallel conducting pates. It has been suggested in previous works that the quantized zero-point modes of this field lead to finite decoherence effects, possibly due to the Casimir force. However, in this work it is shown that the decoherence found in previous works is due to the sudden switching on of the system-environment interaction and due to the acceleration of the electron enforced by the background paths whose superposition was analyzed. The work discusses important theoretical aspects of the setup and shows that while coherence might be lost due to bremsstrahlung induced by an external or the image potential, it cannot be lost due to the mere presence of the quantum vacuum fluctuations between the plates.</description>

      <title>Superradiance of charged black holes embedded in dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical environments are ubiquitous in the Universe; from accretion disks around black holes to galactic dark matter halos, distributions of astrophysical material veil the vast majority of Cosmos. Including environmental effects in strong-field gravity and astrophysics is, therefore, a rather tantalizing task in the quest for novel gravitational-wave phenomena. Here, we examine how environments affect the high-energy process of superradiance. In particular, we study the amplification of charged scalar waves under the expense of the electrostatic energy contained in a charged black hole that is embedded in an observationally-motivated, and qualitatively generic, dark matter halo. We find that the superradiant amplification of massless charged scalar fields scattering off environmentally-enriched charged black holes can be equally efficient to those occurring in vacuum charged black holes. This occurs due to the fact that the sole interplay between the scalar wave and the black hole is the electromagnetic interaction. The addition of mass on the charged scalar waves leads to a rapid suppression of superradiant amplification. This transpires to a great extent due to the `friction' that the mass introduces to the black hole potential. Nevertheless, for sufficiently large scalar masses, the amplification factors can be also subdominantly affected by the compactness of the halo. This occurs because the gravitational interaction between the dense halo and the wave's mass grows, thus further suppressing the superradiant amplification.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically, and they can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, -, -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimisation of the action by employing the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density, namely, $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha \phi_{a}\left(x\right))$, as the function of the symmetric fractional derivative of the field, e.g. in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>
