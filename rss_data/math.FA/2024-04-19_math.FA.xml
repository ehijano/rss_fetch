      <title>Generalized Converses of Operator Jensens Inequalities with Applications to Hypercomplex Function Approximations and Bounds Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mond and Pecaric proposed a powerful method, namd as MP method, to deal with operator inequalities. However, this method requires a real-valued function to be convex or concave, and the normalized positive linear map between Hilbert spaces. The objective of this study is to extend the MP method by allowing non-convex or non-concave real-valued functions and nonlinear mapping between Hilbert spaces. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem and Kantorovich function are fundamental components employed in generalizing the MP method inequality in this context. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the inequalities obtained from the conventional MP method by requiring convex function with a normalized positive linear map. Various new inequalities regarding hypercomplex functions, i.e., operator-valued functions with operators as arguments, are derived based on the proposed MP method. These inequalities are applied to approximate hypercomplex functions using ratio criteria and difference criteria. Another application of these new inequalities is to establish bounds for hypercomplex functions algebra, i.e., an abelian monoid for the addition or multiplication of hypercomplex functions, and to derive tail bounds for random tensors ensembles addition or multiplication systematically.</description>

      <title>More on the (Uniform) Mazur Intersection Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce two moduli of w*-semidenting points and characterise the Mazur Intersection Property (MIP) and the Uniform MIP (UMIP) in terms of these moduli. We show that a property slightly stronger than UMIP already implies uniform convexity of the dual. This may lead to a possible approach towards answering the long standing open question whether the UMIP implies the existence of an equivalent uniformly convex renorming. We also obtain the condition for stability of the UMIP under $\ell_p$-sums.</description>

      <title>Stability of Klartag's improved Lichnerowicz inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work, Klartag gave an improved version of Lichnerowicz' spectral gap bound for uniformly log-concave measures, which improves on the classical estimate by taking into account the covariance matrix. We analyze the equality cases in Klartag's bound, showing that it can be further improved whenever the measure has no Gaussian factor. Additionally, we give a quantitative improvement for log-concave measures with finite Fisher information.</description>

      <title>Sign-changing solutions of variational inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the sign-changing solutions of variational inequality problems. In order to give the existence results of the sign-changing solutions for variational inequality problems, we first construct a suitable penalty problem related to the variational inequality, and prove the existence of a sign-changing solution for this penalty problem using the invariant set of descending flow method. Secondly, we perform a series of estimates on the sign-changing solution sequence of the penalty problem, and prove that the limit of convergence of the sign-changing solution sequence is the sign-changing solution of the original variational inequality problem. Variational inequality problems have extensive and important applications. In this paper, we used penalty method and the method of invariant set of descending flow to obtain the existence results for solutions of a variational inequality. In particular, we obtain the existence results for sign-changing solutions of variational inequalities for the first time based on the method of invariant set of descending flow.</description>

      <title>Periodic traveling waves for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations with non-zero conditions at infinity in $ \R ^2 $</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero conditions at infinity in $\R^2$. We investigate the existence of traveling waves that are periodic in the direction transverse to the direction of propagation and minimize the energy when the momentum is kept fixed. We show that for any given value of the momentum, there is a critical value of the period such that traveling waves with period smaller than the critical value are one-dimensional, and those with larger periods depend on two variables.</description>

      <title>Maximal weak Orlicz types and the strong maximal on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{E}_n: \mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}_n$ and $\mathbf{E}_m: \mathcal{N} \to \mathcal{N}_m$ be two sequences of conditional expectations on finite von Neumann algebras. The optimal weak Orlicz type of the associated strong maximal operator $\mathcal{E} = (\mathbf{E}_n\otimes \mathbf{E}_m)_{n,m}$ is not yet known. In a recent work of Jose Conde and the two first-named authors, it was show that $\mathcal{E}$ has weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$ for a family of functions including $\Phi(t) = t \, \log^{2+\varepsilon} t$, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. In this article, we prove that the weak Orlicz type of $\mathcal{E}$ cannot be lowered below $L \log^2 L$, meaning that if $\mathcal{E}$ is of weak type $(\Phi, \Phi)$, then $\Phi(s) \not\in o(s \, \log^2 s)$. Our proof is based on interpolation. Namely, we use recent techniques of Cadilhac/Ricard to formulate a Marcinkiewicz type theorem for maximal weak Orlicz types. Then, we show that a weak Orlicz type lower than $L \log^2 L$ would imply a $p$-operator constant for $\mathcal{E}$ smaller than the known optimum as $p \to 1^{+}$.</description>

      <title>Internal sequential commutation and single generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extract a precise internal description of the sequential commutation equivalence relation introduced in [KEP23] for tracial von Neumann algebras. As an application we prove that if a tracial von Neumann algebra $N$ is generated by unitaries $\{u_i\}_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ such that $u_i\sim u_j$ (i.e, there exists a finite set of Haar unitaries $\{w_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ in $N^\mathcal{U}$ such that $[u_i, w_1]= [w_k, w_{k+1}]=[w_n,u_j]=0$ for all $1\leq k&lt; n$) then $N$ is singly generated. This generalizes and recovers several known single generation phenomena for II$_1$ factors in the literature with a unified proof.</description>

      <title>Zero-one law of orbital limit points for weighted shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.01641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chan and Seceleanu have shown that if a weighted shift operator on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p&lt;\infty$, admits an orbit with a non-zero limit point then it is hypercyclic. We present a new proof of this result that allows to extend it to very general sequence spaces. In a similar vein we show that, in many sequence spaces, a weighted shift with a non-zero weakly sequentially recurrent vector has a dense set of such vectors; but an example on $c_0(\mathbb{Z})$ shows that such an operator is not necessarily hypercyclic. On the other hand, we obtain that weakly sequentially hypercyclic weighted shifts are hypercyclic. Chan and Seceleanu have moreover shown that if an adjoint multiplication operator on a Bergman space admits an orbit with a non-zero limit point then it is hypercyclic. We extend this result to very general spaces of analytic functions, including the Hardy spaces.</description>

      <title>Matrix Inequalities between $f(A)\sigma f(B)$ and $A\sigma B$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $ B$ be $n\times n$ positive definite complex matrices, let $\sigma$ be a matrix mean, and let $f : [0,\infty)\to [0,\infty)$ be a differentiable convex function with $f(0)=0$. We prove that $$f^{\prime}(0)(A \sigma B)\leq \frac{f(m)}{m}(A\sigma B)\leq f(A)\sigma f(B)\leq \frac{f(M)}{M}(A\sigma B)\leq f^{\prime}(M)(A\sigma B),$$ where $m$ represents the smallest eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$ and $M$ represents the largest eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$. If $f$ is differentiable and concave, then the reverse inequalities hold. We use our result to improve some known subadditivity inequalities involving unitarily invariant norms under certain mild conditions. In particular, if $f(x)/x$ is increasing, then $$|||f(A)+f(B)|||\leq\frac{f(M)}{M} |||A+B|||\leq |||f(A+B)|||$$ holds for all $A$ and $B$ with $M\leq A+B$. Furthermore, we apply our results to explore some related inequalities. As an application, we present a generalization of Minkowski's determinant inequality.equality.</description>

      <title>Construction under Martin's axiom of a Boolean algebra with the Grothendieck property but without the Nikodym property</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Improving a result of M. Talagrand, under the assumption of a weak form of Martin's axiom, we construct a totally disconnected compact Hausdorff space $K$ such that the Banach space $C(K)$ of continuous real-valued functions on $K$ is a Grothendieck space but there exists a sequence $(\mu_n)$ of Radon measures on $K$ such that $\mu_n(A)\to0$ for every clopen set $A\subseteq K$ and $\int_Kfd\mu_n\not\to0$ for some $f\in C(K)$. Consequently, we get that Martin's axiom implies the existence of a Boolean algebra with the Grothendieck property but without the Nikodym property.</description>

      <title>Geometric relative entropies and barycentric R\'enyi divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14282v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give systematic ways of defining monotone quantum relative entropies and (multi-variate) quantum R\'enyi divergences starting from a set of monotone quantum relative entropies.
  Despite its central importance in information theory, only two additive and monotone quantum extensions of the classical relative entropy have been known so far, the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski relative entropies. Here we give a general procedure to construct monotone and additive quantum relative entropies from a given one with the same properties; in particular, when starting from the Umegaki relative entropy, this gives a new one-parameter family of monotone and additive quantum relative entropies interpolating between the Umegaki and the Belavkin-Staszewski ones on full-rank states.
  In a different direction, we use a generalization of a classical variational formula to define multi-variate quantum R\'enyi quantities corresponding to any finite set of quantum relative entropies $(D^{q_x})_{x\in X}$ and signed probability measure $P$, as $$ Q_P^{\mathrm{b},\mathbf{q}}((\rho_x)_{x\in X}):=\sup_{\tau\ge 0}\left\{\text{Tr}\,\tau-\sum_xP(x)D^{q_x}(\tau\|\rho_x)\right\}. $$ We show that monotone quantum relative entropies define monotone R\'enyi quantities whenever $P$ is a probability measure. With the proper normalization, the negative logarithm of the above quantity gives a quantum extension of the classical R\'enyi $\alpha$-divergence in the 2-variable case ($X=\{0,1\}$, $P(0)=\alpha$). We show that if both $D^{q_0}$ and $D^{q_1}$ are monotone and additive quantum relative entropies, and at least one of them is strictly larger than the Umegaki relative entropy then the resulting barycentric R\'enyi divergences are strictly between the log-Euclidean and the maximal R\'enyi divergences, and hence they are different from any previously studied quantum R\'enyi divergence.</description>

      <title>Averaging multipliers on locally compact quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an averaging procedure for completely bounded multipliers on a locally compact quantum group with respect to a compact quantum subgroup. As a consequence we show that central approximation properties of discrete quantum groups are equivalent to the corresponding approximation properties of their Drinfeld doubles. This is complemented by a discussion of the averaging of Fourier algebra elements. We compare the biinvariant Fourier algebra of the Drinfeld double of a discrete quantum group with the central Fourier algebra. In the unimodular case these are naturally identified, but we show by exhibiting a family of counter-examples that they differ in general.</description>
