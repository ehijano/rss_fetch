      <title>Temporal and Spatial Analysis of Crime Patterns in New York City: A Statistical Investigation of NYPD Complaint Data (1963-2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive statistical analysis of criminal complaint data from the New York City Police Department (NYPD) spanning 47 years (1963-2025) [1]. Using a dataset of 438,556 complaint records, we employed exploratory data analysis (EDA), descriptive statistics, and multiple statistical hypothesis tests to investigate the spatial, temporal, and categorical patterns of urban crimes. Our findings revealed significant associations between crime types and geographic locations, temporal variations in criminal activity, and differences in crime severity across time. The results demonstrate that Brooklyn experiences the highest crime volume, petit-larceny constitutes the most common offense, and criminal activity peaks during the evening hours on weekdays, particularly Fridays. Statistical tests, including chi-square tests, Kruskal-Wallis H-test, and Mann-Whitney U test, confirmed highly significant relationships (p &lt; 0.001) across all examined dimensions, providing evidence-based insights for law enforcement resource allocation and urban safety policy development.</description>

      <title>Reviewing definition of resilience in different disciplines with a focus on disaster restructure systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key principle in resilience thinking is Embracing Change because change is, indeed, inevitable. In the face of a growing number of disasters, natural and human-made disasters, our critical infrastructures (CIs) are being challenged like never before. This recent trend has sparked a wave of interest among both practitioners and researchers in understanding and delving deeper into the concept of resilience across multiple disciplines. This paper provides an accessible review of these new insights, exploring various frameworks, guidebooks, and methodologies that define resilience through the lens of ecology, engineering, psychology, social science, community, and disaster management during crisis.</description>

      <title>Structural transitions induced by adaptive rewiring in networks with fixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate structural transitions in adaptive networks where node states remain fixed and only the connections evolve via state-dependent rewiring. Using a general framework characterized by probabilistic rules for disconnection and reconnection based on node similarity, we systematically explore how homophilic and heterophilic interactions influence network topology. A mean-field approximation for the stationary density of active links-those connecting nodes in different states-is developed to determine the conditions under which fragmentation occurs. Analytical results closely agree with numerical simulations. To distinguish community formation from fragmentation, we introduce order parameters that integrate modularity and connectivity. This enables the characterization of three distinct network phases on the rewiring parameter space: i) random connectivity, ii) community structure, and iii) fragmentation. Community structure emerges only under moderate homophily, while extreme homophily or heterophily lead to fragmentation or random networks, respectively. These findings demonstrate that adaptive rewiring alone, independent of node dynamics, can drive complex structural self-organization, with implications for social, technological, and ecological systems where node attributes are intrinsically stable.</description>

      <title>The SolarEV City Paradox: A Critical Review of the Fragmented Integration of Rooftop Photovoltaics and Electric Vehicles for Urban Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban decarbonization is central to meeting global climate goals, yet progress toward integrated low-carbon energy systems remains slow. The SolarEV City Concept, linking rooftop photovoltaics with electric vehicles as mobile storage offers a technically robust pathway for deep CO2 reduction, potentially meeting 60-95 percent of municipal electricity demand when deployed synergistically. Despite rapid global growth of PVs and EVs, integration through bidirectional Vehicle-to-Home and Vehicle-to-Grid systems has lagged, revealing a persistent SolarEV paradox. This review examines that paradox through a socio-technical framework across four dimensions, technology, economics, policy, and society. Cross-national comparison shows that while technical feasibility is well established, large-scale implementation is limited by fragmented charging-protocol standards, immature and often non-profitable V2G business models, regulatory misalignments between energy and transport sectors, and social-equity barriers that restrict participation mainly to high-income homeowners. Emerging national archetypes from Japans resilience-driven model to Europes regulation-first trajectory highlight strong path dependence in current integration strategies. The analysis concludes that advancing SolarEV Cities requires a shift from parallel PV-EV promotion toward coordinated policy frameworks, interoperable digital infrastructure, and inclusive market designs that distribute economic and resilience benefits more equitably. Achieving this integrated energy transition will require strategic collaboration among researchers, governments, industries, and communities to build adaptive, resilient, and socially just urban energy systems.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Activity-Driven Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal-network models have provided key insights into how time-varying connectivity shapes dynamical processes such as spreading. Among them, the activity-driven model is a widely used, analytically tractable benchmark. Yet many temporal networks, such as those of physical proximity, are also embedded in space, and spatial constraints are known to affect dynamics unfolding on the networks strongly. Despite this, there is a lack of similar simple and solvable models for spatiotemporal contact structures. Here, we introduce a spatial activity-driven model in which short-range contacts are more frequent. This model is analytically tractable and captures the joint effects of space and time. We show analytically and numerically that the model reproduces several characteristic features of social and contact networks, including strong and weak ties, clustering, and triangles having weights above the median. These traits can be attributed to space acting as a form of memory. Simulations of spreading dynamics on top of the model networks further illustrate the role of space, highlighting how localisation slows down spreading. Furthermore, the framework is well-suited for modelling social distancing in a principled way as an intervention measure aimed at reducing long-range links. We find that, unlike for non-spatial networks, even a small spatially targeted reduction in the total number of contacts can be very effective. More broadly, by offering a tractable framework, the model enables systematic exploration of dynamical processes on spatiotemporal networks.</description>

      <title>Loops, not groups: Long cycles are responsible for discontinuous phase transitions in higher-order network contagions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a self-consistent approach to introduce higher-order effects in a branching process model of complex contagion on clustered networks. Branching processes operate over an infinite population such that they never circle back and interact with previously exposed parts of the system. This infinite, treelike, structure makes it tricky to account for complex contagion mechanisms such as group effects, peer pressure, or social reinforcement where multiple exposures interact in synergistic ways. Here we present a self-consistent solution that accounts for local group structure and global cycles where the process can feedback on itself. This allows us to distinguish multiple exposures that stem from a single transmission chain, from those occurring at the intersection of different transmission chains. We find that only the latter mechanism can give rise to a discontinuous phase transition in the size of global cascades, which is a defining feature of complex contagions. Group effects alone, without long cycles, produce standard continuous phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics Models for Sentiment Evolution in Weibo Blogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social media platforms enable influencers to distribute content and quickly capture audience reactions, significantly shaping their promotional strategies and advertising agreements. Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single "macro-agent", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory. The sentiment evolution aligns closely with opinion-dynamics models, particularly modified versions of the classical French-DeGroot model that incorporate delayed perception and distinguish between expressed and private opinions. The inferred influence structures reveal interdependencies among blogs that may arise from homophily, whereby emotionally similar users subscribe to the same blogs and collectively shape the shared sentiment expressed within these communities.</description>

      <title>Guided rewiring of social networks reduces polarization and accelerates collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Global social and ecological challenges represent collective action problems requiring rapid and sufficient cooperation with pro-mitigation norms. Sociopolitical polarization hinders such cooperation. Prior agent-based models showed polarization emerges naturally in structured social networks and polarized cluster dissolution rate limits consensus formation rate. Here we study how guided link rewiring affects depolarization dynamics across synthetic and empirical (Facebook, Twitter) network topologies. We compare heuristic rewiring algorithms representing random meetings, mutual acquaintance introductions, and community bridging, alongside topology-based link recommender algorithms (Who to Follow and node2vec). Our heuristic algorithms all outperform Who to Follow in generating cooperative consensus. Homophilic rewiring generates cooperative consensus when agents can easily change opinions. However, heterophilic rewiring achieves this over broader conditions and can accelerate cooperative consensus formation by ~20%, including where up to 33% of the population experiences backfiring interactions. Heterophilic rewiring also vastly outperforms topology-based recommender algorithms. Random rewiring performed consistently well, achieving higher steady-state cooperation than seven out of eight more complex algorithms. Large disparities in steady-state cooperation for topology-based recommender systems highlight their volatility across network structures. Overall, our work reveals a subtle interplay between topology, rewiring algorithm and social depolarization, suggesting strong potential for carefully redesigning social networking technologies for social good.</description>

      <title>Voting power in the Council of the European Union: A comprehensive sensitivity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. A number of decisions require a qualified majority, the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution based on the Shapley--Shubik index and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with approximately 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The decisiveness index decreases if the population criterion is above 68% or the states criterion is at least 17. Some quota combinations contradict the principles of double majority. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley--Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable for evaluating any proposal to reform the qualified majority voting system.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Competitiveness in UEFA's New Champions League Format</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, UEFA changed the group stage of its international soccer competitions to an incomplete round robin tournament. Previously, teams were divided into groups, each playing a double round robin tournament with a resulting ranking table. In contrast, the new format has all teams competing in one league, producing a single ranking. We investigate the effect of the new format on the number of competitive matches in the UEFA Champions League. A match is non-competitive if the prize for at least one opponent does not depend on the match outcome, or if there exists an opportunity for both opponents to collude; otherwise, we call a match competitive. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the new format results in more competitive matches than the old format.</description>

      <title>Sync or Sink: Bounds on Algorithmic Collective Action with Noise and Multiple Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective action against algorithmic systems provides an opportunity for a small group of individuals to strategically manipulate their data to get specific outcomes, from classification to recommendation models. This effectiveness will invite more growth of this type of coordinated actions, both in the size and the number of distinct collectives. With a small group, however, coordination is key. Currently, there is no formal analysis of how coordination challenges within a collective can impact downstream outcomes, or how multiple collectives may affect each other's success. In this work, we aim to provide guarantees on the success of collective action in the presence of both coordination noise and multiple groups. Our insight is that data generated by either multiple collectives or by coordination noise can be viewed as originating from multiple data distributions. Using this framing, we derive bounds on the success of collective action. We conduct experiments to study the effects of noise on collective action. We find that sufficiently high levels of noise can reduce the success of collective action. In certain scenarios, large noise can sink a collective success rate from $100\%$ to just under $60\%$. We identify potential trade-offs between collective size and coordination noise; for example, a collective that is twice as big but with four times more noise experiencing worse outcomes than the smaller, more coordinated one. This work highlights the importance of understanding nuanced dynamics of strategic behavior in algorithmic systems.</description>

      <title>The 1979 Iranian Revolution and the Lost Decade of Science: A Counterfactual Scientometric Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive scientometric analysis of the long-term impact of the 1979 Iranian Revolution on the nation scientific development. Using Scopus-indexed data from 1960 to 2024, we benchmark Iran publication trajectory against a carefully selected peer group representing diverse development models, established scientific leaders, Netherlands, stable regional powers, Israel, and high-growth, Asian Tigers, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore alongside Greece and China. The analysis reveals a stark divergence, in the late 1970s, Iran scientific output surpassed that of South Korea, China and Taiwan. The revolution, however, precipitated a collapse, followed by a lost decade of stagnation, precisely when its Asian peers began an unprecedented, state driven ascent. We employ counterfactual models based on pre revolutionary growth trends to quantify the resulting knowledge deficit. The findings suggest that, in an alternate, stable timeline, Iran scientific output could have rivaled South Korea today. We further outline a research agenda to analyze normalized impact metrics, such as FWCI, and collaboration patterns, complementing our findings on publication volume. By contextualizing Iran unique trajectory, this study contributes to a broader understanding of the divergent recovery patterns exhibited by national scientific systems following profound political shocks, offering insights into the enduring consequences of historical disruptions on the global scientific landscape.</description>

      <title>Friendship-paradox paradox: Do most people's friends really have more friends than they do?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical friendship paradox asserts that, on average, an individual's neighbors have a higher degree than the individual. This statement concerns network-level means and does not describe how often a typical node is locally dominated by its neighbors. Motivated by this distinction, we develop a framework that separates mean-based friendship paradox inequalities from two majority-type quantities: a global fraction measuring how many nodes have a degree smaller than the mean degree of their neighbors, and a local fraction based on hub centrality that measures how many nodes are dominated in a median-based sense. We show that neither fraction is constrained by the classical friendship paradox and that they can behave independently of each other. A simple example and two empirical networks illustrate how quadrant patterns in the joint distribution of a node's degree and its neighbors' degree determine the signs and magnitudes of the two fractions, and how left- or right-skewed degree distributions of neighboring nodes can yield opposite conclusions for mean-based and median-based comparisons. The resulting framework offers a clearer distinction between population averages and local majority relations and provides a foundation for future analyses of local advantage, disadvantage, and perception asymmetry in complex networks.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary constraints for the endemicity of rapidly evolving viruses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antigenic escape constitutes the main mechanism allowing rapidly evolving viruses to achieve endemicity. Beyond granting immune escape, empirical evidence also suggests that mutations of viruses might increase their inter-host infectiousness. While both mechanisms are well-studied individually, their combined effects on viral endemicity remain to be explored. Here we propose a minimal eco-evolutionary framework to simulate epidemic outbreaks generated by pathogens evolving both their infectiousness and immune escape. Our results reveal that the main driver of viral evolution shifts over time: from intrinsic selection for infectiousness at early stages of the outbreak to antigenic diversification in the transition to the endemic phase. We find that the evolution in both traits during the first epidemic wave plays a critical role in determining long-term viral persistence. Evolution in infectiousness enhances the endemicity of viruses, especially in viruses with lower baseline infectiousness due to the longer duration of their first epidemic wave. Likewise, control policies flattening epidemic curves might increase viral endemicity as a result of the greater antigenic diversity generated in the prolonged epidemic waves. Our results thus prove that the long-term behavior of epidemic trajectories hinges on the complex interplay between both evolutionary pathways and the underlying contagion dynamics.</description>
