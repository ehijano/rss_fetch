      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21867v1 Announce Type: cross

      <title>Rigid Algebras and Cospans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce rigid algebras, a generalization of rigid categories to arbitrary symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-categories. We develop their general theory, showing in particular that the a priori $(\infty,2)$-category of rigid algebras is in fact an $(\infty,1)$-category. For the $(\infty,2)$-category of cospans in an $(\infty,1)$-category $\mathcal{C}$, we show that the $(\infty,1)$-category of rigid commutative algebras is canonically identified with $\mathcal{C}$. This identification is used to construct an adjunction between the cospan construction and the functor assigning to a symmetric monoidal $(\infty,2)$-category its $(\infty,1)$-category of rigid commutative algebras.</description>

      <title>2-dimensional TFTs via modular $\infty$-operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This lecture series is based on joint work in progress with Shaul Barkan, as well as work in progress of the author. The five sections of these notes correspond to the five lectures, but more details have been added.
  $2$-dimensional topological field theories ($2$D TFTs) valued in vector spaces are commutative Frobenius algebras. The goal of this lecture series is to generalize from the $1$-category of vector spaces to any symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. to study symmetric monoidal functors $\mathrm{Bord}_2 \to \mathcal{C}$. Choosing $\mathcal{C}$ to be the $(2,1)$-category of linear categories, this recovers a definition of modular functors, and choosing it to be the derived category of a ring yields a notion closely related to cohomological field theories. We will introduce a notion of modular $\infty$-operads and algebras over them, construct the modular $\infty$-operad of surfaces $\mathcal{M}$, and show that algebras over $\mathcal{M}$ in $\mathcal{C}$ are exactly $2$D TFTs valued in $\mathcal{C}$. Along the way we will encounter variants modular $\infty$-operads (such as cyclic $\infty$-operads and $\infty$-properads) as well as a proof of the $1$D cobordism hypothesis with singularities. This uses some (mild) $\infty$-category theory, but no familiarity with ($\infty$-)operads will be assumed. The main goal will be to filter $\mathcal{M}$ by genus to obtain an obstruction-theoretic description of $2$D TFTs with general target. Applying this to invertible TFTs one can construct a new spectral sequence exhibiting relations between the cohomology groups of moduli spaces of curves.</description>

      <title>The Walk-Length Filtration for Persistent Homology on Weighted Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed graphs arise in many applications where computing persistent homology helps to encode the shape and structure of the input information. However, there are only a few ways to turn the directed graph information into an undirected simplicial complex filtration required by the standard persistent homology framework. In this paper, we present a new filtration constructed from a directed graph, called the walk-length filtration. This filtration mirrors the behavior of small walks visiting certain collections of vertices in the directed graph. We show that, while the persistence is not stable under the usual $L_\infty$-style network distance, a generalized $L_1$-style distance is, indeed, stable. We further provide an algorithm for its computation, and investigate the behavior of this filtration in examples, including cycle networks and synthetic hippocampal networks with a focus on comparison to the often used Dowker filtration.</description>

      <title>Cohomology of $BPU_n$ and rings of invariants of Weyl groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16297v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $PU_n$ denote the projective unitary group of rank $n$ and $BPU_n$ be its classifying space, for $n&gt;1$. Using the Serre spectral sequence associated to the fibration $BU_n\to BPU_n\to K(\mathbb{Z},3)$, we compute the integral cohomology group of $BPU_n$ in dimensions $\leq 14$. In addition, we determine the ring structure of $H^*(BPU_n;\mathbb{Z})$ up to dimension $13$ by computing the ring of invariants $H^*(BT_{PU_n})^W$ of the Weyl group action in dimensions $\leq 12$.</description>

      <title>Leibniz rule for wedge product in discrete exterior calculus on general polygonal meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete exterior calculus offers a coordinate--free discretization of exterior calculus especially suited for computations on curved spaces. In this work, we present a wedge product on 2--dimensional pseudomanifolds, whose faces are any polygons. We prove that this polygonal wedge product is compatible with the discrete exterior derivative in the sense that it satisfies the Leibniz product rule. We thus extend previously studied discretizations of wedge products from simplicial or quadrilateral meshes to surface meshes whose faces are arbitrary simple polygons. We also prove that our discrete wedge product corresponds to a cup product of cochains on 2--pseudomanifolds. By rigorously justifying our construction we add another piece to ever evolving discrete versions of exterior calculus.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet-Voronoi domain and injectivity radius of flag manifolds -- equivariant cell structure on $O(3)/O(1)^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06338v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the first part of this work, we study Dirichlet-Voronoi domains for discrete isometry groups of Riemannian manifolds, in view of constructing cell structures on homogeneous (complete, real) flag manifolds, equivariant with respect to the action of the Weyl group. We give general results, allowing to build such a structure from an admissible one on the domain. In particular, the injectivity radius plays a key role in the method. The second part starts with the computation of the injectivity radius of (real and complex) flag manifolds; a first step towards the application of the method developed in the first part. Then, with the help of the quaternion algebra, we investigate the particular case of the flag manifold $O(3)/O(1)^3$ of $SL_3(\mathbb{R})$: we prove that the results of the first part apply and derive a new $\mathfrak{S}_3$-equivariant cell structure on it, whose cellular complex of $\mathbb{Z}[\mathfrak{S}_3]$-modules is determined.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Protein Structures: A Cohomology-Based Approach to the Flagellar Motor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mathematical model derived from cohomology, leveraging the KEEL-proven theorem that establishes cohomology as tautological, generated by boundary classes of curves with fixed dual graphs. Simplicial complexes are constructed using skew-commutative graded algebra, and the structure theorem is applied to connect distinct homologies, enabling precise interpretations of the resulting geometric forms. The proposed model is utilized for protein structure analysis and prediction, with a specific application to the Flagellar Motor structure. This approach offers new insights into the geometric and algebraic foundations of biological macromolecular modeling, highlighting its potential for advancement in structural biology.</description>
