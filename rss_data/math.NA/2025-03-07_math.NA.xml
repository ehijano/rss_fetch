      <title>Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behavior confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after foam yielding. Following the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling stress and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructural features of close-cell foams.</description>

      <title>Approximate Evaluation Method for the Probability of the Union of Independent Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of the probability of union of a large number of independent events requires several combinations involving the factorial and the use of high performance computers with several hours of processing. Bounds and simplifications on the probability of the union are useful in the analysis of stochastic problems across various areas including (but not limited to) systems reliability, biological systems, real-time fault-tolerant systems, probability theory, information theory and communications. We propose an approximation to evaluate the probability of the union of several independent events that uses the arithmetic mean of the probability of all of them. The approximate results are very close to, but larger than the exact values. The method allows a much smaller number of operations with a similar result and more simplicity.</description>

      <title>lrAA: Low-Rank Anderson Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new framework for computing low-rank solutions to nonlinear matrix equations arising from spatial discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations: low-rank Anderson acceleration (lrAA). lrAA is an adaptation of Anderson acceleration (AA), a well-known approach for solving nonlinear fixed point problems, to the low-rank format. In particular, lrAA carries out all linear and nonlinear operations in low-rank form with rank truncation using an adaptive truncation tolerance. We propose a simple scheduling strategy to update the truncation tolerance throughout the iteration according to a residual indicator. This controls the intermediate rank and iteration number effectively. To perform rank truncation for nonlinear functions, we propose a new cross approximation, which we call Cross-DEIM, with adaptive error control that is based on the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM). Cross-DEIM employs an iterative update between the approximate singular value decomposition (SVD) and cross approximation. It naturally incorporates a warm-start strategy for each lrAA iterate. We demonstrate the superior performance of lrAA applied to a range of linear and nonlinear problems, including those arising from finite difference discretizations of Laplace's equation, the Bratu problem, the elliptic Monge-Amp\'ere equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>An optimal Petrov-Galerkin framework for operator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal Petrov-Galerkin formulation to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) recovers the best approximation in a specified finite-dimensional (trial) space with respect to a suitable norm. However, the recovery of this optimal solution is contingent on being able to construct the optimal weighting functions associated with the trial basis. While explicit constructions are available for simple one- and two-dimensional problems, such constructions for a general multidimensional problem remain elusive. In the present work, we revisit the optimal Petrov-Galerkin formulation through the lens of deep learning. We propose an operator network framework called Petrov-Galerkin Variationally Mimetic Operator Network (PG-VarMiON), which emulates the optimal Petrov-Galerkin weak form of the underlying PDE. The PG-VarMiON is trained in a supervised manner using a labeled dataset comprising the PDE data and the corresponding PDE solution, with the training loss depending on the choice of the optimal norm. The special architecture of the PG-VarMiON allows it to implicitly learn the optimal weighting functions, thus endowing the proposed operator network with the ability to generalize well beyond the training set. We derive approximation error estimates for PG-VarMiON, highlighting the contributions of various error sources, particularly the error in learning the true weighting functions. Several numerical results are presented for the advection-diffusion equation to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. By embedding the Petrov-Galerkin structure into the network architecture, PG-VarMiON exhibits greater robustness and improved generalization compared to other popular deep operator frameworks, particularly when the training data is limited.</description>

      <title>A Two-Level Direct Solver for the Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hierarchical Poincar\'e-Steklov method (HPS) is a solver for linear elliptic PDEs that combines a multidomain spectral collocation discretization scheme with a highly efficient direct solver. It is particularly well-suited for solving problems with highly oscillatory solutions. However, its hierarchical structure requires a heterogeneous and recursive approach that limits the potential parallelism. Our work introduces a new two-level solver for HPS which divides the method into dense linear algebra operations that can be implemented on GPUs, and a sparse system encoding the hierarchical aspects of the method which interfaces with highly optimized multilevel sparse solvers. This methodology improves the numerical stability of HPS as well as its computational performance. We present a description and justification of our method, as well as an array of tests on three-dimensional problems to showcase its accuracy and performance.</description>

      <title>An Implicitly Restarted Joint Bidiagonalization Algorithm for Large GSVD Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The joint bidiagonalization (JBD) process of a regular matrix pair $\{A,L\}$ is mathematically equivalent to two simultaneous Lanczos bidiagonalization processes of the upper and lower parts of the Q-factor of QR factorization of the stacked matrix $(A^{\mathrm T},\,L^{\mathrm T})^{\mathrm T}$ when their starting vectors are closely related in a specific way. The resulting JBD method for computing extreme generalized singular values and corresponding left and right singular vectors of $\{A,L\}$ realizes the standard Rayleigh--Ritz projection of the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) problem of $\{A,L\}$ onto the two left and one right subspaces generated by the JBD process. In this paper, the implicit restarting technique is nontrivially and skillfully extended to the JBD process, and an implicitly restarted JBD (IRJBD) algorithm is developed with proper selection of crucial shifts proposed and a few key implementation details addressed in finite precision arithmetic. Compact upper bounds are established for the residual norm of an approximate GSVD component in both exact and finite precision arithmetic, which are used to design efficient and reliable stopping criteria and avoid the expensive computation of approximate right generalized singular vectors. Numerical experiments illustrate that IRJBD performs well and is more efficient than the thick-restart JBD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Parameter estimation in fluid flow models from undersampled frequency space data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4D Flow MRI is the state of the art technique for measuring blood flow, and it provides valuable information for inverse problems in the cardiovascular system. However, 4D Flow MRI has a very long acquisition time, straining healthcare resources and inconveniencing patients. Due to this, usually only a part of the frequency space is acquired, where then further assumptions need to be made in order to obtain an image.
  Inverse problems from 4D Flow MRI data have the potential to compute clinically relevant quantities without the need for invasive procedures, and/or expanding the set of biomarkers for a more accurate diagnosis. However, reconstructing MRI measurements with Compressed Sensing techniques introduces artifacts and inaccuracies, which can compromise the results of the inverse problems. Additionally, there is a high number of different sampling patterns available, and it is often unclear which of them is preferable.
  Here, we present a parameter estimation problem directly using highly undersampled frequency space measurements. This problem is numerically solved by a Reduced-Order Unscented Kalman Filter (ROUKF). We show that this results in more accurate parameter estimation for boundary conditions in a synthetic aortic blood flow than using measurements reconstructed with Compressed Sensing.
  We also compare different sampling patterns, demonstrating how the quality of the parameter estimation depends on the choice of the sampling pattern. The results show a considerably higher accuracy than an inverse problem using velocity measurements reconstructed via compressed sensing. Finally, we confirm these findings on real MRI data from a mechanical phantom.</description>

      <title>Near instance optimality of the Lanczos method for Stieltjes and related matrix functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial Krylov subspace methods are among the most widely used methods for approximating $f(A)b$, the action of a matrix function on a vector, in particular when $A$ is large and sparse. When $A$ is Hermitian positive definite, the Lanczos method is the standard choice of Krylov method, and despite being very simplistic in nature, it often outperforms other, more sophisticated methods. In fact, one often observes that the error of the Lanczos method behaves almost exactly as the error of the best possible approximation from the Krylov space (which is in general not efficiently computable). However, theoretical guarantees for the deviation of the Lanczos error from the optimal error are mostly lacking so far (except for linear systems and a few other special cases). We prove a rigorous bound for this deviation when $f$ belongs to the important class of Stieltjes functions (which, e.g., includes inverse fractional powers as special cases) and a related class (which contains, e.g., the square root and the shifted logarithm), thus providing a \emph{near instance optimality} guarantee. While the constants in our bounds are likely not optimal, they greatly improve over the few results that are available in the literature and resemble the actual behavior much better.</description>

      <title>Treatment of Wall Boundary Conditions in High-Order Compact Gas-Kinetic Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boundary layer represents a fundamental structure in fluid dynamics, where accurate boundary discretization significantly enhances computational efficiency. This paper presents a third-order boundary discretization for compact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS). Wide stencils and curved boundaries pose challenges in the boundary treatment for high-order schemes, particularly for temporal accuracy. By utilizing a time-dependent gas distribution function, the GKS simultaneously evaluates fluxes and updates flow variables at cell interfaces, enabling the concurrent update of cell-averaged flow variables and their gradients within the third-order compact scheme. The proposed one-sided discretization achieves third-order spatial accuracy on boundary cells by utilizing updated flow variables and gradients in the discretization for non-slip wall boundary conditions. High-order temporal accuracy on boundary cells is achieved through the GKS time-dependent flux implementation with multi-stage multi-derivative methodology. Additionally, we develop exact no-penetration conditions for both adiabatic and isothermal wall boundaries, with extensions to curved mesh geometries to fully exploit the advantages of high-order schemes. Comparative analysis between the proposed one-sided third-order boundary scheme, third-order boundary scheme with ghost cells, and second-order boundary scheme demonstrates significant performance differences for the third-order compact GKS. Results indicate that lower-order boundary cell treatments yield substantially inferior results, while the proposed third-order treatment demonstrates superior performance, particularly on coarse grid configurations.</description>

      <title>Exponential Runge-Kutta methods of collocation type for parabolic equations with time-dependent delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the exponential Runge-Kutta methods of collocation type (ERKC) proposed in (Appl Numer Math 53:323-339, 2005) to semilinear parabolic problems with time-dependent delay. We construct two classes of the ERKC methods and analyze their convergence properties. It is shown that methods with $s$ arbitrary nonconfluent collocation parameters achieve convergence of order $s$. Provided that the collocation parameters fulfill some additional conditions and the solutions of the problems exhibit sufficient temporal and spatial smoothness, we derive superconvergence results of order $s + 1$ and $s+1+\beta$. Finally, some numerical experiments are presented to illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A linearly-implicit energy preserving scheme for geometrically nonlinear mechanics based on non-canonical Hamiltonian formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel formulation and numerical strategy for the simulation of geometrically nonlinear structures. First, a non-canonical Hamiltonian (Poisson) formulation is introduced by including the dynamics of the stress tensor. This framework is developed for von-K\'arm\'an nonlinearities in beams and plates, as well as finite strain elasticity with Saint-Venant material behavior. In the case of plates, both negligible and non-negligible membrane inertia are considered. For the former case the two-dimensional elasticity complex is leveraged to express the dynamics in terms of the Airy stress function. The finite element discretization employs a mixed approach, combining a conforming approximation for displacement and velocity fields with a discontinuous stress tensor representation. A staggered, linear implicit time integration scheme is proposed, establishing connections with existing explicit-implicit energy-preserving methods. The stress degrees of freedom are statically condensed, reducing the computational complexity to solving a system with a positive definite matrix. The methodology is validated through numerical experiments on the Duffing oscillator, a von-K\'arm\'an beam, and a column undergoing finite strain elasticity. Comparisons with fully implicit energy-preserving method and the explicit Newmark scheme demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior accuracy while maintaining energy stability. Additionally, it enables larger time steps compared to explicit schemes and exhibits computational efficiency comparable to the leapfrog method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the extendability of local solutions for incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes and 3D Euler problems, with initial data $\mathbf{u}_0$ in the Sobolev space $H^s (\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $s$ ensures the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. A geometric decomposition of the configuration space, identified by the orthogonality between the solution $\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure forces $\nabla p$, splits the problem into two simpler subproblems, which enable the uniform boundedness of the solution in each component of the partition, thereby ensuring the extendability of the solution.</description>

      <title>Code-Verification Techniques for an Arbitrary-Depth Electromagnetic Slot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer is an important topic in computational electromagnetics. To efficiently model this phenomenon, aperture or slot models are often used in conjunction with surface integral equations to solve Maxwell's equations. To establish the credibility of these models, code verification is necessary to assess the correctness of the implementation of the underlying numerical methods. However, many characteristics of surface integral equations and slot models render traditional code-verification approaches ineffective. In this paper, we present approaches to separately measure the different sources of numerical error arising from the method-of-moments implementation of the electric-field integral equation with an arbitrary-depth slot model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for several cases.</description>

      <title>Determinant Estimation under Memory Constraints and Neural Scaling Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calculating or accurately estimating log-determinants of large positive semi-definite matrices is of fundamental importance in many machine learning tasks. While its cubic computational complexity can already be prohibitive, in modern applications, even storing the matrices themselves can pose a memory bottleneck. To address this, we derive a novel hierarchical algorithm based on block-wise computation of the LDL decomposition for large-scale log-determinant calculation in memory-constrained settings. In extreme cases where matrices are highly ill-conditioned, accurately computing the full matrix itself may be infeasible. This is particularly relevant when considering kernel matrices at scale, including the empirical Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) of neural networks trained on large datasets. Under the assumption of neural scaling laws in the test error, we show that the ratio of pseudo-determinants satisfies a power-law relationship, allowing us to derive corresponding scaling laws. This enables accurate estimation of NTK log-determinants from a tiny fraction of the full dataset; in our experiments, this results in a $\sim$100,000$\times$ speedup with improved accuracy over competing approximations. Using these techniques, we successfully estimate log-determinants for dense matrices of extreme sizes, which were previously deemed intractable and inaccessible due to their enormous scale and computational demands.</description>

      <title>Structural Damping Identification Sensitivity in Flutter Speed Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting flutter remains a key challenge in aeroelastic research, with certain models relying on modal parameters, such as natural frequencies and damping ratios. These models are particularly useful in early design stages or for the development of small UAVs (maximum take-off mass below 7 kg). This study evaluates two frequency-domain system identification methods, Fast Relaxed Vector Fitting (FRVF) and the Loewner Framework (LF), for predicting the flutter onset speed of a flexible wing model. Both methods are applied to extract modal parameters from Ground Vibration Testing data, which are subsequently used to develop a reduced-order model with two degrees of freedom. Results indicate that FRVF and LFinformed models provide reliable flutter speed, with predictions deviating by no more than 3% (FRVF) and 5% (LF) from the N4SID-informed benchmark. The findings highlight the sensitivity of flutter speed predictions to damping ratio identification accuracy and demonstrate the potential of these methods as computationally efficient alternatives for preliminary aeroelastic assessments.</description>

      <title>First-order methods on bounded-rank tensors converging to stationary points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Provably finding stationary points on bounded-rank tensors turns out to be an open problem [E. Levin, J. Kileel, and N. Boumal, Math. Program., 199 (2023), pp. 831--864] due to the inherent non-smoothness of the set of bounded-rank tensors. We resolve this problem by proposing two first-order methods with guaranteed convergence to stationary points. Specifically, we revisit the variational geometry of bounded-rank tensors and explicitly characterize its normal cones. Moreover, we propose gradient-related approximate projection methods that are provable to find stationary points, where the decisive ingredients are gradient-related vectors from tangent cones, line search along approximate projections, and rank-decreasing mechanisms near rank-deficient points. Numerical experiments on tensor completion validate that the proposed methods converge to stationary points across various rank parameters.</description>

      <title>A Method for Establishing Asymptotically Accurate Bounds for Extremal Roots of Eulerian Polynomials Using Polynomial Stability Preservers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the tools to bound extreme roots of multivariate real zero polynomials globally. This is done through the use of a relaxation that approximates their rigidly convex sets. This relaxation can easily be constructed using the degree $3$ truncation of the polynomial and it produces in this way a spectrahedron whose computation is relatively easy and whose size is relatively small and depending solely on the number of variables of the polynomial. As we know that, in order to be able to produce in general spectrahedral representations of rigidly convex sets it is necessary to build matrices of very big size, we try, analyze and experiment with several constructions that could increase the size of these matrices. These constructions are based principally in two main approaches: adding information about higher degree monomials or non-trivially increasing the number of variables of the original polynomial. We explore these two construction first in a general setting and see that it is necessary to particularize to certain families of polynomials in order to make them work. In particular, we are able to prove that increasing the number of variables improves the behavior of the relaxation along the diagonal in the case of Eulerian polynomials. We see that applying the relaxation to multivariate Eulerian polynomials and then looking at the univariate polynomials injected in their diagonals produces an exponential asymptotic improvement in the bounds provided. We compare these bounds with other bounds that have appeared previously in the literature and refine these previous bounds in order to study how close do the bounds provided by the relaxation are to the actual roots of the univariate Eulerian polynomials.</description>

      <title>Transferable Foundation Models for Geometric Tasks on Point Cloud Representations: Geometric Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce methods for obtaining pretrained Geometric Neural Operators (GNPs) that can serve as basal foundation models for use in obtaining geometric features. These can be used within data processing pipelines for machine learning tasks and numerical methods. We show how our GNPs can be trained to learn robust latent representations for the differential geometry of point-clouds to provide estimates of metric, curvature, and other shape-related features. We demonstrate how our pre-trained GNPs can be used (i) to estimate the geometric properties of surfaces of arbitrary shape and topologies with robustness in the presence of noise, (ii) to approximate solutions of geometric partial differential equations (PDEs) on manifolds, and (iii) to solve equations for shape deformations such as curvature driven flows. We also release a package of the codes and weights for using our pre-trained GNPs for processing point cloud representations. This allows for incorporating our pre-trained GNPs as components for reuse within existing and new data processing pipelines. The GNPs also can be used as part of numerical solvers involving geometry or as part of methods for performing inference and other geometric tasks.</description>

      <title>Propagating Model Uncertainty through Filtering-based Probabilistic Numerical ODE Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtering-based probabilistic numerical solvers for ordinary differential equations (ODEs), also known as ODE filters, have been established as efficient methods for quantifying numerical uncertainty in the solution of ODEs. In practical applications, however, the underlying dynamical system often contains uncertain parameters, requiring the propagation of this model uncertainty to the ODE solution. In this paper, we demonstrate that ODE filters, despite their probabilistic nature, do not automatically solve this uncertainty propagation problem. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that combines ODE filters with numerical quadrature to properly marginalize over uncertain parameters, while accounting for both parameter uncertainty and numerical solver uncertainty. Experiments across multiple dynamical systems demonstrate that the resulting uncertainty estimates closely match reference solutions. Notably, we show how the numerical uncertainty from the ODE solver can help prevent overconfidence in the propagated uncertainty estimates, especially when using larger step sizes. Our results illustrate that probabilistic numerical methods can effectively quantify both numerical and parametric uncertainty in dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>A robust shifted proper orthogonal decomposition: Proximal methods for decomposing flows with multiple transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new methodology for decomposing flows with multiple transports that further extends the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (sPOD). The sPOD tries to approximate transport-dominated flows by a sum of co-moving data fields. The proposed methods stem from sPOD but optimize the co-moving fields directly and penalize their nuclear norm to promote low rank of the individual data in the decomposition. Furthermore, we add a robustness term to the decomposition that can deal with interpolation error and data noises. Leveraging tools from convex optimization, we derive three proximal algorithms to solve the decomposition problem. We report a numerical comparison with existing methods against synthetic data benchmarks and then show the separation ability of our methods on 1D and 2D incompressible and reactive flows. The resulting methodology is the basis of a new analysis paradigm that results in the same interpretability as the POD for the individual co-moving fields.</description>

      <title>M\"obius-Transformed Trapezoidal Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerical integration by combining the trapezoidal rule with a M\"obius transformation that maps the unit circle onto the real line. We prove that the resulting transformed trapezoidal rule attains the optimal rate of convergence if the integrand function lives in a weighted Sobolev space with a weight that is only assumed to be a positive Schwartz function decaying monotonically to zero close to infinity. Our algorithm only requires the ability to evaluate the weight at the selected nodes, and it does not require sampling from a probability measure defined by the weight nor information on its derivatives. In particular, we show that the M\"obius transformation, as a change of variables between the real line and the unit circle, sends a function in the weighted Sobolev space to a periodic Sobolev space with the same smoothness. Since there are various results available for integrating and approximating periodic functions, we also describe several extensions of the M\"obius-transformed trapezoidal rule, including function approximation via trigonometric interpolation, integration with randomized algorithms, and multivariate integration.</description>

      <title>Learning Hamiltonian Systems with Pseudo-symplectic Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20212v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduces a Pseudo-Symplectic Neural Network (PSNN) for learning general Hamiltonian systems (both separable and non-separable) from data. To address the limitations of existing structure-preserving methods (e.g., implicit symplectic integrators restricted to separable systems or explicit approximations requiring high computational costs), PSNN integrates an explicit pseudo-symplectic integrator as its dynamical core, achieving nearly exact symplecticity with minimal structural error. Additionally, the authors propose learnable Pad\'e-type activation functions based on Pad\'e approximation theory, which empirically outperform classical ReLU, Taylor-based activations, and PAU. By combining these innovations, PSNN demonstrates superior performance in learning and forecasting diverse Hamiltonian systems (e.g., modified pendulum, galactic dynamics), surpassing state-of-the-art models in accuracy, long-term stability, and energy preservation, while requiring shorter training time, fewer samples, and reduced parameters. This framework bridges the gap between computational efficiency and geometric structure preservation in Hamiltonian system modeling.</description>

      <title>Learning truly monotone operators with applications to nonlinear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a novel approach to learning monotone neural networks through a newly defined penalization loss. The proposed method is particularly effective in solving classes of variational problems, specifically monotone inclusion problems, commonly encountered in image processing tasks. The Forward-Backward-Forward (FBF) algorithm is employed to address these problems, offering a solution even when the Lipschitz constant of the neural network is unknown. Notably, the FBF algorithm provides convergence guarantees under the condition that the learned operator is monotone. Building on plug-and-play methodologies, our objective is to apply these newly learned operators to solving non-linear inverse problems. To achieve this, we initially formulate the problem as a variational inclusion problem. Subsequently, we train a monotone neural network to approximate an operator that may not inherently be monotone. Leveraging the FBF algorithm, we then show simulation examples where the non-linear inverse problem is successfully solved.</description>
