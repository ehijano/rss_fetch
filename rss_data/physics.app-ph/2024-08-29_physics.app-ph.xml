      <title>A small footprint travelling-wave parametric amplifier with a high Signal-to-Noise Ratio improvement in a wide band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise a small footprint travelling-wave parametric amplifier (TWPA). The TWPA is built with magnetically flux-tunable superconducting nonlinear asymmetric inductive elements (SNAILs) and parallel-plate capacitors. It implements three-wave mixing (3WM) with resonant phase matching (RPM), a small cutoff frequency for high gain per unitcell and impedance matching networks for large bandwidth impedance matching. The device has 200 unitcells and a physical footprint of only 1.1 mm^2, yet demonstrates an average parametric gain of 19 dB over a 3 GHz bandwidth, an average effective signal-to-noise ratio improvement of 10 dB and a clear speedup of qubit readout time.</description>

      <title>High-yield large-scale suspended graphene membranes over closed cavities for sensor applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suspended membranes of monoatomic graphene exhibit great potential for applications in electronic and nanoelectromechanical devices. In this work, a "hot and dry" transfer process is demonstrated to address the fabrication and patterning challenges of large-area graphene membranes on top of closed, sealed cavities. Here, "hot" refers to the use of high temperature during transfer, promoting the adhesion. Additionally, "dry" refers to the absence of liquids when graphene and target substrate are brought into contact. The method leads to higher yields of intact suspended monolayer CVD graphene and artificially stacked double-layer CVD graphene membranes than previously reported. The yield evaluation is performed using neural-network-based object detection in SEM images, ascertaining high yields of intact membranes with large statistical accuracy. The suspended membranes are examined by Raman tomography and AFM. The method is verified by applying the suspended graphene devices as piezoresistive pressure sensors. Our technology advances the application of suspended graphene membranes and can be extended to other two-dimensional (2D) materials.</description>

      <title>Textile hinges enable extreme properties of mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials -- structures with unusual properties that emerge from their internal architecture -- that are designed to undergo large deformations typically exploit large internal rotations, and therefore, necessitate the incorporation of flexible hinges. In the mechanism limit, these metamaterials consist of rigid bodies connected by ideal hinges that deform at zero energy cost. However, fabrication of structures in this limit has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the fabrication and integration of textile hinges provides a scalable platform for creating large structured metamaterials with mechanism-like behaviors. Further, leveraging recently introduced kinematic optimization tools, we demonstrate that textile hinges enable extreme shape-morphing responses, paving the way for the development of the next generation of mechanism-based metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Infrared thermal imaging camera to measure low temperature thermal fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To measure low-temperature thermal fields, we have developed a single-element cooled thermal imaging camera for a spectral range of 8{\div}14 {\mu}m with an internal shutter for radiometric calibration. To improve the accuracy of measuring the temperature of cold objects, we used a shutter with a combined emissivity as an internal reference source of radiation at the input of the device optical unit. With this aim a small mirror was fixed in the center on its surface covered black, thereby ensuring an efficient reflection of radiation in a wide spectral range of wavelengths. When processing the signal for each pixel of the thermal image, the differential value of the detector response to the shutter blackened and mirror areas was used as a reference. A relative measurement error of 3 percent was obtained for the studied objects with a temperature of -150 {\deg}C. The device was successfully used for remote study of thermal field dynamics during freeze-thawing of biological tissues in vivo.</description>

      <title>Highly Sensitive Differential Microwave Sensor Using Enhanced Spiral Resonators for Precision Permittivity Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a highly sensitive microwave sensor for dielectric sensing. One of the main disadvantages of microwave resonant-based sensors is cross-sensitivity originated by time-dependent uncontrolled environmental factors such as temperature that affect the material under test (MUT) behavior, leading to undesirable frequency shifts and, hence, lower accuracy. However, this work eliminates the unwanted errors using the differential measurement technique by comparing two transmission resonance frequencies during a unit test setup to measure the permittivity of MUT over time. The proposed structure comprises a spiral resonator with an extended horizontal microstrip line (EH-ML) coupled to a microstrip transmission line (MTL). Creating EH-ML within the structure comprises two primary contributions: enhanced sensitivity resulting from stronger fringing fields generated by increasing the effective area and improved resolution due to higher resonance frequencies caused by a lower total capacitive coupling effect. The proposed sensor is fabricated and tested using MUTs with a permittivity of less than 80 to verify the performance. In this regard, a frequency detection resolution (FDR) of 44MHz and a sensitivity of 0.85% are achieved at a maximum permittivity of 78.3. The results of theoretical analysis, simulation, and measurement are in relatively good agreement. Consequently, the proposed highly sensitive microwave sensor offers significant advantages, such as low complexity in design and fabrication. It also offers high resolution and precision in a wide range of permittivity, which can be an attractive candidate for dielectric sensing in health, chemical and agriculture applications.</description>

      <title>Anchor-Controlled Generative Adversarial Network for High-Fidelity Electromagnetic and Structurally Diverse Metasurface Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optoelectronics, designing free-form metasurfaces presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving high electromagnetic response fidelity due to the complex relationship between physical structures and electromagnetic behaviors. A key difficulty arises from the one-to-many mapping dilemma, where multiple distinct physical structures can yield similar electromagnetic responses, complicating the design process. This paper introduces a novel generative framework, the Anchor-controlled Generative Adversarial Network (AcGAN), which prioritizes electromagnetic fidelity while effectively navigating the one-to-many challenge to create structurally diverse metasurfaces. Unlike existing methods that mainly replicate physical appearances, AcGAN excels in generating a variety of structures that, despite their differences in physical attributes, exhibit similar electromagnetic responses, thereby accommodating fabrication constraints and tolerances. We introduce the Spectral Overlap Coefficient (SOC) as a precise metric to measure the spectral fidelity between generated designs and their targets. Additionally, a cluster-guided controller refines input processing, ensuring multi-level spectral integration and enhancing electromagnetic fidelity. The integration of AnchorNet into our loss function facilitates a nuanced assessment of electromagnetic qualities, supported by a dynamic loss weighting strategy that optimizes spectral alignment. Collectively, these innovations represent a transformative stride in metasurface inverse design, advancing electromagnetic response-oriented engineering and overcoming the complexities of the one-to-many mapping dilemma.Empirical evidence underscores AcGAN's effectiveness in streamlining the design process, achieving superior electromagnetic precision, and fostering a broad spectrum of design possibilities.</description>

      <title>Simulating the electrostatic patch force in sphere-plate and plate-plate geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Potential patches are responsible for a force between closely-spaced objects that forms a parasitic contribution to sensitive force measurements. Existing analytical models cannot account for the patch force in the 3D geometries of real experiments. Here, we present a finite-element method model to evaluate the impact of patches in arbitrary geometries. First, we test our model against the plate-plate and sphere-plate geometries, for which the exact solutions are known. Then, we apply it to the analytically unwieldy case of plate-concave plate that is relevant for Casimir force measurements. This work provides a reliable estimation of the parasitic contribution from random potential patches.</description>

      <title>A Bi-polar Current Source with High Short-term Stability for Tsinghua Tabletop Kibble Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-precision current source, capable of supporting weighing measurements with a relative uncertainty at the $10^{-9}$ level, is essential for Kibble balance experiments. However, most current sources utilized in Kibble balances to date are homemade and not commercially available. In this paper, we introduce a digital-feedback, two-stage current source designed for the Tsinghua tabletop Kibble balance, relying solely on commercially available sources and voltmeters. A high-resolution, small-range current source is employed to digitally compensate for current output fluctuations from a large-range current source. Experimental tests show the proposal can offer an easy realization of a current source with nA/A stability to support Kibble balance measurements.</description>

      <title>Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy in a Transmission Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent spin resonance methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy have led to spectrally highly sensitive, non-invasive quantum imaging techniques with groundbreaking applications in fields such as medicine, biology, and physics. Meanwhile, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers detailed investigations with sub-atomic resolution, but often inflicts significant radiation damage. Here we exploit synergies and report on an integration of ESR spectroscopy in a TEM. Our miniaturized ESR setup on a standard TEM sample holder leverages the strong magnetic field of the TEM polepiece to align and energetically separate spin states. This integration will facilitate in-situ studies of spin systems and their dynamics, quantum materials, radicals, electrochemical reactions, and radiation damage - properties previously mainly invisible to electron microscopic tools. Moreover, this development marks a significant technological advancement toward microwave-controlled quantum spin studies with a highly controlled electron probe at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Reconciling Kubo and Keldysh Approaches to Fermi-Sea-Dependent Nonequilibrium Observables: Application to Spin Hall Current and Spin-Orbit Torque in Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum transport studies of spin-dependent phenomena in solids commonly employ the Kubo or Keldysh formulas for the steady-state density matrix in the linear-response regime. Its trace with operators of interest -- such as, spin density, spin current density or spin torque -- gives expectation values of experimentally accessible observables. For such local quantities, these formulas require summing over the manifolds of {\em both} Fermi-surface and Fermi-sea quantum states. However, debates have been raging in the literature about vastly different physics the two formulations can apparently produce, even when applied to the same system. Here, we revisit this problem using a testbed of infinite-size graphene with proximity-induced spin-orbit and magnetic exchange effects. By splitting this system into semi-infinite leads and central active region, in the spirit of Landauer two-terminal setup for quantum transport, we prove the {\em numerically exact equivalence} of the Kubo and Keldysh approaches via the computation of spin Hall current density and spin-orbit torque in both clean and disordered limits. The key to reconciling the two approaches are the numerical frameworks we develop for: ({\em i}) evaluation of Kubo(-Bastin) formula for a system attached to semi-infinite leads, which ensure continuous energy spectrum and evade the need for phenomenological broadening in prior calculations; and ({\em ii}) proper evaluation of Fermi-sea term in the Keldysh approach, which {\em must} include the voltage drop across the central active region even if it is disorder free.</description>

      <title>Multifaceted nature of defect tolerance in halide perovskites and emerging semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskites (LHPs) have shot to prominence as efficient energy conversion materials that can be processed using cost-effective fabrication methods. A widely-quoted reason for their exceptional performance is their ability to tolerate defects, enabling long charge-carrier lifetimes despite high defect densities. Realizing defect tolerance in broader classes of materials would have a substantial impact on the semiconductor industry. Significant effort has been made over the past decade to unravel the underlying origins of defect tolerance to design stable alternatives to LHPs comprised of nontoxic elements. However, it has become clear that understanding defect tolerance in LHPs is far from straightforward. This review discusses the models proposed for defect tolerance in halide perovskites, evaluating the experimental and theoretical support for these models, as well as their limitations. We cover attempts to apply these models to identify materials beyond the lead-halide system that could also exhibit defect tolerance, and the successes and pitfalls encountered over the past decade. Finally, a discussion is made of some of the important missing pieces of information required for a deeper understanding and predictive models that enable the inverse design of defect tolerant semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin natural biotite crystals as a dielectric layer for van der Waals heterostructure applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biotite, an iron-rich mineral belonging to the trioctahedral mica group, is a naturally abundant layered material (LM) exhibiting attractive electronic properties for application in nanodevices. Biotite stands out as a non-degradable LM under ambient conditions, featuring high-quality basal cleavage, a significant advantage for van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH) applications. In this work, we present the micro-mechanical exfoliation of biotite down to monolayers (1Ls), yielding ultrathin flakes with large areas and atomically flat surfaces. To identify and characterize the mineral, we conducted a multi-elemental analysis of biotite using energy-dispersive spectroscopy mapping. Additionally, synchrotron infrared nano-spectroscopy was employed to probe its vibrational signature in few-layer form, with sensitivity to the layer number. We have also observed good morphological and structural stability in time (up to 12 months) and no important changes in their physical properties after thermal annealing processes in ultrathin biotite flakes. Conductive atomic force microscopy evaluated its electrical capacity, revealing an electrical breakdown strength of approximately 1 V/nm. Finally, we explore the use of biotite as a substrate and encapsulating LM in vdWH applications. We have performed optical and magneto-optical measurements at low temperatures. We find that ultrathin biotite flakes work as a good substrate for 1L-MoSe2, comparable to hexagonal boron nitride flakes, but it induces a small change of the 1L-MoSe2 g-factor values, most likely due to natural impurities on its crystal structure. Furthermore, our results show that biotite flakes are useful systems to protect sensitive LMs such as black phosphorus from degradation for up to 60 days in ambient air. Our study introduces biotite as a promising, cost-effective LM for the advancement of future ultrathin nanotechnologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced material composite of nanocarbons and metal-based materials provides a synergistic effect to obtain excellent electrochemical charge-storage performance and other properties. Herein, 3D porous carbon-metal oxynitride nanocomposites with tunable carbon/metal and oxygen/nitrogen ratio are synthesized uniquely by simultaneous ablation from two different targets by single-step pulsed laser deposition at room temperature. Co-ablation of titanium and vanadium nitride targets together with graphite allowed us to synthesize carbon-metal oxynitride porous nanocomposite and exploit them as a binder-free thin film supercapacitor electrode in aqueous electrolyte. We show that the elemental composition ratio and hence the structural properties can be tuned by selecting target configuration and by manipulating the ablation position. We investigate how this tuning capability impacts their charge-storage performances. We anticipate the utilization of as-synthesized various composites in a single PLD production run as next-generation active materials for flexible energy storage and optoelectronic applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a semianalytical synthesis scheme for designing realistic printed-circuit-board- (PCB) based metagratings (MGs), capable of simultaneous beam steering and polarization conversion. These low-profile structures, comprised of sparse periodic arrangements of subwavelength polarizable particles (meta-atoms), oriented by insightful analytical models leading to fabrication-ready designs, have gained growing interest in recent years, demonstrating exceptional diffraction engineering capabilities with very high efficiencies. Herein, to facilitate cross-polarization coupling, we introduce a tilted dogbone meta-atom, going beyond the popular vertical (loaded wire) or recently proposed horizontal (dipole) configurations used in common PCB MG manifestations at microwaves, strictly susceptible to either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) fields, respectively. As shown, the anisotropy introduced by the in-plane rotation of the dogbones, integrated into the MG analytical model in the form of a rotated dipole line, serves as an additional degree of freedom that can be leveraged to nonlocally manipulate the polarization and trajectory of the incident fields. Verified experimentally, the resultant semianalytical synthesis framework enables valuable physical insights, opening the door to integration of efficient anisotropic MGs in applications requiring both polarization and wavefront control, such as satellite, radar and advanced antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling the dispersion of longitudinal waves via the affine deformation of the interlaced wire medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.01968v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the dispersion properties of double interlaced wire metamaterials with geometry modified by affine transformation. That metamaterials were found to support eigenmodes with longitudinal polarization at low frequencies for all deformations. Due to the spatial dispersion the metamaterials isofrequency surfaces are centered at the Brillouin zone edges (rather than at $\Gamma$-point) and have the shape of ellipsoids. The refractive indices corresponding to the ellipsoids were analyzed both analytically and numerically.</description>

      <title>Roadmap for Animate Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humanity has long sought inspiration from nature to innovate materials and devices. As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of our lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability, and autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological materials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing rapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap presents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different disciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and potential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and the built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address shared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability, interdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations. The framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy can guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible development. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its principles, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world in a more sustainable manner.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Predictions with Foundation Atomistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00755v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have led to the development of foundation models for atomistic materials chemistry, enabling quantum-accurate descriptions of interatomic forces across diverse compounds at reduced computational cost. Hitherto, these models have been benchmarked mostly on harmonic phonons, and their accuracy and efficiency in predicting complex, technologically relevant anharmonic heat-conduction properties remains unknown. Here, we introduce a framework that leverages foundation models and the Wigner formulation of heat transport to overcome the major bottlenecks of current techniques for designing heat-management materials, such as high cost, limited transferability, or lack of physics awareness. We present the standards needed to achieve first-principles accuracy in conductivity predictions through foundational model fine-tuning, introducing suitable benchmark metrics and discussing the precision/cost trade-off. We apply our framework to a database of solids with diverse compositions and structures, demonstrating its potential to discover materials for next-gen technologies ranging from thermal insulation to neuromorphic computing.</description>
