      <title>Cartesian Nodal Lines and Magnetic Kramers Weyl Nodes in Spin-Split Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When band degeneracy occurs in a spin-split band structure, it gives rise to divergent Berry curvature and distinctive topological boundary states, resulting in a variety of fascinating effects. We show that three-dimensional spin-split antiferromagnets, characterized by symmetry-constrained momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization, can host two unique forms of symmetry-protected band degeneracy: Cartesian nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, and magnetic Kramers Weyl nodes when spin-orbit coupling is present. Remarkably, these band degeneracies not only produce unique patterns of Berry-curvature distributions but also give rise to topological boundary states with unconventional spin textures. Furthermore, we find that these band degeneracies can lead to strong or even quantized anomalous Hall effects and quantized circular photogalvanic effects under appropriate conditions. Our study suggests that spin-split antiferromagnets provide a fertile ground for exploring unconventional topological phases.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous mass inversion enriched quantum anomalous Hall states in multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, multilayer graphene systems have attracted significant attention due to the discovery of a variety of intriguing phases, particularly quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. In rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, both $C = -5$ and $C = -3$ QAH states have been observed. While the $C = -5$ QAH state is well understood, the origin of the $C = -3$ QAH state remains unclear. In this letter, we propose that the $C = -3$ QAH state in rhombohedral pentalayer graphene (RPG) arises from an asynchronous mass inversion mechanism, driven by the interplay between trigonal warping and staggered layer order under an applied displacement field. Trigonal warping splits the low-energy bands into a central touching point and three "leg" Dirac cones. In the presence of staggered layer order, this splitting enables mass inversions driven by the displacement field to occur asynchronously at the central touching point and the "leg" Dirac cones, potentially leading to the formation of the $C = -3$ QAH state. Furthermore, this mechanism can also be applied to Bernal multilayer graphene systems, predicting the existence of additional QAH states beyond $C = \pm N, \pm 2N$ for $N$-layer graphene.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Electrical Properties of Selectively Grown In-Plane InAs Nanowires using InGaAs Buffer and Capping Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-plane semiconductor nanowires with complex branched geometries, prepared via selective area growth (SAG), offer a versatile platform for advanced electronics, optoelectronics, and quantum devices. However, defects and disorder at the interfaces and top surfaces of the nanowires can significantly degrade their electrical properties. One effective method to mitigate these issues is the incorporation of buffer and capping layers. In this work, we achieved a wider growth selectivity window of InGaAs in the presence of atomic hydrogen (H) and employed it as buffer and capping layers for SAG InAs nanowires to enhance their electrical properties. Hall measurements on InAs nanowires, with and without InGaAs buffer and/or capping layers, revealed that incorporating closely lattice-matched InGaAs buffer and capping layers to InAs nanowires nearly tripled the electron mobility and doubled the phase coherence length compared to nanowires without these layers. These findings demonstrate that the use of InGaAs buffer and capping layers is a crucial strategy for significantly enhancing the quality of InAs nanowires, unlocking their full potential for high performance electronics and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Transparent Graphene-Superconductor Interfaces: Quantum Hall and Zero Field Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study clean, edge-contacted graphene/superconductor interfaces in both the quantum Hall (QH) and zero field regimes. We find that Andreev reflection is substantially stronger than at an interface with a semiconductor two-dimensional electron gas: the large velocity at graphene's conical Dirac points makes the requirement of current continuity to a metal much less restrictive. In both our tight-binding and continuum models, we find a wide range of parameters for which Andreev reflection is strong. For a transparent interface, we demonstrate the following for graphene in the lowest Landau level QH state: (i) Excellent electron-hole hybridization occurs: the electron and hole components in graphene are simply related by an exchange of sublattice. The spatial profile for the electron component is predominantly gaussian on one sublattice and peaked at the interface, and so very different from the QH edge state of a terminated lattice. (ii) The degree of hybridization is independent of the graphene filling: no fine-tuning is needed. (iii) The spectrum is valley degenerate: the dispersion of each chiral Andreev edge mode (CAEM) self-aligns to be antisymmetric about the center of each valley, independent of filling. Achieving a transparent interface requires the absence of any barrier as well as a superconductor that is suitably matched to graphene; we argue that the latter condition is not very stringent. We further consider the effect of reduced transparency and Zeeman splitting on both the wavefunctions of the CAEM and their dispersion.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of temperature of quantum anomalous Hall effect in two-dimensional germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) is significant for future low-power electronics devices, where a main challenge is realizing QAHE at high temperatures. In this work, based on experimentally reported two-dimensional (2D) germanene and magnetic semiconductors Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ and Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$, and the first principle calculations, germanene/magnetic semiconductor heterostructures are investigated. Topologically nontrivial edge states and quantized anomalous Hall conductance are demonstrated. It is shown that the QAHE temperature can be enhanced to approximately 62 K in germanene/monolayer (ML) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 2.1\% tensile strain, 64 K in germanene/bilayer (BL) Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.4\% tensile strain, and 50 K in germanene/ML Cr$_2$Si$_2$Te$_6$ with 1.3\% tensile strain. With increasing tensile strain of these heterostructures, the band gap decreases and the Curie temperature rises, and the highest temperature of QAHE is obtained. Since these 2D materials were discovered in recent experiments, our results provide promising materials for achieving high-temperature QAHE.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling of three-dimensional Chern insulators: gauge-discontinuity formalism and adiabatic pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric (OME) coupling is usually the hallmark of nontrivial band topology in three-dimensional (3D) crystalline insulators. However, if a 3D insulator exhibits nonzero Chern number within any two-dimensional plane of the Brillouin zone, then traditionally the Chern-Simons coupling becomes ill defined for such 3D Chern insulators due to topological obstructions. In this work, by employing a ``gauge-discontinuity" formalism, we resolve this long-standing issue and rigorously derive a quantized layer-resolved OME response in 3D Chern insulators. We demonstrate that the difference of the layer-resolved OME coupling between adjacent layers is universally quantized in unit of $-C e^2/h$, where $C$ is the Chern number. This quantization arises from an anomalous contribution to the Chern-Simons OME coupling, which is closely associated with the Berry curvature of the occupied bands and the hybrid Wannier centers along the direction of the Chern vector $(0,0, C)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomalous Chern-Simons coupling can be transported by an exact integer quantum from one unit cell to its neighboring cell through an adiabatic cyclic pumping process, accompanied by a quantized displacement of Wannier center along the direction of the Chern vector. Our work provides a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators and opens avenues for designing topological quantum phenomena in layered systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional higher-order Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical scheme to realize two-dimensional higher-order Weyl semimetals using a trilayer topological insulator film coupled with a d-wave altermagnet. Our results show that the trilayer topological insulator exhibits two-dimensional Weyl semimetal characteristics with helical edge states. Notably, the Weyl points are located at four high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone, and the topology of symmetric subspaces governs the formation of these Weyl points and edge states. Upon introducing a d-wave altermagnet oriented along the z-direction, gaps open in the helical edge states while preserving two Weyl points, leading to the realization of two-dimensional higher-order Weyl semimetals hosting topological corner states. The nonzero winding number in the subspace along the high-symmetry line serves as a topological invariant characterizing these corner states, and the other subspace Hamiltonian confirms the existence of the Weyl points. Finally, a topological phase diagram provides a complete topological description of the system.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin Hall effect in bilayer honeycomb lattices with C-type antiferromagnetic order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to realize time-reversal symmetry-broken quantum spin Hall insulators using bilayer honeycomb lattices, combining intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, C-type antiferromagnetic ordering, and staggered potentials. The C-type antiferromagnetic order emerges from the interplay between intralayer antiferromagnetism and interlayer ferromagnetism. The system's topological properties are characterized by the spin Chern number. We present the topological phase diagram of the bilayer honeycomb lattice, providing a detailed insight into the stability and tunability of the quantum spin Hall effect in this system. The presence of helical edge states is confirmed by the measurement of quantized longitudinal resistance values of 3/2(h/e2) and 1/2(h/e2) in a sixterminal Hall-bar device. Remarkably, this quantum spin Hall insulator phase is protected by interlayer parity-time (PT) symmetry, despite the breaking of time-reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Anatomy of Spin Wave Polarization in Ferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin waves in ferromagnetic materials are predominantly characterized by right-handed circular polarization due to symmetry breaking induced by net magnetization. However, magnetic interactions, including the external magnetic field, Heisenberg exchange, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and dipole-dipole interaction, can modify this behavior, leading to elliptical polarization. This study provides a systematic analysis of these interactions and their influence on spin wave polarization, establishing principles to predict traits such as polarization degree and orientation based on equilibrium magnetization textures. The framework is applied to diverse magnetic configurations, including spin spirals, domain walls, and Skyrmions, offering a comprehensive yet simple approach to understanding polarization dynamics in ferromagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Silicon oxide nanoparticles grown on graphite by codeposition of the atomic constituents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale silicate dust particles are the most abundant refractory component observed in the interstellar medium and thought to play a key role in catalysing the formation of complex organic molecules in the star forming regions of space. We present a method to synthesise a laboratory analogue of nanoscale silicate dust particles on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) substrates by co-deposition of the atomic constituents. The resulting nanoparticulate films are sufficiently thin and conducting to allow for surface science investigations, and are characterised here, in situ under UHV, using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, near-edge X-ray absorption atomic fine spectroscopy and scanning tunnelling microscopy, and, ex situ, using scanning electron microscopy. We compare SiO$_{x}$ film growth with and without the use of atomic O beams during synthesis and conclude that exposure of the sample to atomic O leads to homogeneous films of interconnected nanoparticle networks. The networks covers the graphite substrate and demonstrate superior thermal stability, up to 1073 K, when compared to oxides produced without exposure to atomic O. In addition, control over the flux of atomic O during growth allows for control of the average oxidation state of the film produced. Photoelectron spectroscopy measurements demonstrate that fully oxidised films have an SiO$_{2}$ stoichiometry very close to bulk SiO$_{2}$ and scanning tunnelling microscopy images show the basic cluster building unit to have a radius of approximately 2.5 nm. The synthesis of SiO$_{x}$ films with adjustable stoichiometry and suitable for surface science experiments that require conducting substrates will be of great interest to the astrochemistry community, and will allow for nanoscale-investigation of the chemical processes thought to be catalysed at the surface of dust grains in space.</description>

      <title>Restriction of macroscopic structural superlubricity due to structure relaxation by the example of twisted graphene bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of structure relaxation on the potential energy surface (PES) of interlayer interaction of twisted graphene bilayer is studied for a set of commensurate moir\'e systems using the registry-dependent empirical potential of Kolmogorov and Crespi. It is found that the influence of structure relaxation on the amplitude of PES corrugations (determining static friction) depends on the unit cell size (or related twist angle) of the moir\'e system. For moir\'e systems with the smallest unit cells, the amplitudes of PES corrugations calculated with and without account of structure relaxation are approximately the same. However, for large unit cell sizes, the structure relaxation can lead to an increase of PES corrugations by orders of magnitude. This means that structure relaxation can provide the main contribution into the static friction of a superlubric system under certain conditions (such as the contact size and twist angle). Moreover, the change of the PES type because of structure relaxation from a trigonal lattice of maxima to a trigonal lattice of minima is observed for the systems with the moir\'e patterns (5,1) and (5,3). Based on the results obtained, possible crossovers between static friction modes taking place upon changing the twist angle in a macroscopic superlubric system consisting of identical layers are discussed. Additionally it is shown that the PES for relaxed structures can still be approximated by the first Fourier harmonics compatible with symmetries of twisted layers analogously to the PES for rigid layers.</description>

      <title>On determining the energy dispersion of spin excitations with scanning tunneling spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional methods to measure the dispersion relations of collective spin excitations involve probing bulk samples with particles such as neutrons, photons or electrons, which carry a well-defined momentum. Open-ended finite-size spin chains, on the contrary, do not have a well-defined momentum due to the lack of translation symmetry, and their spin excitations are measured with an eminently local probe, using inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM). Here we discuss under what conditions STM-IETS spectra can be Fourier-transformed to yield dispersion relations in these systems. We relate the success of this approach to the degree to which spin excitations form standing waves. We show that STM-IETS can reveal the energy dispersion of magnons in ferromagnets and triplons in valence bond crystals, but not that of spinons, the spin excitations in Heisenberg spin-1/2 chains. We compare our theoretical predictions with state-of-the-art measurements on nanographene chains that realize the relevant spin Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Transmission Probability in Double Quantum Well with Triple Barrier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum well of AlGaAs/GaAs is very important to study transport properties of electrons due to its wider application in electronic devices. Hence, the double well of AlGaAs/GaAs with triple barrier is taken to study transmission probability. Transmission probability is found to decrease with the increase in the height and width of the barrier. Transmission probability with energy of electron shows two peaks while taking all three barrier of the same height. Whereas a single and higher value of peak is found when the height of the central barrier is slightly reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berry curvature of phonons is an active subject of research in condensed matter physics. Here, we present a model in which phonons acquire a Berry curvature through their coupling to electrons in crystals with time-reversal symmetry. We illustrate this effect for BaMnSb$_2$, a quasi two-dimensional Dirac insulator, whose low-energy massive Dirac fermions generate a phonon Berry curvature that is proportional to the electronic valley Chern number.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum transport in micrometer-sized single crystals of Bi$_4$Br$_4$, a material predicted to be a second-order topological insulator. 1D topological states with long phase coherence times are revealed via the modulation of quantum interferences with magnetic field and gate voltage. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of Aharanov-Bohm interference between 1D ballistic states several micrometers long, that we identify as phase-coherent hinge modes on neighbouring step edges at the crystal surface. These Aharanov-Bohm interferences are made possible by a disordered phase-coherent contact region, the existence of which is confirmed by STEM/EDX imaging of FIB lamellae. Their coherent nature modulates the transmission of the 1D edge states, leading to weak antilocalization and universal conductance fluctuations with surprisingly large characteristic fields and a strongly anisotropic behavior. These complementary experimental results provide a comprehensive, coherent description of quantum transport in Bi$_4$Br$_4$, and establishes the material as belonging to the class of second-order topological insulators with topologically protected 1D ballistic states.</description>

      <title>State- and momentum-dependent nonlinear Stark effect of interlayer excitons in bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interlayer excitons in van der Waals heterostructures offer rich collective phases, prospective optoelectronic applications, and versatile tunability, where control by electronic means is particularly relevant and practical. Here, in the case of bilayer WSe$_2$, we reveal how layer localization of excitons governs their response to an external electric field. Using Many-Body Perturbation Theory, we calculate the exciton dispersion for different stacking symmetries under applied electric field and/or strain, in order to map the landscape of competing low-energy excitons in four distinct finite-momentum valleys. While intralayer excitons are not affected by the electric field, some interlayer ones exhibit a nonlinear Stark shift that becomes linear after a critical threshold. The degree of nonlinearity is a direct measure of the layer hybridization of the electronic subcomponents of the exciton. Our findings explain the peculiar Stark-shift regimes observed in recent experiments, the nature of (anti)symmetric spectral shifts around zero field, and the sensitivity of dipolar excitons to external perturbations, all highly relevant to their further applications in excitonic condensates, optoelectronics devices and quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Symmetries at the Anderson transition of correlated two-dimensional electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between Anderson localization and Coulomb repulsion reveals deep connections to superconductivity and many-body localization in quantum systems. In this study, we investigate a tin monolayer on silicon, a material known for its Mott and antiferromagnetic behavior, as it undergoes a metal-insulator transition near a band edge. By analyzing spatial correlations of the local density of states (LDOS) with scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we precisely identify the mobility edge and determine its critical exponent as nu = 0.75 +/- 0.1. Our findings show that both LDOS distribution functions and multifractal spectra obey two exact symmetry relations based on the Weyl group symmetry of nonlinear sigma-models. These symmetries hold across the entire transition, from extended to strongly localized states, in agreement with theoretical predictions. Additionally, we observe a power-law scaling of LDOS fluctuations close to the band edge (power -1.7), deep in the localized regime. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate that breaking time-reversal symmetry significantly improves the agreement between our experimental data and theory compared to the standard Anderson model. Overall, our results provide a unifying framework for understanding localization at the band gap edge of a strongly correlated 2D material and show how localization patterns reflect the symmetry class of disordered electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Cove-edged Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons with Chirality-Dependent Bandgap and Carrier Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have garnered significant interest due to their highly customizable physicochemical properties and potential utility in nanoelectronics. Besides controlling widths and edge structures, the inclusion of chirality in GNRs brings another dimension for fine-tuning their optoelectronic properties, but related studies remain elusive owing to the absence of feasible synthetic strategies. Here, we demonstrate a novel class of cove-edged chiral GNRs (CcGNRs) with a tunable chiral vector (n,m). Notably, the bandgap and effective mass of (n,2)- CcGNR show a distinct positive correlation with the increasing value of n, as indicated by theory. Within this GNR family, two representative members, namely, (4,2)- CcGNR and (6,2)-CcGNR, are successfully synthesized. Both CcGNRs exhibit prominently curved geometries arising from the incorporated [4]helicene motifs along their peripheries, as also evidenced by the single-crystal structures of the two respective model compounds (1 and 2). The chemical identities and optoelectronic properties of (4,2)- and (6,2)-CcGNRs are comprehensively investigated via a combination of IR, Raman, solid-state NMR, UV-vis, and THz spectroscopies as well as theoretical calculations. In line with theoretical expectation, the obtained (6,2)-CcGNR possesses a low optical bandgap of 1.37 eV along with charge carrier mobility of 8 cm2/Vs, whereas (4,2)-CcGNR exhibits a narrower bandgap of 1.26 eV with increased mobility of 14 cm2/Vs. This work opens up a new avenue to precisely engineer the bandgap and carrier mobility of GNRs by manipulating their chiral vector.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Transients in Motility-Induced Phase Separation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate normal diffusion in a two-dimensional athermal suspension of active particles undergoing motility-induced phase separation. The particles are modeled as achiral Janus disks with fixed self-propulsion speed and weakly fluctuating orientation. When plotted versus the overall suspension packing fraction, the relevant diffusion constant traces a hysteresis loop with sharp jumps in correspondence with the binodal and spinodal of the gaseous phase. No hysteresis loop is observed between the spinodal and binodal of the dense phase, as they appear to overlap. Moreover, even under steady-state phase separation, the particle displacement distributions exhibit non-Gaussian normal diffusion with transient fat (thin) tails in the presence (absence) of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Giant Uncompensated Magnon Spin Currents in X-type Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnon spin currents in insulating magnets are useful for low-power spintronics. However, in magnets stacked by antiferromagnetic (AFM) exchange coupling, which have recently aroused significant interest for potential applications in spintronics, these currents are largely counteracted by opposite magnetic sublattices, thus suppressing their net effect. Contrary to this common observation, here, we show that magnets with X-type AFM stacking, where opposite magnetic sublattices form orthogonal intersecting chains, support giant magnon spin currents with minimal compensation. Our model Hamiltonian calculations predict magnetic chain locking of magnon spin currents in these X-type magnets, significantly reducing their compensation ratio. In addition, the one-dimensional nature of the chain-like magnetic sublattices enhances magnon spin conductivities surpassing those of two-dimensional ferromagnets and canonical altermagnets. Notably, uncompensated X-type magnets, such as odd-layer antiferromagnets and ferrimagnets, can exhibit magnon spin currents polarized opposite to those expected by their net magnetization. These unprecedented properties of X-type magnets, combined with their inherent advantages resulting from AFM coupling, offer a promising new path for low-power high-performance spintronics.</description>

      <title>Models of liquid samples confinement for nanoscale NMR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion is a prominent source of noise affecting nuclear magnetic resonance at the nanometer scale (nano-NMR), preventing high resolution studies of unpolarized liquid samples. Actively managing diffusion noise through, for example, sample confinement, is likely to unveil alternative noise sources which so far have been disregarded, as they occur in longer time-scales and are, consequently, masked by diffusion. These secondary noise sources could diminish the advantages provided by sample confinement but, on the other hand, they can provide with valuable information about the behavior of the sample and its interactions. In this article, we study for the first time and in detail two noise models for confined nano-NMR, namely, surface interactions and porosity, and discuss their implications for typical nano-NMR experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance in two-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing the ideal limit of interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) in two-dimensional (2D) heterointerfaces is of paramount importance for assessing heat dissipation in 2D-based nanoelectronics. Using graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (Gr/$h$-BN), a structurally isomorphous heterostructure with minimal mass contrast, as a prototype, we develop an accurate yet highly efficient machine-learned potential (MLP) model, which drives nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations on a realistically large system with over 300,000 atoms, enabling us to report the ideal limit range of ITC for 2D heterostructures at room temperature. We further unveil an intriguing stacking-sequence-dependent ITC hierarchy in the Gr/$h$-BN heterostructure, which can be connected to moir\'e patterns and is likely universal in van der Waals layered materials. The underlying atomic-level mechanisms can be succinctly summarized as energy-favorable stacking sequences facilitating out-of-plane phonon energy transmission. This work demonstrates that MLP-driven MD simulations can serve as a new paradigm for probing and understanding thermal transport mechanisms in 2D heterostructures and other layered materials.</description>

      <title>Heavy Fermions as an Efficient Representation of Atomistic Strain and Relaxation in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although the strongly interacting flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have been approached using the minimal Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) Hamiltonian, there is mounting evidence that strain and lattice relaxation are essential in correctly determining the order of the correlated insulator groundstates. These effects can be incorporated in an enhanced continuum model by introducing additional terms computed from the relaxation profile. To develop an analytical and physical understanding of these effects, we include strain and relaxation in the topological heavy fermion (HF) model of TBG. We find that strain and relaxation are very well captured in first order perturbation theory by projection onto the fully symmetric HF Hilbert space, and remarkably do not alter the interacting terms in the periodic Anderson model. Their effects are fully incorporated in the single-particle HF Hamiltonian, and can be reproduced in a minimal model with only 4 symmetry-breaking terms. Our results demonstrate that the heavy fermion framework of TBG is an efficient and robust representation of the perturbations encountered in experiment.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of Green's functions in disordered non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The competition between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization leads to various intriguing phenomena concerning spectrums and wavefunctions. Here, we study the linear response of disordered non-Hermitian systems, which is precisely described by the Green's function. We show that the average maximum value of matrix elements of Green's functions, which quantifies the maximal response against an external perturbation, exhibits different phases characterized by different scaling behaviors with respect to the system size. Whereas the exponential-growth phase is also seen in the translation-invariant systems, the algebraic-growth phase is unique to disordered non-Hermitian systems. We explain the numerical findings using the large deviation theory, which provides analytical insights into the algebraic scaling factors of non-Hermitian disordered Green's functions. Furthermore, we show that these scaling behaviors can be observed in the steady states of disordered open quantum systems, offering a quantum-mechanical avenue for their experimental detection. Our work highlights an unexpected interplay between non-Hermitian skin effect and Anderson localization.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of topological defects in exciton behavior in (6,5) semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes using density functional theory. Our study identifies the helical Stone-Wales defect as a prominent trap for triplet excitons, characterized by a large zero-field splitting consistent with experimental data and a small singlet-triplet gap. The weak electron-phonon coupling, as evidenced by a Huang-Rhys factor of 0.74, renders it a promising single-photon emitter, with the zero-phonon line predicted at 1.6 $\mu$m, within the telecom range. These insights into defect-engineered electronic structure and exciton dynamics offer promising opportunities for improving the performance of carbon nanotube-based quantum light sources and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Latent Haldane Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latent symmetries, which materialize after performing isospectral reductions, have recently been shown to be instrumental in revealing novel topological phases in one-dimensional systems, among many other applications. In this work, we explore how to construct a family of seemingly complicated two-dimensional models that result in energy-dependent Haldane models upon performing an isospectral reduction. In these models, we find energy-dependent latent Semenoff masses without introducing a staggered on-site potential. In addition, energy-dependent latent Haldane masses also emerge in decorated lattices with nearest-neighbor complex hoppings. Using the Haldane model's properties, we then predict the location of the topological gaps in the aforementioned family of models and construct phase diagrams to determine where the topological phases lie in parameter space. This idea yielded, for instance, useful insights in the case of a modified version of $\alpha$-graphyne and hexagonal plaquettes with additional decorations, where the gap-closing energies can be calculated using the ISR to predict topological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable topological lasing through Thouless pumping in bilayer photonic crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.02843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a programmable photonic platform that integrates Thouless pumping and reconfigurable lasing in sliding bilayer photonic crystals. By engineering two periodic potentials -- a slowly moving photonic grating atop a stationary one -- we demonstrate how their interplay yields distinct topological phases characterized by either robust light transport (Thouless pumping) or localized spatial oscillation (trapping). A heterojunction between crystals in these two regimes supports an interface mode stemming from the topological phase transition across the boundary. This interface mode can be actively tuned via microelectromechanical systems or switched through the integration of phase-change materials. We further establish the feasibility of lasing action at this interface mode, offering a pathway toward topologically robust and reconfigurable lasers. Our findings provide a framework for exploring topological phase transitions and unify the fields of topological photonics and programmable photonic devices, opening avenues for multidimensionally tunable light sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a mechanical oscillator coupled to a two-level system driven by a blue-detuned coherent source in the resolved sideband regime. For weak mechanical damping, we find dynamical instabilities leading to limit cycles. They are signaled by strong fluctuations in the number of emitted photons, with a large Fano factor. The phonon-number fluctuations exhibit a strikingly similar behavior. When the coupling strength becomes comparable to the mechanical frequency, non-classical mechanical states appear. We demonstrate that these properties can be detected by measuring the photon-emission spectrum, which enables the reconstruction of the Wigner function. We then discuss the relation with cavity optomechanical systems. Candidates for observing these effects include superconducting qubits, NV centers, and single molecules coupled to oscillators.</description>

      <title>Megahertz cycling of ultrafast structural dynamics enabled by nanosecond thermal dissipation</title>

Abstract: Light-matter interactions are of fundamental scientific and technological interest. Ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction with combined femtosecond-nanometer resolution elucidate the laser-induced dynamics in structurally heterogeneous systems. These measurements, however, remain challenging due to the brightness limitation of pulsed electron sources, leading to an experimental trade-off between resolution and contrast. Larger signals can most directly be obtained by higher repetition rates, which, however, are typically limited to a few kHz by the thermal relaxation of thin material films. Here, we combine nanometric electron-beam probing with sample support structures tailored to facilitate rapid specimen cooling. Optical cycling of a charge-density wave transformation enables quantifying the mean temperature increase induced by pulsed laser illumination. Varying the excitation fluence and repetition rate, we gauge the impact of excitation confinement and efficient dissipation on the heat diffusion in different sample designs. In particular, a thermally optimized support can dissipate average laser intensities of up to 200 $\mu W/\mu m^2$ within a few nanoseconds, allowing for reversible driving and probing of the CDW transition at a repetition rate of 2 MHz. Sample designs tailored to ultrafast measurement schemes will thus extend the capabilities of electron diffraction and microscopy, enabling high-resolution investigations of structural dynamics.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electrical control of dipolariton-based optical circuits with a few femto-joul per bit power consumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The next generation of photonic circuits will require programmable, ultrafast, and energy-efficient components on a scalable platform for quantum and neuromorphic computing. Here, we present ultrafast electrical control of highly nonlinear light-matter hybrid quasi-particles, called waveguide exciton-dipolaritons, with extremely low power consumption. Our device performs as an optical transistor with a GHz-rate electrical modulation at a record-low total energy consumption $\sim$3 fJ/bit and a compact active area of down to 25 $\mu$m$^2$. This work establishes waveguide-dipolariton platforms for scalable, electrically reconfigurable, ultra-low power photonic circuits for both classical and quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetizing the FeSe-like two-dimensional materials and approaching to giant tunneling magnetoresistance with Janus Cr4BN(B2) MBene electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03165</link>

Abstract: Altermagnetism is an emerging series of unconventional magnetic materials characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split bands in the momentum space with zero net magnetization. Metallic altermagnets offer unique advantages for exploring applications in spintronics as conductive metals allows for serving as electrode in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and/or manipulation of spincurrent through external field. Through density functional theory calculations, the 2D altermagnet Cr4B3N was predicted to be stable, resulting from a N atom substitution in the FeSe-like CrB bilayer. Both intra- and inter-layered magnetic exchanges between Cr atoms are in antiferromagnetic with the first three neighbours. Leveraging the anisotropic spin-splittings with momentum dependency revealed in band structure, we designed three edge dependent Cr4B3N/square/Cr4B3N in-plane MTJs with the 7 \AA vaccume the barrie. We found that the Cr-B vertical edge-assembled electrodes based MTJs exhibited giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 91001% , by aligning the conduction channels of the electrodes in parallel and anti-parallel states in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward altermagnetic 2D metallic electrode with a newly established metal boride (MBene), and broadens applications of the nanoscale spintronics.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Spiral Order from Strained Topological Heavy Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological heavy fermion (THF) model of twisted bilayer graphene is a framework for treating its strongly interacting topological flat bands. In this work, we employ the THF model with heterostrain and particle-hole symmetry breaking corrections to study its symmetry-broken ground states. We find that the heterostrain correction motivates a specific parent-state wavefunction which dictates the presence or absence of an incommensurate Kekul\'e spiral (IKS) at each integer filling by invoking Dirac node braiding and annihilation as a mechanism to achieve low energy gapped states. We then show that one-shot Hartree-Fock faithfully replicates the numerical results of fully self-consistent states and motivates an analytical approximation for the IKS wavevector. We can also account for the particle-hole asymmetry in the correlated insulator gaps. In particular, the THF model predicts stronger correlated states on the electron side rather than hole side in agreement with magic angle experiments, despite the electron side being more dispersive in the single-particle band structure. This work demonstrates that we can analytically explain even the more subtle symmetry breaking order properties observed in experiments where heterostrain, relaxation, and interactions together determine the ground state.</description>
