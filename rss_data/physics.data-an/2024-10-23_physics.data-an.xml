      <title>Tipping points in fitness landscape of heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting fitness of biologically-active populations, communities or systems in fluctuating environments is a long-standing challenge. Phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging strategy, two key evolutionary traits living systems harness to optimize fitness in dynamic environments, have been widely reported yet how interplays therein could mediate fitness landscapes of heterogeneous populations remain unknown. Leveraging the financial asset pricing model, here we provide a dynamical framework for fitness of heterogeneous populations, underpinned by the interrelations between sub-populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedgeding. Our framework, independent of the definition of fitness, employs a nonlinear difference equation to present fitness dynamics, and capture the emergence of tipping points, marking the onset of critical state transitions which lead to catastrophic shifts. This study identifies limits on the selective advantage conferred by bet-hedging through reduction in the temporal variance of fitness, with far-reaching ramifications on our current understanding of hedging-mediated fitness enhancement of a population. The lower bound of the effective fitness variance is set by a maximum number of bet-hedgers, beyond which the fitness landscape approaches critical transition, as confirmed by critical slowing down in the vicinity of tipping points. We estimate the scaling law for the critical slowing down numerically and derive the characteristic recovery time for heterogeneous populations. Taken together, our work provides a generic theoretical framework to quantify fitness dynamics and predict critical transitions in heterogeneous populations. The results can be extended further to model fitness landscapes of natural and synthetic multi-species consortia exposed to environmental fluctuations mimicking climatic shifts and immunopathological settings.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation for networks of coupled oscillators: Inferring unknown model parameters from partial observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring the state and unknown parameters of a network of coupled oscillators, such as neurons in the brain, is of utmost importance. This task is made harder when only partial and noisy observations are available, which is a typical scenario in realistic high-dimensional systems. The general task of inference falls under data assimilation, and a commonly used assimilation method is the Ensemble Kalman Filter. Employing network-specific localization of the forecast covariance, an Ensemble Kalman Filter with state space augmentation is shown to yield highly accurate estimates of both the oscillator phases and unknown model parameters in the case where only a subset of oscillator phases are observed. In contrast, standard data assimilation methods yield poor results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for Kuramoto oscillators and for networks of theta neurons, using a variety of network topologies.</description>
