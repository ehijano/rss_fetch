      <title>Generalization of Long-Range Machine Learning Potentials in Complex Chemical Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vastness of chemical space makes generalization a central challenge in the development of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs). While MLIPs could enable large-scale atomistic simulations with near-quantum accuracy, their usefulness is often limited by poor transferability to out-of-distribution samples. Here, we systematically evaluate different MLIP architectures with long-range corrections across diverse chemical spaces and show that such schemes are essential, not only for improving in-distribution performance but, more importantly, for enabling significant gains in transferability to unseen regions of chemical space. To enable a more rigorous benchmarking, we introduce biased train-test splitting strategies, which explicitly test the model performance in significantly different regions of chemical space. Together, our findings highlight the importance of long-range modeling for achieving generalizable MLIPs and provide a framework for diagnosing systematic failures across chemical space. Although we demonstrate our methodology on metal-organic frameworks, it is broadly applicable to other materials, offering insights into the design of more robust and transferable MLIPs.</description>

      <title>The role of charge resonances in the benzene dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern electronic-structure theory defines dispersion interactions as connected intramonomer excitations. Using this definition, dispersion contributions have been shown in literature to be large relative to other contributions at van der Waals distances for the ground state benzene dimer. However, are the dispersion contributions sufficient to describe its potential energy surface? In this paper, we show the importance of charge resonances for the shape of the potential energy surface of the stacked benzene dimer. Charge resonances is a colloquial term for the presence of ion-pair configurations in the electronic wave function, and they represent a charge delocalization between the benzene molecules. We show that the ion-pair configurations, generated from connected intra- and intermonomer excitations, have a significant impact on the potential energy curves as functions of parallel displacement, as well as intramonomer separation. For parallel displacement, the energy minimum shifts approximately 2 {\AA} toward greater displacement if ion-pair configurations are not included. Hence, to understand the non-covalent bonding in the benzene dimer two mechanisms must be taken into account: dispersion interaction and charge resonances.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group approach to second-order Green's function theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a new approach for constructing a renormalized and regularized Fock matrix for self-consistent field calculations. The scheme relies on second-order perturbation theory and is conceptually related to quasiparticle self-consistent second-order Green's function theory (GF2). The regularization is derived within the framework of perturbative similarity renormalization group (SRG) theory. By optimizing both the regularization and spin-scaling parameters, we introduce three SRG-qsGF2 variants that enable accurate predictions of quasiparticle energies and dipole moments. Lastly, we demonstrate that formulating second-order perturbation theory for the total electronic energy using the renormalized SRG-qsGF2 Fock matrix as the unperturbed Hamiltonian mitigates divergence problems commonly observed in conventional M{\o}ller--Plesset perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Alkaline Methanol Electrooxidation on Bi-modified Pt3M Intermetallics: Kinetic Origins and an OH Binding Energy Descriptor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of advanced CO-free catalysts and clarifying the ambiguous kinetic origins and governing factors would undoubtedly open up opportunities to overcome the sluggish kinetics of methanol electrooxidation and promote the development of direct methanol fuel cells. Herein, we constructed a family of Bi-modified Pt3M intermetallic catalysts (Bi-Pt3M/C, M=Cr, Mn, Co, Zn, In, Ga, and Sn) that follow CO-free dominated pathway and exhibit exceptional catalytic activity. More significantly, leveraging this platform, we have identified the pivotal factor governing the reaction kinetics in CO-free pathway, namely OH binding energy (OHBE). This arises because the rate-determining step (RDS) encompasses both C-H bond activation and water dissociation, whose respective barriers can be reflected by the OHBE. Accordingly, OHBE can act as an activity descriptor. Specifically, Bi-Pt3In/C stands out from other Bi-Pt3M/C and delivers the unprecedented mass activity of 36.7 A mgPt-1 at peak potential, far exceeding state-of-the-art Pt-based catalysts reported to date. Taking Bi-Pt3In/C as a proof of concept, we clearly elucidate the origin of enhanced MOR activity by combining theoretical calculations, kinetic isotope effects, and formaldehyde electrooxidation. Moreover, there exhibits a volcano-type trend between OHBE and the activity of Bi-Pt3M/C. Beyond the discovery of ultrahigh-performance catalysts, these findings provide a detailed mechanistic picture of RDS and offer an innovative design principle for advanced catalysts.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of GW-Bethe-Salpeter Equation excitation energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A persistent challenge in machine learning for electronic-structure calculations is the sharp imbalance between abundant low-fidelity data like DFT or TDDFT results and the scarcity of high-fidelity data like many-body perturbation theory labels. We show that transfer learning provides an effective route to bridge this gap: graph neural networks pretrained on DFT and TDDFT properties can be finetuned with limited qs$GW$ and qs$GW$-BSE data to yield accurate predictions of quasiparticle and excitation energies. Assessing both full-model and readout-only finetuning across chemically diverse test sets, we find that pretraining improves accuracy, reduces reliance on costly qs$GW$ data, and mitigates large predictive outliers even for molecules larger or chemically distinct from those seen during finetuning. Our results demonstrate that multi-fidelity transfer learning can substantially extend the reach of many-body-level predictions across chemical space.</description>

      <title>Probing voltage-induced chemical reactions and anharmonicity with a confined vacuum light field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a proof-of-concept investigation of non-equilibrium chemical reaction dynamics at a molecule-electrode interface, driven out of equilibrium by an applied votage bias and mediated by a confined, enhanced vacuum electromagnetic field inside an optical cavity. The coupled electron-vibration-photon system, together with the electrodes and a dissipative environment, is described within an open quantum system framework and solved using a numerically exact quantum dynamical approach. The reaction coordinate is modeled with a Morse potential, enabling explicit treatment of molecular anharmonicity and bond-breaking behavior. By varying the cavity frequency across the infrared regime to cover typical nuclear vibrational energies, we observe multiple resonant rate suppression features that emerge whenever the cavity mode is brought into resonance with a dipole-allowed vibrational transition along the anharmonic ladder up to the dissociation threshold. These findings open the door to extending polaritonic chemistry into genuinely nonequilibrium scenarios relevant to molecule-electrode interfaces. Moreover, building on these results, we further propose a multi-mode vibrational strong coupling strategy in which several cavity modes are individually matched to distinct vibrational transitions. This engineered multi-resonant cavity induces a stepwise vibrational ladder descending process that efficiently drains vibrational excited energy. The resulting cavity-assisted cooling suggests a potential route toward mitigating voltage-induced bond rupture and the long-standing instability issues of molecular junctions operating under high bias.</description>

      <title>When Is Nanoconfined Water Different From Interfacial Water?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water behaves very differently at surfaces and under extreme confinement, but the boundary between these two regimes has remained unclear. Despite evidence that interfacial effects persist under sub-nanometre confinement, the molecular-scale behaviour and its evolution with slit width remain unclear. Here, we use machine-learning molecular dynamics with first-principles accuracy to probe water at graphene surfaces across slit widths ranging from the open-interface limit to angstrom-scale confinement. We find that water undergoes a sharp structural transition: when three or more water layers fit between the walls, the structure of the graphene-water interface is effectively indistinguishable from that in an open system, with density layering, hydrogen bonding, and orientational ordering retaining interfacial character. Below this threshold, however, angstrom-scale confinement strongly reorganises the liquid, producing enhanced ordering, a restructured hydrogen-bond network, and modified orientational motifs. These results establish a molecular-level picture that clearly separates interfacial behaviour from genuine nanoconfinement and provide guidance for predicting and controlling the structure of water in nanoscale solid-liquid environments.</description>

      <title>MolSculpt: Sculpting 3D Molecular Geometries from Chemical Syntax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating precise 3D molecular geometries is crucial for drug discovery and material science. While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that "sculpts" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/SakuraTroyChen/MolSculpt.</description>

      <title>Neutral Barium in Solid Neon: Optical Spectroscopy and First Excited State Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix isolation spectroscopy enables probing atomic properties in controlled cryogenic environments. We present a spectroscopic study on neutral barium atoms embedded in a neon cryogenic crystal at 6.8 K, extending previous investigations performed in other noble gas hosts. The visible and near-infrared emission spectra were recorded under two different laser excitation schemes. First, 10-ns laser pulses at 355 nm were used to directly excite high-lying energy levels of barium, enabling the observation of fluorescence cascades. Second, a tunable continuous-wave laser operating between 700 nm and 900 nm allowed us to determine the matrix-induced shifts of barium energy levels relative to their vacuum values, as well as the inhomogeneous linewidths of the observed transitions and to perform lifetime measurements. Our results confirm multiple radiative pathways and matrix-induced relaxation channels affecting the 5d6s and 6s6p barium manifolds. Furthermore, we present the first lifetime measurement of the barium 5d6s 3D1 state in a neon crystal, yielding 0.39 \pm 0.02 s, with a predicted increase of about 10% at 2 K. The study of fluorescence and spectroscopic properties of barium isolated in neon represents an important step toward future searches for the electron electric dipole moment using barium monofluoride in neon matrices, where neutral barium atoms may act as unavoidable impurities and potential sources of background and systematic limitations.</description>

      <title>Negative Marginal Densities in Mixed Quantum-Classical Liouville Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixed quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) provides an approximate perturbative framework for describing the dynamics of systems with coupled quantum and classical degrees of freedom of disparate thermal wavelengths. The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\textendash{}classical descriptions.</description>

      <title>Machine learned potential for defected single layer hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIP) is critical for performing reliable simulations of materials at length and time scales that are comparable to those in the laboratory. We present here a MLIP suitable for simulations of the temperature dependent structure and dynamics of single layer hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) with defects and grain boundaries, developed using a strictly local equivariant deep neural network as formulated in the Allegro code. The training dataset consisted of about 30,000 images of h-BN with and without point defects generated with ab-initio molecular dynamics simulations, based on density functional theory (DFT), at 500, 1000, and 1500K. The developed MLIP predicts potential energies and forces with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4 meV/atom and 60 meV/Angstrom , respectively. It also reproduces phonon dispersion curves and density of vibrational states of pristine bulk h-BN that are comparable with that obtained from density functional theory-based calculations. Molecular dynamics simulations of the motion of the 4|8 grain boundary unit in h-BN shows the first step to have an activation barrier ~2.2 eV, indicating immobility of the grain boundary. Moving the grain boundary units past the first shows much lower activation barriers of ~0.42eV, suggesting a facile motion of the grain boundary once the first movement is stimulated. These simulations yield a scaled mobility of 1.739*10^(-11) m^3/Js for a temperature of 1500K which, given the inherent differences in the set-ups, is not too far from the experimental value of 1.36*10^(-9) m^3/Js. The ability to predict grain boundary mobility within reasonable agreement with experiment demonstrates the robustness of the MLIP and its suitability for reliable simulations of defect structures and dynamics in single layer h-BN.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Bubble Nucleation in a Liquid-Noble Scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber collaboration is searching for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using a novel bubble chamber with intended thresholds as low as 100eV. Existing molecular dynamics simulations of bubble formation in bubble chambers were conducted with non-scintillating target materials and therefore do not account for the energy transfer to photons or time-delayed releases that occur in atomic de-excitation. In this study, we use the HOOMD-blue molecular dynamics framework to simulate bubble formation in liquid argon, including photon creation, ionization, and direct nuclear recoils. A multi-stage bubble growth process similar to that reported in the literature was observed. When comparing simulated thresholds with and without scintillation effects, we found that scintillation raises the average energy required to form a bubble by a factor of 2.16. This is larger than the fraction of energy lost to photon creation, and demonstrates that energy stored in excited molecular states with lifetimes longer than the rapid growth phase of nucleation (~250 ps) does not contribute significantly to bubble formation. This conclusion was further supported by simulations showing increased bubble nucleation thresholds when the excited molecular state lifetimes were increased, even under identical thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we examine how porosity fluctuations affect the hydrodynamic permeability of a porous matrix or membrane. We introduce a fluctuating Darcy model, which couples the Navier-Stokes equation to the space- and time-dependent porosity fluctuations via a Darcy friction term. Using a perturbative approach, a Dyson equation for hydrodynamic fluctuations is derived and solved to express the permeability in terms of the matrix fluctuation spectrum. Surprisingly, the model reveals strong modifications of the fluid permeability in fluctuating matrices compared to static ones. Applications to various matrix excitation models - breathing matrix, phonons, active forcing - highlight the significant influence of matrix fluctuations on fluid transport, offering insights for optimizing membrane design for separation applications.</description>

      <title>A review on combinatorial approach to aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a combinatorial approach to discrete, finite, and irreversibly aggregating systems has been progressively developed. In this work, we review its achievements up to the present moment, focusing on the practical aspects and discussing its limitations. First, we present the assumptions and combinatorial foundations of the approach, which are based on direct counting of the system states, in contrast to the previous approaches of Smoluchowski and Marcus--Lushnikov. A method to obtain combinatorial expressions for the average number of clusters of a given size and the corresponding standard deviation is described by solving the simplest example of a constant kernel. Then, we extend consideration to a number of kernels (e.g., additive, product, linear--chain, condensation), which were recently solved by explicitly finding the number of internal states of the cluster of a given size. Next, we show that theoretical predictions for any given kernel may be obtained with no need to find an explicit solution but using a recursive expression. We exploit this opportunity to present the use of combinatorial expressions to solve kernels related to the real processes of aerosol growth and planetesimal formation. At this point, a comparison to numerical results appears. Other potential application fields are indicated, including dust agglomeration and polymer growth. Finally, issues related to the varying precision of the theoretical predictions are summarized. In the last section, we propose open problems.</description>

      <title>Heat capacity of dense liquids: A link between two-phase model and melting temperature scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling predicts the power-law dependence of the excess heat capacity of simple liquids on temperature. The two-phase model treats a liquid as a superposition of gas- and solid-like components whose relative abundance is quantified by a liquid rigidity parameter. We demonstrate here that the generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling emerges naturally in the two-phase model from the scale invariance of the liquid rigidity parameter.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Zwanzig FEP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fluctuation framework to quantify the free energy difference between two equilibrium states connected by nonequilibrium processes under arbitrary dynamics and system-environment coupling. For an open system described by the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF), we show that the equilibrium free energy difference between two canonical endpoints can be written as exponential averages of the HMF shift, divided by an explicit factor built from the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final system marginals. These relations hold at the endpoint level and, under an asymptotic equilibration postulate, admit trajectory representations for general driving and coupling protocols. A decomposition of the HMF increment along each trajectory separates the work-like contributions associated with changes in $\lambda(t)$ and $C(t)$, the heat-like exchange with the environment, and a feedback-like functional defined with respect to the initial protocol. In the frozen-driving regime with a noninteracting reference, the equalities reduce to new FEP-like expressions involving an environment functional and an explicit overlap correction, with the Zwanzig formula recovered as a limiting case. We validate the approach on an open system coupled to an environment and evolved under overdamped Langevin dynamics, where conventional Zwanzig FEP suffers from poor phase-space overlap and slow numerical convergence, while the present trajectory equality closely matches the exact free energy difference over a broad range of coupling strengths.</description>

      <title>Quantum Krylov algorithm using unitary decomposition for exact eigenstates of fermionic systems using quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($\Delta t$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $\Delta t$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ of the error parameter $\epsilon$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $\epsilon \neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($\epsilon^2$) vs O($\Delta t$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $\epsilon$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $\epsilon$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Gaussian basis sets for all-electron excited-state calculations of large molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of all-electron Gaussian basis sets, augmented MOLOPT, optimized for excited-state calculations on large molecules. We generate these basis sets by augmenting existing STO-3G, STO-6G, and MOLOPT basis sets optimized for ground state energy calculations. The augmented MOLOPT basis sets achieve fast convergence of $GW$ gaps and Bethe-Salpeter excitation energies, while maintaining low condition numbers of the overlap matrix to ensure numerical stability. For $GW$ HOMO-LUMO gaps, the double-zeta augmented MOLOPT basis yields a mean absolute deviation of 60 meV to the complete basis set limit. The basis set convergence for excitation energies from time-dependent density functional theory and the Bethe-Salpeter equation is similar. We use our smallest generated augmented MOLOPT basis (aug-SZV-MOLOPT-ae-mini) to demonstrate $GW$ calculations on nanographenes with 9224 atoms requiring only 34300 core hours of computational resources.</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of MPS and TTNS for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS), are powerful ans\"atze for simulating quantum dynamics. While both ans\"atze are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 8767-8781] reported a non-negligible discrepancy in its calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for MPS and TTNS. By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we reduce the relative difference in occupancy for weakly populated electronic states from up to 60% towards the end of the simulation to less than 10% and the absolute difference from 0.05 to 0.005. We also discuss the impact of tensor network structures on accuracy and efficiency, with the difference further reduced by an optimized TTNS structure. Our results confirm that both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>

      <title>Field theoretic atomistics: Learning thermodynamic and variational surrogate to density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hohenberg-Kohn (HK) theorem -- the bedrock of density functional theory (DFT) -- establishes a universal map from the external potential to the energy. It also relates the electron density and atomic forces to the variation of the energy with the external potential. But the HK map is rarely utilized in atomistics, wherein interatomic potentials are defined using the molecular or crystal structure rather than the external potential. As a break from this tradition, we present a field theoretic atomistics framework where the external potential assumes the central quantity. We machine learn the HK energy map while satisfying the thermodynamic limit. Further, we obtain both forces and electron density from the variation of the HK energy map, that are exact relations. Our models attain good accuracy across diverse benchmarks and compete with state-of-the-art machine learned interatomic potentials. Through electron density, we predict accurate dipole and quadrupole moments, otherwise nontrivial for interatomic potentials. Our formulation paves the way for a scalable electronic structure surrogate to DFT.</description>

      <title>Exact fluctuation relation for open systems beyond the Jarzynski equality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact fluctuation equalities for open systems that recover free energy differences between two equilibrium endpoints connected by nonequilibrium processes with arbitrary dynamics and coupling. The exponential of the free energy difference is expressed in terms of ensemble averages of the Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) shift and the chi-squared divergence between the initial and final marginal probability distribution of the open system. A trajectory counterpart of this relation follows from an asymptotic equilibration postulate, which treats relaxation to the final stationary canonical state as a boundary condition rather than as a consequence of constraints on the driven dynamics. In the frozen-coupling regime, the HMF shift reduces to the bare-system Hamiltonian shift, yielding a clear heat-work decomposition. The Jarzynski equality (JE) is recovered under the assumption of Hamiltonian dynamics for the combined system. We validate the theory on a dissipative, phase-space-compressing drive followed by an underdamped Langevin relaxation, where the assumptions underlying the JE break down, whereas our equality reproduces the exact free energy differences.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study arXiv:2512.08684, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>
