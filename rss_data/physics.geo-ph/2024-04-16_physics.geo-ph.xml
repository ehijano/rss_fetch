      <title>Satellite observations reveal shorter periodic inner core oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting the Earth's inner core motions relative to the mantle presents a considerable challenge due to their indirect accessibility. Seismological observations initially provided evidence for differential/super-rotation of the inner core, but recently demonstrated a possibly about 70-year periodic oscillation. The contrasting results underscore the ongoing enigma surrounding inner core motion, leaving debates unresolved, including the precise oscillate period. In parallel to seismic observations, satellite geodesy has accumulated decades of global high-precision records, providing a novel avenue to probe inner core motions. Here, we detect an about 6-year oscillation from the gravitational field degree-2 order-2 Stokes coefficients derived from satellite observations, and find it has a unique phase correlation with the about 6-year signal in the Earth's length-of-day variations. This correlation is attributed to an inner core oscillation which is controlled by the gravitational coupling between the inner core and lower mantle (mainly due to the density heterogeneity of the two large low-velocity provinces; LLVPs). That is, we independently corroborate the inner core periodic oscillation, albeit with a significantly shorter period than previously suggested. Our findings demonstrate the dense layer of the LLVPs (mean density anomalies of about +0.9 percent at the bottom), consistent with inversions from tidal tomography and Stoneley modes. Furthermore, our research reveals equatorial topographic undulations of about 187 m at the inner core boundary.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Joint Temperature and Precipitation Emulation of Earth System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth system models (ESMs) are the principal tools used in climate science to generate future climate projections under various atmospheric emissions scenarios on a global or regional scale. Generative deep learning approaches are suitable for emulating these tools due to their computational efficiency and ability, once trained, to generate realizations in a fraction of the time required by ESMs. We extend previous work that used a generative probabilistic diffusion model to emulate ESMs by targeting the joint emulation of multiple variables, temperature and precipitation, by a single diffusion model. Joint generation of multiple variables is critical to generate realistic samples of phenomena resulting from the interplay of multiple variables. The diffusion model emulator takes in the monthly mean-maps of temperature and precipitation and produces the daily values of each of these variables that exhibit statistical properties similar to those generated by ESMs. Our results show the outputs from our extended model closely resemble those from ESMs on various climate metrics including dry spells and hot streaks, and that the joint distribution of temperature and precipitation in our sample closely matches those of ESMs.</description>

      <title>Seismic Traveltime Tomography with Label-free Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have been used to build velocity models (VMs) for seismic traveltime tomography and have shown encouraging performance in recent years. However, they need to generate labeled samples (i.e., pairs of input and label) to train the deep neural network (NN) with end-to-end learning, and the real labels for field data inversion are usually missing or very expensive. Some traditional tomographic methods can be implemented quickly, but their effectiveness is often limited by prior assumptions. To avoid generating and/or collecting labeled samples, we propose a novel method by integrating deep learning and dictionary learning to enhance the VMs with low resolution by using the traditional tomography-least square method (LSQR). We first design a type of shallow and simple NN to reduce computational cost followed by proposing a two-step strategy to enhance the VMs with low resolution: (1) Warming up. An initial dictionary is trained from the estimation by LSQR through dictionary learning method; (2) Dictionary optimization. The initial dictionary obtained in the warming-up step will be optimized by the NN, and then it will be used to reconstruct high-resolution VMs with the reference slowness and the estimation by LSQR. Furthermore, we design a loss function to minimize traveltime misfit to ensure that NN training is label-free, and the optimized dictionary can be obtained after each epoch of NN training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through the numerical tests on both synthetic and field data.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Time Domain Displacement Response due to Concentrated Vertical Force on Free Surface of Elastic Half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents the Huygens method as a novel alternative to the Cagniard-de Hoop method, offering insights into wave generation mechanisms and facilitating wave decomposition. It holds promise for various linear boundary problems and provides results without singularities. The study defines surface waves, including the Rayleigh wave, and identifies a novel wave mode, the Huygens wave. Additionally, it investigates displacements near the axis, providing simplified approximations and examining changes in displacements over time and space, noting their gradual attenuation.</description>

      <title>Number of aftershocks in epidemic-type seismicity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18526v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let V(M, m0) be the number of m&gt;M aftershocks caused by m0 event. We consider the V(M, m0) distribution within epidemic-type seismicity models, ETAS(F). These models include the Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitude and Utsu law for average productivity of m0, but differ in the type of F distribution for the number v(m0) of direct aftershocks. The class of F is quite broad and includes both the Poisson distribution, which is the basis for the regular ETAS model, and its possible alternative, the Geometric distribution. Instead of the traditional threshold M=m0-d we consider M=ma-d, where ma is the mode in the distribution of the strongest aftershock. Under these conditions we find the limit V(M, m0) distribution at m0&gt;&gt;1. In the subcritical case, the limit distribution is extremely simple and identical to the v(m) distribution with a suitable magnitude m=m(d). Theoretical results of this kind are lacking even for the regular ETAS model. Our results provide an additional opportunity to test the type of F-distribution, Bath law, and the very concept of epidemic-type clustering.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Geothermal Gradient in Colombia: a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the geothermal gradient is critical for assessing the geothermal energy potential of a given region. Of particular interest is the case of Colombia, a country with abundant geothermal resources. A history of active oil and gas exploration and production has left drilled boreholes in different geological settings, providing direct measurements of the geothermal gradient. Unfortunately, large regions of the country where geothermal resources might exist lack such measurements. Indirect geophysical measurements are costly and difficult to perform at regional scales. Computational thermal models could be constructed, but they require very detailed knowledge of the underlying geology and uniform sampling of subsurface temperatures to be well-constrained. We present an alternative approach that leverages recent advances in supervised machine learning and available direct measurements to predict the geothermal gradient in regions where only global-scale geophysical datasets and course geological knowledge are available. We find that a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree algorithm yields optimal predictions and extensively validate the trained model. We show that predictions of our model are within 12\% accuracy and that independent measurements performed by other authors agree well with our model. Finnally, we present a geothermal gradient map for Colombia that highlights regions where futher exploration and data collection should be performed.</description>
