      <title>A Case Study of Counting the Number of Unique Users in Linear and Non-Linear Trails -- A Multi-Agent System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parks play a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life by providing recreational spaces and environmental benefits. Understanding the patterns of park usage, including the number of visitors and their activities, is essential for effective security measures, infrastructure maintenance, and resource allocation. Traditional methods rely on single-entry sensors that count total visits but fail to distinguish unique users, limiting their effectiveness due to manpower and cost constraints.With advancements in affordable video surveillance and networked processing, more comprehensive park usage analysis is now feasible. This study proposes a multi-agent system leveraging low-cost cameras in a distributed network to track and analyze unique users. As a case study, we deployed this system at the Jack A. Markell (JAM) Trail in Wilmington, Delaware, and Hall Trail in Newark, Delaware. The system captures video data, autonomously processes it using existing algorithms, and extracts user attributes such as speed, direction, activity type, clothing color, and gender. These attributes are shared across cameras to construct movement trails and accurately count unique visitors. Our approach was validated through comparison with manual human counts and simulated scenarios under various conditions. The results demonstrate a 72% success rate in identifying unique users, setting a benchmark in automated park activity monitoring. Despite challenges such as camera placement and environmental factors, our findings suggest that this system offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for real-time park usage analysis and visitor behavior tracking.</description>

      <title>HIPPO-MAT: Decentralized Task Allocation Using GraphSAGE and Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles decentralized continuous task allocation in heterogeneous multi-agent systems. We present a novel framework HIPPO-MAT that integrates graph neural networks (GNN) employing a GraphSAGE architecture to compute independent embeddings on each agent with an Independent Proximal Policy Optimization (IPPO) approach for multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. In our system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) share aggregated observation data via communication channels while independently processing these inputs to generate enriched state embeddings. This design enables dynamic, cost-optimal, conflict-aware task allocation in a 3D grid environment without the need for centralized coordination. A modified A* path planner is incorporated for efficient routing and collision avoidance. Simulation experiments demonstrate scalability with up to 30 agents and preliminary real-world validation on JetBot ROS AI Robots, each running its model on a Jetson Nano and communicating through an ESP-NOW protocol using ESP32-S3, which confirms the practical viability of the approach that incorporates simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). Experimental results revealed that our method achieves a high 92.5% conflict-free success rate, with only a 16.49% performance gap compared to the centralized Hungarian method, while outperforming the heuristic decentralized baseline based on greedy approach. Additionally, the framework exhibits scalability with up to 30 agents with allocation processing of 0.32 simulation step time and robustness in responding to dynamically generated tasks.</description>

      <title>The potential role of AI agents in transforming nuclear medicine research and cancer management in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: India faces a significant cancer burden, with an incidence-to-mortality ratio indicating that nearly three out of five individuals diagnosed with cancer succumb to the disease. While the limitations of physical healthcare infrastructure are widely acknowledged as a primary challenge, concerted efforts by government and healthcare agencies are underway to mitigate these constraints. However, given the country's vast geography and high population density, it is imperative to explore alternative soft infrastructure solutions to complement existing frameworks. Artificial Intelligence agents are increasingly transforming problem-solving approaches across various domains, with their application in medicine proving particularly transformative. In this perspective, we examine the potential role of AI agents in advancing nuclear medicine for cancer research, diagnosis, and management in India. We begin with a brief overview of AI agents and their capabilities, followed by a proposed agent-based ecosystem that can address prevailing sustainability challenges in India nuclear medicine.</description>

      <title>DynTaskMAS: A Dynamic Task Graph-driven Framework for Asynchronous and Parallel LLM-based Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) has opened new possibilities for artificial intelligence, yet current implementations face significant challenges in resource management, task coordination, and system efficiency. While existing frameworks demonstrate the potential of LLM-based agents in collaborative problem-solving, they often lack sophisticated mechanisms for parallel execution and dynamic task management. This paper introduces DynTaskMAS, a novel framework that orchestrates asynchronous and parallel operations in LLM-based MAS through dynamic task graphs. The framework features four key innovations: (1) a Dynamic Task Graph Generator that intelligently decomposes complex tasks while maintaining logical dependencies, (2) an Asynchronous Parallel Execution Engine that optimizes resource utilization through efficient task scheduling, (3) a Semantic-Aware Context Management System that enables efficient information sharing among agents, and (4) an Adaptive Workflow Manager that dynamically optimizes system performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that DynTaskMAS achieves significant improvements over traditional approaches: a 21-33% reduction in execution time across task complexities (with higher gains for more complex tasks), a 35.4% improvement in resource utilization (from 65% to 88%), and near-linear throughput scaling up to 16 concurrent agents (3.47X improvement for 4X agents). Our framework establishes a foundation for building scalable, high-performance LLM-based multi-agent systems capable of handling complex, dynamic tasks efficiently.</description>

      <title>Adaptive routing protocols for determining optimal paths in AI multi-agent systems: a priority- and learning-enhanced approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As distributed artificial intelligence (AI) and multi-agent architectures grow increasingly complex, the need for adaptive, context-aware routing becomes paramount. This paper introduces an enhanced, adaptive routing algorithm tailored for AI multi-agent networks, integrating priority-based cost functions and dynamic learning mechanisms. Building on an extended Dijkstra-based framework, we incorporate multi-faceted parameters such as task complexity, user request priority, agent capabilities, bandwidth, latency, load, model sophistication, and reliability. We further propose dynamically adaptive weighting factors, tuned via reinforcement learning (RL), to continuously evolve routing policies based on observed network performance. Additionally, heuristic filtering and hierarchical routing structures improve scalability and responsiveness. Our approach yields context-sensitive, load-aware, and priority-focused routing decisions that not only reduce latency for critical tasks but also optimize overall resource utilization, ultimately enhancing the robustness, flexibility, and efficiency of multi-agent systems.</description>

      <title>A Reliable Self-Organized Distributed Complex Network for Communication of Smart Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaboration is a fundamental and essential characteristic of many complex systems, ranging from ant colonies to human societies. Each component within a complex system interacts with others, even at a distance, to accomplish a given task. A network of collaboration can be defined to study the collective behavior of such systems within the framework of complex networks. The nodes in these networks may represent simple organisms or more sophisticated intelligent agents, such as humans. In this study, we utilize intelligent agents (nodes) trained through reinforcement learning techniques to establish connections with their neighbors, ultimately leading to the emergence of a large-scale communication cluster. Notably, there is no centralized administrator; instead, agents must adjust their connections based on information obtained from local observations. The connection strategy is formulated using a physical Hamiltonian, thereby categorizing this intelligent system under the paradigm of "Physics-Guided Machine Learning".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power indices are essential in assessing the contribution and influence of individual agents in multi-agent systems, providing crucial insights into collaborative dynamics and decision-making processes. While invaluable, traditional computational methods for exact or estimated power indices values require significant time and computational constraints, especially for large $(n\ge10)$ coalitions. These constraints have historically limited researchers' ability to analyse complex multi-agent interactions comprehensively. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel Neural Networks-based approach that efficiently estimates power indices for voting games, demonstrating comparable and often superiour performance to existing tools in terms of both speed and accuracy. This method not only addresses existing computational bottlenecks, but also enables rapid analysis of large coalitions, opening new avenues for multi-agent system research by overcoming previous computational limitations and providing researchers with a more accessible, scalable analytical tool.This increased efficiency will allow for the analysis of more complex and realistic multi-agent scenarios.</description>

      <title>Impact of Level 2/3 Automated Driving Technology on Road Work Zone Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As China's road network enters the maintenance era, work zones will become a common sight on the roads. With the development of automated driving, vehicles equipped with Level 2/3 automated driving capabilities will also become a common presence on the roads. When these vehicles pass through work zones, automated driving may disengage, which can have complex effects on traffic safety. This paper explores the impact of Level 2/3 automated driving technology on road safety in high-speed highway work zone environments. Through microscopic traffic simulation method and using full-type traffic conflict technique, factors such as market penetration rate (MPR), traffic volume level, disengagement threshold, and driver takeover style are studied to understand their impact on work zone safety. The study found that the impact of automated driving technology on work zone safety is complex. Disengagement of automated vehicles in work zones reduces the proportion of vehicles that can maintain automated driving status. If takeover is not timely or adequate, it can easily lead to new traffic conflicts. Different factors have varying degrees of impact on work zone safety. Increasing MPR helps reduce the occurrence of single-vehicle conflicts, but it also increases the possibility of multi-vehicle conflicts. Therefore, future research and improvement directions should focus on optimizing the disengagement detection and takeover mechanisms of automated driving systems.</description>

      <title>Using a single actor to output personalized policy for different intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, with the development of Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), adaptive traffic signal control (ATSC) has achieved satisfactory results. In traffic scenarios with multiple intersections, MARL treats each intersection as an agent and optimizes traffic signal control strategies through learning and real-time decision-making. Considering that observation distributions of intersections might be different in real-world scenarios, shared parameter methods might lack diversity and thus lead to high generalization requirements in the shared-policy network. A typical solution is to increase the size of network parameters. However, simply increasing the scale of the network does not necessarily improve policy generalization, which is validated in our experiments. Accordingly, an approach that considers both the personalization of intersections and the efficiency of parameter sharing is required. To this end, we propose Hyper-Action Multi-Head Proximal Policy Optimization (HAMH-PPO), a Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL method that utilizes a shared PPO policy network to deliver personalized policies for intersections with non-iid observation distributions. The centralized critic in HAMH-PPO uses graph attention units to calculate the graph representations of all intersections and outputs a set of value estimates with multiple output heads for each intersection. The decentralized execution actor takes the local observation history as input and output distributions of action as well as a so-called hyper-action to balance the multiple values estimated from the centralized critic to further guide the updating of TSC policies. The combination of hyper-action and multi-head values enables multiple agents to share a single actor-critic while achieving personalized policies.</description>

      <title>CoLMDriver: LLM-based Negotiation Benefits Cooperative Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) cooperative autonomous driving holds great promise for improving safety by addressing the perception and prediction uncertainties inherent in single-agent systems. However, traditional cooperative methods are constrained by rigid collaboration protocols and limited generalization to unseen interactive scenarios. While LLM-based approaches offer generalized reasoning capabilities, their challenges in spatial planning and unstable inference latency hinder their direct application in cooperative driving. To address these limitations, we propose CoLMDriver, the first full-pipeline LLM-based cooperative driving system, enabling effective language-based negotiation and real-time driving control. CoLMDriver features a parallel driving pipeline with two key components: (i) an LLM-based negotiation module under an actor-critic paradigm, which continuously refines cooperation policies through feedback from previous decisions of all vehicles; and (ii) an intention-guided waypoint generator, which translates negotiation outcomes into executable waypoints. Additionally, we introduce InterDrive, a CARLA-based simulation benchmark comprising 10 challenging interactive driving scenarios for evaluating V2V cooperation. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLMDriver significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an 11% higher success rate across diverse highly interactive V2V driving scenarios. Code will be released on https://github.com/cxliu0314/CoLMDriver.</description>

      <title>Bearing-Distance Flocking with Zone-Based Interactions in Constrained Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10047v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel zone-based flocking control approach suitable for dynamic multi-agent systems (MAS). Inspired by Reynolds behavioral rules for $boids$, flocking behavioral rules with the zones of repulsion, conflict, attraction, and surveillance are introduced. For each agent, using only bearing and distance measurements, behavioral contribution vectors quantify the local separation, local and global flock velocity alignment, local cohesion, obstacle avoidance and boundary conditions, and strategic separation for avoiding alien agents. The control strategy uses the local perception-based behavioral contribution vectors to guide each agent's motion. Additionally, the control strategy incorporates a directionally aware obstacle avoidance mechanism that prioritizes obstacles in the agent's forward path. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the model in creating flexible, adaptable, and scalable flocking behavior. Asymptotic stability and convergence to a stable flocking configuration for any initial conditions provided the interaction graph is a spanning tree are demonstrated. The flocking model's reliance on locally sensed bearing and distance measurements ensures scalability and robustness, particularly in scenarios where communication is unreliable or resource-intensive. This makes it well-suited for real-world applications demanding seamless operation in highly dynamic and distributed environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Obstacle Avoidance using Velocity Obstacles and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10117v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Velocity Obstacles (VO) methods form a paradigm for collision avoidance strategies among moving obstacles and agents. While VO methods perform well in simple multi-agent environments, they don't guarantee safety and can show overly conservative behavior in common situations. In this paper, we propose to combine a VO-strategy for guidance with a CBF-approach for safety, which overcomes the overly conservative behavior of VOs and formally guarantees safety. We validate our method in a baseline comparison study, using 2nd order integrator and car-like dynamics. Results support that our method outperforms the baselines w.r.t. path smoothness, collision avoidance, and success rates.</description>

      <title>Agent-Oriented Planning in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the collaboration of multiple LLM-empowered agents possessing diverse expertise and tools, multi-agent systems achieve impressive progress in solving real-world problems. Given the user queries, the meta-agents, serving as the brain within multi-agent systems, are required to decompose the queries into multiple sub-tasks that can be allocated to suitable agents capable of solving them, so-called agent-oriented planning. In this study, we identify three critical design principles of agent-oriented planning, including solvability, completeness, and non-redundancy, to ensure that each sub-task can be effectively resolved, resulting in satisfactory responses to user queries. These principles further inspire us to propose AOP, a novel framework for agent-oriented planning in multi-agent systems, leveraging a fast task decomposition and allocation process followed by an effective and efficient evaluation via a reward model. According to the evaluation results, the meta-agent is also responsible for promptly making necessary adjustments to sub-tasks and scheduling. Besides, we integrate a feedback loop into AOP to further enhance the effectiveness and robustness of such a problem-solving process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advancement of AOP in solving real-world problems compared to both single-agent systems and existing planning strategies for multi-agent systems.
