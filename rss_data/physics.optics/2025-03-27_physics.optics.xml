      <title>Speckle-based X-ray microtomography via preconditioned Wirtinger flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative phase imaging has been extensively studied in X-ray microtomography to improve the sensitivity and specificity of measurements, especially for low atomic number materials. However, obtaining quantitative phase images typically requires additional measurements or assumptions, which significantly limits the practical applicability. Here, we present preconditioned Wirtinger flow (PWF): an assumption-free, single-shot quantitative X-ray phase imaging method. Accurate phase retrieval is demonstrated using a specialized gradient-based algorithm with an accurate physical model. Partial coherence of the source is taken into account, extending the potential applications to bench-top sources. Improved accuracy and spatial resolution over conventional speckle tracking methods are experimentally demonstrated. The various samples are explored to demonstrate the robustness and versatility of PWF.</description>

      <title>Design of Macroscale Optical Systems with Metaoptics Using Transformer-Based Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metaoptics are thin, planar surfaces consisting of many subwavelength optical resonators that can be designed to simultaneously control the amplitude, phase, and polarization to arbitrarily shape an optical wavefront much in the same manner as a traditional lens but with a much smaller form factor. The incorporation of metaoptics into a conventional optical system spans multiple length scales between that of the individual metaoptic elements (&lt; {\lambda}) and that of the entire size of the optic (&gt;&gt; {\lambda}), making computational techniques that accurately simulate the optical response of metaoptics computationally intractable, while more efficient techniques utilizing various approximations suffer from inaccuracies in their prediction of the optical response. To overcome the trade between speed and accuracy, we implement a transformer-based neural network solver to calculate the optical response of metaoptics and combine it with commercial ray optics software incorporating Fourier propagation methods to simulate an entire optical system. We demonstrate that this neural net method is more than 3 orders of magnitude faster than a traditional finite-difference time domain method, with only a 0.47 % deviation in total irradiance when compared with a full wave simulation, which is nearly 2 orders of magnitude more accurate than standard approximation methods for metaoptics. The ability to accurately and efficiently predict the optical response of a metaoptic could enable their optimization, further accelerating and facilitating their application.</description>

      <title>Unifying and accelerating level-set and density-based topology optimization by subpixel-smoothed projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new "subpixel-smoothed projection" (SSP) formulation for differentiable binarization in topology optimization (TopOpt) as a drop-in replacement for previous projection schemes, which suffer from non-differentiability and/or slow convergence as binarization improves. Our new algorithm overcomes these limitations by depending on both the underlying filtered design field and its spatial gradient, instead of the filtered design field alone. We can now smoothly transition between density-based TopOpt (in which topology can easily change during optimization) and a level-set method (in which shapes evolve in an almost-everywhere binarized structure). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on several photonics inverse-design problems and for a variety of computational methods (finite-difference, Fourier-modal, and finite-element methods). SSP exhibits both faster convergence and greater simplicity.</description>

      <title>2D semiconductors as on-chip light sources for integrated nanophotonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incorporating on-chip light sources directly into nanophotonic waveguides generally requires introducing a different material to the chip than that used for guiding the light, a crucial step that requires dealing with several technical challenges, e.g., atomic lattice mismatch in epitaxial growth between substrate and luminescent materials resulting in strain defects that lower performance. Here we demonstrate that van der Waals materials, such as the 2D semiconductor MoSe2, can easily be transferred onto gold plasmonic nanowaveguides using standard dry visco-elastic polymer transfer techniques. We further show that the photoluminescence from MoSe2 can be injected directly into these on-chip waveguides. Our fabrication methods are compatible with large-scale roll-to-roll manufacturing techniques, highlighting a potential cost-effective and scalable hybrid plasmonic and 2D semiconductor platform for integrated nanophotonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tellegen response is a nonreciprocal effect which couples electric and magnetic responses of the medium and enables unique optical properties. Here, we develop a semi-analytical model of a Tellegen particle made of magneto-optical material and explicitly compute its magnetoelectric polarizability. We demonstrate that it could substantially exceed the geometric mean of electric and magnetic polarizabilities giving rise to strong and controllable effective Tellegen response in metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Length-flexible strategies for efficient SERS performance in gold-nanorod-gapped nanoantennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) using gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas has shown great potential in various applications. This reflects in their large values of the customary figure of merit of SERS: the enhancement factor (EF), which is essentially the fourth power of the electric field integrated at the gap, the location at which target molecules are to be sensed. However, fabrication errors in the nanorod lengths can lead to significant variations in the enhancement factor, resulting in performance limitations whenever low values of EF are encountered. Here, we report both design and procedural strategies to address this issue. First, we show that by reducing the nanorod diameter from 360 nm to 260 nm, the EF minima can be avoided for any nanorod length, mitigating the impact of fabrication errors. In addition, we explore the influence of incident wave polarization and orientation on the EF. Our simulations reveal that by tilting the excitation away from normal incidence, it is possible to substantially enhance EF under conditions that would otherwise exhibit low enhancement. In particular, this includes the case of 360 nm diameter. These findings expand the fabrication tolerance and broaden the range of usability of gold-nanorod-dimer nanoantennas, enabling more robust and reliable SERS performance. Importantly, we also show that these strategies also apply to nanoantennas with covered nanorod ends, which are of particular interest for realizing hybrid devices that combine SERS with electrical transport measurements.</description>

      <title>Efficient second-harmonic emission via strong modal overlap in single-resonant lithium niobate nanocavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-efficiency second-harmonic generation (SHG) in compact integrated photonic systems is crucial for advancing nonlinear optical technologies. However, achieving exceptional conversion efficiencies while maintaining stable performance remains a significant challenge. Here, we report a high-Q single-resonant photonic crystal nanobeam cavity (PCNBC) on a polymer-loaded lithium niobate on insulator (LNOI) platform, which enables bright second-harmonic (SH) emission. Through synergistic optimization of modal confinement and spatial overlap in a y-cut LN architecture, our device achieves a normalized SHG conversion efficiency of 163%/W, outperforming previous LN-based photonic crystal cavities LN-based photonic crystal cavities by over three orders of magnitude. The visible SH emission at 768.77 nm exhibits a single-lobe radiation pattern with precise spectral alignment between fundamental (FH) and second-harmonic (SH) modes, a critical feature for integrated photonic circuits. Remarkably, the conversion efficiency remains stable under thermal variations up to 20{\deg}C, addressing a key limitation of multi-resonant systems. High-order cavity modes are directly visualized via CCD imaging, confirming strong spatial overlap. This work establishes a record SHG conversion efficiency for LN microcavities and provides a scalable, temperature-insensitive architecture for nonlinear light sources, with immediate applications in quantum optics and chip-scale interconnects.</description>

      <title>Structured Gaussians From Geometric Quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a geometric description of structured Gaussian beams, a form a structured light, by applying geometric quantisation and symplectic reduction to the 2D harmonic oscillator. Our results show that the geometric quantisation of the oscillator's reduced phase space coincides with the modal Poincar\'e sphere in optics. We explicitly consider the case of the Generalised Hermite-Laguerre-Gauss modes, identifying their interbasis expansions with rotations of the reduced phase space and the geometric data accompanying the quantisation. This description simplifies the presentation of $SU(2)$ symmetries in structured light beams and is extensible to other symmetry groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In electromagnetism, the model of Maxwell's equations yields accurate and trustworthy predictions. Numerical solvers can reach electromagnetic solutions far beyond the set of analytical closed-form solutions; this is crucial in metamaterials design where the goal is to find the geometry that generates an optimal electromagnetic solution for a desired property. Then why do we still need to create computational methodologies in metamaterials research? And why should we care about analytical models? The simulation and optimization bottlenecks limit the range of applications of the state of the art. Hence, there is room for opportunities to create new computational methodologies. Semi-analytical methods that are customized for classes of applications enable simulation and optimization. We detail the state of the research in customized methodologies using the illustrative example of optical metasurfaces and suggest best practices. We also discuss how machine learning may enhance these methodologies.</description>

      <title>Giant Second Harmonic Generation from 3R-MoS$_2$ Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have long served as a cornerstone technique to enhance nonlinear processes, enabling frequency conversion, efficient light manipulation and integrated photonic devices. However, traditional bulk materials often suffer from high absorption losses, hindering the second harmonic generation (SHG) efficiency. Here, we develop a novel approach exploiting quasi-bound state in continuum (qBIC) to achieve giant SHG efficiency in metasurfaces utilizing 3R-MoS$_2$, with high index, superior damage threshold and inherent nonlinearity. The high refractive index of 3R-MoS$_2$, facilitates the high-quality factor (Q) metasurfaces, leading to reduced radiation leakage and localized light confinement within qBIC resonances, with which a remarkable 2000-fold enhancement in SHG intensity has been experimentally demonstrated. Additionally, the twist angle between the lattice orientation and the metasurface unit geometry exhibits a 120$^\circ$ periodicity in its influence on SHG behaviour. By strategically designing to realize the qBIC and exciton dual resonances and optimized twist angle (30$^\circ$), SHG conversion efficiency was boosted to ~1%, which is around 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of the best metasurfaces on traditional bulk materials. This approach enables potential applications in various areas of nonlinear optics, including frequency conversion, light manipulation, integrated photonics, and quantum communications.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) enables label-free functional imaging by capturing temporal OCT signal variations caused by intracellular and intratissue motions. However, the relationship between DOCT signals and the sample motion behind them remains unclear. This paper presents a comprehensive DOCT simulation framework that incorporates mathematical models of intracellular/intratissue motions, two OCT signal generator types that generate OCT signal time sequences from the moving scatterer models, and representative DOCT algorithms. The theory and algorithms of the framework are described in detail, and the utility of this framework is demonstrated through numerical studies. This framework is available as open source and will enhance the understanding and utility of DOCT.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconducting pairing via quantum control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Lyapunov quantum control provides an effective strategy for enhancing superconducting correlations in the Fermi-Hubbard model without requiring careful parameter tuning. While photoinduced superconductivity is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of a monochromatic laser pulse, our approach employs a simple feedback-based protocol that prevents the decrease of superconducting correlations once they begin to form. This method enables robust enhancement of pairing across a broad range of initial pumping conditions, eliminating the need for intricate frequency and amplitude optimization. We also show that an alternative implementation, asymptotic quantum control, achieves comparable results. Furthermore, our approach can be adapted to suppress previously induced superconducting correlations, providing bidirectional control over quantum pairing states. These findings suggest practical pathways for manipulating quantum correlations in strongly interacting systems with minimal experimental complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale operations in quantum networks require efficient sorting of desired paths between nodes. In this article, we consider entanglement routing, which involves establishing an entanglement link between specific nodes in a large network of bosonic nodes. The networks are continuous-variable graph states built from finite squeezing and passive linear optics, shaped by complex network structures that mimic real-world networks. We construct a bipartite routing protocol with the specific goal of establishing a teleportation channel between two clients via passive optics operations locally operated by two different providers sharing the network. We provide criteria for extracting the aforementioned channel and, through the use of a derandomised evolutionary algorithm, extend the existing framework to study complex graph topologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral edge state is a hallmark of topological physics, which has drawn significant attention across quantum mechanics, condensed matter and optical systems. Recently, synthetic dimensions have emerged as ideal platforms for investigating chiral edge states in multiple dimensions, overcoming the limitations of real space. In this work, we demonstrate reconfigurable chiral edge states via synthetic dimensions on an integrated photonic chip. These states are realized by coupling two frequency lattices with opposite pseudospins, which are subjected to programmable artificial gauge potential and long-range coupling within a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Within this system, we are able to implement versatile strategies to observe and steer the chiral edge states, including the realization and frustration of the chiral edge states in a synthetic Hall ladder, the generation of imbalanced chiral edge currents, and the regulation of chiral behaviors as chirality, single-pseudospin enhancement, and complete suppression. This work provides a reconfigurable integrated photonic platform for simulating and steering chiral edge states in synthetic space, paying the way for the realization of high-dimensional and programmable topological photonic systems on chip.</description>

Abstract: Dynamic optical coherence tomography (DOCT) statistically analyzes fluctuations in time-sequential OCT signals, enabling label-free and three-dimensional visualization of intratissue and intracellular activities. Current DOCT methods, such as logarithmic intensity variance (LIV) and OCT correlation decay speed (OCDS) have several limitations.Namely, the DOCT values and intratissue motions are not directly related, and hence DOCT values are not interpretable in the context of the tissue motility. We introduce a new DOCT algorithm that provides more direct interpretation of DOCT in the contexts of dynamic scatterer ratio and scatterer speed in the tissue.The detailed properties of the new and conventional DOCT methods are investigated by numerical simulations, and the experimental validation with in vitro and ex vivo samples demonstrates the feasibility of the new method.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature, continuous-wave Terahertz generation in free-space with an intersubband mid-infrared photomixer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a Terahertz photomixer pumped by mid-infrared photons at 10$\mu$m wavelength. The device is based on a dual-antenna architecture, in which a two-dimensional array of mid-infrared patch-antenna resonators is connected to the electrodes of a log-spiral Terahertz antenna. By exploiting intersubband absorption inside an AlGaAs-GaAs multi-quantum-well heterostructure, a photocurrent is coherently generated at the difference frequency between two quantum cascade lasers. The photocurrent drives the antenna electrodes allowing tunable, continuous-wave generation in free-space up to 1 Terahertz at room temperature. By experimentally studying the photomixer frequency response and dark impedance, we demonstrate that the observed power roll-off at high-frequency is limited by the combined effect of the photoexcited carrier's intrinsic lifetime and of the device $RC$ time constant. In the spectral range investigated we obtain, in continuous-wave, mid-infrared $\rightarrow$ Terahertz conversion efficiencies exceeding by orders of magnitude those of unipolar devices exploiting $\chi^{(2)}$ processes.</description>

      <title>Neural-network based high-speed volumetric dynamic optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09428v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wedemonstratedeep-learningneuralnetwork(NN)-baseddynamicopticalcoherence tomography (DOCT), which generates high-quality logarithmic-intensity-variance (LIV) DOCT images from only four OCT frames. The NN model is trained for tumor spheroid samples using a customized loss function: the weighted mean absolute error. This loss function enables highly accurate LIV image generation. The fidelity of the generated LIV images to the ground truth LIV images generated using 32 OCT frames is examined via subjective image observation and statistical analysis of image-based metrics. Fast volumetric DOCT imaging with an acquisition time of 6.55 s/volume is demonstrated using this NN-based method.</description>

      <title>Linking structure and optical properties of plasmonic nanoparticles on tunable spherical surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complexation of plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) and thermoresponsive microgels is widely exploited for applications, but a microscopic description of the mechanisms governing the spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking. Combining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art simulations and a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels controls NP-NP interactions, establishing for the first time a microscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure. Our study paves the way to experimentally investigate phase transitions on controlled curved surfaces at the nanoscale.</description>
