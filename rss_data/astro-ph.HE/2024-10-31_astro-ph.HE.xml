      <title>Do Neutron Star Ultra-Luminous X-Ray Sources Masquerade as Intermediate Mass Black Holes in Radio and X-Ray?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) were once largely believed to be powered by super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes, although in some rare cases, ULXs also serve as potential candidates for (sub-Eddington) intermediate mass black holes. However, a total of eight ULXs have now been confirmed to be powered by neutron stars, thanks to observed pulsations, and may act as contaminants for radio/X-ray selection of intermediate mass black holes. Here we present the first comprehensive radio study of seven known neutron star ULXs using new and archival data from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, combined with the literature. Across this sample there is only one confident radio detection, from the Galactic neutron star ULX Swift J0243.6+6124. The other six objects in our sample are extragalactic, and only one has coincident radio emission, which we conclude is most likely contamination from a background HII region. We conclude that with current facilities, neutron star ULXs do not produce significant enough radio emission to cause them to be misidentified as radio/X-ray selected intermediate mass black hole candidates. Thus, if background star formation has been properly considered, the current study indicates that a ULX with a compact radio counterpart is not likely to be a neutron star.</description>

      <title>The Massive and Quiescent Elliptical Host Galaxy of the Repeating Fast Radio Burst FRB20240209A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and localization of FRB20240209A by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) experiment marks the first repeating FRB localized with the CHIME/FRB Outriggers and adds to the small sample of repeating FRBs with associated host galaxies. Here we present Keck and Gemini observations of the host that reveal a redshift $z=0.1384\pm0.0004$. We perform stellar population modeling to jointly fit the optical through mid-infrared data of the host and infer a median stellar mass log$(M_*/{\rm M_{\odot}})=11.34\pm0.01$ and a mass-weighted stellar population age $\sim11$Gyr, corresponding to the most massive and oldest FRB host discovered to date. Coupled with a star formation rate $&lt;0.36\,{\rm M_{\odot}\ yr^{-1}}$, the specific star formation rate $&lt;10^{-11.8}\rm\ yr^{-1}$ classifies the host as quiescent. Through surface brightness profile modeling, we determine an elliptical galaxy morphology, marking the host as the first confirmed elliptical FRB host. The discovery of a quiescent early-type host galaxy within a transient class predominantly characterized by late-type star-forming hosts is reminiscent of short-duration gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernovae, and ultraluminous X-ray sources. Based on these shared host demographics, coupled with a large offset as demonstrated in our companion paper, we conclude that preferred progenitors for FRB20240209A include magnetars formed through merging binary neutron stars/white dwarfs or the accretion-induced collapse of a white dwarf, or a luminous X-ray binary. Together with FRB20200120E localized to a globular cluster in M81, our findings provide strong evidence that some fraction of FRBs may arise from a process distinct from the core collapse of massive stars.</description>

      <title>A repeating fast radio burst source in the outskirts of a quiescent galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the repeating fast radio burst source FRB 20240209A using the CHIME/FRB telescope. We have detected 22 bursts from this repeater between February and July 2024, six of which were also recorded at the Outrigger station KKO. The 66-km long CHIME-KKO baseline can provide single-pulse FRB localizations along one dimension with $2^{\prime\prime}$ accuracy. The high declination of $\sim$86 degrees for this repeater allowed its detection with a rotating range of baseline vectors, enabling the combined localization region size to be constrained to $1^{\prime\prime}\times2^{\prime\prime}$. We present deep Gemini observations that, combined with the FRB localization, enabled a robust association of FRB 20240209A to the outskirts of a luminous galaxy (P(O|x) = 0.99; $L \approx 5.3 \times 10^{10}\,L_{\odot}$). FRB 20240209A has a projected physical offset of $40 \pm 5$ kpc from the center of its host galaxy, making it the FRB with the largest host galaxy offset to date. When normalized by the host galaxy size, the offset of FRB 20240209A is comparable to that of FRB 20200120E, the only FRB source known to originate in a globular cluster. We consider several explanations for the large offset, including a progenitor that was kicked from the host galaxy or in situ formation in a low-luminosity satellite galaxy of the putative host, but find the most plausible scenario to be a globular cluster origin. This, coupled with the quiescent, elliptical nature of the host as demonstrated in our companion paper, provide strong evidence for a delayed formation channel for the progenitor of the FRB source.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Multi-Messenger Constraints on the Equation of State of Cold Dense Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize the now substantial amount of astrophysical observations of neutron stars (NSs), along with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at high density, to directly constrain the NS Equation of State (EoS). To this end, we construct non-parametric EoS priors by using Gaussian processes trained on 75 EoSs, which includes models with either hadrons, hyperons or quarks at high densities. We create a prior using the full EoS sample (model-agnostic), and one prior for each EoS family to test model discrimination. These are then utilized in a Bayesian updating scheme by first performing a complete analysis of the binary NS merger event GW170817 with minimal assumptions, and sequentially adding information from X-ray and radio NS observations, along with pQCD calculations. Besides providing standard constraints, such as the pressure at twice nuclear saturation density $p(2\rho_\text{sat})=4.3^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\,\times 10^{34}\text{dyne/cm}^{2}$, at $95\%$ confidence level, for the model agnostic prior, our methodology also allows the constraining of EoS properties such as phase transitions and differentiation among quark, hyperonic or hadronic models.</description>

      <title>Using artificial neural networks in searches for Lorentz invariance violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) in gamma rays can have multiple consequences, such as energy-dependent photon group velocity, photon instability, vacuum birefringence, and modified electromagnetic interaction. Depending on how LIV is introduced, several of these effects can occur simultaneously. Nevertheless, in experimental tests of LIV, each effect is tested separately and independently. For the first time, we are attempting to test for two effects in a single analysis: modified gamma-ray absorption and energy-dependent photon group velocity. In doing so, we are using artificial neural networks. In this contribution, we discuss our experiences with using machine learning for this purpose and present our very first results.</description>

      <title>INTEGRAL observations of magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The INTEGRAL satellite has collected a large amount of data on magnetars in our Galaxy, spanning more than 20 years starting from 2003. The large data set obtained with the IBIS/ISGRI instrument at energies above 20 keV allows us to study both the properties and long-term evolution of their persistent hard X-ray emission and the population characteristics of the short bursts emitted during active periods. We are carrying out a comprehensive analysis of the observed magnetars, exploiting the most recent calibrations and analysis software. Here we report on the long term evolution of the hard X-ray flux of the magnetars detected with ISGRI and the results of a sensitive search for short bursts in SGR J1935+2154.</description>

      <title>Detection of the extended $\gamma$-ray emission from the new supernova remnant G321.3-3.9 with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the 15 yrs of Pass 8 data recorded by the {\em Fermi} Large Area Telescope, we report the detection of an extended gigaelectronvolt emission component with a 68\% containment radius of $0^{\circ}\!.85$, which is spatially associated with the newly identified supernova remnant (SNR) G321.3-3.9. The $\gamma$-ray spectrum is best described by a log-parabola model in the energy range of 100 MeV - 1 TeV, which shows a significant spectral curvature at $\sim$ 1 GeV. Either a leptonic or a hadronic model could explain the multi-wavelength data of G321.3-3.9, while the leptonic model predicts a too low strength of magnetic field. Also considering the flat radio spectrum of G321.3-3.9 and the $\gamma$-ray upper limit in the low energy band, the hadronic model is favored. The spatial coincidence between the $\gamma$-ray morphology and the diffuse thermal X-ray emission of G321.3-3.9 and the curved gigaelectronvolt $\gamma$-ray spectrum of it make G321.3-3.9 to be similar to the typical middle-aged SNRs interacting with molecular clouds. Such characteristics provide another evidence of the potential hadronic origin for its $\gamma$-ray emission. While there is no molecular cloud detected around G321.3-3.9, which challenges the hadronic model.</description>

      <title>On the initial spin periods of magnetars born in weak supernova explosions and their gravitational wave radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial spin periods of newborn magnetars are \textbf{strongly associated with the origin of their strong magnetic fields, both of which can affect the electromagnetic radiation and gravitational waves (GWs) emitted at their birth.} Combining the upper limit $E_{\rm SNR}\lesssim10^{51}$ erg on the explosion energies of \textbf{the supernova (SN) remnants around slowly-spinning magnetars} with a detailed investigation on the evolution of newborn magnetars, we set constraints on the initial spin periods of magnetars \textbf{born in weak SN explosions}. Depending on the conversion efficiency $\eta$ of the electromagnetic energy of \textbf{these} newborn magnetars into the kinetic energy of SN ejecta, the minimum initial spin periods of \textbf{these} newborn magnetars are $P_{\rm i, min}\simeq 5-6$ ms for an ideal efficiency $\eta=1$, $P_{\rm i, min}\simeq 3-4$ ms for a possible efficiency $\eta=0.4$, and $P_{\rm i, min}\simeq 1-2$ ms for a relatively low efficiency $\eta=0.1$. \textbf{Based on these constraints and adopting reasonable values for the physical parameters of the newborn magnetars, we find that their GW radiation at $\nu_{\rm e,1}=\nu$ may be undetectable by the Einstein Telescope (ET) since the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (${\rm S/N}$) is only 2.41 even the sources are located at a very close distance of 5 Mpc, where $\nu$ are the spin frequencies of the magnetars. At such a distance, the GWs emitted at $\nu_{\rm e,2}=2\nu$ from the newborn magnetars with dipole fields $B_{\rm d}=5\times10^{14}$ and $10^{15}$ G may be detectable by the ET because ${\rm S/N}$ are 10.01 and 19.85, respectively. However, if these newborn magnetars are located at $20$ Mpc away in the Virgo supercluster, no GWs could be detected by the ET due to low ${\rm S/N}$.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the internal physics of neutron stars from the observational data of several young pulsars: the role of a power-law decaying dipole magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observational data (e.g., the timing data and magnetic tilt angles $\chi$) of young pulsars can be used to probe some critical issues about the internal physics of neutron stars (NSs), for instance, the number of precession cycles $\xi$ and the internal magnetic field configuration (IMFC) of NSs. Evolution of the dipole magnetic field $B_{\rm d}$ of NSs may play an important role in determining the final results. In this work, a power-law form is adopted to describe the decay of $B_{\rm d}$. In such a scenario, the IMFC and $\xi$ of young pulsars with an ordinary $B_{\rm d}\sim10^{12}-\-10^{13}$ G and a steady braking index $n$ are investigated. Since the tilt angle change rates $\dot{\chi}$ of pulsars with $n&lt;3$ can be theoretically predicted, a test on the power-law decay model can thus be made by comparing the theoretical values to that obtained from observations. However, such a comparison can only be made on the Crab pulsar currently, and the results show that the power-law decay model is inconsistent with the Crab's observations. We suggest that rather than decay, the Crab's $B_{\rm d}$ should increase with time at a rate $\sim12-14$ G/s. A definite conclusion on the validity of the power-law decay model for pulsars with ordinary $B_{\rm d}$ may be given if $\dot{\chi}$ of other pulsars could be measured.</description>

      <title>Investigating the neutron star physics through observations of several young pulsars in the dipole-field re-emergence scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observed timing data, magnetic tilt angle $\chi$, and age of young pulsars could be used to probe some important issues about neutron star (NS) physics, e.g., the NS internal magnetic field configuration, and the number of precession cycles $\xi$. \textbf{Both} quantities are critical in studying the continuous gravitational wave emission from pulsars, and the latter generally characterizes the mutual interactions between superfluid neutrons and other particles in the NS interior. The timing behavior of pulsars can be influenced by the dipole field evolution, which instead of decaying, may increase with time. An increase in the dipole field may result from the re-emergence of the initial dipole field $B_{\rm d,i}$ that was buried into the NS interior shortly after the birth of the NS. In this work, the field re-emergence scenario $\xi$ and the internal field configuration of several young pulsars, as well as their $B_{\rm d, i}$ are investigated by assuming typical accreted masses $\Delta M$. Moreover, since the Crab pulsar has an exactly known age and its tilt angle change rate can be inferred from observations, we can set stringent constraints on its $\xi$, $B_{\rm d,i}$, and $\Delta M$. Although for other young pulsars without exactly known ages and tilt angle change rates, these quantities cannot be accurately determined, we find that their $\xi$ are generally within $\sim10^4-10^6$, and some of them probably have magnetar-strength $B_{\rm d,i}$. Our work could be important for investigating the transient emissions associated with NSs, the origin of strong magnetic fields of NSs, pulsar population, continuous gravitational wave emission from pulsars, and accretion under extreme conditions in principle.</description>

      <title>Minute time scale variability in $\gamma$-ray flare of BL Lacertae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In October 2024, The object BL Lac experienced a brightest flaring event in gamma-ray ($&gt;$100 MeV) with a historical $\gamma$-ray flux of $\sim$10$^{-5}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. Soon after the event was followed across the waveband and in X-ray (0.3-10 keV) it was also found to be flaring with the maximum flux achieved during this event as 8.30$\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The high gamma-ray significance enables us to probe the shortest time scale variability possible and for that, we produced the orbital binned light curve, 5 minutes binned light curve, and the 2 minutes binned light curve. A clear variation is seen in the 5-minute light curve and is fitted with the sum of exponentials to derive the rise and decay time scale which ranges between 3 to 12 minutes. The fastest variability time is also estimated to be an order of 1 minute from 2 minute. The estimated size of the emission region is very small (10$^{13}$ cm) compared to the size of the black hole event horizon. The location of the emission region is estimated to be very close to the supermassive black hole (10$^{14}$ cm) and much inside the BLR (0.1 pc). We discussed the possible way to explain this fast-flux variability in BL Lac.</description>

      <title>Spectral features and variable circular polarisation in the radio emission from the pre-cataclysmic variable QS Vir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: QS Vir is a low-accretion rate cataclysmic variable (CV), or pre-CV, as the M dwarf companion is just filling its Roche lobe. We recently identified radio emission from QS Vir in the Very Large Array Sky Survey, at a flux of ~1 mJy. The origin of radio emission from CVs is not fully understood, with evidence for synchrotron emission from jets and other coherent plasma emission processes, such as electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) or plasma radiation. Our aim is to constrain the radio emission mechanism for QS Vir, through spectroscopic, polarisation, and time variability measurements, all while checking for correlated X-ray variations. We took 3 epochs of new observations with the VLA in S, C, and X bands, with full Stokes polarisation information, complemented by near-simultaneous Swift/XRT X-ray data. Radio spectra are extracted to search for emission features characteristic of coherent plasma emission processes (e.g. high circular polarisation and narrow-band emission). We fit the X-ray spectra with absorbed power-laws, finding no strong X-ray variability. QS Vir showed a nearly flat radio spectrum, with fluxes of 0.4-0.6 mJy in all bands. Swift/XRT showed L_X ~ 5x10^29 erg/s in all observations. We identified strong, variable circular polarisation, ranging from 33+/-3% in S band in the last observation, to &lt;11% in the middle observation in all bands. Linear polarisation was not detected, with upper limits of at most 15%. Intriguingly, the S-band spectra show circularly polarised spectral bumps (width ~0.5 GHz) that rise and decay within &lt;5 minutes. We suggest that the radio emission from QS Vir consists of two components: a relatively constant, low-polarisation flat-spectrum component and a band-limited, rapidly variable, and strongly circularly polarised component. This latter coherent component may be associated with ECME or plasma radiation.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity Effects of Ultralight Boson Clouds Formed by Black Hole Superradiance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillating clouds of ultralight bosons can grow around spinning black holes through superradiance, extracting energy and angular momentum, and eventually dissipating through gravitational radiation. Gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LISA can thus probe the existence of ultralight bosons. In this study, we use fully general-relativistic solutions of the black hole-boson cloud systems to study the self-gravity effects of scalar and vector boson clouds, making only the simplifying assumption that the spacetime is axisymmetric (essentially corresponding to taking an oscillation average). We calculate the self-gravity shift in the cloud oscillation frequency, which determines the frequency evolution of the gravitational wave signal, finding that this effect can be up to twice as large in the relativistic regime compared to non-relativistic estimates. We use this to improve the superrad waveform model, and estimate that this reduces the theoretical phase error to a few cycles over the characteristic timescale of the gravitational wave emission timescale for the louder vector boson signals. We also perform an analysis of the spacetime geometry of these systems, calculating how the cloud changes the innermost stable circular orbit and light-ring around the black hole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The physics content of the QGSJET-III Monte Carlo model of high energy hadronic interactions is briefly described. The predictions of the model for extensive air shower characteristics are presented in comparison to the corresponding results of other Monte Carlo generators of cosmic ray interactions. The results of a recent quantitative analysis of uncertainties for such predictions are discussed, notably, regarding possibilities to enhance the muon content of extensive air showers or to delay the air shower development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that is based on the extended Press-Schechter formalism and phenomenological modelling of star formation. The model yields BH mass-stellar mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. If the efficiency for BH mergers is high the JWST data prefer light seeds while the pre-JWST data prefers heavy seeds. The fit improves for a smaller merger efficiency, $O(0.1)$, for which both data prefer heavy seeds, while also accommodating the PTA GW background data.</description>

      <title>Two-detector flavor sensitivity to ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos, with energies above 100 PeV, could be finally discovered in the near future. Measuring their flavor composition would reveal information about their production and propagation, but new techniques are needed for UHE neutrino telescopes to have the capabilities to do it. We address this by proposing a new way to measure the UHE neutrino flavor composition that does not rely on individual telescopes having flavor-identification capabilities. We manufacture flavor sensitivity from the joint detection by one telescope sensitive to all flavors -- the radio array of IceCube-Gen2 -- and one mostly sensitive to $\nu_\tau$ -- GRAND. From this limited flavor sensitivity, predominantly to $\nu_\tau$, and even under conservative choices of neutrino flux and detector size, we extract important insight. For astrophysics, we forecast meaningful constraints on the neutrino production mechanism; for fundamental physics, vastly improved constraints on Lorentz-invariance violation. These are the first measurement forecasts of the UHE $\nu_\tau$ content.</description>

      <title>Classifying binary black holes from Population III stars with the Einstein Telescope: A machine-learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Third-generation (3G) gravitational-wave detectors such as the Einstein Telescope (ET) will observe binary black hole (BBH) mergers at redshifts up to $z\sim 100$. However, an unequivocal determination of the origin of high-redshift sources will remain uncertain because of the low signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) and poor estimate of their luminosity distance. This study proposes a machine-learning approach to infer the origins of high-redshift BBHs. We specifically differentiate those arising from Population III (Pop. III) stars, which probably are the first progenitors of star-born BBH mergers in the Universe, and those originated from Population I-II (Pop. I-II) stars. We considered a wide range of models that encompass the current uncertainties on Pop. III BBH mergers. We then estimated the parameter errors of the detected sources with ET using the Fisher information-matrix formalism, followed by a classification using XGBoost, which is a machine-learning algorithm based on decision trees. For a set of mock observed BBHs, we provide the probability that they belong to the Pop. III class while considering the parameter errors of each source. In our fiducial model, we accurately identify $\gtrsim 10\%$ of the detected BBHs that originate from Pop. III stars with a precision $&gt;90\%$. Our study demonstrates that machine-learning enables us to achieve some pivotal aspects of the ET science case by exploring the origin of individual high-redshift GW observations. We set the basis for further studies, which will integrate additional simulated populations and account for further uncertainties in the population modeling.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive analysis of the Apertif Fast Radio Burst sample: similarities with young, energetic neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of fast radio bursts (FRBs) has become the main science driver of recent dedicated FRB surveys. Between July 2019 and February 2022, we carried out ALERT, an FRB survey at 1370 MHz using the Apertif instrument installed at the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT). Here we report the detection of 18 new FRBs, and we study the properties of the entire 24 burst sample detected during the survey. For five bursts, we identify host galaxy candidates with &gt;50% probability association. We observe an average linear polarisation fraction of $\sim$43% and an average circular polarisation fraction consistent with 0%. A third of the FRBs display multiple components. The sample next reveals a population of highly scattered bursts, which is most likely to have been produced in the immediate circumburst environment. Furthermore, two FRBs show evidence for high rotation measures, reaching |RM|&gt;$10^3$ rad m$^{-2}$ in the source reference frames. Together, the scattering and rotation measures ALERT finds prove that a large fraction of FRBs are embedded in complex media such as star forming regions or supernova remnants. Through the discovery of the third most dispersed FRB so far, we show that one-off FRBs can emit at frequencies in excess of 6 GHz. Finally, we determine an FRB all-sky rate of $459^{+208}_{-155}$ sky$^{-1}$ day$^{-1}$ above a fluence limit of 4.1 Jy ms, and a fluence cumulative distribution with a power law index $\gamma=-1.23\pm0.06\pm0.2$, which is roughly consistent with the Euclidean Universe predictions. Through the high resolution in time, frequency, polarisation and localisation that ALERT featured, we were able to determine the morphological complexity, polarisation, local scattering and magnetic environment, and high-frequency luminosity of FRBs. We find all these strongly resemble those seen in young, energetic, highly magnetised neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Neutrino quantum kinetics in two spatial dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our understanding of neutrino flavor conversion in the innermost regions of core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers is mostly limited to spherically symmetric configurations that facilitate the numerical solution of the quantum kinetic equations. In this paper, we simulate neutrino quantum kinetics within a (2+1+1) dimensional setup: we model the flavor evolution during neutrino decoupling from matter in two spatial dimensions, one neutrino momentum variable, and time; taking into account non-forward neutral current and charged current collisions of neutrinos with the matter background, as well as neutrino advection. In order to mimic fluctuations in the neutrino emission and matter background, and explore their effect on the flavor evolution, we introduce perturbations in the collision term as well as in the vacuum term of the Hamiltonian. Because of such perturbations, the initial symmetry of the neutrino field across the simulation annulus is broken and flavor conversion is qualitatively affected, with regions of larger flavor conversion alternating across the simulation annulus. In addition, neutrino advection is responsible for spreading flavor waves across neighboring spatial regions. Although based on a simplified setup, our findings highlight the importance of modeling neutrino quantum kinetics in multi-dimensions to assess the impact of neutrinos on the physics of compact astrophysical sources and nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Diffuse Neutrino Background from Magnetorotational Stellar Core Collapses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09126v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A statistically significant detection of the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is around the corner. To this purpose, we assess the contribution to the DSNB of magnetorotational collapses of massive stars, relying on a suite of state-of-the-art three-dimensional neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We find that neutrinos from magnetorotational core collapses boost the high-energy tail of the DSNB spectrum, similar to what is expected from neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses. The latest data from the Super-Kamiokande Collaboration can already exclude that more than $13\%$ of all collapsing massive stars undergo magnetorotational collapses under optimistic assumptions. A DSNB detection at $3 \sigma$ could take place up to $4$ yr earlier at Super-Kamiokande-Gadolinium or JUNO if the fraction of magnetorotational collapses should be larger than $10\%$. Fascinatingly, if the fraction of magnetorotational stellar collapses should be larger than $19\%$ ($13\%$), Hyper-Kamiokande could measure such a fraction at $3\sigma$ after ($10$ yr) $20$ yr of DSNB data taking. The combination of DSNB and electromagnetic data has the potential to resolve the degenerate contributions from magnetorotational and neutrino-driven black hole-forming collapses, providing crucial insight on the properties of the population of collapsing massive stars.</description>

      <title>The CRAFT Coherent (CRACO) upgrade I: System Description and Results of the 110-ms Radio Transient Pilot Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results from a new backend on the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Commensal Realtime ASKAP Fast Transient COherent (CRACO) upgrade. CRACO records millisecond time resolution visibility data, and searches for dispersed fast transient signals including fast radio bursts (FRB), pulsars, and ultra-long period objects (ULPO). With the visibility data, CRACO can localise the transient events to arcsecond-level precision after the detection. Here, we describe the CRACO system and report the result from a sky survey carried out by CRACO at 110ms resolution during its commissioning phase. During the survey, CRACO detected two FRBs (including one discovered solely with CRACO, FRB 20231027A), reported more precise localisations for four pulsars, discovered two new RRATs, and detected one known ULPO, GPM J1839-10, through its sub-pulse structure. We present a sensitivity calibration of CRACO, finding that it achieves the expected sensitivity of 11.6 Jy ms to bursts of 110 ms duration or less. CRACO is currently running at a 13.8 ms time resolution and aims at a 1.7 ms time resolution before the end of 2024. The planned CRACO has an expected sensitivity of 1.5 Jy ms to bursts of 1.7 ms duration or less, and can detect 10x more FRBs than the current CRAFT incoherent sum system (i.e., 0.5-2 localised FRBs per day), enabling us to better constrain he models for FRBs and use them as cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Constraining the low-energy cosmic ray flux in the central molecular zone from MeV nuclear deexcitation line observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays (LECRs) dominate the ionization in dense regions of molecular clouds in which other ionizers such as UV or X-ray photons are effectively shielded. Thus it was argued that the high ionization rate at the central molecular zone (CMZ) of our Galaxy is mainly caused by LECRs. However, the required LECR flux is orders of magnitude higher than the extrapolation of GeV cosmic ray (CR) flux derived from GeV gamma-ray observations. In this paper, we considered two types of additional LECR components and found that only very soft anomalous CR components can explain such a high ionization rate. This LECR component will inevitably produce MeV nuclear deexcitation lines due to their inelastic scattering with the ambient gas. We calculated the MeV line emission and discussed the detectability of next-generation MeV instruments. We found that future MeV observations can be used to pin down the origin of the high ionization rate in the CMZ.</description>

      <title>Modeling of resistive relativistic astrophysical jets. Semianalytic results following a paraxial formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets of magnetized plasma are a common high-energy astrophysical phenomenon, observed across a wide range of spatial and energy scales. In the past, semianalytic meridionally self-similar models have proven highly successful in deciphering the intricate mechanisms that determine their acceleration, collimation, and morphological characteristics. In this work, we present a modification of this formalism based on the angular expansion of the equations of general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics in the vicinity of the jet axis for the description of resistive relativistic spine jets. Our paraxial formalism allows for the inclusion of resistivity and of a realistic, variable adiabatic index equation of state in the mathematical formulation. The electric potential gradient along poloidal magnetic field lines, caused by a gradient in the rotational angular velocity of the field lines, was identified as the mechanism behind the emergence of ohmic dissipation in resistive jets. The semianalytic solutions that we present demonstrate that ohmic dissipation is significant only over localized dissipation regions in resistive jets. Over the extent of these regions, ohmic dissipation weakens the thermal acceleration mechanism and can even lead to the deceleration of these outflows. Additionally, the resistive jets display enhanced thermal collimation and a strengthening of their toroidal magnetic fields over the dissipation regions, resulting in smaller asymptotic opening angles and a more helical magnetic field structure compared to their non-resistive counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this catalog, we present the results of a systematic study of 199 short gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) detected by Konus-Wind between 2011 January 1 and 2021 August 31. The catalog extends the Second Catalog of short gamma-ray bursts covering the period 1994-2010 by ten years of data. The resulting Konus-Wind short GRB sample includes 494 bursts. From temporal and spectral analyses of the sample, we provide the burst durations, spectral lags, estimates of the minimum variability time scales, rise and decay times, the results of spectral fits with three model functions, the total energy fluences, and the peak energy fluxes of the bursts. We present statistical distributions of these parameters for the complete set of 494 short gamma-ray bursts detected in 1994-2021. We discuss evidence found for an additional spectral component and the presence of extended emission in a fraction of the short GRBs. Finally, we consider the results in the context of the Type I (merger-origin)/Type II (collapsar-origin) classification, and discuss magnetar giant flare sub-sample.</description>

Abstract: Context. Pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are a source of very high energy radiation that can reach up to tera-electron volts and even peta-electron volts. Our work uses the pulsar tree, a graph theory tool recently presented to analyze the pulsar population and select candidates of interest.
  Aims. We aim to discover detectable PWNe. We also aim to test to what extent the pulsar tree is able to group detectable PWNe despite only considering the intrinsic properties of pulsars.
  Methods. We selected four pulsars as tera-electron volt PWNe candidates based on their positions in the pulsar tree. Using observed and assumed ranges of values for relevant parameters, we anticipated the possible spectral energy distributions of the PWNe of four pulsars (PSR J1208-6238, J1341-6220, J1838-0537, and J1844-0346) via a detailed time-dependent leptonic model that was already found to be appropriate for describing almost all other detected nebulae.
  Results. We estimated the likelihood of detection for the four candidates we studied by comparing the TeV fluxes predicted by the possible models with the sensitivities of different observatories. In doing so, we provide context for analyzing the advantages and caveats of using the pulsar tree position as a marker for properties that go beyond the intrinsic features of pulsars that are considered in producing the pulsar tree.</description>

      <title>The Soft X-ray Aspect of Gamma-ray Bursts in the Einstein Probe Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21687v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein Probe (EP) satellite, dedicated at time-domain high-energy astrophysics and multi-messenger astronomy, was recently launched and successfully put into operation. The wide-field X-ray telescope (WXT, 0.5-4 keV) onboard has identified multiple gamma-ray burst (GRB) events, with an average duration of approximately 100 seconds. This duration is several times longer than the average duration of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, which typically stands at around 20 seconds. Additionally, EP has detected some unknown X-ray transients whose connection to GRBs is uncertain, due to the absence of gamma-ray counterparts and efficient follow-up observation at multi-wavelengths. It is urgent to understand the physical origin of the intriguing EP GRBs. Inspired by studies of GRB 170817A, we suggest that EP GRBs may primarily consist of off-axis viewed bursts, forming a unique population among the GRB zoo. Based on LGRBs' statistical properties during the prompt phase, we explore observable properties of on-axis and off-axis LGRBs in the soft X-ray band. We predict the characteristics of several observables for these GRBs, including the duration, energy fluence, low-energy spectral index, and the slopes of Amati and Yonetoku relations, which could be tested with a larger sample of GRB events detected by EP in the future.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach for modeling the temporal and spectral evolution of kilonova systematic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kilonovae, possible electromagnetic counterparts to neutron star mergers, provide important information about high-energy transient phenomena and, in principle, also allow us to obtain information about the source properties responsible for powering the kilonova. Unfortunately, numerous uncertainties exist in kilonova modeling that, at the current stage, hinder accurate predictions. Hence, one has to account for possible systematic modeling uncertainties when interpreting the observed transients. In this work, we provide a data-driven approach to account for time-dependent and frequency-dependent uncertainties in kilonova models. Through a suite of tests, we find that the most reliable recovery of the source parameters and description of the observational data can be obtained through a combination of kilonova models with time- and frequency-dependent systematic uncertainties. We apply our new method to analyze AT2017gfo. While recovering a total ejecta mass consistent with previous studies, our approach gives insights into the temporal and spectral evolution of the systematic uncertainties of this kilonova. We consistently find a systematic error below $1$ mag between $1$ to $5$ days after the merger. Our work addresses the need for early follow-up of kilonovae at earlier times, and improved modeling of the kilonova at later times, to reduce the uncertainties outside of this time window.</description>

      <title>Orbits of particles with magnetic dipole moment around magnetized Schwarzschild black holes: Applications to S2 star orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03371v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study provides a comprehensive analytical investigation of the bound and unbound motion of magnetized particles orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, which includes all conceivable types of bounded and unbounded orbits. In particular, for planetary orbits, we perform a comparative analysis of our findings with the observed position of the S2 star carrying magnetic dipole moment around Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). We found maximum and minimum values for the parameter of magnetic interaction between the magnetic dipole of the star and the external magnetic field, as well as the energy and angular momentum of the S2 star. As a result, we obtain estimations of the magnetic dipole of the star in order of $10^6 \rm \ G\cdot cm^{3}$. Additionally, we explore deflecting trajectories akin to gravitational Rutherford scattering. In obtaining the solutions for the orbital equations, we articulate the elliptic integrals and Jacobi elliptic functions, and our study is augmented by illustrative figures and simulations.</description>

      <title>Be careful in multi-messenger inference of the Hubble constant: A path forward for robust inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-messenger observations of coalescing binary neutron stars (BNSs) are a direct probe of the expansion history of the universe and carry the potential to shed light on the disparity between low- and high-redshift measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$. To measure the value of $H_0$ with such observations requires pristine inference of the luminosity distance and the true source redshift with minimal impact from systematics. In this analysis, we carry out joint inference on mock gravitational wave (GW) signals and their electromagnetic (EM) afterglows from BNS coalescences and find that the inclination angle inferred from the afterglow light curve and apparent superluminal motion can be precise, but need not be accurate and is subject to systematic uncertainty that could be as large as $1.5\sigma$. This produces a disparity between the EM and GW inferred inclination angles, which if not carefully treated when combining observations can bias the inferred value of $H_0$. We also find that already small misalignments of $3^{\circ}-6^{\circ}$ between the inherent system inclinations for the GW and EM emission can bias the inference by $\mathcal{O}(1-2\sigma)$ if not taken into account. As multi-messenger BNS observations are rare, we must make the most out of a small number of events and harness the increased precision, while avoiding reduced accuracy. We demonstrate how to mitigate these potential sources of bias by jointly inferring the mismatch between the GW- and EM-based inclination angles and $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection for gravitational waves with normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an accelerated pipeline, based on high-performance computing techniques and normalizing flows, for joint Bayesian parameter estimation and model selection and demonstrate its efficiency in gravitational wave astrophysics. We integrate the Jim inference toolkit, a normalizing flow-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler, with the learned harmonic mean estimator. Our Bayesian evidence estimates run on $1$ GPU are consistent with traditional nested sampling techniques run on $16$ CPU cores, while reducing the computation time by factors of $5\times$ and $15\times$ for $4$-dimensional and $11$-dimensional gravitational wave inference problems, respectively. Our code is available in well-tested and thoroughly documented open-source packages, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for the wider research community.</description>
