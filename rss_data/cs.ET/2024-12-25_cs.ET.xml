      <title>Pilot-Quantum: A Quantum-HPC Middleware for Resource, Workload and Task Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As quantum hardware continues to scale, managing the heterogeneity of resources and applications -- spanning diverse quantum and classical hardware and software frameworks -- becomes increasingly critical. \textit{Pilot-Quantum} addresses these challenges as a middleware designed to provide unified application-level management of resources and workloads across hybrid quantum-classical environments. It is built on a rigorous analysis of existing quantum middleware systems and application execution patterns. It implements the Pilot Abstraction conceptual model, originally developed for HPC, to manage resources, workloads, and tasks. It is designed for quantum applications that rely on task parallelism, including: (i) \textit{Hybrid algorithms}, such as variational approaches, and (ii) \textit{Circuit cutting systems}, used to partition and execute large quantum circuits. \textit{Pilot-Quantum} facilitates seamless integration of quantum processing units (QPUs), classical CPUs, and GPUs, while supporting high-level programming frameworks like Qiskit and Pennylane. This enables users to design and execute hybrid workflows across diverse computing resources efficiently. The capabilities of \textit{Pilot-Quantum} are demonstrated through mini-applications -- simplified yet representative kernels focusing on critical performance bottlenecks. We present several mini-apps, including circuit execution across hardware and simulator platforms (e.\,g., IBM's Eagle QPU), distributed state vector simulation, circuit cutting, and quantum machine learning workflows, demonstrating significant scale (e.\,g., a 41-qubit simulation on 256 GPUs) and speedups (e.\,g., 15x for QML, 3.5x for circuit cutting).</description>

      <title>Measurement-based quantum computation from Clifford quantum cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) is a paradigm for quantum computation where computation is driven by local measurements on a suitably entangled resource state. In this work we show that MBQC is related to a model of quantum computation based on Clifford quantum cellular automata (CQCA). Specifically, we show that certain MBQCs can be directly constructed from CQCAs which yields a simple and intuitive circuit model representation of MBQC in terms of quantum computation based on CQCA. We apply this description to construct various MBQC-based Ans\"atze for parameterized quantum circuits, demonstrating that the different Ans\"atze may lead to significantly different performances on different learning tasks. In this way, MBQC yields a family of Hardware-efficient Ans\"atze that may be adapted to specific problem settings and is particularly well suited for architectures with translationally invariant gates such as neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>DelGrad: Exact event-based gradients in spiking networks for training delays and weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) inherently rely on the timing of signals for representing and processing information. Incorporating trainable transmission delays, alongside synaptic weights, is crucial for shaping these temporal dynamics. While recent methods have shown the benefits of training delays and weights in terms of accuracy and memory efficiency, they rely on discrete time, approximate gradients, and full access to internal variables like membrane potentials. This limits their precision, efficiency, and suitability for neuromorphic hardware due to increased memory requirements and I/O bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, we propose DelGrad, an analytical, event-based method to compute exact loss gradients for both synaptic weights and delays. The inclusion of delays in the training process emerges naturally within our proposed formalism, enriching the model's search space with a temporal dimension. Moreover, DelGrad, grounded purely in spike timing, eliminates the need to track additional variables such as membrane potentials. To showcase this key advantage, we demonstrate the functionality and benefits of DelGrad on the BrainScaleS-2 neuromorphic platform, by training SNNs in a chip-in-the-loop fashion. For the first time, we experimentally demonstrate the memory efficiency and accuracy benefits of adding delays to SNNs on noisy mixed-signal hardware. Additionally, these experiments also reveal the potential of delays for stabilizing networks against noise. DelGrad opens a new way for training SNNs with delays on neuromorphic hardware, which results in less number of required parameters, higher accuracy and ease of hardware training.</description>

      <title>Modular Autonomous Vehicle in Heterogeneous Traffic Flow: Modeling, Simulation, and Implication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular autonomous vehicles (MAVs) represent a groundbreaking concept that integrates modularity into the ongoing development of autonomous vehicles. This innovative design introduces unique features to traffic flow, allowing multiple modules to seamlessly join together and operate collectively. To understand the traffic flow characteristics involving these vehicles and their collective operations, this study established a modeling framework specifically designed to simulate their behavior within traffic flow. The mixed traffic flow, incorporating arbitrarily formed trains of various modular sizes, is modeled and studied. Simulations are conducted under varying levels of traffic demand and penetration rates to examine the traffic flow dynamics in the presence of these vehicles and their operations. The microscopic trajectories, MAV train compositions, and macroscopic fundamental diagrams of the mixed traffic flow are analyzed. The simulation findings indicate that integrating MAVs and their collective operations can substantially enhance capacity, with the extent of improvement depending on the penetration rate in mixed traffic flow. Notably, the capacity nearly doubles when the penetration rate exceeds 75%. Furthermore, their presence significantly influences and regulates the free-flow speed of the mixed traffic. Particularly, when variations in operational speed limits exist between the MAVs and the background traffic, the mixed traffic adjusts to the operating velocity of these vehicles. This study provides insights into potential future traffic flow systems incorporating emerging MAV technologies.</description>

      <title>On the ETHOS of AI Agents: An Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17114v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a world increasingly defined by machine intelligence, the future depends on how we govern the development and integration of AI into society. Recent initiatives, such as the EU AI Act, EDPB opinion, U.S. Bipartisan House Task Force and NIST AI Risk Management Report, highlight the urgent need for robust governance frameworks to address the challenges posed by advancing AI technologies. However, existing frameworks fail to adequately address the rise of AI agents or the ongoing debate between centralized and decentralized governance models. To bridge these gaps, we propose the Ethical Technology and Holistic Oversight System framework, which leverages Web3 technologies, including blockchain, smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and soulbound tokens, to establish a decentralized global registry for AI agents. ETHOS incorporates the concept of AI specific legal entities, enabling these systems to assume limited liability and ensuring accountability through mechanisms like insurance and compliance monitoring. Additionally, the framework emphasizes the need for a collaborative, participatory approach to AI governance, engaging diverse stakeholders through public education, transparency, and international coordination. ETHOS balances innovation with ethical accountability, providing a forward looking strategy for the responsible integration of AI agents into society. Finally, this exploration reflects the emergence of a new interdisciplinary field we define as Systems Thinking at the Intersection of AI, Web3, and Society.</description>
