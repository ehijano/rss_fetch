      <title>Optimizing Portfolios with Pakistan-Exposed ETFs: Risk and Performance Insight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the investment landscape of Pakistan as an emerging and frontier market, focusing on implications for international investors, particularly those in the United States, through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with exposure to Pakistan. The analysis encompasses 30 ETFs with varying degrees of exposure to Pakistan, covering the period from January 1, 2016, to February 2024. This research highlights the potential benefits and risks associated with investing in these ETFs, emphasizing the importance of thorough risk assessments and portfolio performance comparisons. By providing descriptive statistics and performance metrics based on historical optimization, this paper aims to equip investors with the necessary insights to make informed decisions when optimizing their portfolios with Pakistan-exposed ETFs. The second part of the paper introduces and assesses dynamic optimization methodologies. This section is designed to explore the adaptability and performance metrics of dynamic optimization techniques in comparison with conventional historical optimization methods. By integrating dynamic optimization into the investigation, this research aims to offer insights into the efficacy of these contrasting methodologies in the context of Pakistan-exposed ETFs. The findings underscore the significance of Pakistan's market dynamics within the broader context of emerging markets, offering a pathway for diversification and potential growth in investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Multi-Hypothesis Prediction for Portfolio Optimization: A Structured Ensemble Learning Approach to Risk Diversification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03919v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A framework for portfolio allocation based on multiple hypotheses prediction using structured ensemble models is presented. Portfolio optimization is formulated as an ensemble learning problem, where each predictor focuses on a specific asset or hypothesis. The portfolio weights are determined by optimizing the ensemble's parameters, using an equal-weighted portfolio as the target, serving as a canonical basis for the hypotheses. Diversity in learning among predictors is parametrically controlled, and their predictions form a structured input for the ensemble optimization model. The proposed methodology establishes a link between this source of learning diversity and portfolio risk diversification, enabling parametric control of portfolio diversification prior to the decision-making process. Moreover, the methodology demonstrates that the diversity in asset or hypothesis selection, based on predictions of future returns, before and independently of the ensemble learning stage, also contributes to the out-of-sample portfolio diversification. The sets of assets with more diverse but lower average return predictions are preferred over less diverse selections. The methodology enables parametric control of diversity in both the asset selection and learning stages, providing users with significant control over out-of-sample portfolio diversification prior to decision-making. Experiments validate the hypotheses across one-step and multi-step decisions for all parameter configurations and the structured model variants using equity portfolios.</description>
