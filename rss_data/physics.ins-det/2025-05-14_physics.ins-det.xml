      <title>$\tau$HK: a modular housekeeping system for cryostats and balloon payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\tau$HK is a versatile experiment housekeeping (HK) system designed to perform cryogenic temperature readout and heater control on the upcoming Taurus balloon experiment. $\tau$HK, more broadly, is also suitable for ambient-temperature applications and general-purpose experiment input and output. It is built around an IEEE Eurocard subrack capable of housing up to 16 interchangeable daughter cards, allowing a fully populated system to support as many as 256 independent channels while drawing under 7.5\,W. This modular architecture allows experiments to expand on the existing daughter cards with ones tailored to their specific needs. There are currently three flavors of daughter cards: Resistive Temperature Device (RTD) readout, general purpose thermometer bias and readout, and load driver. The RTD board consists of a low noise lock-in amplifier that is limited only by device sensitivity over all temperature ranges. The general-purpose bias and readout board with chopping capability is primarily designed for thermometer diodes, but flexible enough to accommodate room temperature thermistors, Wheatstone bridges, optical encoders, and other devices. Finally, the load driver card can output an analog voltage for precise cryogenic heaters or it can be used to pulse width modulate high power loads. $\tau$HK is a power efficient solution for experimental housekeeping needs that is suited for the the harsh environment of stratospheric ballooning.</description>

      <title>A Non-planar ReBCO Test Coil with 3D-printed Aluminum Support Structure for the EPOS Stellarator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the test of a small scale, non-planar coil using non-insulated ReBCO tape wound on a 3D-printed aluminum support structure. A 3D-scan of the winding frame which was printed out of AlSi10Mg using selective laser melting, showed peak manufacturing deviations of 0.3 mm. We tested the coil with 21 turns of 3 mm wide tape cooled both by liquid nitrogen and with a cryocooler. We achieved a central field strength of up to 21 mT which agrees with the prediction suggesting that we manufactured the coil without defects. The peak field was reached at a supply current of 120 A. The current leads showed a contact resistance of $\left(2.25\pm0.13\right)\mu\Omega$. The discharge time $L/R$ was found to be 0.63 s in liquid nitrogen and 2.92 s when cooled by the cryocooler. From this we estimate a winding pack temperature of 41 K.</description>

      <title>Influence of Self-Absorption on Pulse Shape Discrimination in Organic Glass Scintillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic glass scintillators are an interesting alternative to liquid scintillators, offering many advantageous characteristics with few drawbacks. In this paper we investigate the influence of light self-absorption in the organic glass scintillator on its pulse shape discrimination capability. With five scintillators of different heights but same diameter, we measure photoelectron yield and Figure of Merit in neutron-gamma discrimination. The decrease of both values with increasing size is attributed to light self-absorption, while normalized Figure of Merit remains constant. The choice of gates for charge comparison method is discussed. We also use genetic algorithm to estimate decay times and intensities of fast, medium, and slow components of light pulse shapes measured with Bollinger-Thomas setup. We compare the results to trans-stilbene reference sample.</description>

      <title>Evidence of localized groundwater flow during thermal response test using distributed thermal sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four Borehole Heat Exchangers (BHE) were installed at the BRGM Shallow Geothermal Research Facility (BRGM-SGRF) in Orl{\'e}ans, France. They are sixty meters deep and eight meters apart on a line. The facility is localized in the Parisian sedimentary basin. The boreholes are in the Beauce Limestones geological layers, which are locally eroded and karstified. A special type of grouting materiel was used in order to investigate if the boreholes are actually grouted. These measures have confirmed that the four boreholes are grouted along the whole depth. Distributed Thermal Response Tests (DTRT) using optic cables alongside the heat exchangers were performed on each borehole. The distributed thermal sensing, combined with the thermal response test, allows discriminating the heat transfer between geological layers. While the first two boreholes temperature variations with respect to the depth is almost constant, again indicative of a purely conductive heat transfer, the DTS measurement technique gave evidence of a localized enhanced heat transfer on the last two boreholes, between 25 and 40 meters deep. This enhanced heat transfer is believed to be generated by a fast groundwater flow at these depths. What is remarkable is that such a rapid flow can be observed on roughly 15 meters height, while a borehole 8 meters apart exhibits a purely conductive temperature profile. The BRGM has develop a borehole heat exchanger model called SAMBA (Semi Analytical Model for Borehole heat exchanger). It discretizes the heat transfer according to the depth of the borehole, using the thermal resistance and capacity model of Bauer et al. (2011) to model heat transfer inside the borehole, and a moving infinite cylindrical source (MICS) for heat transfer in the ground. Inversion of the SAMBA model for the boreholes exhibiting groundwater flow has been performed to determine the mean ground thermal conductivity and the groundwater flow between 25 to 40 meters deep.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Efficient Radon Removal by Silver-Zeolite in a Dark Matter Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the performance of an efficient radon trap using silver-zeolite Ag-ETS-10, measured with a spherical proportional counter filled with an argon/methane mixture. Our study compares the radon reduction capabilities of silver-zeolite and the widely used activated charcoal, both at room temperature. We demonstrate that silver-zeolite significantly outperforms activated charcoal by three orders of magnitude in radon capture. Given that radon is a major background contaminant in rare event searches, our findings highlight silver-zeolite as a highly promising adsorbent, offering compelling operational advantages for both current and future dark matter and neutrino physics experiments. Additionally, this holds great promise for developing future radon reduction systems in underground laboratories in order to increase their supporting capabilities for ton-scale experiments.</description>

      <title>Quartz fluorescence backgrounds in rare-event searches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been known for almost a decade that delayed photon noise with a power law time profile follows scintillation pulses in liquid xenon particle detectors. The origin of the noise has remained unknown, and in the past two years, has become an overwhelming background for low-threshold dark matter searches aimed at O(10) GeV dark matter particle masses, as well as measurements of coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering of 8B solar neutrinos. We show that the dominant component of this delayed photon noise is due to UV-induced fluorescence of quartz photosensor windows.</description>

      <title>Simulation and measurement of Black Body Radiation background in a Transition Edge Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Any Light Particle Search II (ALPS II) experiment at DESY, Hamburg, is a Light-Shining-through-a-Wall (LSW) experiment aiming to probe the existence of axions and axion-like particles (ALPs), which are candidates for dark matter. Data collection in ALPS II is underway utilizing a heterodyne-based detection scheme. A complementary run for confirmation or as an alternative method is planned using single photon detection, requiring a sensor capable of measuring low-energy photons ($1064\,\mathrm{nm}$, $1.165\,\mathrm{eV}$) with high efficiency (higher than $50\,\%$) and a low background rate (below $7.7\cdot10^{-6}\,\mathrm{cps}$). To meet these requirements, we are investigating a tungsten Transition Edge Sensor (TES) provided by NIST, which operates in its superconducting transition region at millikelvin temperatures. This sensor exploits the drastic change in resistance caused by the absorption of a single photon. We find that the background observed in the setup with a fiber-coupled TES is consistent with Black Body Radiation (BBR) as the primary background contributor. A framework was developed to simulate BBR propagation to the TES under realistic conditions. The framework not only allows the exploration of background reduction strategies, such as improving the TES energy resolution, but also reproduces, within uncertainties, the spectral distribution of the observed background. These simulations have been validated with experimental data, in agreement with the modeled background distribution, and show that the improved energy resolution reduces the background rate in the $1064\,\mathrm{nm}$ signal region by one order of magnitude, to approximately $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{cps}$. However, this rate must be reduced further to meet the ALPS II requirements.</description>

      <title>Towards Foundation Models for Experimental Readout Systems Combining Discrete and Continuous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a (proto) Foundation Model for Nuclear Physics, capable of operating on low-level detector inputs from Imaging Cherenkov Detectors at the future Electron Ion Collider. To address limitations in existing next-token prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to leverage fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Multi-Track Reconstruction using Graph Neural Networks at Belle II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the study of an end-to-end multi-track reconstruction algorithm for the central drift chamber of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider using Graph Neural Networks for an unknown number of particles. The algorithm uses detector hits as inputs without pre-filtering to simultaneously predict the number of track candidates in an event and their kinematic properties. In a second step, we cluster detector hits for each track candidate to pass to a track fitting algorithm. Using a realistic full detector simulation including beam-induced backgrounds and detector noise taken from actual collision data, we find significant improvements in track finding efficiencies for tracks in a variety of different event topologies compared to the existing baseline algorithm used in Belle II. For events with a hypothetical long-lived massive particle with a mass in the GeV-range decaying uniformly along its flight direction into two charged particles, the GNN achieves a combined track finding and fitting efficiency of 85.4% with a fake rate of 2.5%, compared to 52.2% and 4.1% for the baseline algorithm. This is the first end-to-end multi-track machine learning algorithm for a drift chamber detector that has been utilized in a realistic particle physics environment.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Design and Monte Carlo Simulation of a Neutron Beam Shutter for Cyclotron-Based Neutron Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a novel design methodology for neutron beam shutters that integrates Monte Carlo simulations (MCNP) with machine learning techniques to enhance shielding performance and accelerate the design process. The target facility is a compact neutron science platform where neutrons are produced by proton beams from a cyclotron striking a neutron production target. The system includes both thermal and fast neutron beamlines. A beam shutter is installed on the thermal neutron line to reduce occupational radiation exposure during maintenance activities.
  In this work, 200 neutron shutter configurations with varying material sequences were simulated using MCNP. The resulting dataset was used to train a fully connected neural network to predict the neutron flux downstream of the shielding. The trained model was subsequently applied to 1,000 randomly generated shielding configurations for rapid flux prediction and performance ranking. The 20 designs with the lowest predicted flux were selected and further validated via MCNP simulations.
  Results show that the optimal design reduces the neutron flux from 5.61 x 10^9 n/cm2*s at the shutter entrance to 4.96 x 10^5 n/cm2*s at the exit, achieving a reduction of four orders of magnitude. These findings confirm that the integration of machine learning techniques can effectively reduce simulation costs and assist in identifying high-performance shielding configurations, demonstrating the strong potential of data driven approaches in neutron system design.</description>

      <title>Cluster Counting Algorithm for the CEPC Drift Chamber using LSTM and DGCNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The particle identification (PID) of hadrons plays a crucial role in particle physics experiments, especially in flavor physics and jet tagging. The cluster-counting method, which measures the number of primary ionizations in gaseous detectors, is a promising breakthrough in PID. However, developing an effective reconstruction algorithm for cluster counting remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a cluster-counting algorithm based on long short-term memory and dynamic graph convolutional neural networks for the CEPC drift chamber. Experiments on Monte Carlo simulated samples demonstrate that our machine-learning-based algorithm surpasses traditional methods. It improves the $K/\pi$ separation of PID by 10\%, meeting the PID requirements of CEPC.</description>
