      <title>Paired fermions in strong magnetic fields and daughters of even-denominator Hall plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent quantum Hall experiments have observed `daughter states' next to several plateaus at half-integer filling factors in various platforms. These states were first proposed based on model wavefunctions for the Moore-Read state by Levin and Halperin. We show that these daughters and their parents belong to an extensive family tree that encompasses all pairing channels and permits a unified description in terms of weakly interacting composite fermions. Each daughter represents a bosonic integer quantum Hall state formed by composite-fermion pairs. The pairing of the parent dictates an additional number of filled composite-fermion Landau levels. We support our field-theoretic composite-fermion treatment by using the K-matrix formalism, analysis of trial wavefunctions, and a coupled-wire construction. Our analysis yields the topological orders, quantum numbers, and experimental signatures of all daughters of paired states at half-filling and `next-generation' even-denominators. Crucially, no two daughters share the same two parents. The unique parentage implies that Hall conductance measurements alone could pinpoint the topological order of even-denominator plateaus. Additionally, we propose a numerically suitable trial wavefunction for one daughter of the SU(2)$_2$ topological order, which arises at filling factor $\nu=\frac{6}{11}$. Finally, our insights explain experimentally observed features of transitions in wide-quantum wells, such as suppression of the Jain states with the simultaneous development of half-filled and daughter states.</description>

      <title>Chern number landscape of spin-orbit coupled chiral superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductors are one of the predominant quantum electronic states of matter where topology, symmetry, and Fermiology intertwine. This is pushed to a new limit by further invoking the coupling between spin and charge degrees of freedom, which fundamentally affects the principal nature of the Cooper pair wave function. We investigate the onset of superconductivity in the Rashba-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice, which is symmetry-classified by the associated irreducible representations (irrep) of the hexagonal point group. From an instability analysis by means of the truncated-unity functional renormalization group (TU-FRG) we find the $E_2$ irrep to dominate a large fraction of phase space and to lead up to an energetically preferred gapped, chiral superconducting state. The topological phase space classification associated with the anomalous propagators obtained from TU-FRG reveals a fragmentation of the $E_2$ domain into different topological sectors with vastly differing Chern numbers. It hints at a potentially applicable high sensitivity and tunability of chiral superconductors with respect to topological edge modes and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical and Static Structure Factors in Hedgehog-Antihedgehog Order in Icosahedral 1/1 Approximant Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of magnetic long-range orders in the icosahedral quasicrystal and topological magnetic structures on the icosahedron (IC) as the hedgehog state and the antihedgehog state have attracted great interest. Here, we report our theoretical analysis of the dynamical as well as static structure of the hedgehog-antihedgehog order in the 1/1 approximant crystal (AC). By constructing the effective magnetic model for the rare-earth based AC, on the basis of the linear spin-wave theory, the excitation energy is shown to exhibit the reciprocal dispersion, as a consequence of preservation of the spatial inversion symmetry by the hedgehog-antihedgehog ordering. The static structure factor is shown to be expressed generally in the convolution form of the lattice structure factor and the magnetic structure factor on the IC(s) and the numerical calculation reveals the extinction rule. The dynamical structure factor shows that the high intensities appear in the low-energy branch along the $\Gamma$-X line and the R-$\Gamma$-M line in the reciprocal space.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity multipole order in the spin-orbit coupled metallic pyrochlore Pb$_2$Re$_2$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pyrochlore oxide Pb2Re2O7-{\delta} (PRO) is a candidate spin-orbit-coupled metal (SOCM) that exhibits a structural phase transition with inversion symmetry breaking. In this study, we report the results of detailed X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on single crystals of PRO to clarify the crystal structure below the phase transition temperature at Ts = 300 K. In the XRD patterns, a clear peak splitting is observed below Ts, indicating a cubic to tetragonal transition. Based on the group-subgroup relationship and the observed reflection conditions, the space group of the low-temperature phase is proposed to be I4122, which agrees with optical second harmonic generation measurements. This space group is the same as that of the lowest temperature structure of the analogous SOCM Cd2Re2O7 (CRO), which is realized by the emergence of odd-parity multipole order. The comparison between PRO and CRO allows for advancing our understanding on the symmetry-lowering complex order exhibited by SOCMs.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional hidden phase probed by in-plane magnetotransport in kagome metal CsV3Sb5 thin flakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal compounds with kagome structure have been found to exhibit a variety of exotic structural, electronic, and magnetic orders. These orders are competing with energies very close to each other, resulting in complex phase transitions. Some of the phases are easily observable, such as the charge density wave (CDW) and the superconducting phase, while others are more challenging to identify and characterize. Here we present magneto-transport evidence of a new phase below ~35 K in the kagome topological metal CsV3Sb5 (CVS) thin flakes between the CDW and the superconducting transition temperatures. This phase is characterized by six-fold rotational symmetry in the in-plane magnetoresistance (MR) and is connected to the orbital current order in CVS. Furthermore, the phase is characterized by a large in-plane negative magnetoresistance, which suggests the existence of a three-dimensional, magnetic field-tunable orbital current ordered phase. Our results highlight the potential of magneto-transport to reveal the interactions between exotic quantum states of matter and to uncover the symmetry of such hidden phases.</description>

      <title>Zone-selection effect of photoelectron intensity distributions in a nonsymmorphic system RAlSi (R : Ce and Nd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structures of noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetals RAlSi (R: Ce and Nd) using soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that the photoelectron intensity distribution observed in the momentum-resolved electronic bands is highly sensitive to the covered Brillouin zone (BZ) due to the zone-selection effect arising from the nonsymmorphic crystal structure of RAlSi. Our data reconstruct the photoelectron distributions varied according to the zone-selection effect, and reveal comprehensive information about the electronic band structures reproduced by band calculations. This detailed information enables us to experimentally trace the Weyl-cone dispersion throughout three-dimensional momentum space, providing valuable insights into the unique properties of RAlSi.</description>

      <title>Solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of graphene rectangulenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete analytical solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of undoped and doped graphene rectangulenes. These are non-chiral ribbons of arbitrary length and width, whose dimensions range from simple short acene molecules all the way up to the bulk limit. We rewrite the Hubbard model in the basis of bulk and edge non-interacting eigen-states, and provide explicit expressions for the Coulomb matrix elements. We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic and spin spiral correlations in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model: gauge symmetry, Ward identities, and dynamical mean-field theory analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We reconsider the derivation of Ward identities for spin stiffnesses, which determine the non-linear sigma model of magnetic degrees of freedom of interacting electrons in the presence of antiferromagnetic or incommensurate correlations. We emphasize that in the approaches, which do not break explicitly spin symmetry of the action, the spatial components of gauge kernel, which is used to obtain spin stiffnesses, remain gauge invariant even in case of spontaneous spin symmetry breaking. We derive the corrected Ward identities, which account for this gauge invariance. We emphasize that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffnesses is not fixed by the obtained identities, and show that the infinitesimally small external staggered field is crucially important to obtain finite static uniform transverse susceptibility. On the other hand, we find that the spatial spin stiffnesses are determined by the gauge kernel of the Legendre transformed theory, which is in general {\it different} from the gauge kernel of the original theory and obtain an explicit expressions for spatial spin stiffnesses through susceptibilities and current correlation functions. We verify numerically the obtained results within dynamic mean field theory, and obtain doping dependencies of the resulting spin-wave stiffnesses for antiferromagnetic and incommensurate phase.</description>

      <title>Observation of Mermin-Wagner behavior in LaFeO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic materials attract a lot of attention since they potentially exhibit new magnetic properties due to, e.g., strongly enhanced spin fluctuations. However, the suppression of the long-range magnetic order in two dimensions due to long-wavelength spin fluctuations, as suggested by the Mermin-Wagner theorem, has been questioned for finite-size laboratory samples. Here we study the magnetic properties of a dimensional crossover in superlattices composed of the antiferromagnetic LaFeO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ that, thanks to their large lateral size, allowed examination using a sensitive magnetic probe - muon spin rotation spectroscopy. We show that the iron electronic moments in superlattices with 3 and 2 monolayers of LaFeO$_3$ exhibit a static antiferromagnetic order. In contrast, in the superlattices with single LaFeO$_3$ monolayer, the moments do not order and fluctuate to the lowest measured temperature as expected from the Mermin-Wagner theorem. Our work shows how dimensionality can be used to tune the magnetic properties of ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity by Strong Electron Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity is a spin-splitting phenomenon from a helical structure with a considerably effective spin-orbit coupling. This unexpectedly large spin-splitting phenomenon has been experimentally observed in chiral organic molecules, which typically show a weak spin-orbit coupling. To understand this, we use the renormalized mean-field theory and Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formulas to study the transport properties of single-stranded DNA in the presence of strong electron correlation. It shows a significant spin polarization of 46.5% near the Coulomb repulsion limit, which explains the extremely high spin polarization observed in experiments. Compared to systems without electron correlation, the averaged spin polarization in this case is 2 to 4 times greater across various system sizes. Furthermore, the parameter dependence of the spin polarization and the underlying Metal-Insulator transition are studied.</description>

      <title>Long-range magnetic order in CePdAl$_3$ enabled by orthorhombic deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of structural deformation on the magnetic properties of orthorhombic CePdAl$_3$ in relation to its tetragonal polymorph. Utilizing x-ray and neutron diffraction we establish that the crystal structure has the $Cmcm$ space group symmetry and exhibits pseudo-tetragonal twinning. According to density-functional calculations the tetragonal-orthorhombic deformation mechanism has its grounds in relatively small free enthalpy difference between the polymorphs, allowing either phase to be quenched and fully accounts for the twinned microstructure of the orthorhombic phase. Neutron diffraction measurements show that orthorhombic CePdAl$_3$ establishes long-range magnetic order below $T_\mathrm{N}$=5.29 (5) K characterized by a collinear, antiferromagnetic arrangement of magnetic moments. Magnetic anisotropies of orthorhombic CePdAl$_3$ arise from strong spin-orbit coupling as evidenced by the crystal-field splitting of the $4f$ multiplet, fully characterised with neutron spectroscopy. We discuss the potential mechanism of frustration posed by antiferromagnetic interactions between nearest neighbours in the tetragonal phase, which hinders the formation of long-range magnetic order in tetragonal CePdAl$_3$. We propose that orthorhombic deformation releases the frustration and allows for long-range magnetic order.</description>

      <title>Single helicity of the triple-$q$ triangular skyrmion lattice state in cubic chiral helimagnet EuPtSi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the magnetic helicity of the triple-$q$ magnetic structure of the triangular skyrmion lattice in the ``A-phase" of EuPtSi for a magnetic field along the [111] axis by resonant x-ray diffraction using a circularly polarized beam. We show that all three Fourier components of the triple-$q$ structure are perpendicular to the respective $q$ vectors and have the same helicity. They are connected by the rotation operations about the [111] axis. The helicity is the same as that of the single-$q$ helimagnetic phase at low fields, suggesting that the antisymmetric exchange interaction inherent in the chiral structure supports the formation of the triangular skyrmion lattice. We also observe that the helical plane in the helimagnetic phase is tilted to the magnetic field to form a conical structure before the first-order transition to the skyrmion lattice phase.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the biquadratic spin interactions based on the spin cluster expansion for \textit{ab initio} tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise a calculation scheme for \textit{ab initio} tight-binding Hamiltonians to evaluate the biquadratic spin interaction. This scheme employs the spin cluster expansion with the disordered local moment method and was originally developed within the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker theory. By applying it to the two-orbital Hubbard model, we show that the evaluated biquadratic interactions agree well with those in the effective quantum spin model derived for the limit of strong correlation. This result suggests the broad applicability of the method to various magnets with large local moments. We then apply it to the \textit{ab initio} tight-binding models for bcc Fe and fcc Ni and obtain consistent results with previous studies. The present scheme offers a convenient \textit{ab initio} tool for understanding or predicting magnetic properties arising from the biquadratic interaction.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of the Curie temperature in single crystalline ferromagnetic LaCrGe$_3$ by electron irradiation-induced disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LaCrGe$_3$ has attracted attention as a potential candidate for studies of quantum phase transitions in a ferromagnetic material. The application of pressure avoids a quantum critical point by developing a new magnetic phase. It was suggested that the disorder may provide an alternative route to a quantum critical point. We used low-temperature 2.5 MeV electron irradiation to induce relatively small amounts of point-like disorder in single crystals of LaCrGe$_3$. Irradiation leads to an increase of the resistivity at all temperatures with some deviation from the Matthiessen rule. Hall effect measurements show that electron irradiation does not cause any detectable change in the carrier density. Unexpectedly, the Curie temperature, $T_{\text{FM}}$, \emph{increases} with the increase of disorder from approximately 90 K in pristine samples up to nearly 100 K in the heavily irradiated sample, with a tendency towards saturation at higher doses. Although the mechanism of this effect is not entirely clear, we conclude that it cannot be caused by effective ``doping" or ``pressure" due to electron irradiation. We suggest that disorder-induced broadening of a sharp peak in the density of states, $D(E)$, situated at $E_p=E_F-0.25$ eV below the Fermi energy, $E_F$, causes an increase in $D(E_F)$, leading to an enhancement of $T_\text{FM}$ in this itinerant ferromagnet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Novel critical phenomena beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm have been long sought after. Among many candidate scenarios, the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) constitutes the most fascinating one, and its lattice model realization has been debated over the past two decades. Here we apply the spherical Landau level regularization to study the effective (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear sigma model with a topological term and the potential DQCP therein. Utilizing the state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group method with explicit $\text{SU(2)}_\text{spin}\times\text{U(1)}_\text{charge}\times\text{U(1)}_\text{angular-momentum}$ symmetry as well as exact diagonalization simulations, we provide a comprehensive phase diagram for the model with a SO(5) continuous transition line -- extension of the previous identified SO(5) multicritical point [arXiv:2307.05307] -- while tuning interaction length. The state-operator correspondence with the conformal tower structure is used to identify the emergent conformal symmetry with the best scaling dimension of relevant primary fields and they match well with the critical exponents obtained from the crossing point analysis of the correlation ratio. Our results thus pave the way to a definitive answer of the two-decade debate on this model.</description>

Abstract: Highly disordered NbN thin films exhibit promising superconducting and optical properties. Despite extensive study, discrepancies in its basic electronic properties persist. Analysis of the optical conductivity of disordered ultra-thin NbN films, obtained from spectroscopic ellipsometry by standard Drude-Lorentz model, provides inconsistent parameters. We argue that this discrepancy arise from neglecting the presence of quantum corrections to conductivity in the IR range. To resolve this matter, we propose a modification to the Drude-Lorentz model, incorporating quantum corrections. The parameters obtained from the modified model are consistent not only with transport and superconducting measurements but also with ab initio calculations. The revisited values describing conduction electrons, which differ significantly from commonly adopted ones, are the electron relaxation rate $\Gamma\approx1.8~\textrm{eV}/\hbar$, the Fermi velocity $v_F \approx 0.7 \times 10^{6}~\textrm{ms}^{-1}$ and the electron density of states $N(E_F)=2~$states of both spins/eV/$V_{\textrm{f.u.}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural distortions and imperfections are a crucial aspect of materials science, on the macroscopic scale providing strength, but also enhancing corrosion and reducing electrical and thermal conductivity. At the nanometre scale, multi-atom imperfections, such as atomic chains and crystalline domain walls have conversely been proposed as a route to topological superconductivity, whose most prominent characteristic is the emergence of Majorana Fermions that can be used for error-free quantum computing. Here, we shed more light on the nature of purported domain walls in Fe(Se,Te) that may host 1D dispersing Majorana modes. We show that the displacement shift of the atomic lattice at these line-defects results from sub-surface impurities that warp the topmost layer(s). Using the electric field between the tip and sample, we manage to reposition the sub-surface impurities, directly visualizing the displacement shift and the underlying defect-free lattice. These results, combined with observations of a completely different type of 1D defect where superconductivity remains fully gapped, highlight the topologically trivial nature of 1D defects in Fe(Se,Te).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states at a half-filled Landau level are believed to carry an integer number $\mathcal{C}$ of chiral Majorana edge modes, reflected in their thermal Hall conductivity. We show that this number determines the primary series of Abelian fractional quantum Hall states that emerge above and below the half-filling point. On a particular side of half-filling each series may originate from two consecutive values of $\mathcal{C}$, but the combination of the series above and below half-filling uniquely identifies $\mathcal{C}$. We analyze these states both by a hierarchy approach and by a composite fermion approach. In the latter, we map electrons near a half-filled Landau level to composite fermions at a weak magnetic field and show that a bosonic integer quantum Hall state is formed by pairs of composite fermions and plays a crucial role in the state's Hall conductivity.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Computations That Capture Strict Variationality, Volume Law Behavior, and the Efficient Representation of Neural Network States</title>

Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

Abstract: CuAl2-type transition-metal (Tr) zirconides are superconductor family, and the Tr-site element substitution largely modifies its transition temperature (Tc). Here, we synthesized polycrystalline samples of Fe1-xNixZr2 by arc melting. From magnetic susceptibility measurements, bulk superconductivity was observed for 0.4 &lt;= x &lt;= 0.8, and the highest Tc of 2.8 K was observed for x = 0.6. The obtained superconductivity phase diagram exhibits dome-shaped trend, which is similar to unconventional superconductors, where magnetic fluctuations are essential for superconductivity. In addition, from the c/a lattice constant ratio analysis, we show the possible relationship between the suppression of bulk superconductivity in the Ni-rich compositions and a collapsed tetragonal transition.</description>

      <title>Frustrated Superconductivity in the Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the opposite trend of maximum $T_c$ in multilayer nickelate and cuprate superconductors, we propose an interlayer pairing scenario for the superconductivity of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ discovered recently under high pressure. Our theory reveals intrinsic frustration of the spin-singlet pairing formed between two outer layers and the same inner layer, which causes strong superconducting fluctuations between layers and thus explains the reduction of its maximum $T_c$ compared to that of the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. This supports a fundamental distinction between multilayer nickelate and cuprate superconductors associated with their potentially different (interlayer vs intralayer) pairing mechanisms. Our theory predicts extended $s^\pm$-wave gap structures in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, with varying signs and possible nodes on different Fermi pockets. We also find an intrinsic Josephson coupling with potentially interesting consequences to be examined in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Interplay between short-range and critical long-range fluctuations in the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density at quantum transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium behavior of the particle density in many-body systems undergoing quantum transitions driven by the chemical potential $\mu$. They originate from a nontrivial interplay between noncritical short-range and critical long-range quantum fluctuations. As a paradigmatic model we consider the one-dimensional fermionic Kitaev chain, for which very accurate numerical checks of our scaling ansatz can be performed up to $O(10^4)$ sites. The search for dynamic scaling behaviors of the particle density is complicated by the fact that its equilibrium (ground state) behavior is dominated by short-range fluctuations, giving rise to regular background terms and peculiar logarithmic terms from resonances between renormalization-group perturbations associated with the energy and identity operator families within the conformal field theory. To study these issues, we focus on two dynamic protocols, either instantaneous quenches or quasi-adiabatic changes of $\mu$ to the critical value $\mu_c$, unveiling out-of-equilibrium scaling behaviors of the particle density, which arise from the critical modes, within a dynamic finite-size scaling framework.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Quantum States for the Interacting Hofstadter Model with Higher Local Occupations and Long-Range Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their immense representative power, neural network quantum states (NQS) have gained significant interest in current research. In recent advances in the field of NQS, it has been demonstrated that this approach can compete with state-of-the-art numerical techniques, making NQS a compelling alternative, in particular for the simulation of large, two-dimensional quantum systems. In this study, we show that recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions can be employed to study systems relevant to current research in quantum many-body physics. Specifically, we employ a 2D tensorized gated RNN to explore the bosonic Hofstadter model with a variable local Hilbert space cut-off and long-range interactions. At first, we benchmark the RNN-NQS for the Hofstadter-Bose-Hubbard (HBH) Hamiltonian on a square lattice. We find that this method is, despite the complexity of the wave function, capable of efficiently identifying and representing most ground state properties. Afterwards, we apply the method to an even more challenging model for current methods, namely the Hofstadter model with long-range interactions. This model describes Rydberg-dressed atoms on a lattice subject to a synthetic magnetic field. We study systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ sites and identify three different regimes by tuning the interaction range and the filling fraction $\nu$. In addition to phases known from the HBH model at short-ranged interaction, we observe bubble crystals and Wigner crystals for long-ranged interactions. Especially interesting is the evidence of a bubble crystal phase on a lattice, as this gives experiments a starting point for the search of clustered liquid phases, possibly hosting non-Abelian anyon excitations. In our work we show that NQS are an efficient and reliable simulation method for quantum systems, which are the subject of current research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) studies the interaction between light and matter at the single quantum level and has played a central role in quantum science and technology. Combining the idea of cavity QED with moir\'e materials, we theoretically show that strong quantum light-matter interaction provides a way to control frustrated magnetism. Specifically, we develop a theory of moir\'e materials confined in a cavity consisting of thin polar van der Waals crystals. We show that nontrivial quantum geometry of moir\'e flat bands leads to electromagnetic vacuum dressing of electrons, which produces appreciable changes in single-electron energies and manifests itself as long-range electron hoppings. We apply our general formulation to a twisted transition metal dichalcogenide heterobilayer encapsulated by ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride layers and predict its phase diagram at different twist angles and light-matter coupling strengths. Our results indicate that the cavity confinement enables one to control magnetic frustration of moir\'e materials and might allow for realizing various exotic phases such as a quantum spin liquid.</description>

Abstract: At thermal equilibrium, we find that generalized susceptibilities encoding the static physical response properties of Hermitian many-electron systems possess inherent non-Hermitian (NH) matrix symmetries. This leads to the generic occurrence of exceptional points (EPs), i.e., NH spectral degeneracies, in the generalized susceptibilities of prototypical Fermi-Hubbard models, as a function of a single parameter such as chemical potential. We demonstrate that these EPs are necessary to promote correlation-induced thermodynamic instabilities, such as phase-separation occurring in the proximity of a Mott transition, to a topologically stable phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We use the spin functional renormalization group to investigate the $J_1$-$J_2$ quantum Heisenberg model on a square lattice. By incorporating sum rules associated with the fixed length of the spin operators as well as the nontrivial quantum dynamics implied by the spin algebra, we are able to compute the ground state phase diagram for arbitrary spin $S$, including the quantum paramagnetic phase at strong frustration. Our prediction for the extent of this paramagnetic region for $ S = 1/2 $ agrees well with other approaches that are computationally more expensive. We find that the quantum paramagnetic phase disappears for $ S \gtrsim 5 $ due to the suppression of quantum fluctuations with increasing $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing ab initio many-body perturbation theory combined with dynamical mean field theory, we discovered that in strongly correlated topological semimetals HoPtBi and PrAlGe, which exhibit topological singular points in the vicinity of the Fermi level, the formation of 4$f$ quasiparticles are forbidden. We show that blocking hybridization channels at the topological singular point effectively enhances on-site Coulomb repulsion, resulting in a substantial self-energy. This renders the topological singular point incompatible with the presence of strongly correlated electrons at the Fermi level. In contrast to the Kondo effect, our findings suggest that the topological quasiparticles in close proximity to the singular points do not hybridize with 4$f$ electrons due to the self-energy, thus hindering the manifestation of heavy-fermion behavior when the singular points persist at the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Frustration-induced quantum criticality in Ni-doped CePdAl as revealed by the $\mu$SR technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In CePdAl, the 4$f$ moments of cerium arrange to form a geometrically frustrated kagome lattice. Due to frustration, in addition to Kondo- and Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interactions, this metallic system shows a long-range magnetic order (LRO) with a $T_{\rm N}$ of only 2.7\,K. Upon Ni doping at the Pd sites, $T_{\rm N}$ is further suppressed, to reach zero at a critical concentration $x_c \approx 0.15$. Here, by using muon-spin relaxation and rotation ($\mu$SR), we investigate CePd${1-x}$Ni$_x$Al at a local level for five different Ni-concentrations, both above and below $x_c$. Like the parent CePdAl compound, for $x = 0.05$, we observe an incommensurate LRO, which turns into a quasi-static magnetic order for $x = 0.1$ and 0.14. More interestingly, away from $x_c$, for $x = 0.16$ and 0.18, we still observe a non-Fermi liquid regime, evidenced by a power-law divergence of the longitudinal relaxation at low temperatures. In this case, longitudinal field measurements exhibit a time-field scaling, indicative of a cooperative spin dynamics that persists for $x &gt; x_c$. Furthermore, like the externally applied pressure, the chemical pressure induced by Ni doping suppresses the region below $T^*$, characterized by a spin-liquid like dynamical behavior. Our results suggest that the magnetic properties of CePdAl are similarly affected by the hydrostatic- and the chemical pressure. We also confirm that the unusual non-Fermi liquid regime (compared with conventional quantum critical systems) is due to the presence of frustration that persists up to the highest Ni concentrations.</description>

      <title>$\frac{5}{2}$ fractional quantum Hall state in GaAs with Landau level mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Landau level mixing is the key in understanding the mysterious $5/2$ fractional quantum Hall effect in GaAs quantum well. Theoretical calculations with and without Landau level mixing show striking differences. However, the way to deal with the considerable strong Landau level mixing in GaAs is still unsatisfactory. We develop a method combining the screening and the perturbation theories to study the nature of the $5/2$ fractional quantum Hall effect in GaAs efficiently. The screening which has been succeed in explaining ZnO systems integrates out the low-energy Landau levels close to the related Landau level, while the other high-energy Landau levels are integrated out by the perturbation theory. We find that the ground states still hold the quasi-triplet degeneracy which implies the Pfaffian nature of the system. Furthermore, the particle-hole symmetry is only weakly violated since the particle-hole parity is close to unity. We propose that the ground state in the finite-size calculations can be approximated as a variational superposition of the Pfaffian and anit-Pfaffian states. In the experimental environment the symmetrized Pfaffian component is dominant, corresponding a thermal conductance around $2.5$ quanta can be understood consequently.</description>

Abstract: In optical lattices attractive ultracold fermions with three hyperfine-spin components (colors) can form three fermionic configurations depending on interactions: unbound fermion, on-site trion and off-site trion, leading to the coexistence of multiple Fermi species in the ordered phase, which manifests that the attractive three-color fermions are unique from other correlated fermion systems and may host intriguing phases and phase transitions. At temperature below the superexchange energy scale, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method to investigate the phases and phase transitions in the half-filled attractive three-color Hubbard model on a honeycomb lattice where Hubbard interactions are color-dependent (anisotropic interactions) and the coupling between color 3 and colors (1, 2) serves as a control parameter. In the coupling regime where on-site and off-site trions coexist, our QMC simulations demonstrate coexisting N\'eel and charge density wave orders which are common in condensed matter but rare in ultracold atoms. At weak coupling where the color superfluid (CSF) order is scattered by color-3 fermions, we find that very small coupling of color 3 with colors (1, 2) can destroy the CSF order and the vanishing of the CSF order is not immediately accompanied by the emergence of the on-site trionic phase, which strikingly disagrees with the prevalent results of dynamical mean-field theory. The underlying mechanisms of the coexisting charge/spin orders and the CSF order breaking are also presented based on intuitive physical pictures.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Mixed-state Quantum Topological Order</title>

Abstract: Decoherence is a major obstacle to the preparation of topological order in noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we show that decoherence can also give rise to new types of topological order. Specifically, we construct concrete examples by proliferating fermionic anyons in the toric code via local quantum channels. The resulting mixed states retain long-range entanglement, which manifests in the nonzero topological entanglement negativity, though the topological quantum memory is destroyed by decoherence. By comparison to the gapless spin liquid in pure states, we show that the identified states represent a novel intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, which has no counterpart in pure states. Through the lens of quantum anomalies of 1-form symmetries, we then provide general constructions of intrinsic mixed-state quantum topological order, and reveal the existence of non-bosonic deconfined anyons as another key feature of these novel phases. The extended meaning and characterization of deconfined excitations and their statistics in mixed states are clarified. Moreover, when these deconfined anyons have nontrivial braiding statistics, we prove that the mixed states %must be bipartite long-range entangled for any bipartition. That is, such mixed states cannot be prepared via finite-depth local quantum channels from any bipartite separable states. We further demonstrate our construction using the decohered Kitaev honeycomb model and the decohered double semion model. In the latter case, a surprising scenario arises where decoherence gives rise to additional types of deconfined anyons.</description>

      <title>Classification of multiorbital superconducting state based on augmented multipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pairing interactions between electrons play an essential role in determining the properties in superconducting states. Recently, a plethora of unconventional superconducting states has been extensively explored, which often emerge owing to multipole fluctuations in the vicinity of multipole orders. We classify such superconducting states from the viewpoint of the multipole degrees of freedom by extending its representation to Nambu space. We clarify that under the crystallographic point group, arbitrary Cooper pairs between electrons with any angular momenta are systematically classified by four types of multipoles: electric, magnetic, magnetic toroidal, and electric toroidal. As examples, we apply our formulation to an $sp$-orbital electron system, which potentially exhibits exotic Cooper pairs under polar and axial point groups. Our systematic classification will be useful in characterizing unconventional superconducting states in multiorbital systems.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16962</link>

Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify (\emph{herald}) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

      <title>Discrete Time Crystal Phase as a Resource for Quantum Enhanced Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete time crystals are a special phase of matter in which time translational symmetry is broken through a periodic driving pulse. Here, we first propose and characterize an effective mechanism to generate a stable discrete time crystal phase in a disorder-free many-body system with indefinite persistent oscillations even in finite-size systems. Then we explore the sensing capability of this system to measure the spin exchange coupling. The results show strong quantum-enhanced sensitivity throughout the time crystal phase. As the spin exchange coupling varies, the system goes through a sharp phase transition and enters a non-time crystal phase in which the performance of the probe considerably decreases. We characterize this phase transition as a second-order type and determine its critical properties through a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. The performance of our probe is independent of the initial states and may even benefit from imperfections in the driving pulse.</description>

      <title>The description of two-dimensional altermagnetism</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, recently spotlighted in condensed matter physics, presents captivating physical properties and holds promise for spintronics applications. This study delves into the theoretical description and categorization of two-dimensional altermagnetism using spin group theory. Employing spin-group formalism, we establish seven distinct spin layer groups, extending beyond the conventional five spin Laue groups, to describe two-dimensional altermagnetism. Utilizing these findings, we classify previously reported two-dimensional altermagnets and identify novel materials exhibiting altermagnetism. Specifically, monolayer MnTeMoO$_6$ and VP$_2$H$_8$(NO$_4$)$_2$ are predicted to be two-dimensional altermagnets. Furthermore, we scrutinize their spin-momentum locking characteristics through symmetry analysis and density functional theory calculations, substantiating their altermagnetic properties.</description>
