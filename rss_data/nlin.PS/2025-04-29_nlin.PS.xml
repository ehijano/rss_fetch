      <title>Breather and Positon excitations in a nonlinear electrical transmission line modeled by the Kundu-Eckhaus Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the dynamics of breathers and positons in a nonlinear electrical transmission line modeled by the modified Naguchi circuit, governed by the Kundu-Eckhaus equation. Utilizing the reductive perturbation method and a specific transformation, we analyze the influence of different time-dependent linear potentials on these nonlinear wave structures. The analysis is conducted for three representative cases: (i) a constant potential, which modifies the orientation and amplitude of breathers and positons, (ii) a periodically modulated potential, which transforms them into crescent-shaped structures with unique spatial characteristics, and (iii) an exponentially varying potential, which induces asymmetric crescent-shaped waveforms. Additionally, we show that linear potentials significantly influence breather and positon dynamics in the modified electrical transmission line by altering their position and positon amplitude-constant potentials maintain peaks at the origin, periodic potentials shift breathers forward and positons backward, while exponential potentials move breathers backward and positons forward. Our findings highlight the critical role of external modulation in shaping wave propagation, localizing waves, and altering their amplitude, demonstrating its potential for controlling wave dynamics in nonlinear transmission lines. Unlike previous studies that focused on rogue waves, this work provides new insights into the evolution of breathers and positons under external perturbations. The results may have significant implications for applications in electrical transmission networks.</description>

      <title>Supratransmission of rogue wave-like breathing solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supratransmission is a fascinating and counterintuitive nonlinear wave phenomenon that enables energy transmission through frequency band gaps. Recent studies have suggested that supratransmission in a damped-driven Klein-Gordon equation can lead to the formation of rogue waves. In this work, we reduce the same model to a damped and driven discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and demonstrate that the claimed rogue waves are unstable solitons exhibiting breathing dynamics. Through extensive numerical simulations, we thoroughly investigate and analyze the behavior of solitons and supratransmission in these lattices. Additionally, we perform asymptotic analysis to explain the underlying mechanism responsible for supratransmission. Our findings provide new insights into the dynamics of nonlinear waves and their stability in such systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear states of the conservative complex Swift-Hohenberg equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the conservative complex Swift-Hohenberg equation, which belongs to the family of nonlinear fourth-order dispersive Schr\"odinger equations. In contrast to the well-studied one-dimensional dissipative Swift-Hohenberg equation, the complex variant introduces a wide array of largely unexplored solutions. Our study provides a fundamental step in understanding the complex characteristics of this equation, particularly for typical classes of solutions-uniform, periodic, and localized states-and their relationship with the original dissipative model. Our findings reveal significant differences between the two models. For instance, uniform solutions in the conservative model are inherently unstable, and periodic solutions are generally unstable except within a narrow parameter interval that supports multiple localized states. Furthermore, we establish a generalized Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion to determine the stability of localized states in the conservative equation and relate it to the stability properties of the dissipative counterpart.</description>

      <title>Oscillation death by mechanochemical feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are compressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Turing pattern theory on homogeneous and heterogeneous higher-order temporal network system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes on networked systems have received mounting attention in the past two decades, and the corresponding theory of network dynamics has been continuously enriched with the advancement of network science. Recently, time-varying features and many-body interactions have been discovered on various and numerous real-world networks, such as biological and social systems, and the study of contemporary network science has gradually moved away from historically static network frameworks that are based on pairwise interactions. We aim to propose a general and rudimentary framework for Turing instability of reaction-diffusion processes on higher-order temporal networks. Firstly, we define a brand Laplacian to depict higher-order temporal diffusion behaviors on networks. Furthermore, the general form of higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion systems with frequency of oscillation is defined, and a time-independent and concise form is obtained by equivalent substitution and method of averaging. Next, we discuss the two cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous network systems and give equivalent conditions of Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Finally, in the numerical simulation part, we verify and discuss the validity of the above theoretical framework and study the effect of the frequency of oscillation of higher-order temporal networks on reaction-diffusion processes. Our study has revealed that higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion, which takes into account both time-varying feature and many-body interactions, can formulate innovative and diverse patterns. Moreover, there are significant differences between patterns in continuous space and patterns on traditional networks.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory of soliton gases for the defocusing NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive Nonlinear Dispersion Relations (NDR) for the defocusing NLS (dark) soliton gas using the idea of thermodynamic limit of quasimomentum and quasienergy differentials on the underlying family of Riemann surfaces. It turns out that the obtained NDR are closely connected with the recently studied NDR for circular soliton gas for the focusing NLS. We find solutions for the kinetic equation for the defocusing NLS soliton condensate, which is defined by the endpoints of the spectral support $\Gamma$ for the NDR. It turns out that, similarly to KdV soliton condensates (\cite{CERT}), the evolution of these endpoints is governed by the defocusing NLS-Whitham equations (\cite{Kodama}). We also study the Riemann problem for step initial data and the kurtosis of genus zero and one defNLS condensates, where we proved that the kurtosis of genus one condensate can not exceed 3/2, whereas for genus zero condensate the kurtosis is always 1.</description>

      <title>Traveling wave profiles for a semi-discrete Burgers equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look for traveling waves of the semi-discrete conservation law $4\dot u_j +u_{j+1}^2-u_{j-1}^2 = 0$, using variational principles related to concepts of ``hidden convexity'' appearing in recent studies of various PDE (partial differential equations). We analyze and numerically compute with two variational formulations related to dual convex optimization problems constrained by either the differential-difference equation (DDE) or nonlinear integral equation (NIE) that wave profiles should satisfy. We prove existence theorems conditional on the existence of extrema that satisfy a strict convexity criterion, and numerically exhibit a variety of localized, periodic and non-periodic wave phenomena.</description>
