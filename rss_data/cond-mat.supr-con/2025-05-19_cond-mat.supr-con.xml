      <title>Topological surface states in {\gamma}-PtBi$_2$ evidenced by scanning tunneling microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the application of topological materials, the specific location of their topological surface states with respect to the Fermi level are important. {\gamma}-PtBi2 has been demonstrated to be a Weyl semimetal possessing superconducting Fermi arcs by photoemission spectroscopy. However, the evidence of its topological surface states is lacking by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which should be rather sensitive to detect the surface states. Here, we show multiple STM evidences for the existence of topological surface states in {\gamma}-PtBi2. We observe not only the step-edge and screw dislocation induced quasiparticle interference fringes, originating from the electron scatterings between the Fermi arcs of {\gamma}-PtBi2, but also the back-scattering prohibition related to the spin-flip process, which is the direct evidence for the topological nature of the surface states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the topological surface states are precisely located over a narrow energy range near the Fermi level, within which sharply enhanced intensity and slow spatial decay of quasiparticle interference are observed.</description>

      <title>Pressure induced evolution of anisotropic superconductivity and Fermi surface nesting in a ternary boride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Migdal-Eliashberg theory implemented in Electron Phonon Wannier (EPW) code, we have investigated anisotropic superconductivity of a ternary boride $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$. The robust coupling between $\mathrm{\sigma}$-bonding states, primarily created by the d-orbitals of Mo atoms and the in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms, facilitates the generation of cooper pairs that make $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$ a single-gap anisotropic superconductor with a critical temperature ($\mathrm{T_c}\sim ) \, 19.3$ K. A weak Fermi surface nesting and the low value of electron-phonon coupling cannot induce charge density wave instabilities, as evidenced by the lack of a significant peak in the real part of total Lindhard susceptibility and the absence of phonon softening. Furthermore, the system is readily tunable by hydrostatic pressure up to 76.69 GPa, owing to its low bulk modulus and negative formation energy. The persistent reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, Fermi nesting and the stiffening of phonon modes leads to a diminution of superconductivity under pressure up to 59.71 GPa. At 76.69 GPa, a modification in the topology of the Fermi surface, namely a Lifshitz transition, occurs resulting in a sudden improvement in the nesting condition. This enhanced nesting, in turn, induces an abrupt stabilisation of superconductivity at 76.69 GPa, resulting in a V-shaped response to pressure.</description>

      <title>Neutron Spin Resonance Near a Lifshitz Transition in Overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elucidating the relationship between spin excitations and fermiology is essential for clarifying the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs). Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering results on the hole overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ near a Lifshitz transition, where the electron pocket at $M$ point is nearly replace by four hole pockets. In the normal state, the spin excitations are observed at incommensurate wave vectors with chimney-like dispersions. By cooling down to the superconducting state, a neutron spin resonance mode emerges with a peak energy of $E_r=$ 14-15 meV weakly modulated along $L$-direction. The incommensurability notably increases at low energies, giving rise to downward dispersions of the resonance mode. This behavior contrasts sharply with the upward dispersions of resonance observed in optimally doped Ba$_{0.67}$K$_{0.33}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ contributed by the hole to electron scattering, but resembles with the cases in KFe$_2$As$_2$ and KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ where the fermiology are dominated by hole pockets. These results highlight the critical role of electronic structure modifications near the Fermi level, especially in governing interband scattering under imperfect nesting conditions, which fundamentally shape the spin dynamics of FeSCs.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetoresistance and Anomalous Hall Effect in the Superconductor NiBi$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NiBi$_{3}$ compound exhibits an intriguing interplay of superconductivity, magnetism, and topology. While the possibility of unconventional superconductivity involving magnetic interactions has been previously discussed and dismissed, the topological character of its electronic structure has only recently gained attention. Here, we report experimental evidence of unconventional magnetic ordering in high-quality single crystals of NiBi$_{3}$, revealed through detailed magnetotransport measurements. The magnetoresistance shows a distinct temperature dependence, combining a classical Lorentz-like component with a linear-in-field contribution. Moreover, anomalous Hall effect signals persist down to the superconducting transition and vanish above 75 K. These results indicate that spin textures significantly influence charge transport in NiBi$_{3}$, pointing to a compensated magnetic background intertwined with its topological electronic structure. Our findings underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of this material.</description>

      <title>Born-limit scattering and pair-breaking crossover in d-wave superconductivity of (TMTSF)2ClO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the quasi-one-dimensional organic unconventional superconductor (TMTSF)2ClO4, the randomness of the non-centrosymmetric ClO4 anions can be experimentally controlled by adjusting the cooling rate through the anion-ordering temperature. This feature provides a unique opportunity to study disorder effects on unconventional superconductivity in great detail. We here report on measurements of the electronic specific heat of this system, performed under various cooling rates. The evolution of the residual density of states indicates that the ClO4 randomness works as Born-limit pair breakers, which, to our knowledge, has never been clearly identified in any unconventional superconductors. Furthermore, detailed analyses suggest a peculiar crossover from strong unitarity scattering due to molecular defects toward the Born-limit weak scattering due to borders of ordered regions. This work supports the d-wave nature of pairing in (TMTSF)2ClO4 and intends to provide an experimental basis for further developments of pair-breaking theories of unconventional superconductors where multiple electron scattering mechanisms coexist.</description>

      <title>Magnetotransport signatures of spin-orbit coupling in high-temperature cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin transport in superconductors offers a compelling platform to merge the dissipationless nature of superconductivity with the functional promise of spin-based electronics. A significant challenge in achieving spin polarisation in conventional superconductors stems from the singlet state of Cooper pairs, which exhibit no net spin. The generation of spin-polarised carriers, quasiparticles, or triplet pairs in superconductors has predominantly been realised in hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet systems through proximity-induced spin polarisation. Historically, cuprate superconductors have been characterised by strong electronic correlations but negligible spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report exceptionally large anisotropic magnetoresistance and a pronounced planar Hall effect arising near the superconducting phase transition in the prototypical high-temperature cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-x without using a proximity ferromagnet. These effects, unprecedented in centrosymmetric cuprates, emerge from spin-polarised quasiparticle transport mediated by strong spin-orbit coupling. By systematically tuning magnetic field strength, orientation, temperature, and doping, we show clear evidence of spin-orbit-driven transport phenomena in a material class long thought to lack such interactions. Our findings reveal an unexpected spin-orbit landscape in cuprates and open a route to engineer spintronic functionalities in high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals in the normal state of the Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unraveling the behavior of the electrons in the copper-oxygen planes of cuprate superconductors remains a challenge. Here we examine the electronic charge redistribution among planar copper and oxygen orbitals and the charge gap using the Emery model in the normal state, solved with cellular dynamical mean-field theory at finite temperature. We quantify the charge redistribution as a function of the onsite Coulomb repulsion on the copper orbitals, the bare copper-oxygen energy difference, and the hole or electron doping. We find that the position relative to the metal to insulator boundary of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen diagram determines the charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals. For a fixed bare Cu-O energy difference, an increase in the Cu electron repulsion leads to a transfer of the electronic charge from Cu to O orbitals. For a fixed charge gap size of the undoped state, as the system evolves from a charge-transfer to a Mott-Hubbard regime, the electronic charge is transferred from Cu to O orbitals. Our findings posit the Coulomb repulsion and the bare charge-transfer energy as key drivers of the microscopic process of charge redistribution in the CuO$_2$ plane. They quantify the anticorrelation between the charge gap size and oxygen hole content. They show that for fixed band-structure parameters, the charge gap and the charge redistribution between Cu and O orbitals provide a way to understand observed trends in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant electromagnetic responses in superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is essential for making physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, mean-field Hamiltonians that explicitly break $U(1)$ symmetry often yield gauge-dependent results. While this issue has been resolved for linear responses in conventional superconductors, a unified framework that also covers unconventional superconductors and nonlinear responses has yet to be established. In this study, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework that enables gauge-invariant calculations of electromagnetic responses at arbitrary orders in external fields, applicable to both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent-fluctuation-of-the-order-parameter (CFOP) approach to full photon vertices and admits a diagrammatic representation of the response kernel in terms of Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a QCD axion.</description>

      <title>Floating zone growth at high oxygen pressures in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the discovery of superconductivity under pressure in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer La$_3$Ni$^{2.5+}_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$^{2.66+}_3$O$_{10}$, a new field of nickelate superconductors opened up. In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. We employ optical floating zone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase formation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the general stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for large high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-\delta}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity of an altermagnetic metal: Polarized BCS and inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the superconductivity of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi systems with $d$-wave altermagnetism under external magnetic field near zero temperature. At large altermagnetic coupling without magnetic field, we show that altermagnetism drives a second-order phase transition from the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to an inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The inclusion of magnetic field turns the BCS state into a long-sought polarized BCS superconductor with spin-population imbalance. It also shrinks the parameter window of the FFLO state and eventually leads to a nontrivial quantum tri-critical Lifshitz point, where two second-order phase transition lines between the polarized BCS, FFLO and normal states intersect. At small altermagnetic coupling, we find the usual route to the FFLO state driven by magnetic field. The presence of the altermagnetic coupling narrows the phase window of the FFLO state and creates another quantum Lifshitz point, where a first-order transition curve meets a second-order transition line. Between the two Lifshitz points, the transition from the polarized BCS state to the normal state is smooth. Our predicted rich phase diagram is relevant to some recently discovered unconventional magnets, including RuO$_{2}$ that exhibits a relatively high superconducting temperature in the thin film limit under applied strain. Our results of unconventional superfluidity are also testable in ultracold atom laboratories, where a spin-1/2 altermagnetic Fermi gas might be realizable upon loading into two-dimensional Hubbard lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Charge-loop current order and Z3 nematicity mediated by bond-order fluctuations in kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=Cs,Rb,K)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments on geometrically frustrated kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) have revealed the emergence of the charge loop current (cLC) order near the bond order (BO) phase. However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.</description>

      <title>Fermionized dual vortex theory for magnetized kagom\'{e} spin liquid</title>

Abstract: Inspired by the recent quantum oscillation measurement on the kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet in finite magnetic fields, we raise the question about the physical contents of the emergent fermions and the gauge fields if the U(1) spin liquid is relevant for the finite-field kagom\'{e} lattice antiferromagnet. Clearly, the magnetic field is non-perturbative in this regime, and the finite-field state has no direct relation with the U(1) Dirac spin liquid proposal at zero field. We here consider the fermionized dual vortex liquid state as one possible candidate theory to understand the magnetized kagom\'{e} spin liquid. Within the dual vortex theory, the $S^z$ magnetization is the emergent U(1) gauge flux, and the fermionized dual vortex is the emergent fermion. The magnetic field polarizes the spin component that modulates the U(1) gauge flux for the fermionized vortices and generates the quantum oscillation. Within the mean-field theory, we discuss the gauge field correlation, the vortex-antivortex continuum and the vortex thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Niobium coaxial cavities with internal quality factors exceeding 1.5 billion for circuit quantum electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: Group-V materials such as niobium and tantalum have become popular choices for extending the performance of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms allowing for quantum processors and memories with reduced error rates and more modes. The complex surface chemistry of niobium however makes identifying the main modes of decoherence difficult at millikelvin temperatures and single-photon powers. We use niobium coaxial quarter-wave cavities to study the impact of etch chemistry, prolonged atmospheric exposure, and the significance of cavity conditions prior to and during cooldown, in particular niobium hydride evolution, on single-photon coherence. We demonstrate cavities with quality factors of Q_int&gt;1.4X10^9 in the single-photon regime, a 15 fold improvement over aluminum cavities of the same geometry. We rigorously quantify the sensitivity of our fabrication process to various loss mechanisms and demonstrate a 2-4X reduction in the two-level system (TLS) loss tangent and a 3-5X improvement in the residual resistance over traditional BCP etching techniques. Finally, we demonstrate transmon integration and coherent cavity control while maintaining a cavity coherence of 11.3ms. The accessibility of our method, which can easily be replicated in academic-lab settings, and the demonstration of its performance mark an advancement in 3D cQED.</description>

      <title>Quantum colored strings in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model</title>

Abstract: The stripe phase, an intertwined order observed in high-temperature superconductors, is regarded as playing a key role in elucidating the underlying mechanism of superconductivity, especially in cuprates. Following Jan Zaanen's early scenario, the filled charge stripe, with one hole per unit cell of the charge order, can be taken as the interactive elastic quantum strings of holes, stabilized by $\pi$-phase shifts between neighboring magnetic domains. However, this scenario is challenging to explain, particularly in terms of electron pairing, which necessitates hole pairs. In this work, we propose a new effective model for describing the stripe phase in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model. With respect to the antiferromagnetic background, the model comprises three types of color-labeled point-defects coupling to an effective spin field, so named as ``colored string". Comparing with numerical results from large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find semi-quantitative agreement in local hole density, magnetic moment, and the newly proposed spectrum features of the effective spin field. By systematically analyzing the hole-density distribution and the scaling of groundstate energy at different system sizes, we determine the effective core radius and the effective hopping amplitude of the quantum string. Furthermore, the local pinning field can be finely adjusted to drag the quantum string, offering a potential method for detecting it in optical lattices. At last, we further demonstrate the partially-filled stripe with less than one hole per unit cell of the charge order can also be well described by the effective theory.</description>

      <title>Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09908v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.</description>

      <title>Low-energy perspective of interacting electrons in the normal state of superconducting bilayer nickelate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.</description>
