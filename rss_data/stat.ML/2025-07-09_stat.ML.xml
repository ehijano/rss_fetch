      <title>Enjoying Non-linearity in Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the multinomial logistic bandit problem, a variant of generalized linear bandits where a learner interacts with an environment by selecting actions to maximize expected rewards based on probabilistic feedback from multiple possible outcomes. In the binary setting, recent work has focused on understanding the impact of the non-linearity of the logistic model (Faury et al., 2020; Abeille et al., 2021). They introduced a problem-dependent constant $\kappa_*$, that may be exponentially large in some problem parameters and which is captured by the derivative of the sigmoid function. It encapsulates the non-linearity and improves existing regret guarantees over $T$ rounds from $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T})}$ to $\smash{O(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$, where $d$ is the dimension of the parameter space. We extend their analysis to the multinomial logistic bandit framework, making it suitable for complex applications with more than two choices, such as reinforcement learning or recommender systems. To achieve this, we extend the definition of $\kappa_*$ to the multinomial setting and propose an efficient algorithm that leverages the problem's non-linearity. Our method yields a problem-dependent regret bound of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{{T}/{\kappa_*}})} $, where $K$ is the number of actions and $\kappa_* \ge 1$. This improves upon the best existing guarantees of order $ \smash{\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}( Kd \sqrt{T} )} $. Moreover, we provide a $\smash{ \Omega(d\sqrt{T/\kappa_*})}$ lower-bound, showing that our dependence on $\kappa_*$ is optimal.</description>

      <title>Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP): A Distribution-Free Statistical and Machine Learning Framework for Adaptive Risk Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose Temporal Conformal Prediction (TCP), a novel framework for constructing prediction intervals in financial time-series with guaranteed finite-sample validity. TCP integrates quantile regression with a conformal calibration layer that adapts online via a decaying learning rate. This hybrid design bridges statistical and machine learning paradigms, enabling TCP to accommodate non-stationarity, volatility clustering, and regime shifts which are hallmarks of real-world asset returns, without relying on rigid parametric assumptions. We benchmark TCP against established methods including GARCH, Historical Simulation, and static Quantile Regression across equities (S&amp;P 500), cryptocurrency (Bitcoin), and commodities (Gold). Empirical results show that TCP consistently delivers sharper intervals with competitive or superior coverage, particularly in high-volatility regimes. Our study underscores TCP's strength in navigating the coverage-sharpness tradeoff, a central challenge in modern risk forecasting. Overall, TCP offers a distribution-free, adaptive, and interpretable alternative for financial uncertainty quantification, advancing the interface between statistical inference and machine learning in finance.</description>

      <title>A Malliavin calculus approach to score functions in diffusion generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion generative models have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modelling complex data distributions. These models aim at learning the score function, which defines a map from a known probability distribution to the target data distribution via deterministic or stochastic differential equations (SDEs). The score function is typically estimated from data using a variety of approximation techniques, such as denoising or sliced score matching, Hyv\"arien's method, or Schr\"odinger bridges. In this paper, we derive an exact, closed form, expression for the score function for a broad class of nonlinear diffusion generative models. Our approach combines modern stochastic analysis tools such as Malliavin derivatives and their adjoint operators (Skorokhod integrals or Malliavin Divergence) with a new Bismut-type formula. The resulting expression for the score function can be written entirely in terms of the first and second variation processes, with all Malliavin derivatives systematically eliminated, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. The theoretical framework presented in this work offers a principled foundation for advancing score estimation methods in generative modelling, enabling the design of new sampling algorithms for complex probability distributions. Our results can be extended to broader classes of stochastic differential equations, opening new directions for the development of score-based diffusion generative models.</description>

      <title>Property Elicitation on Imprecise Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Property elicitation studies which attributes of a probability distribution can be determined by minimising a risk. We investigate a generalisation of property elicitation to imprecise probabilities (IP). This investigation is motivated by multi-distribution learning, which takes the classical machine learning paradigm of minimising a single risk over a (precise) probability and replaces it with $\Gamma$-maximin risk minimization over an IP. We provide necessary conditions for elicitability of a IP-property. Furthermore, we explain what an elicitable IP-property actually elicits through Bayes pairs -- the elicited IP-property is the corresponding standard property of the maximum Bayes risk distribution.</description>

      <title>Best-of-N through the Smoothing Lens: KL Divergence and Regret Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple yet effective method for inference-time alignment of generative models is Best-of-$N$ (BoN), where $N$ outcomes are sampled from a reference policy, evaluated using a proxy reward model, and the highest-scoring one is selected. While prior work argues that BoN is almost optimal in reward vs KL tradeoffs, the effectiveness of BoN depends critically on the quality of the proxy reward model used for selection. For this purpose, we study BoN through a smooth version known as Soft Best-of-N (SBoN) and develop a theoretical framework to address this gap. We analyze the scaling behaviour of BoN by providing bounds on the KL divergence between the SBoN policy and the reference policy, offering insights into how performance varies with the number of samples. We also study the regret gap, i.e., the gap between the expected true reward under the optimal policy and the SBoN policy. Our theoretical and empirical findings show that smoothing helps SBoN mitigate reward overoptimization, especially when the quality of the proxy reward is low.</description>

      <title>Online Regularized Learning Algorithms in RKHS with $\beta$- and $\phi$-Mixing Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an online regularized learning algorithm in a reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on a class of dependent processes. We choose such a process where the degree of dependence is measured by mixing coefficients. As a representative example, we analyze a strictly stationary Markov chain, where the dependence structure is characterized by the \(\phi\)- and \(\beta\)-mixing coefficients. Under these assumptions, we derive probabilistic upper bounds as well as convergence rates for both the exponential and polynomial decay of the mixing coefficients.</description>

      <title>Kernel Trace Distance: Quantum Statistical Metric between Measures through RKHS Density Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under contamination as well as particle flow simulations.</description>

      <title>Estimating prevalence with precision and accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike classification, whose goal is to estimate the class of each data point in a dataset, prevalence estimation or quantification is a task that aims to estimate the distribution of classes in a dataset. The two main tasks in prevalence estimation are to adjust for bias, due to the prevalence in the training dataset, and to quantify the uncertainty in the estimate. The standard methods used to quantify uncertainty in prevalence estimates are bootstrapping and Bayesian quantification methods. It is not clear which approach is ideal in terms of precision (i.e. the width of confidence intervals) and coverage (i.e. the confidence intervals being well-calibrated). Here, we propose Precise Quantifier (PQ), a Bayesian quantifier that is more precise than existing quantifiers and with well-calibrated coverage. We discuss the theory behind PQ and present experiments based on simulated and real-world datasets. Through these experiments, we establish the factors which influence quantification precision: the discriminatory power of the underlying classifier; the size of the labeled dataset used to train the quantifier; and the size of the unlabeled dataset for which prevalence is estimated. Our analysis provides deep insights into uncertainty quantification for quantification learning.</description>

      <title>Bridging Prediction and Intervention Problems in Social Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many automated decision systems (ADS) are designed to solve prediction problems -- where the goal is to learn patterns from a sample of the population and apply them to individuals from the same population. In reality, these prediction systems operationalize holistic policy interventions in deployment. Once deployed, ADS can shape impacted population outcomes through an effective policy change in how decision-makers operate, while also being defined by past and present interactions between stakeholders and the limitations of existing organizational, as well as societal, infrastructure and context. In this work, we consider the ways in which we must shift from a prediction-focused paradigm to an interventionist paradigm when considering the impact of ADS within social systems. We argue this requires a new default problem setup for ADS beyond prediction, to instead consider predictions as decision support, final decisions, and outcomes. We highlight how this perspective unifies modern statistical frameworks and other tools to study the design, implementation, and evaluation of ADS systems, and point to the research directions necessary to operationalize this paradigm shift. Using these tools, we characterize the limitations of focusing on isolated prediction tasks, and lay the foundation for a more intervention-oriented approach to developing and deploying ADS.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks on Financial Reporting via Maximum Violated Multi-Objective Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bad actors, primarily distressed firms, have the incentive and desire to manipulate their financial reports to hide their distress and derive personal gains. As attackers, these firms are motivated by potentially millions of dollars and the availability of many publicly disclosed and used financial modeling frameworks. Existing attack methods do not work on this data due to anti-correlated objectives that must both be satisfied for the attacker to succeed. We introduce Maximum Violated Multi-Objective (MVMO) attacks that adapt the attacker's search direction to find $20\times$ more satisfying attacks compared to standard attacks. The result is that in $\approx50\%$ of cases, a company could inflate their earnings by 100-200%, while simultaneously reducing their fraud scores by 15%. By working with lawyers and professional accountants, we ensure our threat model is realistic to how such frauds are performed in practice.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Regret Reduces to Kernelized Static Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dynamic regret in online convex optimization, where the objective is to achieve low cumulative loss relative to an arbitrary benchmark sequence. By observing that competing with an arbitrary sequence of comparators $u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}$ in $\mathcal{W}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is equivalent to competing with a fixed comparator function $u:[1,T]\to \mathcal{W}$, we frame dynamic regret minimization as a static regret problem in a function space. By carefully constructing a suitable function space in the form of a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), our reduction enables us to recover the optimal $R_{T}(u_{1},\ldots,u_{T}) = \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\sum_{t}\|u_{t}-u_{t-1}\|T})$ dynamic regret guarantee in the setting of linear losses, and yields new scale-free and directionally-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees. Moreover, unlike prior dynamic-to-static reductions -- which are valid only for linear losses -- our reduction holds for any sequence of losses, allowing us to recover $\mathcal{O}\big(\|u\|^2+d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)\ln T\big)$ bounds in exp-concave and improper linear regression settings, where $d_{\mathrm{eff}}(\lambda)$ is a measure of complexity of the RKHS. Despite working in an infinite-dimensional space, the resulting reduction leads to algorithms that are computable in practice, due to the reproducing property of RKHSs.</description>

      <title>Navigating Sparse Molecular Data with Stein Diffusion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic optimal control (SOC) has recently emerged as a principled framework for fine-tuning diffusion models. However, its dependence on computationally intensive simulations makes it impractical for fast sampling. In parallel, a class of training-free approaches has been developed that guides diffusion models using off-the-shelf classifiers on predicted clean samples, bypassing the need to train classifiers on noisy data. These methods can be interpreted as approximate SOC schemes, using Tweedie's formula to estimate diffusion posteriors. In practice, however, such direct approximations can introduce significant errors, leading to unreliable guidance. In this work, we unify the strengths of both paradigms by proposing a novel training-free diffusion guidance framework based on a surrogate stochastic optimal control objective. We derive a new theoretical bound on the value function that reveals the necessity of correcting the approximate posteriors to remain faithful to the true diffusion posterior. To this end, we connect the problem with Stein variational inference, which seeks the steepest descent direction that minimizes the Kullback-Leibler discrepancy between the two posteriors. Our method, which we refer to as Stein Diffusion Guidance (SDG), introduces a principled correction mechanism and incorporates a novel running cost functional to enable effective guidance in low-density regions. Experiments on challenging molecular generation tasks demonstrate that SDG significantly outperforms standard training-free guidance methods, highlighting its potential for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Estimating Interventional Distributions with Uncertain Causal Graphs through Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scientific domains -- from biology to the social sciences -- many questions boil down to \textit{What effect will we observe if we intervene on a particular variable?} If the causal relationships (e.g.~a causal graph) are known, it is possible to estimate the intervention distributions. In the absence of this domain knowledge, the causal structure must be discovered from the available observational data. However, observational data are often compatible with multiple causal graphs, making methods that commit to a single structure prone to overconfidence. A principled way to manage this structural uncertainty is via Bayesian inference, which averages over a posterior distribution on possible causal structures and functional mechanisms. Unfortunately, the number of causal structures grows super-exponentially with the number of nodes in the graph, making computations intractable. We propose to circumvent these challenges by using meta-learning to create an end-to-end model: the Model-Averaged Causal Estimation Transformer Neural Process (MACE-TNP). The model is trained to predict the Bayesian model-averaged interventional posterior distribution, and its end-to-end nature bypasses the need for expensive calculations. Empirically, we demonstrate that MACE-TNP outperforms strong Bayesian baselines. Our work establishes meta-learning as a flexible and scalable paradigm for approximating complex Bayesian causal inference, that can be scaled to increasingly challenging settings in the future.</description>

      <title>On the Inherent Privacy of Zeroth Order Projected Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05610v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentially private zeroth-order optimization methods have recently gained popularity in private fine tuning of machine learning models due to their reduced memory requirements. Current approaches for privatizing zeroth-order methods rely on adding Gaussian noise to the estimated zeroth-order gradients. However, since the search direction in the zeroth-order methods is inherently random, researchers including Tang et al. (2024) and Zhang et al. (2024a) have raised an important question: is the inherent noise in zeroth-order estimators sufficient to ensure the overall differential privacy of the algorithm? This work settles this question for a class of oracle-based optimization algorithms where the oracle returns zeroth-order gradient estimates. In particular, we show that for a fixed initialization, there exist strongly convex objective functions such that running (Projected) Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (ZO-GD) is not differentially private. Furthermore, we show that even with random initialization and without revealing (initial and) intermediate iterates, the privacy loss in ZO-GD can grow superlinearly with the number of iterations when minimizing convex objective functions.</description>

      <title>FACT: the Features At Convergence Theorem for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in deep learning theory is to understand how neural networks learn and represent features. To this end, we prove the Features at Convergence Theorem (FACT), which gives a self-consistency equation that neural network weights satisfy at convergence when trained with nonzero weight decay. For each weight matrix $W$, this equation relates the "feature matrix" $W^\top W$ to the set of input vectors passed into the matrix during forward propagation and the loss gradients passed through it during backpropagation. We validate this relation empirically, showing that neural features indeed satisfy the FACT at convergence. Furthermore, by modifying the "Recursive Feature Machines" of Radhakrishnan et al. 2024 so that they obey the FACT, we arrive at a new learning algorithm, FACT-RFM. FACT-RFM achieves high performance on tabular data and captures various feature learning behaviors that occur in neural network training, including grokking in modular arithmetic and phase transitions in learning sparse parities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between optimal structure learning and optimal conditional independence testing by showing that the minimax optimal rate for structure learning problems is determined by the minimax rate for conditional independence testing in these problems. This is accomplished by establishing a general reduction between these two problems in the case of poly-forests, and demonstrated by deriving optimal rates for several examples, including Bernoulli, Gaussian and nonparametric models. Furthermore, we show that the optimal algorithm in these settings is a suitable modification of the PC algorithm. This theoretical finding provides a unified framework for analyzing the statistical complexity of structure learning through the lens of minimax testing.</description>

      <title>Predicting Graph Structure via Adapted Flux Balance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many dynamic processes such as telecommunication and transport networks can be described through discrete time series of graphs. Modelling the dynamics of such time series enables prediction of graph structure at future time steps, which can be used in applications such as detection of anomalies. Existing approaches for graph prediction have limitations such as assuming that the vertices do not to change between consecutive graphs. To address this, we propose to exploit time series prediction methods in combination with an adapted form of flux balance analysis (FBA), a linear programming method originating from biochemistry. FBA is adapted to incorporate various constraints applicable to the scenario of growing graphs. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets (constructed via Preferential Attachment model) and real datasets (UCI Message, HePH, Facebook, Bitcoin) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Prototype-Guided and Lightweight Adapters for Inherent Interpretation and Generalisation in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a promising paradigm for collaboratively training machine learning models across distributed data sources while maintaining privacy. Nevertheless, real-world FL often faces major challenges including communication overhead during the transfer of large model parameters and statistical heterogeneity, arising from non-identical independent data distributions across clients. In this work, we propose an FL framework that 1) provides inherent interpretations using prototypes, and 2) tackles statistical heterogeneity by utilising lightweight adapter modules to act as compressed surrogates of local models and guide clients to achieve generalisation despite varying client distribution. Each client locally refines its model by aligning class embeddings toward prototype representations and simultaneously adjust the lightweight adapter. Our approach replaces the need to communicate entire model weights with prototypes and lightweight adapters. This design ensures that each client's model aligns with a globally shared structure while minimising communication load and providing inherent interpretations. Moreover, we conducted our experiments on a real-world retinal fundus image dataset, which provides clinical-site information. We demonstrate inherent interpretable capabilities and perform a classification task, which shows improvements in accuracy over baseline algorithms.</description>

      <title>Consistency and Inconsistency in $K$-Means Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A celebrated result of Pollard proves asymptotic consistency for $k$-means clustering when the population distribution has finite variance. In this work, we point out that the population-level $k$-means clustering problem is, in fact, well-posed under the weaker assumption of a finite expectation, and we investigate whether some form of asymptotic consistency holds in this setting. As we illustrate in a variety of negative results, the complete story is quite subtle; for example, the empirical $k$-means cluster centers may fail to converge even if there exists a unique set of population $k$-means cluster centers. A detailed analysis of our negative results reveals that inconsistency arises because of an extreme form of cluster imbalance, whereby the presence of outlying samples leads to some empirical $k$-means clusters possessing very few points. We then give a collection of positive results which show that some forms of asymptotic consistency, under only the assumption of finite expectation, may be recovered by imposing some a priori degree of balance among the empirical $k$-means clusters.</description>

      <title>seMCD: Sequentially implemented Monte Carlo depth computation with statistical guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical depth functions provide center-outward orderings in spaces of dimension larger than one, where a natural ordering does not exist. The numerical evaluation of such depth functions can be computationally prohibitive, even for relatively low dimensions. We present a novel sequentially implemented Monte Carlo methodology for the computation of, theoretical and empirical, depth functions and related quantities (seMCD), that outputs an interval, a so-called seMCD-bucket, to which the quantity of interest belongs with a high probability prespecified by the user. For specific classes of depth functions, we adapt algorithms from sequential testing, providing finite-sample guarantees. For depth functions dependent on unknown distributions, we offer asymptotic guarantees using non-parametric statistical methods. In contrast to plain-vanilla Monte Carlo methodology the number of samples required in the algorithm is random but typically much smaller than standard choices suggested in the literature. The seMCD method can be applied to various depth functions, covering multivariate and functional spaces. We demonstrate the efficiency and reliability of our approach through empirical studies, highlighting its applicability in outlier or anomaly detection, classification, and depth region computation. In conclusion, the seMCD-algorithm can achieve accurate depth approximations with few Monte Carlo samples while maintaining rigorous statistical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Deep learning from strongly mixing observations: Sparse-penalized regularization and minimax optimality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The explicit regularization and optimality of deep neural networks estimators from independent data have made considerable progress recently. The study of such properties on dependent data is still a challenge. In this paper, we carry out deep learning from strongly mixing observations, and deal with the squared and a broad class of loss functions. We consider sparse-penalized regularization for deep neural network predictor. For a general framework that includes, regression estimation, classification, time series prediction,$\cdots$, oracle inequality for the expected excess risk is established and a bound on the class of H\"older smooth functions is provided. For nonparametric regression from strong mixing data and sub-exponentially error, we provide an oracle inequality for the $L_2$ error and investigate an upper bound of this error on a class of H\"older composition functions. For the specific case of nonparametric autoregression with Gaussian and Laplace errors, a lower bound of the $L_2$ error on this H\"older composition class is established. Up to logarithmic factor, this bound matches its upper bound; so, the deep neural network estimator attains the minimax optimal rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the emergence of large-scale pre-trained neural networks, methods to adapt such "foundation" models to data-limited downstream tasks have become a necessity. Fine-tuning, preference optimization, and transfer learning have all been successfully employed for these purposes when the target task closely resembles the source task, but a precise theoretical understanding of "task similarity" is still lacking. While conventional wisdom suggests that simple measures of similarity between source and target distributions, such as $\phi$-divergences or integral probability metrics, can directly predict the success of transfer, we prove the surprising fact that, in general, this is not the case. We adopt, instead, a feature-centric viewpoint on transfer learning and establish a number of theoretical results that demonstrate that when the target task is well represented by the feature space of the pre-trained model, transfer learning outperforms training from scratch. We study deep linear networks as a minimal model of transfer learning in which we can analytically characterize the transferability phase diagram as a function of the target dataset size and the feature space overlap. For this model, we establish rigorously that when the feature space overlap between the source and target tasks is sufficiently strong, both linear transfer and fine-tuning improve performance, especially in the low data limit. These results build on an emerging understanding of feature learning dynamics in deep linear networks, and we demonstrate numerically that the rigorous results we derive for the linear case also apply to nonlinear networks.</description>

      <title>Transformers Simulate MLE for Sequence Generation in Bayesian Networks</title>

Abstract: Transformers have achieved significant success in various fields, notably excelling in tasks involving sequential data like natural language processing. Despite these achievements, the theoretical understanding of transformers' capabilities remains limited. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical capabilities of transformers to autoregressively generate sequences in Bayesian networks based on in-context maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Specifically, we consider a setting where a context is formed by a set of independent sequences generated according to a Bayesian network. We demonstrate that there exists a simple transformer model that can (i) estimate the conditional probabilities of the Bayesian network according to the context, and (ii) autoregressively generate a new sample according to the Bayesian network with estimated conditional probabilities. We further demonstrate in extensive experiments that such a transformer does not only exist in theory, but can also be effectively obtained through training. Our analysis highlights the potential of transformers to learn complex probabilistic models and contributes to a better understanding of large language models as a powerful class of sequence generators.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Anomaly Detection through Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting anomalies in datasets is a longstanding problem in machine learning. In this context, anomalies are defined as a sample that significantly deviates from the remaining data. Meanwhile, optimal transport (OT) is a field of mathematics concerned with the transportation, between two probability measures, at least effort. In classical OT, the optimal transportation strategy of a measure to itself is the identity. In this paper, we tackle anomaly detection by forcing samples to displace its mass, while keeping the least effort objective. We call this new transportation problem Mass Repulsing Optimal Transport (MROT). Naturally, samples lying in low density regions of space will be forced to displace mass very far, incurring a higher transportation cost. We use these concepts to design a new anomaly score. Through a series of experiments in existing benchmarks, and fault detection problems, we show that our algorithm improves over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Risk-sensitive planning aims to identify policies maximizing some tail-focused metrics in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Such an optimization task can be very costly for the most widely used and interpretable metrics such as threshold probabilities or (Conditional) Values at Risk. Indeed, previous work showed that only Entropic Risk Measures (EntRM) can be efficiently optimized through dynamic programming, leaving a hard-to-interpret parameter to choose. We show that the computation of the full set of optimal policies for EntRM across parameter values leads to tight approximations for the metrics of interest. We prove that this optimality front can be computed effectively thanks to a novel structural analysis and smoothness properties of entropic risks. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance in a variety of decision-making scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) seeks to transfer the knowledge of a teacher, towards a student neural net. This process is often done by matching the networks' predictions (i.e., their output), but, recently several works have proposed to match the distributions of neural nets' activations (i.e., their features), a process known as \emph{distribution matching}. In this paper, we propose an unifying framework, Knowledge Distillation through Distribution Matching (KD$^{2}$M), which formalizes this strategy. Our contributions are threefold. We i) provide an overview of distribution metrics used in distribution matching, ii) benchmark on computer vision datasets, and iii) derive new theoretical results for KD.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that perfect hallucination control in large language models is mathematically impossible. No LLM inference mechanism can simultaneously achieve truthful response generation, semantic information conservation, relevant knowledge revelation, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is fundamental, arising from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself rather than engineering limitations. The proof spans three mathematical frameworks: auction theory, proper scoring theory for probabilistic predictions, and log-sum-exp analysis for transformer architectures. In each setting, we demonstrate that information aggregation creates unavoidable violations of conservation principles. The Jensen gap in transformer probability aggregation provides a direct measure of this impossibility. These results reframe hallucination from an engineering bug to an inevitable mathematical feature of distributed intelligence. There are fundamental trade-offs between truthfulness, knowledge utilization, and response completeness, providing principled foundations for managing rather than eliminating hallucination. This work reveals deep connections between neural network inference, philosophy of knowledge and reasoning, and classical results in game theory and information theory, opening new research directions for developing beneficial AI systems within mathematical constraints.</description>

Abstract: Probability density estimation from observed data constitutes a central task in statistics. In this brief, we focus on the problem of estimating the copula density associated to any observed data, as it fully describes the dependence between random variables. We separate univariate marginal distributions from the joint dependence structure in the data, the copula itself, and we model the latter with a neural network-based method referred to as copula density neural estimation (CODINE). Results show that the novel learning approach is capable of modeling complex distributions and can be applied for mutual information estimation and data generation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The remarkable performance of overparameterized deep neural networks (DNNs) must arise from an interplay between network architecture, training algorithms, and structure in the data. To disentangle these three components, we apply a Bayesian picture, based on the functions expressed by a DNN, to supervised learning. The prior over functions is determined by the network, and is varied by exploiting a transition between ordered and chaotic regimes. For Boolean function classification, we approximate the likelihood using the error spectrum of functions on data. When combined with the prior, this accurately predicts the posterior, measured for DNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent. This analysis reveals that structured data, combined with an intrinsic Occam's razor-like inductive bias towards (Kolmogorov) simple functions that is strong enough to counteract the exponential growth of the number of functions with complexity, is a key to the success of DNNs.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation through Gaussian Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems operate under the assumption that training and test data are sampled from a fixed probability distribution. However, this assumptions is rarely verified in practice, as the conditions upon which data was acquired are likely to change. In this context, the adaptation of the unsupervised domain requires minimal access to the data of the new conditions for learning models robust to changes in the data distribution. Optimal transport is a theoretically grounded tool for analyzing changes in distribution, especially as it allows the mapping between domains. However, these methods are usually computationally expensive as their complexity scales cubically with the number of samples. In this work, we explore optimal transport between Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), which is conveniently written in terms of the components of source and target GMMs. We experiment with 9 benchmarks, with a total of $85$ adaptation tasks, showing that our methods are more efficient than previous shallow domain adaptation methods, and they scale well with number of samples $n$ and dimensions $d$.</description>

      <title>On the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational quantum learning models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for successful variational quantum machine learning (QML) relies on the design of suitable parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs), as analogues to neural networks in classical machine learning. Successful QML models must fulfill the properties of trainability and non-dequantization, among others. Recent works have highlighted an intricate interplay between trainability and dequantization of such models, which is still unresolved. In this work we contribute to this debate from the perspective of machine learning, proving a number of results identifying, among others when trainability and non-dequantization are not mutually exclusive. We begin by providing a number of new somewhat broader definitions of the relevant concepts, compared to what is found in other literature, which are operationally motivated, and consistent with prior art. With these precise definitions given and motivated, we then study the relation between trainability and dequantization of variational QML. Next, we also discuss the degrees of "variationalness" of QML models, where we distinguish between models like the hardware efficient ansatz and quantum kernel methods. Finally, we introduce recipes for building PQC-based QML models which are both trainable and nondequantizable, and corresponding to different degrees of variationalness. We do not address the practical utility for such models. Our work however does point toward a way forward for finding more general constructions, for which finding applications may become feasible.</description>

      <title>The Perils of Optimizing Learned Reward Functions: Low Training Error Does Not Guarantee Low Regret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, specifying reward functions that capture the intended task can be very challenging. Reward learning aims to address this issue by learning the reward function. However, a learned reward model may have a low error on the data distribution, and yet subsequently produce a policy with large regret. We say that such a reward model has an error-regret mismatch. The main source of an error-regret mismatch is the distributional shift that commonly occurs during policy optimization. In this paper, we mathematically show that a sufficiently low expected test error of the reward model guarantees low worst-case regret, but that for any fixed expected test error, there exist realistic data distributions that allow for error-regret mismatch to occur. We then show that similar problems persist even when using policy regularization techniques, commonly employed in methods such as RLHF. We hope our results stimulate the theoretical and empirical study of improved methods to learn reward models, and better ways to measure their quality reliably.</description>

      <title>Robust Score-Based Quickest Change Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11094v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Methods in the field of quickest change detection rapidly detect in real-time a change in the data-generating distribution of an online data stream. Existing methods have been able to detect this change point when the densities of the pre- and post-change distributions are known. Recent work has extended these results to the case where the pre- and post-change distributions are known only by their score functions. This work considers the case where the pre- and post-change score functions are known only to correspond to distributions in two disjoint sets. This work selects a pair of least-favorable distributions from these sets to robustify the existing score-based quickest change detection algorithm, the properties of which are studied. This paper calculates the least-favorable distributions for specific model classes and provides methods of estimating the least-favorable distributions for common constructions. Simulation results are provided demonstrating the performance of our robust change detection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Regression for the Mean: Auto-Evaluation and Inference with Few Labels through Post-hoc Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of machine learning systems that can effectively perform arbitrary tasks has led to synthetic labels from these systems being used in applications of statistical inference, such as data analysis or model evaluation. The Prediction Powered Inference (PPI) framework provides a way of leveraging both a large pool of pseudo-labelled data and a small sample with real, high-quality labels to produce a low-variance, unbiased estimate of the quantity being evaluated for. Most work on PPI considers a relatively sizable set of labelled samples, which can be resource intensive to obtain. However, we find that when labelled data is scarce, the PPI++ method can perform even worse than classical inference. We analyze this phenomenon by relating PPI++ to ordinary least squares regression, which also experiences high variance with small sample sizes, and use this regression framework to better understand the efficacy of PPI. Motivated by this, we present two new PPI-based techniques that leverage robust regressors to produce even lower variance estimators in the few-label regime.</description>

      <title>Scalable Discrete Diffusion Samplers: Combinatorial Optimization and Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08696v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>

      <title>Unifying Explainable Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems, prevalent in various scientific and engineering domains, are susceptible to anomalies that can significantly impact their performance and reliability. This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Hierarchical Invariant Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Bayesian Hierarchical Invariant Prediction (BHIP) reframing Invariant Causal Prediction (ICP) through the lens of Hierarchical Bayes. We leverage the hierarchical structure to explicitly test invariance of causal mechanisms under heterogeneous data, resulting in improved computational scalability for a larger number of predictors compared to ICP. Moreover, given its Bayesian nature BHIP enables the use of prior information. In this paper, we test two sparsity inducing priors: horseshoe and spike-and-slab, both of which allow us a more reliable identification of causal features. We test BHIP in synthetic and real-world data showing its potential as an alternative inference method to ICP.</description>
