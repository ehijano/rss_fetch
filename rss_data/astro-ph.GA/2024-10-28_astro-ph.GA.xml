      <title>On the Formation of S-stars from a Recent Massive Black Hole Merger in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Galactic Center hosts a rotating disk of young stars between 0.05 and 0.5 pc of Sgr A*. The ``S-stars'' at a distance $&lt;0.04$ pc, however, are on eccentric orbits with nearly isotropically distributed inclinations. The dynamical origin of the S-star cluster has remained a theoretical challenge. Using a series of $N$-body simulations, we show that a recent massive black hole merger with Sgr A* can self-consistently produce many of the orbital properties of the Galactic nuclear star cluster within 0.5 pc. A black hole merger results in a gravitational wave recoil kick, which causes the surrounding cluster to form an apse-aligned, eccentric disk. We show that stars near the inner edge of an eccentric disk migrate inward and are driven to high eccentricities and inclinations due to secular torques similar to the eccentric Kozai-Lidov mechanism. In our fiducial model, starting with a thin eccentric disk with $e = 0.3$, the initially unoccupied region within $0.04$ pc is populated with high eccentricity, high inclination S-stars within a few Myr. This dynamical channel would suggest that a black hole of mass $2^{+3}_{-1.2} \times 10^5 \ M_{\odot}$ merged with Sgr A* within the last 10 Myr.</description>

      <title>The cooler past of the intracluster medium in TNG-Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intracluster medium (ICM) today is comprised largely of hot gas with clouds of cooler gas of unknown origin and lifespan. We analyze the evolution of cool gas (temperatures $\lesssim10^{4.5}$ K) in the ICM of 352 galaxy clusters from the TNG-Cluster simulations, with present-day mass $\sim10^{14.3-15.4}\,{\rm M_\odot}$. We follow the main progenitors of these clusters over the past $\sim13$ billion years (since $z\lesssim7$) and find that, according to TNG-Cluster, the cool ICM mass increases with redshift at fixed cluster mass, implying that this cooler past of the ICM is due to more than just halo growth. The cool cluster gas at $z\lesssim0.5$ is mostly located in and around satellite galaxies, while at $z\gtrsim2$ cool gas can also accrete via filaments from the intergalactic medium. Lower-mass and higher-redshift clusters are more susceptible to cooling. The cool ICM mass correlates with the number of gaseous satellites and inversely with the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass. The average number of gaseous satellites decreases since $z=2$, correlating with the decline in the cool ICM mass over cosmic time, suggesting a link between the two. Concurrently, kinetic SMBH feedback shifts the ICM temperature distribution, decreasing the cool ICM mass inside-out. At $z\approx0.5$, the predicted MgII column densities are in the ballpark of recent observations, where satellites and other halos contribute significantly to the total MgII column density. Suggestively, a non-negligible amount of the ICM cool gas forms stars in-situ at early times, reaching $\sim10^{2}\,{\rm M_\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ and an H$\alpha$ surface brightness of $\sim10^{-17}\,{\rm~erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,arcsec^{-2}}$ at $z\approx2$, detectable with Euclid and JWST.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Framework Characterizing the Metallicity and Star-Formation History Dependence of X-ray Binary Population Formation and Emission in Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new empirical framework modeling the metallicity and star-formation history (SFH) dependence of X-ray luminous ($L &gt; 10^{36}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) point-source population luminosity functions (XLFs) in normal galaxies. We expect the X-ray point-source populations are dominated by X-ray binaries (XRBs), with contributions from supernova remnants near the low luminosity end of our observations. Our framework is calibrated using the collective statistical power of 3,731 X-ray detected point-sources within 88 Chandra-observed galaxies at $D &lt;$ 40 Mpc that span broad ranges of metallicity ($Z \approx$ 0.03-2 $Z_\odot$), SFH, and morphology (dwarf irregulars, late-types, and early-types). Our best-fitting models indicate that the XLF normalization per unit stellar mass declines by $\approx$2-3 dex from 10 Myr to 10 Gyr, with a slower age decline for low-metallicity populations. The shape of the XLF for luminous X-ray sources ($L &lt; 10^{38}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) significantly steepens with increasing age and metallicity, while the lower-luminosity XLF appears to flatten with increasing age. Integration of our models provide predictions for X-ray scaling relations that agree very well with past results presented in the literature, including, e.g., the $L_{\rm X}$-SFR-$Z$ relation for high-mass XRBs (HMXBs) in young stellar populations as well as the $L_{\rm X}/M_\star$ ratio observed in early-type galaxies that harbor old populations of low-mass XRBs (LMXBs). The model framework and data sets presented in this paper further provide unique benchmarks that can be used for calibrating binary population synthesis models.</description>

      <title>Weak-lensing Mass Reconstruction of Galaxy Clusters with a Convolutional Neural Network -- II: Application to Next-Generation Wide-Field Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional weak-lensing mass reconstruction techniques suffer from various artifacts, including noise amplification and the mass-sheet degeneracy. In Hong et al. (2021), we demonstrated that many of these pitfalls of traditional mass reconstruction can be mitigated using a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). In this paper, we present our improvements and report on the detailed performance of our CNN algorithm applied to next-generation wide-field observations. Assuming the field of view ($3\deg.5 \times 3\deg.5$) and depth (27 mag at $5\sigma$) of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, we generated training datasets of mock shear catalogs with a source density of 33 arcmin$^{-2}$ from cosmological simulation ray-tracing data. We find that the current CNN method provides high-fidelity reconstructions consistent with the true convergence field, restoring both small and large-scale structures. In addition, the cluster detection utilizing our CNN reconstruction achieves $\sim75$% completeness down to $\sim 10^{14}M_{\odot}$. We anticipate that this CNN-based mass reconstruction will be a powerful tool in the Rubin era, enabling fast and robust wide-field mass reconstructions on a routine basis.</description>

      <title>Scylla IV: Intrinsic Stellar Properties and Line-of-Sight Dust Extinction Measurements Towards 1.5 Million Stars in the SMC and LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of resolved stars in nearby galaxies, we can constrain their stellar properties and line-of-sight dust extinction. From the Scylla survey, we obtain ultraviolet to near-infrared photometry from Wide Field Camera 3 onboard the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} for more than 1.5 million stars in the SMC and LMC. We use the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST) to analyze the multi-band SEDs of these sources and characterize their initial masses, ages, metallicities, distances, and line-of-sight extinction properties (e.g.~$A_V$, $R_V$). We apply quality cuts and perform validation simulations to construct a catalog of over 550,000 stars with high-reliability SED fits, which we use to analyze the stellar content and extinction properties of the SMC and LMC. We detect stars with masses as low as 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. Observed stellar age distributions show a jump in stars around 6 Gyrs ago, which is in agreement with other star-formation histories. Extinctions ($A_V$) in both galaxies follow a log-normal distribution. We compare $A_V$ with ancillary gas and dust tracers like $HI$, $H_\alpha$, and far infrared (FIR) dust emission and find positive correlations on a field-by-field basis. We convert observed $A_V$ to predicted dust surface densities using the Draine et. al. (2014) model and find $A_V$-based dust surface densities are a factor of $\sim$2.5 lower than observed FIR-based dust surface densities, a correction factor similar to other studies.</description>

      <title>The Galaxy Zoo Catalogs for the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy Zoo is an online project to classify morphological features in extra-galactic imaging surveys with public voting. In this paper, we compare the classifications made for two different surveys, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) imaging survey and a part of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), in the equatorial fields of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Our aim is to cross-validate and compare the classifications based on different imaging quality and depth.
  We find that generally the voting agrees globally but with substantial scatter i.e. substantial differences for individual galaxies. There is a notable higher voting fraction in favor of ``smooth'' galaxies in the DESI+\rev{{\sc zoobot}} classifications, most likely due to the difference between imaging depth. DESI imaging is shallower and slightly lower resolution than KiDS and the Galaxy Zoo images do not reveal details such as disk features \rev{and thus are missed in the {\sc zoobot} training sample}. \rev{We check against expert visual classifications and find good agreement with KiDS-based Galaxy Zoo voting.}
  We reproduce the results from Porter-Temple+ (2022), on the dependence of stellar mass, star-formation, and specific star-formation on the number of spiral arms. This shows that once corrected for redshift, the DESI Galaxy Zoo and KiDS Galaxy Zoo classifications agree well on population properties. The zoobot cross-validation increases confidence in its ability to compliment Galaxy Zoo classifications and its ability for transfer learning across surveys.</description>

      <title>Tracking Outflow using Line-Locking (TOLL). I. The case study of Quasar J221531-174408</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating line-locked phenomena within quasars is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quasar outflows, the role of radiation pressure in astrophysical flows, and the star formation history and metallicity of the early universe. We have initiated the Tracking Outflow by Line-Locking (TOLL) project to study quasar outflow by studying line-locking signatures using high-resolution high signal-to-noise ratio quasar spectra. In this paper, we present a case study of the line-locking signatures from QSO J221531-174408. The spectrum was obtained using the Very Large Telescope-UV Visual Echelle Spectrograph. We first identify associated absorbers in the spectrum using CIV, NV, and Si IV doublets and measure their velocity shifts, covering fractions, and column densities through line profile fitting technique. Then we compare the velocity separations between different absorbers, and detect nine pairs of line-locked C IV doublets, three pairs of line-locked N V doublets, and one pair of line-locked SiIV doublets. This is one of the four quasars known to possess line-locked signatures in C IV, Si IV, and N V at the same time. We also find three complex line-locked systems, where three to five absorbers are locked together through multi-ion doublets. Our study suggests that line-locking is a common phenomenon in the quasar outflows, and theoretical models involving more than two clouds and one ionic doublet are needed in the future to explain the formation of these complex line-locking signatures.</description>

      <title>A closer look at the origin of LINER emission and its connection to evolved stars with a machine learning classification scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the dominant ionizing sources in galaxies is essential for understanding their formation and evolution. Traditionally, spectra are classified based on their dominant ionizing source using strong emission lines and Baldwin, Phillips, \&amp; Terlevich (BPT) diagrams. The ionizing source is traditionally determined by the emission line ratios using the BPT diagrams. Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Regions (LINERs) are a class of ionizing mechanisms that is observationally identified but with a poorly understood origin, unlike the case of star forming regions and active galactic nuclei (AGN). LINERs, typically found in early-type galaxies, are often associated with low-luminosity AGN activity but may also be powered by aging stellar populations, particularly post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (p-AGB) stars. In this study, we employ a machine-learning-based encoder, Spender, to analyze the full MaNGA IFU spectra and identify key spectral features of LINERs. By examining the continuum and line emission of these spaxels, our approach aims to uncover hidden patterns and better understand the dominant ionizing sources. We show in this work that the neural network-based encoder was able identify LINER sources from the stellar continuum alone. The characteristics of the stellar population underlying LINER regions are consistent with evolved low mass stars implying that the source driving LINER emission is probably p-AGB stars rather than AGN activity.</description>

      <title>LIGHTS. The extended point spread functions of the Large Binocular Cameras at the LBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the arrival of the next generation of ultra-deep optical imaging surveys reaching $\mu_V$$\sim$30 mag/arcsec$^2$ (3$\sigma$; 10"$\times$10"), the removal of scattered light due to the point spread function (PSF) effect remains a critical step for the scientific exploitation of the low surface brightness information contained in these data. Because virtually all pixels in the ground-based images are affected by an unwanted screen of light with a brightness greater than $\mu_V$$\sim$29 mag/arcsec$^2$, the characterization of the extended PSF (R$&gt;$5 arcmin) is mandatory. We describe the procedure used to construct the extended PSFs of the LIGHTS survey in the g- and r-band images taken with the Large Binocular Cameras (LBCs) of the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). We produce PSFs with a radial extension of 7.5 arcmins. These are later extended to 30 arcmins following an empirically motivated power-law extrapolation of their behaviour in their outermost regions. As an example of the application of our methodology, we subtract the scattered light around the galaxy NGC3198. The result of this subtraction clearly shows the outermost parts of the galaxy's disc, which have been obscured by the influence of nearby bright stars. Following a reproducible science philosophy, we make all the PSF models and the scripts used to do the analysis of this paper publicly available.</description>

      <title>Red Stellar Populations and Dust Extinction toward W3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore red stellar populations toward the W3 giant molecular cloud through the use of optical-to-infrared (IR) photometry and Gaia DR 3 data, simultaneously characterizing stellar content and properties of dust in the molecular medium. We use a Rayleigh-Jeans Color Excess (RJCE) method modified to de-redden stellar observations of both red giants (RGs) and OB stars, and construct an IR Hertzsprung-Russell diagram validated against the Besanccon Galactic model. Taking advantage of the near-universal IR interstellar extinction law and precise Gaia measurements, we develop a method for obtaining the spectral classification, foreground extinction, and distance moduli of stars, validated by spectroscopically-confirmed OB stars. We constrain the observed parallax and proper motion of OB stars in W3, demonstrating the importance of considering systematic effects in the parallax bias, and assign parallax- and proper motion-based cloud membership to our stellar samples. While it has been assumed that all spectroscopic OB stars are inside the W3 cloud, we find evidence of seven background B stars and three potential runaway OB stars. The methods developed here based on known stellar populations enable us to identify 82 new OB candidates that are confidently within the cloud. We quantify several dust-to-dust empirical correlations, in particular the IR color excess $E(H-[4.5])$ and the optical depth $\tau_1$ of submillimeter dust emission at 1 THz using RGs behind W3, measuring a best fit of $E(H-[4.5]) = (1.07 \pm 0.04) \times 10^3 \, \tau_{1,\,\mathrm{HOTT}} + (0.00 \pm 0.02)$ mags.</description>

      <title>Unimolecular Chemical Kinetics in the Interstellar: Competition of Infrared Radiation and Collision Activation Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unimolecular gas phase chemical reactions could be activated by both infrared (IR) radiation and inter-molecular collision in the interstellar environment. Understanding the interplay and competition between the radiation and collision activation mechanisms is crucial for assessing accurate reaction rate constants with an appropriate model. In this work, guided by an extended version of Lindemann theory that considers the contribution of both the radiation-activation and collision-activation to the rate constant of unimolecular reactions, we show that the relative importance of the two mechanisms can be measured by a dimensionless number $PR$ that is the ratio of the collision frequency to the radiation absorption rate of the molecule. The reaction kinetic is dominated by collision-activation or by radiation activation depending on whether $PR$ is larger or smaller than a reference value $PR^*$, which is determined to be $PR^* \approx 10$ based on magnitudes of molecular properties and is verified by detailed calculations of a number of typical interstellar unimolecular reactions. This method of evaluating the relative importance of the two mechanisms is checked against master equation calculations of two interstellar reactions: the dissociation reaction of silicilic acid around the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and the methyl association in Titan's atmosphere, and the validity is verified. The method can be used in the future to help determine the appropriate and effective modeling approach for chemical reactions in astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>The Local Ultraviolet to Infrared Treasury I. Survey Overview of the Broadband Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Local Ultraviolet to Infrared Treasury (LUVIT) is a Hubble Space Telescope program that combines newly acquired data in the near ultraviolet (NUV), optical, and near infrared (NIR) with archival optical and NIR imaging to produce multiband panchromatic resolved stellar catalogs for 23 pointings in 22 low-mass, star-forming galaxies ranging in distance from the outskirts of the Local Group to ~3.8 Mpc. We describe the survey design, detail the LUVIT broadband filter observations and the archival datasets included in the LUVIT reductions, and summarize the simultaneous multiband data reduction steps. The spatial distributions and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) from the resulting stellar catalogs are presented for each target, from the NUV to the NIR. We demonstrate in which regions of the CMDs stars with NUV and optical, optical and NIR, and NUV through NIR detections reside. For each target, we use the results from artificial star tests to measure representative completeness, bias, and total photometric uncertainty as a function of magnitude in each broadband filter. We also assess which LUVIT targets have significant spatial variation in the fraction of stars recovered at a given magnitude. The panchromatic LUVIT stellar catalogs will provide a rich legacy dataset for a host of resolved stellar population studies.</description>

      <title>A Rapidly Accreting Active Galactic Nucleus Hidden in a Dust-Obscured Galaxy at $z \sim 0.8$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust-obscured galaxies (DOGs) containing central supermassive black holes (SMBHs) that are rapidly accreting (i.e., having high Eddington ratios, $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$) may represent a key phase closest to the peak of both the black-hole and galaxy growth in the coevolution framework for SMBHs and galaxies. In this work, we present a 68 ks XMM-Newton observation of the high-$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ DOG J1324+4501 at \mbox{$z \sim 0.8$}, which was initially observed by Chandra. We analyze the XMM-Newton spectra jointly with archival Chandra spectra. In performing a detailed \mbox{X-ray} spectral analysis, we find that the source is intrinsically \mbox{X-ray} luminous with $\log (L_\mathrm{X}$/erg s$^{-1}) = 44.71^{+0.08}_{-0.12}$ and heavily obscured with $\log (N_\mathrm{H}/\mathrm{cm}^{-2}) = 23.43^{+0.09}_{-0.13}$. We further utilize UV-to-IR archival photometry to measure and fit the source's spectral energy distribution (SED) to estimate its host-galaxy properties. We present a supplementary comparison sample of 21 \mbox{X-ray} luminous DOGs from the XMM-SERVS survey with sufficient ($&gt; 200$) $0.5-10$ keV counts to perform a similarly detailed X-ray spectral analysis. Of the X-ray luminous DOGs in our sample, we find that J1324+4501 is the most remarkable, possessing one of the highest \mbox{X-ray} luminosities, column densities, and star-formation rates. We demonstrate that J1324+4501 is in an extreme evolutionary stage where SMBH accretion and galaxy growth are at their peaks.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of the High Star-Formation Efficiency in Massive Galaxies at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the early excess of bright galaxies seen by \textit{JWST}, we run zoom-in cosmological simulations of a massive galaxy at Cosmic Dawn (MDG), in a halo of $10^{11} M_\odot$ at $z = 9$, using the hydro-gravitational code RAMSES at an effective resolution $\sim 10~{\rm pc}$. We investigate physical mechanisms that enhance the star-formation efficiencies (SFEs) under the unique conditions of high gas density ($\sim 3\times 10^3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, $\sim 10^4~M_\odot/{\rm pc^2}$). Our fiducial star formation recipe uses a physically-motivated, turbulence-based, multi-freefall model, avoiding ad-hoc extrapolation from lower redshifts. By $z = 9$, our simulated galaxy is a clumpy, thick, rotating disc with a high stellar mass of a few $10^9~M_\odot$ and high star formation rate of $\sim 100~M_\odot/{\rm yr}$. The high gas density makes supernova (SN) feedback less effective at suppressing star formation, producing a relatively high local SFE $\gtrsim 10\%$. The global SFE is dominated by feedback-driven outflows and is only weakly correlated with the local SFE. Photoionization heating can enhance the effects of SN feedback on the local SFE by making more SNe explode in diffuse environments, but the global SFE remains high even in our simulations with the strongest feedback. Intense accretion at Cosmic Dawn seeds strong turbulence, which reduces the local SFE for the same gas conditions due to turbulent pressure support. This prevents star-forming clouds from catastrophically collapsing, but this only weakly affects the global SFE. The star formation histories of our simulated galaxies are in the ballpark of the MDGs seen by \textit{JWST}, despite our limited resolution. They set the stage for future simulations which treat radiation self-consistently and use a higher effective resolution $\sim 1~{\rm pc}$ which captures the physics of star-forming clouds.</description>

      <title>Do strong bars exhibit strong non-circular motions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic bars induce characteristic motions deviating from pure circular rotation, known as non-circular motions. As bars are non-axisymmetric structures, stronger bars are expected to show stronger non-circular motions. However, this has not yet been confirmed by observations. We use a bisymmetric model to account for the stellar kinematics of 14 barred galaxies obtained with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) and characterize the degree of bar-driven non-circular motions. For the first time, we find tight relations between the bar strength (bar ellipticity and torque parameter) and the degree of stellar non-circular motions. We also find that bar strength is strongly associated with the stellar radial velocity driven by bars. Our results imply that stronger bars exhibit stronger non-circular motions. Non-circular motions beyond the bar are found to be weak, comprising less than 10% of the strength of the circular motions. We find that galaxies with a boxy/peanut (B/P) bulge exhibit a higher degree of non-circular motions and higher stellar radial velocity compared to galaxies without a B/P bulge, by 30-50%. However, this effect could be attributed to the presence of strong bars in galaxies with a B/P feature in our sample, which would naturally result in higher radial motions, rather than to B/P bulges themselves inducing stronger radial motions. More observational studies, utilizing both stellar and gaseous kinematics on statistically complete samples, along with numerical studies, are necessary to draw a comprehensive view of the impact that B/P bulges have on bar-driven non-circular motions.</description>

      <title>Galaxy catalogs from the SAGE Semi-Analytic Model calibrated on THE THREE HUNDRED hydrodynamical simulations: A method to push the limits toward lower mass galaxies in dark matter only clusters simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The new generation of upcoming deep photometric and spectroscopic surveys will allow us to measure the astrophysical properties of faint galaxies in massive clusters. This would demand to produce simulations of galaxy clusters with better mass resolution than the ones available today if we want to make comparisons between the upcoming observations and predictions of cosmological models. But producing full-physics hydrodynamical simulations of the most massive clusters is not an easy task. This would involve billions of computational elements to reliably resolve low mass galaxies similar to those measured in observations. On the other hand, dark matter only simulations of cluster size halos can be done with much larger mass resolution but at the cost of having to apply a model that populate galaxies within each of the subhalos in these simulations. In this paper we present the results of a new set of dark matter only simulations with different mass resolutions within the THE THREE HUNDRED project. We have generated catalogs of galaxies with stellar and luminosity properties by applying the SAGE Semi-Analytical Model of galaxy formation. To obtain the catalogs consistent with the results from hydrodynamical simulations, the internal physical parameters of SAGE were calibrated with the Particle Swarm Optimization method using a subset of full-physics runs with the same mass resolution than the dark matter only ones.</description>

      <title>Sub-Eddington accreting supermassive primordial black holes explain Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has uncovered an abundant population of compact, extremely red, and X-ray weak objects at $z\gtrsim4$, knows as ``Little Red Dots" (LRDs). These objects exhibit spectral energy distributions that resemble both active galactic nuclei (AGN) and stellar population templates. However, whether dominated by AGN activity or compact star formation, the high redshifts and masses/luminosities of LRDs, coupled with their significant abundance, present potential challenges to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we proposes a novel cosmic interpretation of this anomaly, suggesting that these LRDs are likely massive galaxies seeded by supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) came into being in the very early universe. We analyze 434 known LRDs from the 0.54 ${\rm deg}^2$ COSMOS-Web survey and test the hypothesis that they originated from SMPBHs assuming sub-Eddington accretion. According to our result, SMPBHs actually could lead to the existence of more LRDs, even at higher redshifts ($z&gt;8$).</description>

      <title>Ionized Carbon in Galaxies: The [C II] 158 $\mu$m Line as a Total Molecular Gas Mass Tracer Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a statistical study of the [C II] 158 $\mu$m line and the CO(1-0) emission for a sample of $\sim$200 local and high-$z$ (32 sources with $z&gt;1$) galaxies with much different physical conditions. We explore the correlation between the luminosities of [C II] and CO(1-0) lines, and obtain a strong linear relationship, confirming that [C II] is able to trace total molecular gas mass, with a small difference between (U)LIRGs and less-luminous galaxies. The tight and linear relation between [C II] and CO(1-0) is likely determined by the average value of the observed visual extinction $A_V$ and the range of $G_0/n$ in galaxies. Further investigations into the dependence of $L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}/L_{\mathrm{CO(1-0)}}$ on different physical properties show that $L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}/L_{\mathrm{CO(1-0)}}$ (1) anti-correlates with $\Sigma_{\mathrm{IR}}$, and the correlation becomes steeper when $\Sigma_{\mathrm{IR}} \gtrsim 10^{11}$ $L_\odot\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$; (2) correlates positively with the distance from the main sequence $\Delta(\mathrm{MS})$ when $\Delta(\mathrm{MS})\lesssim 0$; and (3) tends to show a systematically smaller value in systems where the [C II] emission is dominated by ionized gas. Our results imply that caution needs to be taken when applying a constant [[C II]-to-$M_{\mathrm{H_2}}$ conversion factor to estimate the molecular gas content in extreme cases, such as galaxies having low-level star formation activity or high SFR surface density.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Gas Dynamics and Star Formation in a z=1.1 Main Sequence Spiral Galaxy with ALMA and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of high-resolution CO(2-1) and Paschen-$\alpha$ emission lines to trace gas dynamics and spatially resolved star formation in ASPECS-LP.3mm.06, a $z=1.1$ main sequence galaxy. Utilizing data from the ALMA and JWST NIRCam Wide Field Slitless Spectroscopy (WFSS), we explore both ionized gas and molecular gas within this galaxy. With a substantial molecular gas fraction (f$_\mathrm{mol}$ = 0.44 $\pm$ 0.02), ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 remains on the star-forming main sequence and adheres to the Kennicutt-Schmidt (KS) relation, indicating typical gas-to-star conversion efficiency. Our analysis reveals extended structures across multiple wavelengths, suggesting regulated star formation within a stable disk. The spatially resolved star formation efficiency (SFE) and kinematic analysis indicate that ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 features a smooth mass assembly process across bulge and disk. Additionally, the galaxy exhibits modest dust extinction (A$_\mathrm{V}$ = 0.8), potentially linked to self-regulation during bulge formation. These findings position ASPECS-LP.3mm.06 as a prototypical galaxy, offering valuable insights into the mechanisms governing normal disk galaxy growth at z$\sim$1.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Abundance Discrepancy Problem in HII Regions with Photoionization Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex ionization structure and chemical composition of \hii\ regions poses a significant challenge in astrophysics. The abundance discrepancy problem, characterized by inconsistencies between abundances derived from recombination lines (RLs) and collisionally excited lines (CELs), has long been a puzzle in the field. In this theoretical study, we present novel photoionization models that incorporate temperature, density, and chemical inhomogeneities within a single cloud to comprehensively address this discrepancy. By accounting for the intricate interplay between ionization, excitation, and chemistry, our models successfully reproduce both observed RLs and CELs with with an average difference between our models and the observations of 25% -- within uncertainties inherent in Galactic archival long-slit and new SDSS-V Local Volume Mapper observations. Through comparisons between generic inhomogeneous model predictions and observations, demonstrating the ability of our theoretical framework to analyze the abundance discrepancy problem within \hii\ regions. Our results highlight the importance of incorporating spatially resolved temperature, density, and chemical structures when interpreting the physical processes governing emission line spectra in these astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Implication of a galaxy-scale negative feedback by one of the most powerful multi-phase outflows in a hyper-luminous infrared galaxy at the intermediate redshift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful, galactic outflows driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are commonly considered as a main mechanism to regulate star formation in massive galaxies. Ultra- and hyper-luminous IR galaxies (U/HyLIRGs) are thought to represent a transition phase of galaxies from a rapidly growing period to a quiescent status as gas swept out by outflows, providing a laboratory to investigate outflows and their feedback effects on the hosts. In this paper we report recent Gemini and ALMA observations of a HyLIRG, J1126 at $z=0.46842$, which has been identified with a puzzling co-existence of a fast ionized outflow ($&gt;2000$ km s$^{-1}$) and an intense starburst (star formation rate of 800 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$). The Gemini observation shows the fast ionized outflow is extended to several kpc with a mass-loss rate of 180 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. A massive molecular outflow with a high mass-loss rate (2500 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) is revealed by ALMA. The multi-phase outflows show large factors of momentum boost and loading of kinetic power, indicating a driving by thermal pressure of a nuclear hot wind and/or radiation pressure of a highly obscured AGN. In addition to ejection of kinetic energy, it is also found that the powerful outflow can induce an ionizing shock in the galaxy disk and enhance the excitation and dissociation of molecular gas. The powerful outflow probably results in an instantaneous negative feedback and shows potential to regulate the host growth in a long term.</description>

      <title>Velocity dispersion function evolution from strong lensing statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The redshift and size distributions of galaxy scale strong lenses depend on the evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in the redshift range 0.2&lt;z&lt;1. We use this dependence to constrain the velocity dispersion function (VDF) evolution from the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S) sample of lenses. Our modeling of the lens population includes lens identifiability given survey parameters, and constrains the evolution of the VDF based on the redshift distributions of sources and lenses as well as the distribution of Einstein radii. We consider five different assumptions for the reference VDF at redshift zero and two sets of scaling relations for the VDF. We find that in all cases the observed lens sample favors a slow evolution of both the VDF normalization factor and the VDF characteristic velocity with redshift which is consistent with a VDF that is constant in redshift for z&lt;1.</description>

      <title>On the role of non-circular motions in MaNGA galaxies I: global properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-circular (NC) motions represent the imprints of non-axisymmetric structures in galaxies, providing opportunities to study the physical properties of gas departing from circular rotation. In this work, we have conducted a systematic study of the non-circular motions in a sample of 1624 gas-rich disk galaxies from the MaNGA MPL-11. By using the H$\alpha$ velocity as a tracer of the disk rotation, we find indications that the amplitude of the non-circular motions is related to the stellar mass, with the low mass and late-type galaxies the most affected. In our sample, we find ratios of circular to non-circular rotation ranging from 5% to 20%. By implementing harmonic models to include NC motions associated with spiral arms and stellar bars, we find that the rotational curves traced with H$\alpha$ are barely affected by the NC induced by these structures. Consequently, in our sample, we do not find evidence that NC motions contribute to the scatter of the stellar Tully-Fisher relation. Our results suggest that non-circular motions might have a more localized effect in galaxies rather than a global one.</description>

Abstract: Stellar streams retain a memory of their gravitational interactions with small-scale perturbations. While perturbative models for streams have been formulated in action-angle coordinates, a direct transformation to these coordinates is only available for static and typically axisymmetric models for the galaxy. The real Milky Way potential is in a state of disequilibrium, complicating the application of perturbative methods around an equilibrium system. Here, we utilize a combination of differentiable simulations and Hamiltonian perturbation theory to model the leading-order effect of dark matter subhalos on stream observables. To obtain a perturbative description of streams, we develop a direct and efficient forward mode differentiation of Hamilton's equations of motion. Our model operates in observable coordinates, allowing us to treat the effects of arbitrary subhalo potentials on streams perturbatively, while simultaneously capturing non-linear effects due to other substructures like the infalling LMC or the rotating bar. The model predicts the velocity dispersion of streams as a function of subhalo statistics, allowing us to constrain the low-mass range of subhalos down to $\sim 10^5~M_\odot$. We forecast the velocity dispersion of the GD-1 stream, and find that observations are in agreement with a CDM subhalo population, with a slight preference for more dense subhalos. The method provides a new approach to characterize streams in the presence of substructure, with significantly more modeling flexibility compared to previous works.</description>

      <title>High resolution HI mapping of nearby XMP BCD galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical observations of Blue Compact Dwarf galaxies (BCDs) show they typically have high specific star formation rates and low metallicites. A subset of these galaxies (those with the lowest gas phase metallicities) display cometary optical morphologies similar to those found at high redshift. Whether this combination of properties predominantly arises from interactions with neighbours or accretion from the cosmic web or something else remains unclear. We used high resolution HI mapping to gain insights into the processes driving the observed properties of a sample of extremely metal poor (XMP) BCDs. We present Very Large Array B- and C-configuration HI mapping of four BCDs. For three of the targeted BCDs we also detect and map the HI in their nearby companions. In these three cases there is HI evidence for a recent flyby interaction between the BCD and a nearby companion. The HI evidence for recent interactions for these three BCDs is corroborated by our analysis of the tidal forces exerted on the BCDs by companions with available spectroscopic redshifts. For J0204-1009 we had sufficient spatial resolution to determine that it is dark matter dominated and estimate its DM halo mass to be in the range 1.2 x 10^11 to 5.2 x 10^11 solar masses. It is the most isolated BCD in our small sample, J0301-0052, which shows one of the most asymmetric HI morphologies. J0301-0052 has a similar cometary HI morphology to the BCD's optical morphology, although the HI column density maximum is projected at the end of the of the optical tail. Our HI observations suggest J0301-0052 may be undergoing a merger, while the other BCDs show evidence of a recent tidal interaction with a near neighbour. While our selection criteria favoured BCDs with companions our results are consistent with the earlier finding by other authors that most BCDs are associated with either mild tidal interactions or mergers.</description>

      <title>Semi-confined supernova feedback in HII region bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galactic-scale simulations rely on sub-grid models to provide prescriptions for the coupling between supernova (SN) feedback and the interstellar medium (ISM). Many of these models are computed in 1-D to allow for an efficient way to account for the variability of properties of their local environment. However, small-scale simulations revealed that the release of energy from SNe within molecular clouds can be highly asymmetrical. This is largely due to the presence of pre-SN feedback, such as ionizing radiation, that are able to carve cavities and channels around the progenitors prior to their detonation. Being partially confined, the SN energy escapes into the outer ISM preferentially through these channels, departing from the spherically symmetric 1-D descriptions. To understand by how much the feedback output could differ, we present a theoretical model for a semi-confined SN. The problem concerns a SN expanding into an evolved HII region, bounded by a molecular cloud with pre-existing vents. With the aid of simple 3-D hydrodynamical simulations, we show that this mode of energy release increases the dynamical impact of the outflows, and extends the timescales over which the SN is energetically coupled to the surrounding matter. We also show that the amount of small-scale solenoidal turbulence driven by semi-confined SNe may be amplified.</description>

      <title>Stellar Loci. VIII. Photometric Metallicities for 100 Million Stars Based on Synthetic Gaia Colors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the stellar locus method to synthetic $(BP-RP)_{XPSP}$ and $(BP-G)_{XPSP}$ colors derived from corrected Gaia BP/RP (XP) spectra to obtain accurate and precise estimates of metallicity for about 100 million stars in the Milky Way (34 million giants in the color range $0.6 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.75$ and 65 million dwarfs in the color range $0.2 &lt; (BP-RP)_0 &lt; 1.5$). The sub milli-magnitude precision of the derived synthetic stellar colors enables estimates of metallicity for stars as low as [Fe/H] $\sim -4$. Multiple validation tests indicate that the typical metallicity precision is between 0.05 -- 0.1 dex for both dwarfs and giants at [Fe/H] = 0 as faint as G $\sim$ 17, and decreases to 0.15 -- 0.25 dex at [Fe/H] = $-$2.0. For $-4.0 &lt;$ [Fe/H] $ &lt; -3.0$, the typical metallicity precision decreases to on the order of 0.4 -- 0.5 dex, based on the results from the training sample. Our achieved precision is comparable to or better than previous efforts using the entire XP spectra, and about three times better than our previous work based on Gaia EDR3 colors. This opens up new opportunities for investigations of stellar populations, the formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way, the chemistry of stars and star clusters, and the identification of candidate stars for subsequent high-resolution spectroscopic follow-up.</description>

      <title>SIROCCO: A Publicly Available Monte Carlo Ionization and Radiative Transfer Code for Astrophysical Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Outflows are critical components of many astrophysical systems, including accreting compact binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN). These outflows can significantly affect a system's evolution and alter its observational appearance by reprocessing the radiation produced by the central engine. Sirocco (Simulating Ionization and Radiation in Outflows Created by Compact Objects - or "the code formerly known as Python") is a Sobolev-based Monte Carlo ionization and radiative transfer code. It is designed to simulate the spectra produced by any system with an azimuthally-symmetric outflow, from spherical stellar winds to rotating, biconical accretion disc winds. Wind models can either be parametrized or imported, e.g. from hydrodynamical simulations. The radiation sources include an optically thick accretion disc and various central sources with flexible spectra and geometries. The code tracks the "photon packets" produced by the sources in any given simulation as they traverse and interact with the wind. The code assumes radiative near-equilibrium, so the thermal and ionization state can be determined iteratively from these interactions. Once the physical properties in the wind have converged, Sirocco can be used to generate synthetic spectra at a series of observer sightlines. Here, we describe the physical assumptions, operation, performance and limitations of the code. We validate it against tardis, cmfgen and cloudy, finding good agreement, and present illustrative synthetic spectra from disc winds in cataclysmic variables, tidal disruption events, AGN and X-ray binaries. Sirocco is publicly available on GitHub, alongside its associated data, documentation and sample input files covering a wide range of astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>No evidence for gamma-ray emission from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: More than a decade ago, the Large Area Telescope aboard the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope unveiled the existence of two gigantic gamma-ray lobes known as the Fermi bubbles. While their origin is still unknown, various studies identified intricate spectral and morphological structures within the bubbles. One peculiar region, the cocoon, has recently been associated with gamma-ray emissions from the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal (Sgr) galaxy. We assess the validity of this claim through adaptive-template fitting and pixel-count statistical methods. Our approach introduces a substantial advancement in data interpretation by enabling a data-driven optimisation of astrophysical background models, thereby reducing the impact of background mis-modelling. We do not find evidence for gamma-ray emission from the Sgr region at the level obtained in previous work. We demonstrate that there is no pronounced difference between the source population located within the cocoon region and a reference region at similar latitudes. We examine the hypothesis that a millisecond pulsar population in Sgr causes the putative signal via dedicated simulations finding that it is unlikely that we may have detected their presence in Sgr.</description>

      <title>Cross-Survey Image Transformation: Enhancing SDSS and DECaLS Images to Near-HSC Quality for Advanced Astronomical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on transforming galaxy images between astronomical surveys, specifically enhancing images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) to achieve quality comparable to the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey (HSC). We proposed a hybrid model called Pix2WGAN, which integrates the pix2pix framework with the Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to convert low-quality observational images into high-quality counterparts. Our model successfully transformed DECaLS images into pseudo-HSC images, yielding impressive results and significantly enhancing the identification of complex structures, such as galaxy spiral arms and tidal tails, which may have been overlooked in the original DECaLS images. Moreover, Pix2WGAN effectively addresses issues like artifacts, noise, and blurriness in both source and target images. In addition to the basic Pix2WGAN model, we further developed an advanced architecture called Cascaded Pix2WGAN, which incorporates a multi-stage training mechanism designed to bridge the quality gap between SDSS and HSC images, demonstrating similarly promising outcomes. We systematically assessed the similarity between the model-generated pseudo-HSC images and actual HSC images using various metrics, including Mean Squared Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), along with perceptual metrics such as Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) and Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID). The results indicate that images transformed by our model outperform both the original SDSS and DECaLS images across nearly all evaluation metrics. Our research is expected to provide significant technical support for astronomical data analysis, cross-survey image integration, and high-precision astrometry.</description>

      <title>Lensing point-spread function of coherent astrophysical sources and non-trivial wave effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most research on astrophysical lensing has been conducted using the geometric optics framework, where there exists a clear concept of lensing images. However, wave optics effects can be important for coherent sources, e.g. pulsars, fast raio bursts, and gravitational waves observed at long wavelengths. There, the concept of lensing images needs an extension. We introduce the concept of the `lensing point-spread function' (LPSF), the smoothed flux density distribution of a coherent point source after being lensed, as a generalization of the lensing image concept at finite frequencies. The frequency-dependent LPSF captures the gradual change of the flux density distribution of the source from discrete geometric images at high frequencies to a smooth distribution at low frequencies. It complements other generalizations of lensing images, notably the imaginary images and the Lefschetz thimbles. Being a footprint of a lensing system, the LPSF is useful for theoretical studies of lensing. Using the LPSF, we identify a frequency range with non-trivial wave effects, where both geometric optics and perturbative wave optics fail, and determine this range to be $|\kappa|^{-1} \lesssim \nu \lesssim 10$, with $\kappa$ and $\nu$ being the dimensionless lens amplitude and the reduced observing frequency, respectively. Observation of LPSFs with non-trivial wave effects requires either very close-by lenses or very large observing wavelengths. The potential possibilities are the lensing of gravitational waves, the plasma lensing of Milky Way pulsars, and lensing by the solar gravitational lens.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building a comprehensive catalog of galaxy clusters is a fundamental task for the studies on the structure formation and galaxy evolution. In this paper, we present COSMIC (Cluster Optical Search using Machine Intelligence in Catalogs), an algorithm utilizing machine learning techniques to efficiently detect galaxy clusters. COSMIC involves two steps, including the identification of the brightest cluster galaxies and the estimation of the cluster richness. We train our models on the galaxy data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and WHL galaxy cluster catalog. Validated to a test data in the region of northern Galactic cap, COSMIC algorithm demonstrates a high completeness when cross-matching with previous cluster catalogs. Richness comparison with previous optical and X-ray measurements also demonstrated a tight correlation. Our methodology showcases robust performance in galaxy cluster detection and holds promising prospects for applications in upcoming large-scale surveys.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to gain new insights into the controversial dynamical status of MACS J0329-0211 (MACS0329), a massive cluster at z=0.4503, with a new analysis using a large sample of member galaxies as kinematic tracers. Our analysis is based on extensive spectroscopic data for more than 1700 galaxies obtained with the VIMOS and MUSE spectrographs at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), in combination with B and Rc Suprime-Cam photometry from the Subaru archive. According to our member selection procedure, we define a sample of 430 MACS0329 galaxies within 6 Mpc, corresponding to about 3 times the virial radius. We estimate the global velocity dispersion, sigmaV=841 km/s, and present the velocity dispersion profile. We estimate a mass M200=9.2E14 in units of solar masses, using 227 galaxies within R200=1.71 Mpc, for which sigmaV200=1018 km/s. The spatial distribution of the red galaxies traces a SE-NW elongated structure, without signs of a velocity gradient. This structure likely originates from the main phase of cluster assembly. The distribution of the blue galaxies is less concentrated, more rounded and shows signs of substructure, all characteristics indicating a recent infall of groups from the field. We detect two loose clumps of blue galaxies in the south and southwest at a distance about R200 from the cluster center. The strong spatial segregation among galaxy populations is not accompanied by kinematical difference. Thanks to our extensive catalog of spectroscopic redshift, we are able to study galaxy systems that are intervening along the line of sight. We can identify two foreground galaxy systems (GrG1 at z=0.31 and GrG2 at z=0.38) and one background system (GrG3 at z=0.47). We point out that the second brightest galaxy projected onto the MACS0329 core is in fact the dominant galaxy of the foreground group GrG2.</description>

      <title>Improving Galaxy Cluster Selection with the Outskirt Stellar Mass of Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The number density and redshift evolution of optically selected galaxy clusters offer an independent measurement of the amplitude of matter fluctuations, $S_8$. However, recent results have shown that clusters chosen by the redMaPPer algorithm show richness-dependent biases that affect the weak lensing signals and number densities of clusters, increasing uncertainty in the cluster mass calibration and reducing their constraining power. In this work, we evaluate an alternative cluster proxy, outskirt stellar mass, $M_{\textrm{out}}$, defined as the total stellar mass within a $[50,100]$ kpc envelope centered on a massive galaxy. This proxy exhibits scatter comparable to redMaPPer richness, $\lambda$, but is less likely to be subject to projection effects. We compare the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 redMaPPer cluster catalog with a $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected cluster sample from the Hyper-Suprime Camera survey. We use weak lensing measurements to quantify and compare the scatter of $M_{\textrm{out}}$ and $\lambda$ with halo mass. Our results show $M_{\textrm{out}}$ has a scatter consistent with $\lambda$, with a similar halo mass dependence, and that both proxies contain unique information about the underlying halo mass. We find $\lambda$-selected samples introduce features into the measured $\Delta \Sigma$ signal that are not well fit by a log-normal scatter only model, absent in $M_{\textrm{out}}$ selected samples. Our findings suggest that $M_{\textrm{out}}$ offers an alternative for cluster selection with more easily calibrated selection biases, at least at the generally lower richnesses probed here. Combining both proxies may yield a mass proxy with a lower scatter and more tractable selection biases, enabling the use of lower mass clusters in cosmology. Finally, we find the scatter and slope in the $\lambda-M_{\textrm{out}}$ scaling relation to be $0.49 \pm 0.02$ and $0.38 \pm 0.09$.</description>

      <title>A tell-tale tracer for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks: comparing the [CI] 8727 A line and ALMA observations in proplyds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of protoplanetary disks in regions with massive OB stars is influenced by externally driven winds that deplete the outer parts of disks. These winds have previously been studied via forbidden oxygen emission lines, which also arise in isolated disks in low-mass star forming-regions (SFRs) with weak external UV fields in photoevaporative or magnetic (internal) disk winds. It is crucial to determine how to disentangle external winds from internal ones. Here, we report a proxy for unambiguously identifying externally driven winds with a forbidden line of neutral atomic carbon, [C i] 8727 A. We compare for the first time the spatial location of the emission in the [O i] 5577 A, [O i] 6300 A, and [C i] 8727 A lines traced by VLT/MUSE-NFM, with the ALMA Band 7 continuum disk emission in a sample of 12 proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). We confirm that the [O i] 5577 A emission is co-spatial with the disk emission, whereas the [O i] 6300 A is emitted both on the disk surface and on the ionization front of the proplyds. We show for the first time that the [C i] 8727 A line is also co-spatial with the disk surface in proplyds, as seen in the MUSE and ALMA data comparison. To verify whether the [C i] 8727 A line is detected in regions where external photoevaporation is not expected, we examine VLT/X-Shooter spectra for young stars in low-mass SFRs. Although the [O i] lines are well detected in all these targets, there is &lt;&lt;10% detection rate in the case of the [C i] 8727 A line. This number increases substantially to a ~40% detection rate in sigma-Orionis, a region with intermediate UV radiation. The spatial location of the [C i] 8727 A line emission and the lack of its detection in isolated disks in low-mass SFRs strongly suggest that this line is a tell-trace tracer of externally driven photoevaporative winds, which agrees with recent excitation models.</description>

      <title>The effect of helium reionization on the Lyman-alpha forest hydrogen flux statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the impact of QSOs on the high redshift (z &gt; 4) Intergalactic Medium using Monte Carlo realisations of QSO populations and the HeIII regions they generate, applied to the Sherwood-Relics simulations, allowing for uncertainties in the QSO luminosity function, its evolution, and QSO spectra and ages. While QSO luminosity functions based on optical-infrared selection are unable to reproduce the broadening HI Lyman-alpha optical depth distributions at z &gt; 5, much broader distributions are found for the higher numbers of QSOs based on x-ray selection, suggesting a large QSO contribution to the ultra-violet background at z &gt; 5 may offer an alternative to late reionization models to account for the broad HI Lyman-alpha optical depth distributions. Realisations using QSOs based on the higher QSO counts also much better recover the measured pixel flux auto-correlation function at z &gt; 5. The HeIII regions from QSO sources according to both types of luminosity function suppress the pixel flux power spectrum on small scales, k &gt; 0.02 s/km, while enhancing it on larger, both by amounts of up to tens of percent at z &gt; 4, with the magnitude increasing with the intergalactic HeIII filling factor and the boost in temperature within the HeIII regions.</description>

      <title>Formation of free-floating planetary mass objects via circumstellar disk encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of planetary mass objects (PMOs) wandering in young star clusters remains enigmatic, especially when they come in pairs. They could represent the lowest-mass object formed via molecular cloud collapse or high-mass planets ejected from their host stars. However, neither theory fully accounts for their abundance and multiplicity. Here, we show via hydrodynamic simulations that free-floating PMOs have a unique formation channel via the fragmentation of tidal bridge between encountering circumstellar disks. This process can be highly productive in density clusters like Trapezium forming metal-poor PMOs with disks. Free-floating multiple PMOs also naturally emerge when neighboring PMOs are caught by mutual gravity. PMOs may thus form a distinct population different from stars and planets.</description>

      <title>Misaligned gas acquisition as a formation pathway of S0 galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a sample of 753 S0 galaxies from the MPL-10 of MaNGA survey and investigate the gas-star kinematic misalignment and merger remnant fraction in galaxies with different morphological types. The misalign fraction in S0s is the highest among all the morphological types for both young (global $\mathrm{D}_n4000&lt;1.6$, $\sim$15%) and old (global $\mathrm{D}_n4000&gt;1.6$, $\sim$10%) galaxies. We compare the properties of misaligned S0s with other types of galaxies, finding: (i) misaligned S0s and misaligned spirals have higher bulge luminosity, higher B/T and larger S\'ersic index compared to spirals; (ii) the misaligned S0s have lower bulge luminosity $M_r$ and smaller bulge size than merger remnant S0s, while aligned S0s have the widest coverage for these parameter distributions which are overlapped with both misaligned S0s and merger remnant S0s; (iii) misaligned S0s have lower stellar mass $M_*$ and more isolated environment than aligned S0s and merger remnant S0s; (iv) the young misaligned S0s have positive $\mathrm{D}_n4000$ radial gradient, while the aligned S0s and merger remnant S0s show negative $\mathrm{D}_n4000$ radial gradient. Combining all these observational results, we suggest misaligned gas acquisition as another efficient formation pathway for S0 galaxies. The redistribution of gas angular momentum during gas-gas collision between accreted and pre-existing gas leads to gas inflow and the growth of bulge component, meanwhile the lack of cold gas at the outskirts leads to fading of spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Impact of Dynamical Friction on the Tidal Formation of NGC 1052-DF2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of dark matter-deficient galaxies (DMDGs) through tidal interactions has been a subject of growing interest, particularly with the discovery of galaxies such as NGC 1052-DF2. Previous studies suggested that strong tidal forces could strip dark matter from satellite galaxies, but the role of dynamical friction in this process has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we present self-consistent N-body simulations that incorporate the effects of dynamical friction on the tidal formation of DF2, and compare them with the one without dynamical friction. We find that dynamical friction significantly accelerates the decay of the satellite galaxy's orbit, causing it to experience more frequent tidal stripping and leading to the earlier formation of a DM-deficient state, approximately 7-8 Gyr after infall. This is a few Gyr earlier than simulations without dynamical friction. Our results suggest that DMDGs can form in a wider range of orbital configurations, particularly on more circular orbits, than previously thought. Furthermore, we find that globular clusters in the DM-deficient phase exhibit elevated velocity dispersion, providing an observational signature of this evolutionary stage. We also examine the evolution of satellite in the phase space of total energy versus angular momentum, and show that a vertically narrow feature in this phase space is a clear signature of pericentre passage. These findings broaden the understanding of how DMDGs form and highlight the critical role of dynamical friction in shaping the evolutionary history of satellite galaxies in massive halos.</description>

      <title>GA-NIFS: co-evolution within a highly star-forming galaxy group at z=3.7 witnessed by JWST/NIRSpec IFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present NIRSpec IFS observations of a galaxy group around the massive GS_4891 galaxy at z=3.7 in GOODS-South that includes two other two systems, GS_4891_n to the north and GS_28356 to the east. These observations, obtained as part of the GTO GA-NIFS program, allow for the first time to study the spatially resolved properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and ionized gas kinematics of a galaxy at this redshift. Leveraging the wide wavelength range spanned with the high-dispersion grating (with resolving power R=2700) observations, covering from [OII]$\lambda$$\lambda$3726,29 to [SII]$\lambda$$\lambda$6716,31, we explore the spatial distribution of star-formation rate, nebular attenuation and gas metallicity, together with the mechanisms responsible for the excitation of the ionized gas. GS_4891 presents a clear gradient of gas metallicity (as traced by 12 + log(O/H)) by more than 0.2dex from the south-east (where a star-forming clump is identified) to the north-west. The gas metallicity in the less-massive northern system, GS_4891_n, is also higher by 0.2 dex than at the center of GS_4891, suggesting that inflows of lower-metallicity gas might be favoured in higher-mass systems. The kinematic analysis shows that GS_4891 presents velocity gradients in the ionized gas consistent with rotation. The region between GS_4891 and GS_4891_n does not present high gas turbulence which, together with the difference in gas metallicities, suggests that these two systems might be in a pre-merger stage. Finally, GS_4891 hosts an ionized outflow that extends out to r_out=1.2 kpc from the nucleus and reaches maximum velocities v_out of approximately 400 km/s. Despite entraining an outflowing mass rate of M_out$\sim$2Msun/yr, the low associated mass-loading factor, $\eta$=0.05, implies that the outflow does not have a significant impact on the star-formation activity of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Dust Survival in Galactic Winds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a suite of high-resolution numerical simulations to study the evolution and survival of dust in hot galactic winds. We implement a novel dust framework in the Cholla hydrodynamics code and use wind tunnel simulations of cool, dusty clouds to understand how thermal sputtering affects the dust content of galactic winds. Our simulations illustrate how various regimes of cloud evolution impact dust survival, dependent on cloud size, wind properties, and dust grain size. We find that significant amounts of dust can survive in winds in all scenarios, even without shielding from the cool phase of outflows. We present an analytic framework that explains this result, along with an analysis of the impact of cloud evolution on the total fraction of dust survival. Using these results, we estimate that 60 percent of 0.1 micron dust that enters a starburst-driven wind could survive to populate both the hot and cool phases of the halo, based on a simulated distribution of cloud properties. We also investigate how these conclusions depend on grain size, exploring grains from 0.1 micron to 10 Angstrom. Under most circumstances, grains smaller than 0.01 micron cannot withstand hot-phase exposure, suggesting that the small grains observed in the CGM are either formed in situ due to the shattering of larger grains, or must be carried there in the cool phase of outflows. Finally, we show that the dust-to-gas ratio of clouds declines as a function of distance from the galaxy due to cloud-wind mixing and condensation. These results provide an explanation for the vast amounts of dust observed in the CGMs of galaxies and beyond.</description>

      <title>A link to the past: characterizing wandering black holes in Milky Way-type galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A population of non-stellar black holes ($\gtrsim$100 M$_{\odot}$) has been long predicted to wander the Milky Way. We aim to characterize this population by using the L-Galaxies semi-analytical model applied on top of the high resolution Millennium-II merger trees. Our results predict $\sim$10 wandering black holes with masses $\sim$2 $\times$ 10$^{3}$ M$_{\odot}$ in a typical $z$ = 0 Milky Way galaxy, accounting for $\sim$2$\%$ of the total non-stellar black hole mass budget of the galaxy. We find that the locations of these wanderers correlate with their formation scenario. While the ones concentrated at $\lesssim$1 kpc from the galactic nucleus on the disk come from past galactic mergers, the ones formed as a consequence of ejections due to gravitational recoils or the disruption of satellite galaxies are typically located at $\gtrsim$100 kpc. Such small and large distances might explain the absence of strong observational evidence for wandering black holes in the Milky Way. Our results also indicate that $\sim$67$\%$ of the wandering population is conformed by the leftovers of black hole seeds that had little to no growth since their formation. We find that wandering black holes that are leftover seeds become wanderers at an earlier time with respect to grown seeds, and also come from more metal-poor galaxies. Finally, we show that the number of wandering black holes in a Milky Way-type galaxy depends on the seeding efficiency.</description>

      <title>Studies of stationary features in jets: BL Lacertae II. Trajectory reversals and superluminal speeds on sub-parsec scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution VLBI observations revealed a quasi-stationary component (QSC) in the relativistic jets of many blazars, which represents a standing recollimation shock. The VLBA monitoring of the BL Lacertae jet at 15~GHz shows the QSC at a projected distance of about 0.26~mas from the radio core.} We study the trajectory and kinematics of the QSC in BL Lacertae on sub-parsec scales using 15~GHz VLBA data of 164 observations over 20 years from the MOJAVE program and 2~cm VLBA Survey. To reconstruct the QSC's intrinsic trajectory, we use moving average and trajectory refinement procedures to smooth out the effects of core displacement and account for QSC positioning errors. We identified 22 QSC reversal patterns with a frequency of $\sim 1.5$ per year. Most reversals have an acute angle $&lt;90\degr$ and few have a loop-shaped or arc-shaped trajectory. Where observed, combinations of reversals show reversible and quasi-oscillatory motion. We propose a model in which a relativistic transverse wave passes through the QSC, generating a short-lived reverse motion, similar to the transverse motion of a seagull on a wave. According to the model, relativistic waves are generated upstream and the reverse motion of the QSC is governed by the amplitude, velocity and tilt of the wave as it passes through. The apparent superluminal speeds of the QSC ($\sim 2\,c$) are then due to the relativistic speed of the jet's transverse wave ($&lt;0.3\,c$ in the host galaxy rest frame) combined with the relativistic motion towards the observer. The measured superluminal speeds of QSC indirectly indicate the presence of relativistic transverse waves, and the size of the QSC scattering on the sky is proportional to the maximum amplitude of the wave.

      <title>Optical Continuum Reverberation Mapping of a Candidate IMBH in a Nearby Seyfert 1 Galaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To investigate the short-term variability and determine the size of the optical continuum emitting region of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we carried out high-cadence, multiband photometric monitoring of a Seyfert 1 galaxy J0249-0815 across two nights, together with a one-night single-band preliminary test. The presence of the broad Ha component in our target was confirmed by recent Paloma spectroscopic observations, 23 years after the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, ruling out the supernovae origin of the broad Ha line. The photometric experiment was primarily conducted utilizing four-channel imagers MuSCAT 3 and 4 mounted on 2 m telescopes within the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network. Despite the expectation of variability, we observed no significant variation (&lt;1.4%) on timescales of 6 to 10 hr. This nondetection is likely due to substantial host galaxy light diluting the subtle active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability. Additionally, we cannot rule out that the target was in a relatively quiescent state without intranight variability during our monitoring, owing to the stochastic nature of AGN variations. To enhance the possibility of detecting subtle variability signals and lag in future IMBH reverberation campaigns, it may be beneficial to select targets with a higher AGN-to-host flux ratio, and conduct dual-band preliminary tests and tailored simulations.</description>

      <title>Galaxy spectroscopy without spectra: Galaxy properties from photometric images with conditional diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern spectroscopic surveys can only target a small fraction of the vast amount of photometrically cataloged sources in wide-field surveys. Here, we report the development of a generative AI method capable of predicting optical galaxy spectra from photometric broad-band images alone. This method draws from the latest advances in diffusion models in combination with contrastive networks. We pass multi-band galaxy images into the architecture to obtain optical spectra. From these, robust values for galaxy properties can be derived with any methods in the spectroscopic toolbox, such as standard population synthesis techniques and Lick indices. When trained and tested on 64x64-pixel images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the global bimodality of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in photometric space is recovered, as well as a mass-metallicity relation of star-forming galaxies. The comparison between the observed and the artificially created spectra shows good agreement in overall metallicity, age, Dn4000, stellar velocity dispersion, and E(B-V) values. Photometric redshift estimates of our generative algorithm can compete with other current, specialized deep-learning techniques. Moreover, this work is the first attempt in the literature to infer velocity dispersion from photometric images. Additionally, we can predict the presence of an active galactic nucleus up to an accuracy of 82%. With our method, scientifically interesting galaxy properties, normally requiring spectroscopic inputs, can be obtained in future data sets from large-scale photometric surveys alone. The spectra prediction via AI can further assist in creating realistic mock catalogs.</description>

      <title>FASHI: An untargeted survey of the 21 cm HI absorption galaxies with FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The FAST All Sky H I survey (FASHI) will cover the entire observable sky ($\sim$22000 square degrees) with the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). With the currently released data, we perform an untargeted survey of 21 cm HI absorption galaxies at redshift $z\lesssim0.09$ over an area of about 10000 square degrees. We have detected 51 HI absorbers, including 21 previously known and 30 new ones. The probability of occurrence for the HI absorbers in all HI galaxies is 1/1078. The radio flux densities of the FASHI absorbers are mainly concentrated in the range of $S_{\rm 1.4GHz}=10\sim100$ mJy, but also as low as $2.6\pm0.4$ mJy. We find that the host galaxies of the associated HI absorbers have relatively high star formation rates, and there is a negative correlation between the HI column density and the stellar mass in the host galaxy. Consequently, FAST has significantly improved the capabilities and performance for HI absorption observations and has provided a true untargeted survey of 21 cm HI absorption galaxies for such studies.</description>

Abstract: The kinematics of the young stellar association near the Sun TW Hya is studied. Kinematic estimates of the age of this association were obtained in two ways. The first method -- analysis of stellar trajectories integrated back in time -- gave an estimate of the age $t=4.9\pm1.2$ Myr. The second was to analyze the instantaneous velocities of stars and showed that there is a volume expansion of the stellar system with an angular velocity coefficient $K_{xyz}=103\pm12$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Based on this effect, the time interval that passed from the beginning of the expansion of the TW Hya association to the present moment was found, $t=9.5\pm1.1$ Myr. The following principal semi-axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid are determined: $\sigma_{1,2,3}=(5.25,1.84,0.35)\pm(0.34,0.63,0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>The currently observed clumps cannot be the "direct" precursors of the currently observed open clusters</title>

Abstract: We categorized clumps, embedded clusters, and open clusters and conducted a comparative analysis of their physical properties. Overall, the radii of open clusters are significantly larger than those of embedded clusters and clumps. The radii of embedded clusters are larger than those of clumps, which may be due to the expansion of embedded clusters. The open clusters have significantly higher masses than embedded clusters, by about one order of magnitude. Given the current mass distribution of clumps in the Milky Way, the evolutionary sequence from a single clump evolving into an embedded cluster and subsequently into an open cluster cannot account for the observed open clusters with old ages and high masses, which is also supported by N-body simulations of individual embedded clusters. To explain the mass and radius distributions of the observed open clusters, initial embedded clusters with masses higher than 3000 M$_{\odot}$ are necessary. However, the upper limit of the embedded cluster sample is less than 1000 M$_{\odot}$, and only a few ATLASGAL clumps have a mass higher than 3000 M$_{\odot}$. Thus, the currently observed clumps cannot be the "direct" precursors of the currently observed open clusters. If the Milky Way has a burst-like and time-dependent star formation history, the currently observed open clusters with old ages and high masses may come from massive clumps in the past. There is also a very real possibility that these open clusters originate from post-gas expulsion coalescence of multiple embedded clusters. We compared the separation of open clusters and the typical size of molecular clouds, and find that most molecular clouds may only form one open cluster, which supports the scenario of post-gas expulsion coalescence. Further study is necessary to distinguish between the different scenarios.</description>

      <title>PRODIGE -- envelope to disk with NOEMA. IV. An infalling gas bridge surrounding two Class 0/I systems in L1448N</title>

Abstract: Context. The formation of stars has been subject to extensive studies in the past decades from molecular cloud to protoplanetary disk scales. It is still not fully understood how the surrounding material in a protostellar system, that often shows asymmetric structures with complex kinematic properties, feeds the central protostar(s) and their disk(s). Aims. We study the spatial morphology and kinematic properties of the molecular gas surrounding the IRS3A and IRS3B protostellar systems in the L1448N region located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Methods. We present 1 mm NOEMA observations of the PRODIGE large program and analyze the kinematic properties of molecular lines. Given the complexity of the spectral profiles, the lines are fitted with up to three Gaussian velocity components. The clustering algorithm DBSCAN is used to disentangle the velocity components into the underlying physical structure. Results. We discover an extended gas bridge (~3000 au) surrounding both the IRS3A and IRS3B systems in six molecular line tracers (C18O, SO, DCN, H2CO, HC3N, and CH3OH). This gas bridge is oriented along the northeast-southwest direction and shows clear velocity gradients on the order of 100 km/s/pc towards the IRS3A system. We find that the observed velocity profile is consistent with analytical streamline models of gravitational infall towards IRS3A. The high-velocity C18O (2-1) emission towards IRS3A indicates a protostellar mass of ~1.2 Msun. Conclusions. While high angular resolution continuum data often show IRS3A and IRS3B in isolation, molecular gas observations reveal that these systems are still embedded within a large-scale mass reservoir with a complex spatial morphology as well as velocity profiles. The kinematic properties of the extended gas bridge are consistent with gravitational infall toward the IRS3A protostar.</description>

      <title>Microlensing Discovery and Characterization Efficiency in the Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>

Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time will discover thousands of microlensing events across the Milky Way Galaxy, allowing for the study of populations of exoplanets, stars, and compact objects. We evaluate numerous survey strategies simulated in the Rubin Operation Simulations (OpSims) to assess the discovery and characterization efficiencies of microlensing events. We have implemented three metrics in the Rubin Metric Analysis Framework: a discovery metric and two characterization metrics, where one estimates how well the lightcurve is covered and the other quantifies how precisely event parameters can be determined. We also assess the characterizability of microlensing parallax, critical for detection of free-floating black hole lenses. We find that, given Rubin's baseline cadence, the discovery and characterization efficiency will be higher for longer duration and larger parallax events. Microlensing discovery efficiency is dominated by the observing footprint, where more time spent looking at regions of high stellar density including the Galactic bulge, Galactic plane, and Magellanic clouds, leads to higher discovery and characterization rates. However, if the observations are stretched over too wide an area, including low-priority areas of the Galactic plane with fewer stars and higher extinction, event characterization suffers by &gt; 10%. This could impact exoplanet, binary star, and compact object events alike. We find that some rolling strategies (where Rubin focuses on a fraction of the sky in alternating years) in the Galactic bulge can lead to a 15-20% decrease in microlensing parallax characterization, so rolling strategies should be chosen carefully to minimize losses.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Fine-Features of Nuclear Equation of State from Future Neutron Star Radius Measurements to 0.1km Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07823v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To more precisely constrain the Equation of State (EOS) of supradense neutron-rich nuclear matter, future high-precision X-ray and gravitational wave observatories are proposed to measure the radii of neutron stars (NSs) with an accuracy better than about 0.1 km. However, it remains unclear what particular aspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the EOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within a Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and skewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$, curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, respectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing observations and an expected accuracy $\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to 0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the stiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\Delta R$ reveals more accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among parameters characterizing high-density $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$, (3) a double-peak feature of the PDF($K_{\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong $K_{\rm{sym}}-J_{\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed when $\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, and the locations of the two peaks are sensitive to the maximum value of $J_{\rm{sym}}$ reflecting the stiffness of $E_{\rm{sym}}(\rho)$ above about 3 times the saturation density $\rho_0$ of SNM, (4) the high-precision radius measurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for constraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around $(2-3)\rho_0$.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>Investigating 39 Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars with VLTI/GRAVITY: Uncovering A Long Period Binary Desert</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars (WRs) are one of the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and immediate progenitors of stellar-mass black holes. Their multiplicity forms an important anchor point in single and binary population models for predicting gravitational-wave progenitors. Recent spectroscopic campaigns have suggested incompatible multiplicity fractions and period distributions for N- and C-rich Galactic WRs (WNs and WCs) at short as well as long orbital periods, in contradiction with evolutionary model predictions. In this work, we employed infrared interferometry using the $K$-band instrument GRAVITY at the VLTI to investigate the multiplicity of WRs at long periods and explore the nature of their companions. We present a survey of 39 Galactic WRs, including 11 WN, 15 WC and 13 H-rich WN (WNh) stars. We detected wide companions with GRAVITY for only four stars: WR 48, WR 89, WR 93 and WR 115. Combining with spectroscopic studies, we arrived at multiplicity fractions of $f^{\rm WN}_{\rm obs} = 0.55\pm0.15$, $f^{\rm WC}_{\rm obs} = 0.40\pm0.13$ and $f^{\rm WNh}_{\rm obs} = 0.23\pm0.12$. In addition, we also found other features in the GRAVITY dataset such as (i) a diffuse extended component in over half the WR sample; (ii) five known spectroscopic binaries resolved in differential phase data and (iii) spatially resolved winds in four stars: WR 16, WR 31a, WR 78 and WR 110. Our survey reveals a lack of intermediate (few 100s d) and long- (few years to decades) period WR systems. The 200-d peak in the period distributions of WR+OB and BH+OB binaries predicted by Case B mass-transfer binary evolution models is not seen in our data. The rich companionship of their O-type progenitors in this separation range suggest that the WR progenitor stars expand and interact with their companions, most likely through unstable mass-transfer, resulting in either a short-period system or a merger.</description>

      <title>Constraining cosmology with N-body simulations for future spectroscopic galaxy surveys at $2\leq z\leq 3$</title>

Abstract: Determining the spatial curvature ($\Omega_k$) independent of cosmic microwave background observations plays a key role in revealing the physics of the early universe. The Hubble tension is one of the most serious issues in modern cosmology. We investigate halo catalogs identified from $N$-body simulations at $z=2$ and 3, mimicking high-redshift galaxy surveys. We measure redshift-space correlation functions of halos from the two snapshots. We detect clear features of baryon acoustic oscillations and redshift-space distortions. We find that we can obtain a few percent constraints on both the geometric distances and growth of structure at the distant universe in future surveys. By taking into account the information of the underlying matter power spectrum, we demonstrate that we can also achieve constraint on the Hubble constant $H_0$ with a few percent as well as the spatial curvature with $|\Omega_k|\lesssim 0.1$ by observing galaxies with the number density with $\bar{n}_{\rm g}\simeq 10^{-4} (~h^3{\rm ~Mpc}^{-3})$. Our analysis provides a timely forecast for the upcoming spectroscopic surveys, which target emission line galaxy or dusty star-forming galaxy samples.</description>
