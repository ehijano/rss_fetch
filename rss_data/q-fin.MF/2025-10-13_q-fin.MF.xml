      <title>Lifted Heston Model: Efficient Monte Carlo Simulation with Large Time Steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lifted Heston model is a stochastic volatility model emerging as a Markovian lift of the rough Heston model and the class of rough volatility processes. The model encodes the path dependency of volatility on a set of N square-root state processes driven by a common stochastic factor. While the system is Markovian, simulation schemes such as the Euler scheme exist, but require a small-step, multidimensional simulation of the state processes and are therefore numerically challenging. We propose a novel simulation scheme of the class of implicit integrated variance schemes. The method exploits the near-linear nature between the stochastic driver and the conditional integrated variance process, which allows for a consistent and efficient sampling of the integrated variance process using an inverse Gaussian distribution. Since we establish the linear relation using a linear projection in the L2 space, the method is optimal in an L2 sense and offers a significant efficiency gain over similar methods. We demonstrate that our scheme achieves near-exact accuracy even for coarse discretizations and allows for efficient pricing of volatility options with large time steps.</description>

      <title>A General CoVaR Based on Entropy Pooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general CoVaR framework that extends the traditional CoVaR by incorporating diverse expert views and information, such as asset moment characteristics, quantile insights, and perspectives on the relative loss distribution between two assets. To integrate these expert views effectively while minimizing deviations from the prior distribution, we employ the entropy pooling method to derive the posterior distribution, which in turn enables us to compute the general CoVaR. Assuming bivariate normal distributions, we derive its analytical expressions under various perspectives. Sensitivity analysis reveals that CoVaR exhibits a linear relationship with both the expectations of the variables in the views and the differences in expectations between them. In contrast, CoVaR shows nonlinear dependencies with respect to the variance, quantiles, and correlation within these views.
  Empirical analysis of the US banking system during the Federal Reserve's interest rate hikes demonstrates the effectiveness of the general CoVaR when expert views are appropriately specified. Furthermore, we extend this framework to a general $\Delta$CoVaR, which allows for the assessment of risk spillover effects from various perspectives.</description>
