      <title>Classification of Raw MEG/EEG Data with Detach-Rocket Ensemble: An Improved ROCKET Algorithm for Multivariate Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multivariate Time Series Classification (MTSC) is a ubiquitous problem in science and engineering, particularly in neuroscience, where most data acquisition modalities involve the simultaneous time-dependent recording of brain activity in multiple brain regions. In recent years, Random Convolutional Kernel models such as ROCKET and MiniRocket have emerged as highly effective time series classification algorithms, capable of achieving state-of-the-art accuracy results with low computational load. Despite their success, these types of models face two major challenges when employed in neuroscience: 1) they struggle to deal with high-dimensional data such as EEG and MEG, and 2) they are difficult to interpret. In this work, we present a novel ROCKET-based algorithm, named Detach-Rocket Ensemble, that is specifically designed to address these two problems in MTSC. Our algorithm leverages pruning to provide an integrated estimation of channel importance, and ensembles to achieve better accuracy and provide a label probability. Using a synthetic multivariate time series classification dataset in which we control the amount of information carried by each of the channels, we first show that our algorithm is able to correctly recover the channel importance for classification. Then, using two real-world datasets, a MEG dataset and an EEG dataset, we show that Detach-Rocket Ensemble is able to provide both interpretable channel relevance and competitive classification accuracy, even when applied directly to the raw brain data, without the need for feature engineering.</description>

      <title>SETN: Stock Embedding Enhanced with Textual and Network Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stock embedding is a method for vector representation of stocks. There is a growing demand for vector representations of stock, i.e., stock embedding, in wealth management sectors, and the method has been applied to various tasks such as stock price prediction, portfolio optimization, and similar fund identifications. Stock embeddings have the advantage of enabling the quantification of relative relationships between stocks, and they can extract useful information from unstructured data such as text and network data. In this study, we propose stock embedding enhanced with textual and network information (SETN) using a domain-adaptive pre-trained transformer-based model to embed textual information and a graph neural network model to grasp network information. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on related company information extraction tasks. We also demonstrate that stock embeddings obtained from the proposed model perform better in creating thematic funds than those obtained from baseline methods, providing a promising pathway for various applications in the wealth management industry.</description>

      <title>L3iTC at the FinLLM Challenge Task: Quantization for Financial Text Classification &amp; Summarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article details our participation (L3iTC) in the FinLLM Challenge Task 2024, focusing on two key areas: Task 1, financial text classification, and Task 2, financial text summarization. To address these challenges, we fine-tuned several large language models (LLMs) to optimize performance for each task. Specifically, we used 4-bit quantization and LoRA to determine which layers of the LLMs should be trained at a lower precision. This approach not only accelerated the fine-tuning process on the training data provided by the organizers but also enabled us to run the models on low GPU memory. Our fine-tuned models achieved third place for the financial classification task with an F1-score of 0.7543 and secured sixth place in the financial summarization task on the official test datasets.</description>

      <title>Optimal design of unimorph-type cantilevered piezoelectric energy harvesters using level set-based topology optimization by considering manufacturability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a design methodology for a piezoelectric energy-harvesting device optimized for maximal power generation at a designated frequency using topology optimization. The proposed methodology is adapted to the design of a unimorph-type piezoelectric energy harvester, wherein a piezoelectric film is affixed to a singular side of a silicon cantilever beam. Both the substrate and the piezoelectric film components undergo concurrent optimization. Constraints are imposed to ensure that the resultant design is amenable to microfabrication, with specific emphasis on the etchability of piezoelectric energy harvesters. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the efficacy of the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method yields optimized substrate and piezoelectric designs with an enhanced electromechanical coupling coefficient, while allowing the eigenfrequency of the device and the minimum output voltage to be set to the desired values. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide solutions that satisfy the cross-sectional shape, substrate-dependent, and minimum output voltage constraints. The solutions obtained by the proposed method are manufacturable in the field of microfabrication.</description>
