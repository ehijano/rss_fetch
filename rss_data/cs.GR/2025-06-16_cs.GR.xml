      <title>Real-Time Per-Garment Virtual Try-On with Temporal Consistency for Loose-Fitting Garments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Per-garment virtual try-on methods collect garment-specific datasets and train networks tailored to each garment to achieve superior results. However, these approaches often struggle with loose-fitting garments due to two key limitations: (1) They rely on human body semantic maps to align garments with the body, but these maps become unreliable when body contours are obscured by loose-fitting garments, resulting in degraded outcomes; (2) They train garment synthesis networks on a per-frame basis without utilizing temporal information, leading to noticeable jittering artifacts. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage approach for robust semantic map estimation. First, we extract a garment-invariant representation from the raw input image. This representation is then passed through an auxiliary network to estimate the semantic map. This enhances the robustness of semantic map estimation under loose-fitting garments during garment-specific dataset generation. Furthermore, we introduce a recurrent garment synthesis framework that incorporates temporal dependencies to improve frame-to-frame coherence while maintaining real-time performance. We conducted qualitative and quantitative evaluations to demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both image quality and temporal coherence. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the garment-invariant representation and the recurrent synthesis framework.</description>

      <title>iDiT-HOI: Inpainting-based Hand Object Interaction Reenactment via Video Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital human video generation is gaining traction in fields like education and e-commerce, driven by advancements in head-body animation and lip-syncing technologies. However, realistic Hand-Object Interaction (HOI) - the complex dynamics between human hands and objects - continues to pose challenges. Generating natural and believable HOI reenactments is difficult due to issues such as occlusion between hands and objects, variations in object shapes and orientations, and the necessity for precise physical interactions, and importantly, the ability to generalize to unseen humans and objects. This paper presents a novel framework iDiT-HOI that enables in-the-wild HOI reenactment generation. Specifically, we propose a unified inpainting-based token process method, called Inp-TPU, with a two-stage video diffusion transformer (DiT) model. The first stage generates a key frame by inserting the designated object into the hand region, providing a reference for subsequent frames. The second stage ensures temporal coherence and fluidity in hand-object interactions. The key contribution of our method is to reuse the pretrained model's context perception capabilities without introducing additional parameters, enabling strong generalization to unseen objects and scenarios, and our proposed paradigm naturally supports long video generation. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in challenging real-world scenes, offering enhanced realism and more seamless hand-object interactions.</description>

      <title>NeuVAS: Neural Implicit Surfaces for Variational Shape Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural implicit shape representation has drawn significant attention in recent years due to its smoothness, differentiability, and topological flexibility. However, directly modeling the shape of a neural implicit surface, especially as the zero-level set of a neural signed distance function (SDF), with sparse geometric control is still a challenging task. Sparse input shape control typically includes 3D curve networks or, more generally, 3D curve sketches, which are unstructured and cannot be connected to form a curve network, and therefore more difficult to deal with. While 3D curve networks or curve sketches provide intuitive shape control, their sparsity and varied topology pose challenges in generating high-quality surfaces to meet such curve constraints. In this paper, we propose NeuVAS, a variational approach to shape modeling using neural implicit surfaces constrained under sparse input shape control, including unstructured 3D curve sketches as well as connected 3D curve networks. Specifically, we introduce a smoothness term based on a functional of surface curvatures to minimize shape variation of the zero-level set surface of a neural SDF. We also develop a new technique to faithfully model G0 sharp feature curves as specified in the input curve sketches. Comprehensive comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the significant advantages of our method.</description>

      <title>Volumetric Functional Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of volumetric correspondences between 3D shapes has great potential for medical and industrial applications. In this work, we pave the way for spectral volume mapping, extending for the first time the functional maps framework from the surface setting to the volumetric domain. We show that the eigenfunctions of the volumetric Laplace operator define a functional space that is suitable for high-quality signal transfer. We also experiment with various techniques that edit this functional space, porting them from the surface to the volume setting. We validate our method on novel volumetric datasets and on tetrahedralizations of well established surface datasets, also showcasing practical applications involving both discrete and continuous signal mapping, for segmentation transfer, mesh connectivity transfer and solid texturing. Last but not least, we show that considering the volumetric spectrum greatly improves the accuracy for classical shape matching tasks among surfaces, consistently outperforming existing surface-only spectral methods.</description>

      <title>TextureSplat: Per-Primitive Texture Mapping for Reflective Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting have demonstrated remarkable novel view synthesis performance at high rendering frame rates. Optimization-based inverse rendering within complex capture scenarios remains however a challenging problem. A particular case is modelling complex surface light interactions for highly reflective scenes, which results in intricate high frequency specular radiance components. We hypothesize that such challenging settings can benefit from increased representation power. We hence propose a method that tackles this issue through a geometrically and physically grounded Gaussian Splatting borne radiance field, where normals and material properties are spatially variable in the primitive's local space. Using per-primitive texture maps for this purpose, we also propose to harness the GPU hardware to accelerate rendering at test time via unified material texture atlas.</description>

      <title>UltraZoom: Generating Gigapixel Images from Regular Photos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UltraZoom, a system for generating gigapixel-resolution images of objects from casually captured inputs, such as handheld phone photos. Given a full-shot image (global, low-detail) and one or more close-ups (local, high-detail), UltraZoom upscales the full image to match the fine detail and scale of the close-up examples. To achieve this, we construct a per-instance paired dataset from the close-ups and adapt a pretrained generative model to learn object-specific low-to-high resolution mappings. At inference, we apply the model in a sliding window fashion over the full image. Constructing these pairs is non-trivial: it requires registering the close-ups within the full image for scale estimation and degradation alignment. We introduce a simple, robust method for getting registration on arbitrary materials in casual, in-the-wild captures. Together, these components form a system that enables seamless pan and zoom across the entire object, producing consistent, photorealistic gigapixel imagery from minimal input.</description>

      <title>Free Your Hands: Lightweight Turntable-Based Object Capture Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05511v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) from multiple captured photos of an object is a widely studied problem. Achieving high quality typically requires dense sampling of input views, which can lead to frustrating manual labor. Manually positioning cameras to maintain an optimal desired distribution can be difficult for humans, and if a good distribution is found, it is not easy to replicate. Additionally, the captured data can suffer from motion blur and defocus due to human error. In this paper, we use a lightweight object capture pipeline to reduce the manual workload and standardize the acquisition setup, with a consumer turntable to carry the object and a tripod to hold the camera. Of course, turntables and gantry systems have been frequently used to automatically capture dense samples under various views and lighting conditions; the key difference is that we use a turntable under natural environment lighting. This way, we can easily capture hundreds of valid images in several minutes without hands-on effort. However, in the object reference frame, the light conditions vary (rotate); this does not match the assumptions of standard NVS methods like 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). We design a neural radiance representation conditioned on light rotations, which addresses this issue and allows rendering with novel light rotations as an additional benefit. We further study the behavior of rotations and find optimal capturing strategies. We demonstrate our pipeline using 3DGS as the underlying framework, achieving higher quality and showcasing the method's potential for novel lighting and harmonization tasks.</description>

      <title>Bokeh Diffusion: Defocus Blur Control in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08434v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image models have revolutionized creative fields by generating visually captivating outputs from textual prompts; however, while traditional photography offers precise control over camera settings to shape visual aesthetics - such as depth-of-field via aperture - current diffusion models typically rely on prompt engineering to mimic such effects. This approach often results in crude approximations and inadvertently alters the scene content. In this work, we propose Bokeh Diffusion, a scene-consistent bokeh control framework that explicitly conditions a diffusion model on a physical defocus blur parameter. To overcome the scarcity of paired real-world images captured under different camera settings, we introduce a hybrid training pipeline that aligns in-the-wild images with synthetic blur augmentations, providing diverse scenes and subjects as well as supervision to learn the separation of image content from lens blur. Central to our framework is our grounded self-attention mechanism, trained on image pairs with different bokeh levels of the same scene, which enables blur strength to be adjusted in both directions while preserving the underlying scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables flexible, lens-like blur control, supports downstream applications such as real image editing via inversion, and generalizes effectively across both Stable Diffusion and FLUX architectures.</description>

      <title>VideoMat: Extracting PBR Materials from Video Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We leverage finetuned video diffusion models, intrinsic decomposition of videos, and physically-based differentiable rendering to generate high quality materials for 3D models given a text prompt or a single image. We condition a video diffusion model to respect the input geometry and lighting condition. This model produces multiple views of a given 3D model with coherent material properties. Secondly, we use a recent model to extract intrinsics (base color, roughness, metallic) from the generated video. Finally, we use the intrinsics alongside the generated video in a differentiable path tracer to robustly extract PBR materials directly compatible with common content creation tools.</description>

      <title>Agentic 3D Scene Generation with Spatially Contextualized VLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in multimodal content generation enabled by vision-language models (VLMs), their ability to reason about and generate structured 3D scenes remains largely underexplored. This limitation constrains their utility in spatially grounded tasks such as embodied AI, immersive simulations, and interactive 3D applications. We introduce a new paradigm that enables VLMs to generate, understand, and edit complex 3D environments by injecting a continually evolving spatial context. Constructed from multimodal input, this context consists of three components: a scene portrait that provides a high-level semantic blueprint, a semantically labeled point cloud capturing object-level geometry, and a scene hypergraph that encodes rich spatial relationships, including unary, binary, and higher-order constraints. Together, these components provide the VLM with a structured, geometry-aware working memory that integrates its inherent multimodal reasoning capabilities with structured 3D understanding for effective spatial reasoning. Building on this foundation, we develop an agentic 3D scene generation pipeline in which the VLM iteratively reads from and updates the spatial context. The pipeline features high-quality asset generation with geometric restoration, environment setup with automatic verification, and ergonomic adjustment guided by the scene hypergraph. Experiments show that our framework can handle diverse and challenging inputs, achieving a level of generalization not observed in prior work. Further results demonstrate that injecting spatial context enables VLMs to perform downstream tasks such as interactive scene editing and path planning, suggesting strong potential for spatially intelligent systems in computer graphics, 3D vision, and embodied applications.
