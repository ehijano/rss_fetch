      <title>Dark Matter Heating of Compact Stars Beyond Capture: A Relativistic Framework for Energy Deposition by Particle Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, can act as detectors of energetic particle fluxes originating from astrophysical accelerators. While most existing capture and heating calculations assume isotropic very low energetic incident fluxes from the halo dark matter, many realistic sources produce highly directional beams or jets, for which gravitational focusing, trajectory multiplicity, and local energy deposition must be treated consistently. In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star. In particular, we illustrate the framework using boosted dark matter produced in a list of 324 blazars as a representative case study, computing the resulting fluxes and the associated heating in the selected stars. Additional regimes such as the interaction roof and geometric limit are discussed, highlighting the conditions under which compact objects can efficiently convert incident beam energy into observable heating.</description>

      <title>Scalar Tsunamis from Black Hole Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stars and other macroscopic objects may be surrounded by potentially large field configurations of very light scalars coupled to ordinary matter. If the star ends in a black hole, e.g. via a supernova or a neutron star merger, the source vanishes, and the field is released. In this paper, we improve on previous estimates for the field configurations arriving at large distances by including the effects of general relativity and an improved modelling of the initial field configurations. The total amount of energy released is typically of the same order of magnitude as suggested by simple flat space estimates. The spectrum receives noticeable corrections.</description>

      <title>Probing Extended Higgs Sectors via Multi-Top Events from Higgs Pair Decays in 2HDM Type-I at the HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the production of multi-top quark events final states containing up to four top quarks as a probe for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) within the framework of the Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I. Focusing on the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s} = 14$TeV, we analyze associated production processes including $pp \to t\bar{t}H$, $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}A$, $pp \rightarrow HA$, $pp \rightarrow HH^{\pm}$, and $pp \rightarrow AH^{\pm}$. The simulation pipeline incorporates theoretical constraints and branching ratios. By targeting these high-multiplicity final states, the research aims to establish the sensitivity of the HL-LHC to an extended Higgs sector, utilizing the top quark's unique coupling to the scalar field as a primary discovery channel. The analysis is centered on two benchmark points characterized by a degenerate mass spectrum ($m_H = m_A = m_{H^{\pm}} = 500$GeV) in the alignment limit ($\sin(\beta - \alpha) \to 1$), with $\tan\beta$ varied between 1 and 3. Event selection was performed with stringent cuts on jet multiplicity to suppress dominant SM backgrounds, such as $t\bar{t}W$, $t\bar{t}Z$, and $WWZ$. Our results indicate that signal significance improves substantially as the integrated luminosity increases from $3000~fb^{-1}$ to $4000~fb^{-1}$, with all investigated channels exceeding the $5\sigma$ discovery threshold.</description>

      <title>Transeverse-Momentum Subtraction for Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering provides unique access to the three-dimensional momentum and spin structure of the proton, enabling precise studies of parton dynamics and hadronization in QCD. We present a transverse-momentum subtraction approach applied to the detected hadron that enables efficient and precise calculation of higher-order QCD corrections to identified hadron production in Semi-Inclusive Deep-Inelastic Scattering. We demonstrate the success of the method through a next-to-next-to-leading order QCD calculation and provide fully differential phenomenological applications, which provide important ingredients for global analyses of fragmentation functions. Our method is applicable to next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order QCD corrections for both unpolarized and polarized semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering.</description>

      <title>CoLLM: AI engineering toolbox for end-to-end deep learning in collider analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent improvements in large language models have opened new opportunities for accelerating and automating scientific workflows. In parallel, modern collider analyses are becoming increasingly complex and demand substantial programming and deep learning expertise. \coll alleviates this workload by using pretrained large language models to generate physically consistent analysis code for event selection. Additionally, it automates subsequent deep learning analyses. To further reduce reliance on programming or deep learning experience, \coll provides a graphical user interface that allows users to perform end-to-end analyses through an interactive interface. The main motivation behind \coll is to lower the coding burden and simplify the technical complexity of collider analyses, which increasingly depend on sophisticated event selections and advanced deep learning methods.</description>

      <title>CP violation angles from H$\to\tau\tau$ decays at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring charge-parity (CP) violation in Higgs-fermion interactions is a key target of future precision Higgs programs. The decay $H\to\tau\tau$ is particularly sensitive to the CP structure of the Higgs Yukawa coupling via $\tau$ spin correlation, while the clean environment of $e^+e^-$ collisions at the Future Circular Collider (FCC) enables accurate reconstruction of CP-sensitive observables. In this letter, we study the sensitivity of FCC-ee to the Higgs CP state using $H\to\tau\tau$ events produced in associated $ZH$ production at $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV. In the anomalous-coupling parametrization, we project a precision of $\Delta\phi_{\tau\tau}=\pm 2.5^\circ$ at 68 % CL, with the dominant contribution arising from one-prong hadronic $\tau$ decays. We further interpret the analysis in the Effective Field Theory framework, deriving expected limits on the CP-odd operators, and compare them with electron and magnetic dipole moment measurements and the anomalous-coupling approach.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition with primordial black holes: Distinct phase structure and catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of primordial black holes (PBHs) on the chiral phase transition and its associated stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) signals. Using the three-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model, we construct the chiral effective potential in a Schwarzschild spacetime background. We find that PBHs promote chiral symmetry restoration and induce a nontrivial local phase structure in the vicinity of the event horizon simultaneously. In particular, this structure exhibits a novel chiral symmetry breaking pattern involving both second- and first-order phase transitions, a feature absent in flat spacetime. We further demonstrate that PBHs act as genuine catalysts for the chiral phase transition by analyzing the bounce solution in curved spacetime. The presence of PBHs substantially enhances the inverse duration parameter $\beta/H$ while leaving the overall transition strength comparable to that in flat spacetime. As a consequence, even a small population of PBHs can induce $\mathcal{O}(1)$ shifts in both the peak frequency and the peak amplitude of the GW spectrum generated by the first-order dark chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Return of the CHAMPs: A clockwork portal to charged dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Dark Matter (DM) is conventionally assumed to be chargeless, the possibility of a charged massive particle (CHAMP) as the DM particle remains alive. With phenomenological constraints on the charge being very severe, such a scenario is often sought to be dismissed, citing naturalness. We demonstrate here that such a (mini)charged DM can be realized within the clockwork paradigm, without the need to invoke unnaturally small parameters. The model is examined against constraints, theoretical and experimental, and the phenomenologically admissible parameter space is delineated. Several intriguing tests, at the LHC as well as at future direct and indirect detection experiments, are pointed out.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain constraints on the intercepts of the Regge pole tra jectories (which we believe to have definite C-parity) based on the rule that C-even exchanges correspond to attractive forces between hadrons undergo ing elastic scattering, and C-odd exchanges correspond to attractive forces in the case of particle-antiparticle scattering and repulsive forces in the case of particle-particle scattering.</description>

      <title>Spin Light of neutrino in polarized matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spin Light of neutrino ($SL\nu$) is an electromagnetic radiation of the neutrino magnetic moment emitted when neutrino moves in external conditions (fields or matter). The effect can be of significance in the extremely dense matter of compact astrophysical objects such as neutron stars (NS). If detected, this radiation could provide a fair opportunity to study the properties of neutrinos and the medium through which they move, since the properties of the radiation depend on both. Motivated by the possibility of the nuclear matter spin-polarization, in this paper, we study the new properties to $SL\nu$ obtained under the influence of net matter polarization. We demonstrate that the polarization can enhance or completely suppress the radiation. Also, it introduces a characteristic asymmetry into the total radiation from the compact object, which could be an observable feature dependent on the matter polarization and the magnetic field inside the stellar (if the field is connected to the stellar matter polarization). The research may have implications for the physics of NS and magnetars, bringing us closer to the possibility of studying their internal structure.</description>

      <title>Cavity, lumped-circuit, and spin-based detection of axion dark matter: differences and similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles are compelling candidates for ultralight bosonic dark matter, forming coherent oscillating fields that can be probed by experiments known as haloscopes. A broad range of haloscope concepts has been developed, including resonant cavity haloscopes, lumped-element circuit detectors, and spin-based experiments, each sensitive to different axion couplings and mass ranges. Rather than attempting an exhaustive survey of all existing approaches, this comparative review provides a unified framework for the major haloscope classes, establishing a common language for the descriptions of signal generation, noise properties, data analysis, and scanning strategies.
  Key properties of ultralight bosonic dark matter relevant for detection are summarized first, including coherence time, spectral linewidth, and stochasticity under the standard halo model. The discussion then compares cavity, Earth-scale, lumped-element, and spin haloscopes, focusing on expected signal shapes, dominant noise sources, and statistical frameworks for axion searches. Particular emphasis is placed on consistent definitions of signal-to-noise ratio and on how detector bandwidth, axion coherence, and noise characteristics determine optimal scan strategies.
  By systematically comparing operating principles and performance metrics across these detector families, this framework clarifies shared concepts as well as the essential differences that govern sensitivity in different mass and coupling regimes. The resulting perspective synthesizes current search methodologies and offers guidance for optimizing future haloscope experiments.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection and Cosmological Constraints of Dark Matter with Dark Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fermionic dark matter candidate that couples to the standard model particles exclusively through electric and magnetic dipole operators mediated by a massive dark photon. Such dipole portals naturally arise in dark sectors where the dark matter is neutral under a hidden $U(1)_D$, and they lead to phenomenology distinct from conventional vector-current interactions. We consider the direct-detection signals arising from dark matter-nucleus scattering including the Migdal effect, dark matter-electron scattering, and semiconductor targets, which allow sensitivity to sub-GeV dark matter masses, together with the cosmological bounds from such as thermal relic abundance, cosmic microwave background, big-bang nucleosynthesis, and cosmic-rays. We find that the dark dipole coupling can be largely constrained by direct detection (in particular, electric dipole coupling). However, the cosmological observations have already constrained most of the parameter space, in particular for magnetic dipole interactions of $U(1)_D$ for sub-GeV dark matter. For the dark matter mass below 10 MeV, the semiconductor (in particular, using skipper-CCD) experiments can play a crucial role in probing the dark dipole interactions: future low-threshold experiments utilizing the semiconductor targets can further extend the constraints. Our results have demonstrated that the sub-GeV dark matter with dark dipole interactions can be still safe from the direct-detection constraints, and the future low-threshold semiconductor experiments may play a significant role in constraining the dark dipole interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the rare decay $B \to K_0^*(1430)\,\ell^+ \ell^-$ as a possible probe for new physics beyond the standard model (SM). We first analyze this channel within the SM and then include scalar leptoquark (LQ) contributions. We provide predictions for key observables, like differential decay rate, branching ratio, ratio of branching fractions at different channels, forward-backward asymmetry and different lepton polarizations, and assess their sensitivity to leptoquark scenarios, highlighting $q^2$ regions less affected by the long-distance charmonium effects. The results can be useful for future Belle II and LHCb measurements.</description>

      <title>QED Effects in PDFs -- A Les Houches Comparison Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, and even more so in the last few years, our knowledge of the internal structure of the proton has become more accurate and precise thanks to the large amount of data available and developments in theory and methodology. The reduction of the uncertainties associated to these developments has brought previously neglected effects into focus as their typical magnitude are competitive with the size of the uncertainties. One such effect is the inclusion of QED into PDF fits. Typically this is a percent effect, and thus while theoretically important, it has had a relatively limited impact on phenomenological studies up to this point. In this proceeding we study some of the effects which, while peripheral to the inclusion of QED in the proton, can considerably change the relative size and shape of the QCD+QED fit with respect to the QCD only determination. These may become important in the future as precision continues to increase. After a comparison of the QCD+QED PDFs with the QCD only PDFs of various global PDF fitting groups, we focus largely upon NNPDF4.0, which shows the biggest effect when including QED. Focusing largely on a single set of PDFs also enables more subtle effects to be analysed, making it an ideal candidate for this study.</description>

      <title>Parametric-Resonance Production of QCD Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dark matter axion production is enhanced through a natural and unavoidable mechanism: primordial temperature fluctuations periodically modulate the axion mass during the QCD phase transition, thereby triggering parametric resonance in axion field evolution. This interplay between parametric resonance and the misalignment mechanism shifts the predicted axion mass window for the observed dark matter abundance to $10^{-4}-10^{-3} \, \text{eV}$, displacing the canonical axion mass window to previously unexplored higher ranges.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Electroweakino Sector of the Baryon Number Violating MSSM at the HL-LHC with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the projected sensitivity of direct electroweakino production $pp \to \tilde\chi_1^{\pm} \tilde\chi_2^0$ at the HL-LHC in a simplified framework with wino-like, mass degenerate $\tilde\chi_1^{\pm}$ and $\tilde\chi_2^0$, and a bino-like lightest neutralino $\tilde\chi_1^0$, assuming R-parity violating~(RPV) through the baryon number violating $\lambda^{\prime \prime}_{112}u^c d^c d^c$ and $\lambda^{\prime \prime}_{113}u^c d^c b^c$ operators. We consider three channels with the $\lambda^{\prime \prime}_{112}u^c d^c d^c$ RPV operator: $Wh$ mediated $1\,\ell + 2\,b + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$, $Wh$ mediated $1\,\ell + (\geq 2\,j) + 2\, \gamma + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$, and $WZ$ mediated $3\ell + (\geq 2 j) + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$. In each channel, we train benchmark-specific multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), analogous to signal-region classifiers, on the four-momenta of the final state particles along with a small set of higher-level observables to distinguish the signal from the dominant SM backgrounds. We find that the HL-LHC will be able to probe winos up to $\sim 900~$GeV, $\sim 780~$GeV, and $\sim 880~$GeV in the $Wh$ mediated $1\,\ell + 2\,b + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$, $Wh$ mediated $1\,\ell + (\geq 2\,j) + 2\, \gamma + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$, and $WZ$ mediated $3\ell + (\geq 2 j) + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$ channels, respectively, for $m_{\tilde\chi_1^0} \sim 50~$GeV, in the presence of $\lambda^{\prime \prime}_{112}u^c d^c d^c$ couplings, at $2\sigma$ sensitivity. In case the $\lambda^{\prime \prime}_{113}u^c d^c b^c$ operator is solely switched on, the projected sensitivity for winos reach up to $\sim 700~$GeV for $Wh$ mediated $1\,\ell + (\geq 1\,b)\, + (\geq 1j)\, + 2\, \gamma + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$ and $\sim 850~$GeV for the $WZ$ mediated $3\ell + (\geq 1 b) + \rm E{\!\!\!/}_T$ channel.</description>

      <title>Hard thermal contributions to phase transition observables at NNLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To construct the high-temperature effective field theory of gauge-Higgs models up to $\mathcal{O}(g^6)$ in the gauge coupling, we integrate out hard modes to three-loop level and use the next-to-next-to-leading order effective potential. For the Abelian Higgs model, we quantify the impact of both higher-dimensional operators and higher-loop corrections on thermodynamic parameters relevant for gravitational-wave observables, finding that one-loop dimension-six effects typically dominate over two- and three-loop corrections to super-renormalizable parameters for the strongest transitions. We derive the three-loop scalar and Debye masses for the ${\rm U(1)}$ and ${\rm SU}(N)$ gauge-Higgs models, as well as the two-loop quartic couplings for the Abelian case, show gauge independence of physical parameters, and demonstrate that no new master integrals are required for the matching, while consistency of 4d and 3d renormalizability points to previously missing contributions in these master integrals.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript presents an historical perspective prepared by Barry Ninham and Colin Pask in 1969 on the connection between quantum electrodynamics theory and nucleon interactions. A new theory of strong interactions based on electromagnetic considerations is proposed. Energy and force range magnitudes are correctly given. A new theory of the pion emerges and the pion mass and lifetime are calculated. No strong interaction coupling constant is required.</description>

      <title>Stable Causality and Microcausality for Drummond-Hathrell Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local superluminal photon propagation arises at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/m_e^2)$ in the Drummond Hathrell (DH) effective action obtained by integrating out the electron in QED coupled to gravity. Whether such superluminality implies a genuine violation of causality in curved spacetime is subtle and remains conceptually nontrivial. In this work we revisit this question using two complementary and largely symmetry-independent diagnostics.
  First, we analyse the global causal structure of the effective (optical) metric governing DH photon propagation and identify conditions under which it remains stably causal, thereby excluding the formation of closed causal curves. Second, from a quantum-field-theoretic perspective, we examine microcausality by treating the gravitational background as a fixed Lorentz-breaking field and applying flat-spacetime analyticity bounds to the photon commutator within the geometric-optics regime of the EFT.
  For two representative examples, a circular photon orbit in Schwarzschild and a linear trajectory in a two-black-hole geometry, we find that, within the regime of validity of the DH effective theory, both diagnostics indicate that the superluminal photon propagation is causally benign. Our results do not constitute a general definition of microcausality in curved spacetime, but provide a controlled and instructive check of causal consistency for EFT superluminality in gravitational backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Fixed-energy inverse scattering with radial basis function neural networks and its application to neutron-alpha interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven method to solve the fixed-energy inverse scattering problem for radially symmetric potentials using radial basis function (RBF) neural networks in an open-loop control system. The method estimates the scattering potentials in the Fourier domain by training an appropriate number of RBF networks, while the control step is carried out in the coordinate space by using the measured phase shifts as control parameters. The system is trained by both finite and singular input potentials and is capable of modeling a great variety of scattering events. The method is applied to neutron-alpha scattering at 10 MeV incident neutron energy, where the underlying central part of the potential is estimated by using the measured l = 0, 1, 2 phase shifts as inputs. The obtained potential is physically sensible, and the recalculated phase shifts are within a few percent relative error.</description>

      <title>Consistency of standard cosmologies using Bayesian model comparison and tension quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified Bayesian assessment of model comparison and data-set consistency for LCDM (cold dark matter plus a cosmological constant) and minimal extensions (neutrino mass, spatial curvature, constant or evolving dark energy) using cosmic microwave background (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO), and type Ia supernova (SN) data. The major results are summarized in the first three figures. We quantify model preference with Bayesian evidence and assess consistency with complementary evidence- and likelihood-based diagnostics applied uniformly across data-set combinations. For the models considered, updated Planck processing systematically improves internal CMB consistency (low-$\ell$ versus high-$\ell$, and primary CMB versus CMB lensing). The preference for a closed geometry and an associated ``curvature tension'' with BAO and/or CMB lensing are largely confined to earlier Planck likelihood implementations and weaken substantially when using updated CMB processing and more recent BAO measurements. Apparent evidence for evolving dark energy in CMB+BAO+SN combinations depends sensitively on the specific pairing of CMB and SN likelihoods: plausible alternatives shift inferred tensions by more than $1\,\sigma$ and can completely reverse the preferred model. Allowing a free neutrino mass tends to absorb residual shifts without introducing new inconsistencies, and we do not find robust evidence for a standalone $\tau$-driven discrepancy once the full likelihood context is accounted for. We conclude that claims of a required update of our standard cosmological model from LCDM to $w_0w_a$CDM are premature.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter signals with high energy astrophysical neutrinos in IceCube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy neutrinos provide a potentially powerful and distinctive probe for dark matter (DM) - neutrino interactions, particularly in environments with enhanced DM densities, such as the DM spikes predicted to form around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the center of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Recent observations by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, which identified four AGN, namely TXS 0506+056, NGC 1068, PKS 1424+240, and NGC 4151 as neutrino sources, provide a unique opportunity to search for signatures of these interactions. In this study, we use IceCube data to derive the most stringent constraints to date on both the energy-dependent and energy-independent DM-neutrino scattering cross-sections. We perform a statistical analysis using data from individual sources as well as a combined (stacked) analysis of all four sources. Our strongest limits arise from the stacking analysis, yielding an upper bound of $\sigma_{0} \le 8\times 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for an energy-independent cross-section and $\sigma_{0} \le 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ for a linearly energy-dependent cross-section, both at 90\% confidence level, particularly in scenarios involving the adiabatic growth of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the first-order hydrodynamic transport coefficients (shear viscosity $\eta$, bulk viscosity $\zeta$, and charge conductivity $\sigma$) for a broad class of strongly coupled, four-dimensional charged relativistic gauge theory plasma with holographic gravitational duals containing higher-derivative corrections. The landscape of our holographic models captures non-conformal gauge theories with an arbitrary number of relevant coupling constants and a general scalar potential in the gravitational dual, allowing for a systematic exploration of charged transport along generic holographic RG flows. The leading-order higher-derivative corrections probe gauge theories with non-equal central charges $c\ne a$ at the ultraviolet fixed point, and enable the engineering of diverse temperature and charge density profiles for the viscosities and the conductivity. Our results establish the membrane paradigm in higher-derivative holographic models: all the transport coefficients are extracted from the black brane horizon values of the gravitational scalars, and various functions defining the gravitational holographic dual.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole signatures from femtolensing and spectral fringe of Gamma Ray Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Femtolensing of gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are vastly studied to constrain the primordial black hole (PBHs) lighter than $10^{-13}$ solar mass and may close the window for PBH dark matter. In this case, wave optics formalism is required and carefully implemented in our analysis. Incorporating the GRB observational data from Swift XRT, we perform the statistic analysis of PBH lensing, comparing with null hypothesis where BAND model is used to parametrize the GRB spectrum. We found few GRB data manifest the spectral fringe which characterize the feature of femtolensing by PBHs, and the analysis shows moderate statistical preference in terms of goodness of fit. Conversely, since most of the fitting to GRB spectral data do not improved with PBH lensing, we utilize to obtain upper bound on the PBH fractional abundance with respect to dark matter. However, the robust constraint cannot be achieved, unless the size of GRBs are smaller than $5\times10^{7}$ m for PBH mass around $5\times10^{-15}$ solar mass.</description>

      <title>Super-knee cosmic rays from interacting supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is increasing evidence that, in the very late phase of stellar evolution before core collapse, massive stars have winds with large mass loss rates that give rise to a dense circumstellar medium (CSM) surrounding the progenitor star. After core collapse, a shock wave forms when the supernova ejecta interacts with this CSM. In such an interaction, the nuclei in the CSM can undergo diffusive shock acceleration and reach very high energies. We consider such a model, which includes magnetic field amplification from the non-resonant streaming instability, enhancement to the abundance of heavy-ions, and composition-dependent acceleration. Applying this to several supernova subclasses, we find that IIn supernovae can supply a dominant fraction of the observed super-knee cosmic-ray (CR) flux from $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{15}\,{\rm eV}$ to $\sim{\rm few}\times10^{17}\,{\rm eV}$ and is consistent with recent LHAASO measurements above the CR knee. This systematic model also explains the increasingly heavy nuclear composition in this energy range.</description>

      <title>Quantum Effective Dynamics and Stability of Vacuum in Anti-de Sitter Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the details of the canonical quantization of effective quantum field theories in anti-de Sitter spacetime, emphasizing the stability of the quantum vacuum. We take the scalar and Maxwell fields as examples. For the non-minimally coupled massless real scalar field with \xi R\phi^2 term in the Lagrangian (mass can be introduced by shift of \xi), only when \xi \le 5/48, the quantized Hamiltonian is spontaneously non-negative and the vacuum is well defined. For \xi &gt; 5/48, one has to assign the negative energy spectrum as that of the ghost particles, introducing anti-commutation relations to make the corresponding part of the Hamiltonian trivial, ensuring the Hamiltonian non-negative and the vacuum (and the Hilbert space) well defined. This method of ghost states is applicable once the proper radial boundary conditions guarantee the Hamiltonian self-adjoint. The resulting dynamics can be compared with those resulting from the positive self-adjoint extensions when the latter is available for \xi\le 9/48. For the Maxwell fields, the gauge invariant canonical energy momentum tensor straightforwardly leads to the gauge invariant non-negative Hamiltonian (well-defined vacuum). Hence the redundant gauge degree of freedom is irrelevant, and the 2-dimensional dynamical degrees of freedom are quantized in a concrete, e.g., temporal gauge. The energy momentum tensors for both quantized fields are renormalized to be finite at operator level, which renders the stable vacuum maximally symmetric. The back-reactions to the background spacetime by excited states via the semi-classical Einstein equations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Constraints on the Neutron Star Equation of State with a Smooth Hadron-Quark Crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian inference of the dense-matter equation of state (EOS) within a unified framework that incorporates hadronic matter, quark matter, and a smooth hadron--quark crossover. The EOS is constrained using physical consistency filters, gravitational-wave data from GW170817, NICER mass--radius measurements, and hypothetical future high-precision radius data. We find that current observations strongly constrain the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy, particularly its slope and curvature, while the highest-density hadronic parameters and quark-matter parameters remain only weakly constrained. The posterior distributions favor a crossover centered at an energy density $\overline{\varepsilon}\sim(4$--$6)\varepsilon_0$ with a width $\Gamma\sim(0.5$--$1.0)\varepsilon_0$, where $\varepsilon_0$ is the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter at saturation. The most probable radius of a canonical neutron star is $R_{1.4}\simeq 11.5-13.0$ km, and the maximum mass is $M_{\rm TOV}\simeq 2.2\,M_\odot$. Overall, present data primarily probe the low-to-intermediate density EOS and provide limited direct sensitivity to quark matter and genuinely high-density physics, highlighting the need for next-generation precision radius measurements.</description>

Abstract: Baym and Farrar (arXiv:2601.02300v1) have recently pointed out a puzzle in understanding the role of the hyperfine interaction in the ground state of a hydrogen atom. If one uses a variational wave function in which the Bohr radius, $a_0$ is replaced by a variational radius parameter, $R$, first-order perturbation theory can give a contribution to the energy proportional to $-1/R^3$. This raises the question of why the hyperfine interaction does not lead to collapse of hydrogen. I show that including the effects of the non-zero size of the proton leads to a resolution of the puzzle such that the variational procedure yields a value of $R$ that is indistinguishable from $a_0$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering: a Systematic Toolkit for Tidal Effects in General Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.06951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for systematic computations of scattering amplitudes for gravitational Raman scattering, -- the inelastic scattering of massless fields off compact relativistic objects. We focus on the small-frequency (post-Minkowskian, PM) regime relevant for the study of tidal effects, which can be mapped onto gravitational wave observables during the inspiraling phase of a merger. We demonstrate that this setup is ideal for systematic studies of tidal effects, in a way that is free from coordinate, gauge, and field redefinition ambiguities. We use a combination of worldline effective field theory, the background field method, and advanced scattering amplitude techniques to derive phase shifts for scattering of spin-$0,1,2$ fields off generic compact objects at third PM order. We demonstrate that the inclusion of the recoil of the object is crucial for consistency of this calculation. Focusing on a particular case of black holes, we extract the leading static and dynamical Love numbers of the spin-0 field and the static Love number of the spin-1 field in four dimensions by matching our EFT amplitudes and calculations in General Relativity. We show, fully on-shell, that the leading static Love numbers vanish identically, while the dynamical Love numbers are not zero and run logarithmically. The latter resolves the ambiguities of previous off-shell matching calculations. We also extend our results to seven dimensions, where spin-2 Love numbers undergo a renormalization group running at 2PM, which we compute explicitly. In addition, we extract the leading static Love numbers of spin-0 and spin-1 fields in five dimensions, which also run.</description>

      <title>Probing Boson Clouds with Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can generate boson clouds via superradiance when the boson's Compton wavelength is comparable to the black hole's size. In binary systems, these clouds can produce distinctive observational imprints. Recent studies accounting for nonlinearities induced by orbital backreaction suggest that if the binary forms at a large separation, resonance transitions can significantly deplete the cloud, minimizing later observational consequences except for very specific orbital inclinations. In this paper, we extend this framework to supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), considering the influence of their astrophysical evolutionary histories. We find that, before entering the gravitational wave (GW) radiation stage, the additional energy loss channels can accelerate orbital evolution. This acceleration makes hyperfine resonant transitions inefficient, allowing a sufficient portion of the cloud to remain for later direct observations. We further discuss the ionization effects and cloud depletion occurring at this stage. Based on these theoretical insights, we explore how multi-messenger observations for SMBHBs can be utilized to detect the ionization effects of boson clouds by examining changes in the orbital period decay rate via electromagnetic measurements and variations in GW strain over a wide frequency band. Our findings reveal a complex dependence on the binary's total mass, mass ratio, and boson mass, emphasizing the significant role of astrophysical evolution histories in detecting boson clouds within binaries.</description>

      <title>SUSY meets SMEFT: Complete one-loop matching of the general MSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the complete one-loop matching of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) onto the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), considering the most general case for the MSSM with conserved $R$-parity, which has 124 free parameters. The matching is performed with the Matchete package, which integrates out all superpartners at once with non-degenerate masses, while also retaining the most general flavor structure. Our results include all correlations among the different SMEFT Wilson coefficients that are governed by supersymmetry and thus provide a basis for future systematic and global studies of the MSSM parameter space employing EFT methods. A detailed discussion is provided on the treatment of the Higgs sector and electroweak symmetry breaking, along with the reduction of redundant operators in the EFT Lagrangian to the Warsaw basis. Furthermore, we validate against existing results in the literature and present a minimal phenomenological example. As an alternative low-energy scenario, we also provide the complete one-loop matching of the MSSM onto the two-Higgs-doublet-model EFT, where the second Higgs doublet is retained in the infrared spectrum. Extensive auxiliary material, including the code utilized for the matching, is available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: The gallium anomaly, a persistent discrepancy exceeding $4\sigma$ in the $^{71}$Ga neutrino capture rates from $^{51}$Cr and $^{37}$Ar radioactive sources by the GALLEX, SAGE, and recently BEST experiments, has challenged particle physics and nuclear theory for over three decades. We present a new calculation of the neutrino capture cross section, abandoning the conventional leading-order approximation for electronic wave functions by numerically solving the Dirac-Coulomb equation for both bound and continuum electron states. Finally, we reevaluate the gallium anomaly, updating its global significance and presenting the most up-to-date status of its interpretation in terms of sterile neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Reheating after the Supercooled Phase Transitions with Radiative Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theories with radiative symmetry breaking (RSB) lead to first-order phase transitions and the production of gravitational waves as well as primordial black holes if the supercooling period lasted long enough. Here we explain how to efficiently reheat the universe after such period in the above-mentioned class of theories. Two cases are possible, depending on whether the RSB scale is much larger than the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking scale or not. When it is, the dominant reheating mechanism can be the decays of the field responsible for RSB in the Standard Model (SM) sector. We point out that in a similar way dark matter (DM) can be produced and we analyze in some detail the case of a sterile-neutrino, finding that the full DM abundance is reproduced when this particle is at the $10^2$ MeV scale in a well-motivated SM completion. When the RSB scale is not much larger than the EW symmetry breaking scale, we find that efficient reheating always occurs when the energy density of the false vacuum is first entirely transferred to a dark photon and then to SM fermions via dark-photon decays.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar meson dominance, the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the matrix elements of the pseudoscalar density with pion-quantum numbers $I^G J^{PC}= 1^- 0^{-+}$ in the nucleon in terms of dispersion relations, PCAC and pQCD asymptotic sum rules for the pseudoscalar form factor. We show that the corresponding spectral density must have at least one zero. A model based on ChPT at low energies, resonances at intermediate energies, Regge power-like behaviour at high energies and pQCD at asymptotically high energies, allows to deduce the pion-nucleon coupling constant and the Goldberger-Treiman discrepancy $\Delta_{\rm GT} = 1 -\frac{m_N g_A}{F_{\pi}g_{\pi NN}}$, yielding the results for the charged channel \[g_{\pi^+ pn} = 13.14(^{+6}_{-4})(7)_{\rm IB}, \quad \Delta_{\rm GT} = 1.26(^{+51}_{-34})(50)_{\rm IB}\ , \] to be compared with the most precise determinations, $g_{\pi^+ np} = 13.25(5)$ (and hence $\Delta_{\rm GT}=2.1(4) \%$), from $np, pp$ scattering analysis of the Granada-2013 database and $g_{\pi^+pn}=13.11(10)$, $\Delta_{\rm GT}=1.0(7)\%$ from the GMO sum rule. Our work supports the concept of pseudoscalar dominance in the nucleon structure suggested by Dominguez long ago. The minimal resonance saturation of the pseudoscalar form factor of the nucleon with the lowest isovector-pseudoscalar mesons compatible with analyticity, pQCD short distance constraints and chiral symmetry leads to an extended PCAC in the large-$N_c$ limit, and effectively depends on the $\pi(1300)$ excited pion state. Our results are compatible, though more accurate, than recent lattice QCD studies and are consistent with almost flat strong pion-nucleon-nucleon vertices.</description>

      <title>Quark polarization and transverse momentum effects on double quarkonium production in hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of double quarkonia ($J/\psi$, $\psi(2S)$, $\Upsilon$ mesons) in polarized hadron-hadron collisions, considering the kinematic configuration where the transverse momentum of each pair of bound states is much smaller than its invariant mass. Supported by nonrelativistic QCD arguments, we adopt the Color-Singlet Model for the quarkonium formation mechanism and assume the validity of transverse momentum dependent factorization. In strong analogy with dilepton production in the Drell-Yan processes, the azimuthal modulations of the cross section, calculated to the order $\alpha_s^4$ in the QCD coupling constant, can be expressed as convolutions of transverse momentum dependent distributions of light quarks and antiquarks inside the incoming hadrons. By adopting very recent parameterizations of these distributions, we show that a phenomenological study of these quantities in $\pi^-p\to J/\psi\,J/\psi\,X $ in the kinematic region covered by the COMPASS and AMBER fixed-target experiments at CERN, where the gluon contribution is found to be negligible, would provide direct access to the quark distributions. In particular, this will offer the possibility of a further sign change test of the quark Sivers function of the proton. The impact of our findings on similar studies about the gluon content of the proton in present and future fixed-target experiments at the LHC, like SMOG and LHCspin, is also demonstrated.</description>

Abstract: The low energy effective field theory of interacting neutrinos derived from the Standard Model may be framed as a pointlike interaction and thereby modeled on a lattice of neutrino momenta. We identify a path to take a continuum limit of this lattice problem in the center of momentum frame. In this limit, the weak interaction is found to become trivial between incoming plane waves describing ultrarelativistic particles, unless finite neutrino wave packet sizes are taken into consideration. We follow up with an analytic treatment of interacting neutrino wave packets, demonstrating the importance of the wave packet size for characterizing neutrino-neutrino scattering in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory treatment of oscillations of Dirac neutrinos in external fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in external fields using the approach based on the quantum field theory (QFT). Neutrinos are virtual particles in this formalism. Neutrino mass eigenstates are supposed to be Dirac fermions. We consider two cases of external fields: the neutrino electroweak interaction with background matter and the interaction with an external magnetic field owing to the presence of the transition magnetic moment. The formalism used involves the dressed propagators of mass eigenstates in external fields. In the matter case, finding of these propagators for Dirac neutrinos has certain difficulties compared to the Majorana particles considered previously. These difficulties are overcome by regularizing the effective potential of the neutrino interaction with matter. The QFT formalism application to the spin-flavor precession also encounters certain peculiarities in the Dirac case compared to the Majorana one. They are related to the observability of right polarized Dirac neutrinos. We derive the matrix elements and the probabilities for Dirac neutrinos interacting with both types of external fields. In case of the spin-flavor precession, we obtain the small QFT contribution to the probabilities in addition to the prediction of the quantum mechanical approach.</description>

Abstract: We study chiral symmetry breaking and restoration in accelerating and rotating frames using low-energy effective models. By analyzing the chiral condensate in Rindler coordinates, we show that different renormalization schemes lead to distinct conclusions in accelerating frame: the scheme with subtracting divergences in Rindler vacuum supports an acceleration-independent critical temperatures, while the other scheme with subtracting divergences in Minkowski vacuum suggests enhanced critical temperature. We further investigate system with both rotation and acceleration. We find that the critical acceleration (see definition in Section V) for chiral symmetry restoration decreases with angular velocity, indicating cooperative effects from acceleration-induced thermalization and rotation-induced effective chemical potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.04026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the decay and production properties of the strange double-charm pentaquark $P_{ccs}^{++}$ with strangeness $S=-1$. Building upon our previous work predicting its $J^P=1/2^-$ molecular configuration, we employ three-point QCD sum rules to calculate its strong decay widths and estimate its production branching ratio via $\Xi_{bc}^+$ baryon decays. The total strong decay width to the $\Xi_{cc}\bar{K}$ and $\Omega_{cc}\pi$ final-state channels is determined as $85\pm19$ MeV. Furthermore, using a rescattering mechanism, we analyze the $\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D_s^{\ast-}\Xi_{cc}^{++}\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++}$ process and estimate the production branching ratio to be $\mathcal{B}r(\Xi_{bc}^+\rightarrow D^-P_{ccs}^{++})=(4.3_{-1.5}^{+2.0})\times10^{-6}$. The relatively narrow width and detectable branching ratio suggest the possibility searching for this pentaquark state in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metastable cosmic strings provide a minimal and predictive origin for the stochastic gravitational-wave background reported by Pulsar Timing Array experiments. We analyse this possibility in electroweak-like dark sectors with a single-stage breaking $SU(2)\times U(1)\!\to\!U(1)$ driven by one Higgs field. In the regime with dark sector Higgs mass below the $Z'$ mass, and for sufficiently small $W'$ mass, the resulting $Z$-string is classically stable but undergoes quantum decay via nucleation of monopole--antimonopole pairs along the string. We compute the corresponding semiclassical bounce action in a thin-defect approximation, treating both the string core and the monopole endpoints as localised defects whose sizes are small relative to their separation in the tunnelling configuration. This yields a decay rate per unit length that depends on the gauge couplings and the mass hierarchy. We delineate the parameter space in which single-scale dark-sector models reproduce the PTA signal, demonstrating the applicability of the thin-defect approximation throughout the phenomenologically favoured region and without invoking extended Higgs sectors or multi-stage symmetry breaking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of neutrino physics has made significant progress in measuring the strength and frequency of neutrino and antineutrino oscillations in the past two decades. It is clear that the amplitudes involved in the neutrino oscillation probabilities are all rephaping invariants of the quartet forms of the elements of the PMNS mixing matrix. We show in this paper how these quartet observables can be directly linked to the rescaled leptonic unitarity triangles within the framework of three active neutrinos. We provide a systematic discussion of the nine CP-conserving quartets ${\cal R}^{}_{\gamma k} \equiv {\rm Re} \left [ V^{}_{\alpha i} V^{}_{\beta j} V^{*}_{\alpha j} V^{*}_{\beta i}\right ] $ along with the universal Jarlskog invariant of CP violation ${\cal J} \equiv \sum_\gamma \epsilon^{}_{\alpha\beta\gamma} \sum_k \epsilon^{}_{ijk} \; {\rm Im} \left [ V^{}_{\alpha i} V^{}_{\beta j} V^{*}_{\alpha j} V^{*}_{\beta i} \right ]$, and place particular emphasis on the matter effect on these quartets. In addition to the well-known Naumov relation for the Jarlskog invariant ${\cal J}$, similar relations connecting ${\cal R}$ in vacuum and its effective counterparts $\widetilde{\cal R}$ in matter are introduced and examined in detail. We find that the effective CP-conserving invariants $\widetilde{\cal R}^{}_{\alpha i}$ in matter can be regarded as linear combinations of their vacuum counterparts. With the latest global fit data of neutrino masses and mixing elements, numerical analyses are carried out to give an intuitive understanding of how these rephasing invariants evolve as the matter density increases.</description>

      <title>New Multi-messenger Probe of Dark Matter-Nucleon Interactions from Ultra-high Energy Cosmic Ray Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the density of dark matter (DM) halo can be highly enhanced around supermassive black holes at the centers of massive galaxies. If real, these DM \emph{spikes} would offer new opportunities to probe the properties of DM. In this work, we point out that DM spikes can significantly impact the composition and survivability of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays accelerated near supermassive black holes. A large DM-nucleon cross section would fragment heavy nuclei into lighter elements and prevent them from attaining the energies observed at Earth. While the origin of cosmic rays remains a mystery, we show that if the highest-energy cosmic rays on Earth come from sources like NGC 1068, then cross sections of size $\sigma_{\chi p} \leq 10^{-33} \left( \frac{m_\chi}{\mathrm{GeV}}\right)\;\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ would be excluded by cosmic ray data. These bounds can be competitive with other existing probes and rule out new parameter space in the DM mass region $m_\chi\in [3\;\mathrm{MeV}, 30\;\mathrm{MeV}]$. While the uncertainties on the acceleration mechanism of cosmic rays prevent us from setting robust limits, our study highlights an important connection between DM spikes and cosmic ray physics that is complementary to existing cosmological and direct detection constraints.</description>

      <title>Unified analysis of screening masses for vector and axial-vector mesons and their diquark partners in the Contact Interaction model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the screening masses of vector and axial-vector mesons and their corresponding diquark partners within a symmetry-preserving vector-vector contact interaction approach. Our analysis includes mesons and diquarks composed of both light and heavy quarks, providing a unified description of their thermal behavior. The longitudinal and transverse modes of the screening masses are analyzed, and the results are systematically compared with other theoretical approaches. At $T = 0$ MeV, our predictions agree with available experimental data, and a comparison with the expected free theory limit at high temperatures is also presented. Notably, the parity partners of the lightest mesons and diquarks converge at high temperatures, signaling chiral symmetry restoration within this framework. These results provide a consistent and detailed picture of meson and diquark properties at finite temperature and lay the groundwork for extending the capabilities of the model to baryon screening masses in the quark-diquark picture.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic geometry in hadron resonance gas model at real and imaginary baryon chemical potential and a simple sufficient condition for quark deconfinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamic geometry of the hadron resonance gas model with (without) excluded volume effects (EVE) of baryons is investigated. The case with imaginary mu, where mu is the baryon chemical potential, is investigated as well as the one with real mu. We calculate the scalar curvature R and use the R=0 criterion to investigate the phase structure in the mu^2-T plane where T is the temperature. The curve on which R=0 continues analytically from the imaginary mu region, where the lattice QCD is feasible, to the real mu one. In the presence of EVE, there are rich phase structures in the large real mu region as well as the Roberge-Weiss like region where mu is imaginary and a singularity appears, while there is no phase structure in the large real $\mu$ region in the absence of EVE. The limitation temperature of the baryon gas is also obtained by using the baryon number fluctuation. The LQCD predicted critical point locates almost on the curve of the limitation temperature we determined. A simple sufficient condition, n_B&gt;1/(2v_B)$, is obtained for the quark deconfinement in the large real mu region, where n_B and v_B are the net baryon number density and the volume of a baryon, respectively.</description>

      <title>Triple crossing positivity bounds for multi-field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.01169v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism to extract triple crossing symmetric positivity bounds for effective field theories with multiple degrees of freedom, by making use of $su$ symmetric dispersion relations supplemented with positivity of the partial waves, $st$ null constraints and the generalized optical theorem. This generalizes the convex cone approach to constrain the $s^2$ coefficient space to higher orders. Optimal positive bounds can be extracted by semi-definite programs with a continuous decision variable, compared with linear programs for the case of a single field. As an example, we explicitly compute the positivity constraints on bi-scalar theories, and find all the Wilson coefficients can be constrained in a finite region, including the coefficients with odd powers of $s$, which are absent in the single scalar case.</description>

Abstract: We review lattice results related to pion, kaon, $D$-meson, $B$-meson, and nucleon physics with the aim of making them easily accessible to the nuclear and particle physics communities. More specifically, we report on the determination of the light-quark masses, the form factor $f_+(0)$ arising in the semileptonic $K \to \pi$ transition at zero momentum transfer, as well as the decay-constant ratio $f_K/f_\pi$ and its consequences for the CKM matrix elements $V_{us}$ and $V_{ud}$. We review the determination of the $B_K$ parameter of neutral kaon mixing as well as the additional four $B$ parameters that arise in theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. For the heavy-quark sector, we provide results for $m_c$ and $m_b$ as well as those for the decay constants, form factors, and mixing parameters of charmed and bottom mesons and baryons. These are the heavy-quark quantities most relevant for the determination of CKM matrix elements and the global CKM unitarity-triangle fit. We review the status of lattice determinations of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. We review the determinations of nucleon charges from the matrix elements of both isovector and flavour-diagonal axial, scalar and tensor local quark bilinears, and momentum fraction, helicity moment and the transversity moment from one-link quark bilinears. We also review determinations of scale-setting quantities. Finally, in this review we have added a new section on the general definition of the low-energy limit of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Fundamental oscillations as a tool to distinguish boson stars from neutron stars and black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04059v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Massive boson stars are self-gravitating configurations of self-interacting scalar fields and can be modeled by a massive scalar field with a quartic self-interaction potential. It has been shown that the equation of state and static structure properties, such as mass and radius, follow scaling relations independent of microscopic dark matter properties. In this work, we demonstrate for the first time that non-radial fundamental ($f$-)mode characteristics also follow a scaling in the strong interaction limit, opening up the outstanding prospect of evaluating the mode properties for boson stars for arbitrary masses spanning the scalar dark matter parameter space allowed by current observations. We provide the scaling relations within full general relativity and obtain the mode characteristics corresponding to the maximum boson star mass configuration. We apply these to determine the $f$-mode properties for boson stars solely as a function of their mass and compactness, which allows distinguishing them from those of neutron stars and black hole quasinormal modes in comparable mass range. In particular, we show that the frequencies are always lower than those of corresponding black holes of the same mass by a factor of 4.5. This provides a smoking gun for the distinguishability of boson stars from other compact objects using gravitational wave observations.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Planck-DESI tension by non-minimally coupled quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Planck measurement of cosmic microwave background (CMB) has established the $\Lambda$-cold-dark-matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model as the concordant model along with other observations. However, recent measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) have renewed the matter fraction $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension between Planck-$\Lambda$CDM and DESI-$\Lambda$CDM. Directly reconciling this CMB-BAO tension with a dynamical DE in Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parametrization seems to imply a crossing of the equation-of-state (EoS) through $w=-1$ at low redshifts. In this letter, we resolve this $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension by allowing for the DM non-minimally coupled to gravity via a quintessence field. This non-minimal coupling is preferred over $3\sigma$ confidence level. Consequently, even though the usual effective EoS of the coupled quintessence apart from the standard CDM part never crosses but always above $w=-1$, a misidentification with the $w_0w_a$CDM model would exactly fake such a crossing behavior, and the tensions on neutrino mass and growth rate in the $\Lambda$CDM model are also relieved in our model as a result of the resolved $\Omega_\mathrm{m}$ tension.</description>

      <title>Multi-strange and charmed hadrons: A novel probe for the QCD equation of state at high baryon densities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear experiments near and below the threshold of hyperon production have shown that the production of Kaons is a sensitive probe for the dense QCD equation of state. At beam energies up to 1.5AGeV, strangeness production can probe the equation of state for densities up to approximately twice nuclear saturation. In this paper we will discuss the possibilities of extending this range in density by the study of multi-strange baryons as well as charmed hadrons in the SIS100 beam energy range up to $10A$GeV. Here, densities up to five times nuclear saturation can be reached and the production of multi-strange and charmed hadrons shows a strong sensitivity to the equation of state. On the other hand a precise prediction of the effect of the equation of state will require knowledge of the fundamental production cross section near the elementary production threshold in p+p collisions which is yet not measured for the hadrons discussed.</description>

      <title>Systematics of the chemical freeze-out line in the high baryon density regime explored at SIS100</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The systematic uncertainties of chemical freeze-out fits at SIS100 energies (Au+Au reactions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3-5$ GeV) are studied using UrQMD simulations. Although hadron production in UrQMD does not occur on a sharp chemical freeze-out hyper-surface, the extracted fit quality is shown to be very good. The extracted chemical parameters depend on the selected hadron species as well as the underlying equation of state (EoS) of the matter. Including light nuclei and anti-protons in the fit increases the expected freeze-out temperature, while a stiffer EoS increases the obtained chemical potential. Similarly, the baryon densities extracted by the thermal fits depend on the choice of hadrons as well as the underlying equation of state. These results are important for the upcoming CBM@FAIR physics program and highlight that a degree of caution is advised when one relates the chemical freeze-out curve to features on the QCD phase diagram like the critical endpoint or a possible phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum corrections to the Randall-Sundrum (RS) model in the near-extremal black brane background with quantum corrections in the near-horizon. The near-horizon geometry is described by Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, and the quantum fluctuations are governed by the Schwarzian action. We introduce the Schwarzian modes into the RS metric, derive the quantum-corrected equation for the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes via the Schwinger-Dyson equation, calculate the correction to the KK mass spectrum, and discuss the impact of quantum corrections on the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. Our work introduces both quantum corrections and temperature into the RS model, providing insights into cosmology and phase transitions within it.</description>

      <title>Dilaton Effective Field Theory across the Conformal Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dilaton effective field theory (dEFT) can be employed to analyze lattice data in gauge theories that lie in close proximity of the lower edge of the conformal window. Under special conditions, we show that it can be used as a diagnostic tool to distinguish near-conformal, yet confining, theories from infrared conformal ones. We demonstrate this efficacy by analyzing two sets of lattice measurements taken from the literature. For the $SU(3)$ theory coupled to $N_f=8$ Dirac fermions transforming in the fundamental representation, our analysis favors confinement. For the $SU(2)$ theory with $N_f=1$ adjoint fermion, our fits favor infrared conformal behavior. We discuss future lattice measurements, and analysis refinements, that can further test this framework.</description>

      <title>Exact black holes and black branes with bumpy horizons supported by superfluid pions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present exact solutions of the Einstein-$SU(2)$ non-linear sigma model in $3+1$ spacetime dimensions, describing bumpy black holes and black branes. Using an Ansatz for superfluid pion multi-vortices, the matter sector reduces to a first-order BPS system, while the Einstein equations reduce to a Liouville equation with a smooth source governing the horizon deformation. These solutions describe horizons of different constant curvatures, with nontrivial bumpy geometries protected by an integer topological invariant, namely the vorticity, which also controls the number of bumps and the black hole thermodynamics. Remarkably, such horizons arise in a minimal and physically motivated matter model, without invoking exotic fields or modified gravity. The physical implications of these results in holography and astrophysics are briefly described.</description>
