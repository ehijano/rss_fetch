      <title>EmotionTalk: An Interactive Chinese Multimodal Emotion Dataset With Rich Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, emotion recognition plays a critical role in applications such as human-computer interaction, mental health monitoring, and sentiment analysis. While datasets for emotion analysis in languages such as English have proliferated, there remains a pressing need for high-quality, comprehensive datasets tailored to the unique linguistic, cultural, and multimodal characteristics of Chinese. In this work, we propose \textbf{EmotionTalk}, an interactive Chinese multimodal emotion dataset with rich annotations. This dataset provides multimodal information from 19 actors participating in dyadic conversational settings, incorporating acoustic, visual, and textual modalities. It includes 23.6 hours of speech (19,250 utterances), annotations for 7 utterance-level emotion categories (happy, surprise, sad, disgust, anger, fear, and neutral), 5-dimensional sentiment labels (negative, weakly negative, neutral, weakly positive, and positive) and 4-dimensional speech captions (speaker, speaking style, emotion and overall). The dataset is well-suited for research on unimodal and multimodal emotion recognition, missing modality challenges, and speech captioning tasks. To our knowledge, it represents the first high-quality and versatile Chinese dialogue multimodal emotion dataset, which is a valuable contribution to research on cross-cultural emotion analysis and recognition. Additionally, we conduct experiments on EmotionTalk to demonstrate the effectiveness and quality of the dataset. It will be open-source and freely available for all academic purposes. The dataset and codes will be made available at: https://github.com/NKU-HLT/EmotionTalk.</description>

      <title>CMIE: Combining MLLM Insights with External Evidence for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in visual reasoning and text generation. While previous studies have explored the application of MLLM for detecting out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, our empirical analysis reveals two persisting challenges of this paradigm. Evaluating the representative GPT-4o model on direct reasoning and evidence augmented reasoning, results indicate that MLLM struggle to capture the deeper relationships-specifically, cases in which the image and text are not directly connected but are associated through underlying semantic links. Moreover, noise in the evidence further impairs detection accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CMIE, a novel OOC misinformation detection framework that incorporates a Coexistence Relationship Generation (CRG) strategy and an Association Scoring (AS) mechanism. CMIE identifies the underlying coexistence relationships between images and text, and selectively utilizes relevant evidence to enhance misinformation detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing methods.</description>

      <title>HiDream-I1: A High-Efficient Image Generative Foundation Model with Sparse Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in image generative foundation models have prioritized quality improvements but often at the cost of increased computational complexity and inference latency. To address this critical trade-off, we introduce HiDream-I1, a new open-source image generative foundation model with 17B parameters that achieves state-of-the-art image generation quality within seconds. HiDream-I1 is constructed with a new sparse Diffusion Transformer (DiT) structure. Specifically, it starts with a dual-stream decoupled design of sparse DiT with dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, in which two separate encoders are first involved to independently process image and text tokens. Then, a single-stream sparse DiT structure with dynamic MoE architecture is adopted to trigger multi-model interaction for image generation in a cost-efficient manner. To support flexiable accessibility with varied model capabilities, we provide HiDream-I1 in three variants: HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, and HiDream-I1-Fast.
  Furthermore, we go beyond the typical text-to-image generation and remould HiDream-I1 with additional image conditions to perform precise, instruction-based editing on given images, yielding a new instruction-based image editing model namely HiDream-E1. Ultimately, by integrating text-to-image generation and instruction-based image editing, HiDream-I1 evolves to form a comprehensive image agent (HiDream-A1) capable of fully interactive image creation and refinement. To accelerate multi-modal AIGC research, we have open-sourced all the codes and model weights of HiDream-I1-Full, HiDream-I1-Dev, HiDream-I1-Fast, HiDream-E1 through our project websites: https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-I1 and https://github.com/HiDream-ai/HiDream-E1. All features can be directly experienced via https://vivago.ai/studio.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Transcript-assisted Video Summarization and Highlight Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video consumption is a key part of daily life, but watching entire videos can be tedious. To address this, researchers have explored video summarization and highlight detection to identify key video segments. While some works combine video frames and transcripts, and others tackle video summarization and highlight detection using Reinforcement Learning (RL), no existing work, to the best of our knowledge, integrates both modalities within an RL framework. In this paper, we propose a multimodal pipeline that leverages video frames and their corresponding transcripts to generate a more condensed version of the video and detect highlights using a modality fusion mechanism. The pipeline is trained within an RL framework, which rewards the model for generating diverse and representative summaries while ensuring the inclusion of video segments with meaningful transcript content. The unsupervised nature of the training allows for learning from large-scale unannotated datasets, overcoming the challenge posed by the limited size of existing annotated datasets. Our experiments show that using the transcript in video summarization and highlight detection achieves superior results compared to relying solely on the visual content of the video.</description>

      <title>Weakly-supervised Localization of Manipulated Image Regions Using Multi-resolution Learned Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The explosive growth of digital images and the widespread availability of image editing tools have made image manipulation detection an increasingly critical challenge. Current deep learning-based manipulation detection methods excel in achieving high image-level classification accuracy, they often fall short in terms of interpretability and localization of manipulated regions. Additionally, the absence of pixel-wise annotations in real-world scenarios limits the existing fully-supervised manipulation localization techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel weakly-supervised approach that integrates activation maps generated by image-level manipulation detection networks with segmentation maps from pre-trained models. Specifically, we build on our previous image-level work named WCBnet to produce multi-view feature maps which are subsequently fused for coarse localization. These coarse maps are then refined using detailed segmented regional information provided by pre-trained segmentation models (such as DeepLab, SegmentAnything and PSPnet), with Bayesian inference employed to enhance the manipulation localization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the feasibility to localize image manipulations without relying on pixel-level labels.</description>

      <title>PixelThink: Towards Efficient Chain-of-Pixel Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing reasoning segmentation approaches typically fine-tune multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using image-text pairs and corresponding mask labels. However, they exhibit limited generalization to out-of-distribution scenarios without an explicit reasoning process. Although recent efforts leverage reinforcement learning through group-relative policy optimization (GRPO) to enhance reasoning ability, they often suffer from overthinking - producing uniformly verbose reasoning chains irrespective of task complexity. This results in elevated computational costs and limited control over reasoning quality. To address this problem, we propose PixelThink, a simple yet effective scheme that integrates externally estimated task difficulty and internally measured model uncertainty to regulate reasoning generation within a reinforcement learning paradigm. The model learns to compress reasoning length in accordance with scene complexity and predictive confidence. To support comprehensive evaluation, we introduce ReasonSeg-Diff, an extended benchmark with annotated reasoning references and difficulty scores, along with a suite of metrics designed to assess segmentation accuracy, reasoning quality, and efficiency jointly. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves both reasoning efficiency and overall segmentation performance. Our work contributes novel perspectives towards efficient and interpretable multimodal understanding. The code and model will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>Visatronic: A Multimodal Decoder-Only Model for Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of foundation models and large language models (LLMs) has fueled significantly improvement in the capabilities of machine learning systems that benefit from mutlimodal input data. However, existing multimodal models are predominantly built on top of pre-trained LLMs, which can limit accurate modeling of temporal dependencies across other modalities and thus limit the model's ability to jointly process and leverage multimodal inputs. To specifically investigate the alignment of text, video, and speech modalities in LLM-style (decoder-only) models, we consider a simplified multimodal generation task, Video-Text to Speech (VTTS): speech generation conditioned on both its corresponding text and video of talking people. The ultimate goal is to generate speech that not only follows the text but also aligns temporally with the video and is consistent with the facial expressions. In this paper, we first introduce Visatronic, a unified multimodal decoder-only transformer model that adopts an LLM-style architecture to embed visual, textual, and speech inputs into a shared subspace, treating all modalities as temporally aligned token streams. Next, we carefully explore different token mixing strategies to understand the best way to propagate information from the steps where video and text conditioning is input to the steps where the audio is generated. We extensively evaluate Visatronic on the challenging VoxCeleb2 dataset and demonstrate zero-shot generalization to LRS3, where Visatronic, trained on VoxCeleb2, achieves a 4.5% WER, outperforming prior SOTA methods trained only on LRS3, which report a 21.4% WER. Additionally, we propose a new objective metric, TimeSync, specifically designed to measure phoneme-level temporal alignment between generated and reference speech, further ensuring synchronization quality.

      <title>Nexus: An Omni-Perceptive And -Interactive Model for Language, Audio, And Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes an industry-level omni-modal large language model (LLM) pipeline that integrates auditory, visual, and linguistic modalities to overcome challenges such as limited tri-modal datasets, high computational costs, and complex feature alignments. Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark. (6) An in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment reveals that incorporating the audio modality enhances representational alignment between vision and language.</description>

      <title>BioVL-QR: Egocentric Biochemical Vision-and-Language Dataset Using Micro QR Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces BioVL-QR, a biochemical vision-and-language dataset comprising 23 egocentric experiment videos, corresponding protocols, and vision-and-language alignments. A major challenge in understanding biochemical videos is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers because of the cluttered environment and indistinguishable objects. Previous studies assumed manual object annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the issue, we focus on Micro QR Codes. However, detecting objects using only Micro QR Codes is still difficult due to blur and occlusion caused by object manipulation. To overcome this, we propose an object labeling method combining a Micro QR Code detector with an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As an application of the method and BioVL-QR, we tackled the task of localizing the procedural steps in an instructional video. The experimental results show that using Micro QR Codes and our method improves biochemical video understanding. Data and code are available through https://nishi10mo.github.io/BioVL-QR/</description>

      <title>Promptus: Can Prompts Streaming Replace Video Streaming with Stable Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the exponential growth of video traffic, traditional video streaming systems are approaching their limits in compression efficiency and communication capacity. To further reduce bitrate while maintaining quality, we propose Promptus, a disruptive semantic communication system that streaming prompts instead of video content, which represents real-world video frames with a series of "prompts" for delivery and employs Stable Diffusion to generate videos at the receiver. To ensure that the generated video is pixel-aligned with the original video, a gradient descent-based prompt fitting framework is proposed. Further, a low-rank decomposition-based bitrate control algorithm is introduced to achieve adaptive bitrate. For inter-frame compression, an interpolation-aware fitting algorithm is proposed. Evaluations across various video genres demonstrate that, compared to H.265, Promptus can achieve more than a 4x bandwidth reduction while preserving the same perceptual quality. On the other hand, at extremely low bitrates, Promptus can enhance the perceptual quality by 0.139 and 0.118 (in LPIPS) compared to VAE and H.265, respectively, and decreases the ratio of severely distorted frames by 89.3% and 91.7%. Our work opens up a new paradigm for efficient video communication. Promptus is open-sourced at: https://github.com/JiangkaiWu/Promptus.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI agents have drawn increasing attention mostly on their ability to perceive environments, understand tasks, and autonomously achieve goals. To advance research on AI agents in mobile scenarios, we introduce the Android Multi-annotation EXpo (AMEX), a comprehensive, large-scale dataset designed for generalist mobile GUI-control agents which are capable of completing tasks by directly interacting with the graphical user interface (GUI) on mobile devices. AMEX comprises over 104K high-resolution screenshots from popular mobile applications, which are annotated at multiple levels. Unlike existing GUI-related datasets, e.g., Rico, AitW, etc., AMEX includes three levels of annotations: GUI interactive element grounding, GUI screen and element functionality descriptions, and complex natural language instructions with stepwise GUI-action chains. We develop this dataset from a more instructive and detailed perspective, complementing the general settings of existing datasets. Additionally, we finetune a baseline model SPHINX Agent and illustrate the effectiveness of AMEX.The project is available at https://yxchai.com/AMEX/.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Inverse Attention Network with Intrinsic Discriminant Feature Exploitation for Fake News Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal fake news detection has garnered significant attention due to its profound implications for social security. While existing approaches have contributed to understanding cross-modal consistency, they often fail to leverage modal-specific representations and explicit discrepant features. To address these limitations, we propose a Multimodal Inverse Attention Network (MIAN), a novel framework that explores intrinsic discriminative features based on news content to advance fake news detection. Specifically, MIAN introduces a hierarchical learning module that captures diverse intra-modal relationships through local-to-global and local-to-local interactions, thereby generating enhanced unimodal representations to improve the identification of fake news at the intra-modal level. Additionally, a cross-modal interaction module employs a co-attention mechanism to establish and model dependencies between the refined unimodal representations, facilitating seamless semantic integration across modalities. To explicitly extract inconsistency features, we propose an inverse attention mechanism that effectively highlights the conflicting patterns and semantic deviations introduced by fake news in both intra- and inter-modality. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that MIAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its pivotal contribution to advancing social security through enhanced multimodal fake news detection.</description>

      <title>Audio Visual Segmentation Through Text Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) is to localize and segment the sounding source objects from video frames. Research on AVS suffers from data scarcity due to the high cost of fine-grained manual annotations. Recent works attempt to overcome the challenge of limited data by leveraging the vision foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), prompting it with audio to enhance its ability to segment sounding source objects. While this approach alleviates the model's burden on understanding visual modality by utilizing knowledge of pre-trained SAM, it does not address the fundamental challenge of learning audio-visual correspondence with limited data. To address this limitation, we propose \textbf{AV2T-SAM}, a novel framework that bridges audio features with the text embedding space of pre-trained text-prompted SAM. Our method leverages multimodal correspondence learned from rich text-image paired datasets to enhance audio-visual alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a novel feature, $\mathbf{\textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLIP} \odot \textit{\textbf{f}}_{CLAP}}$, which emphasizes shared semantics of audio and visual modalities while filtering irrelevant noise. Our approach outperforms existing methods on the AVSBench dataset by effectively utilizing pre-trained segmentation models and cross-modal semantic alignment.

Abstract: Vision-language models encode images and text in a joint space, minimizing the distance between corresponding image and text pairs. How are language and images organized in this joint space, and how do the models encode meaning and modality? To investigate this, we train and release sparse autoencoders (SAEs) on the embedding spaces of four vision-language models (CLIP, SigLIP, SigLIP2, and AIMv2). SAEs approximate model embeddings as sparse linear combinations of learned directions, or "concepts". We find that, compared to other methods of linear feature learning, SAEs are better at reconstructing the real embeddings, while also able to retain the most sparsity. Retraining SAEs with different seeds or different data diet leads to two findings: the rare, specific concepts captured by the SAEs are liable to change drastically, but we also show that the key commonly-activating concepts extracted by SAEs are remarkably stable across runs. Interestingly, while most concepts are strongly unimodal in activation, we find they are not merely encoding modality per se. Many lie close to - but not entirely within - the subspace defining modality, suggesting that they encode cross-modal semantics despite their unimodal usage. To quantify this bridging behavior, we introduce the Bridge Score, a metric that identifies concept pairs which are both co-activated across aligned image-text inputs and geometrically aligned in the shared space. This reveals that even unimodal concepts can collaborate to support cross-modal integration. We release interactive demos of the SAEs for all models, allowing researchers to explore the organization of the concept spaces. Overall, our findings uncover a sparse linear structure within VLM embedding spaces that is shaped by modality, yet stitched together through latent bridges-offering new insight into how multimodal meaning is constructed.</description>
