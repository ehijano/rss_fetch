      <title>Phase-Stable Optical Fiber Links for Quantum Network Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the distribution of single-photon-level pulses from a mode-locked laser source over a phase-stable fiber link, achieving an optical timing jitter of less than 100 as over 10 minutes of data accumulation. This stability enables a fidelity greater than 0.998 between two stabilized 2.1 km long deployed fiber links. Building on time and frequency metrology techniques traditionally used for high-stability optical atomic clock signal distribution, we use time and frequency multiplexing to achieve an isolation of quantum and classical channels by better than $10^{10}$. Our results mark a necessary step towards scalable, high-rate quantum networks with a provable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Observation of spatially structured Montgomery effect in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first direct observation of the spatially structured Montgomery effect, a lensless self-imaging phenomenon that generalizes the Talbot effect to aperiodic structures, unfolding repeated tightly focused spots (~10 $\mu$m) in free space. Using a dynamic optical hologram to discretize radial spatial frequencies, we demonstrate self-imaging at distances ranging from 30 to 100 mm. Our method independently controls the focal spot size and self-imaging period, enabling dynamic three-dimensional light patterns. We also show the arbitrary tunability of the transverse profile by demonstrating revivals of Laguerre-Gaussian, Hermite-Gaussian, Ince-Gaussian modes, and Airy beams. These findings open opportunities for multi-plane microscopy, optical atom traps, and quantum atomic systems.</description>

      <title>A Compact Ultra-Wideband Circularly Polarized Antenna Based on Miniaturized Phase Shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, a compact wideband circularly polarized antenna based on a miniaturized phase shifter with ultra-wideband operation is proposed. The proposed antenna is comprised of a pair of compact orthogonal ultra-wideband Vivaldi antennas and a miniaturized phase shifter. To achieve wideband impedance matching and miniaturization, parasitic radiation structures, metal coupled plates, and {\Gamma}-type balun with high-impedance transmission lines are designed. After optimization, the final antenna dimensions are only 0.36 lambda x 0.36 lambda x 0.34 lambda, where lambda is the free-space wavelength at the lowest operating frequency. Additionally, the miniaturized 90 degrees wideband phase shifter of the antenna is designed by employing a PI-type network and a negative group delay (NGD) network with extremely compact dimensions of 0.071 lambda x 0.047 lambda. The simulated results indicate that the antenna exhibits a 10-dB impedance bandwidth within 0.32 - 1.2 GHz (3.75:1) and a 3-dB axial ratio (AR) bandwidth within 0.32 - 1.15 GHz (3.59:1). Finally, a prototype is fabricated and reasonable agreement is achieved between the simulated and measured results.</description>

      <title>Longwave-transparent low-emissivity material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low emissivity (low-e) materials are crucial for conserving thermal energy in buildings, cold chain logistics and transportation by minimizing unwanted radiative heat loss or gain. However, their metallic nature intrinsically causes severe longwave attenuation, hindering their broad applications. Here, we introduce, for the first time, an all-dielectric longwave-transparent low-emissivity material (LLM) with ultra-broadband, high transmittance spanning 9 orders of magnitude, from terahertz to kilohertz frequencies. This meter-scale LLM not only achieves energy savings of up to 41.1% over commercial white paint and 10.2% over traditional low-e materials, but also unlocks various fundamentally new capabilities including high-speed wireless communication in energy-efficient buildings, wireless energy transfer with radiative thermal insulation, as well as non-invasive terahertz security screening and radio frequency identification in cold chain logistics. Our approach represents a new photonic solution towards carbon neutrality and smart city development, paving the way for a more sustainable and interconnected future.</description>

      <title>Recover Biological Structure from Sparse-View Diffraction Images with Neural Volumetric Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volumetric reconstruction of label-free living cells from non-destructive optical microscopic images reveals cellular metabolism in native environments. However, current optical tomography techniques require hundreds of 2D images to reconstruct a 3D volume, hindering them from intravital imaging of biological samples undergoing rapid dynamics. This poses the challenge of reconstructing the entire volume of semi-transparent biological samples from sparse views due to the restricted viewing angles of microscopes and the limited number of measurements. In this work, we develop Neural Volumetric Prior (NVP) for high-fidelity volumetric reconstruction of semi-transparent biological samples from sparse-view microscopic images. NVP integrates explicit and implicit neural representations and incorporates the physical prior of diffractive optics. We validate NVP on both simulated data and experimentally captured microscopic images. Compared to previous methods, NVP significantly reduces the required number of images by nearly 50-fold and processing time by 3-fold while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. NVP is the first technique to enable volumetric reconstruction of label-free biological samples from sparse-view microscopic images, paving the way for real-time 3D imaging of dynamically changing biological samples. \href{https://xue-lab-cobi.github.io/Sparse-View-FDT/}{Project Page}</description>

      <title>Design of a Dual Polarized Gold-Coated Four-Channel PCF-SPR Sensor with Ultra-High Sensitivity and Broad RI Coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic crystal fiber-based surface plasmon resonance (PCF-SPR) sensors have emerged as a promising class of optical sensors due to their high sensitivity, compact structure and compatibility with a wide range of analytes. Their performance can be significantly enhanced by carefully engineering the fiber geometry to improve the coupling between the guided core mode and the surface plasmon mode. In this work, a polarization-dependent PCF-SPR sensor is numerically designed and analyzed using the finite element method (FEM) to achieve strong mode coupling, wide detection range and high refractive index (RI) sensitivity. The proposed structure incorporates air holes of varying diameters and a rectangular core slot to induce birefringence, while four outer microchannels coated with a 30 nm gold layer form separate plasmonic regions for multiple resonance excitation. Simulation results demonstrate maximum wavelength sensitivities of 77500 nm/RIU and 92500 nm/RIU for x and y-polarizations, respectively and amplitude sensitivities of 3930 1/RIU and 3139 1/RIU, with corresponding figures of merit of 517 1/RIU and 356 1/RIU across an analyte RI range of 1.32-1.42. Parametric analysis confirms strong fabrication tolerance, with coupling mainly influenced by the smallest air holes and the core slot height. The external sensing configuration enables easy analyte handling and reuse, while the design remains compatible with existing fabrication techniques. The proposed sensor thus offers a compact, highly sensitive and fabrication-feasible platform for biochemical and chemical sensing applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip processing of optical orbital angular momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum is an important concept in optics, thus numerous researches explore the principles and applications of light beams with orbital angular momentum. This type of light beam is also called vortex beam, whose inherent infinite-dimensional feature has broad prospect in many fields like optical communications and optical computing. However, there are still a lot of problems in the propagation and processing of on-chip vortex beams. Here, with inverse design method, we design four cross-shaped waveguide structures which can support vortex beams with topological charge l = 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively. The four vortex modes are momentum matched so the coupling between every two waveguides can happen, achieving the conversion of orbital angular momentum. The longest width of each waveguide is about 2 um, so the cross-shaped waveguides are able to be integrated on a photonic chip. All the cross-shaped waveguides are silicon-on-insulator waveguide, and such silicon-based platform has the advantage of being compatible with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the application prospect, we construct an XOR logic gate with the conversion of orbital angular momentum. Therefore, our work provides a new idea for the manipulation of orbital angular momentum, expands the applications of on-chip vortex beams, and shows great potential.</description>

      <title>Strong-field Driven Sub-cycle Band Structure Modulation Measured with Ultrafast Electric Field Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, ultrafast electron dynamics in the solid state have been extensively studied using various strong light-matter interaction techniques, such as high-harmonic generation. These studies lead to multiple interpretations of light-matter interaction in the strong-field regime, with exact mechanisms not yet fully understood. It is known that strong-field interaction with a crystalline solid leads to significant modification of its band structure and hence its optical properties on ultrafast timescales. In this work, we present measurements with ultrafast electric field observables in magnesium oxide from a non-resonant nonlinear optical interaction. Using field observables, we show that the ultrafast, strong-field light-matter interaction modulates the band structure on sub-cycle time scales, resulting in a modulation of the nonlinear optical response of the material. We perform time-dependent perturbation theory calculations with a field-dependent dispersion relation and non-perturbative semiconductor Bloch equation calculations, which agree with experimental observations. Our work offers a new perspective on strong-field-driven electron dynamics in solids through the lens of electric field observables. The demonstrated attosecond modulation of the nonlinear response could have important implications for quantum light generation using nonlinear optical processes.</description>

      <title>Electrical and Thermal Performance Tuning of Spoof Plasmonic Interconnect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces an electromagnetic metastructure based interconnect design that could address the critical need for electrical bandwidth and heat dissipation in high-speed, chiplet integration. We leverage silicon as the substrate for its superior thermal properties, and to counteract its high dielectric constant that typically causes high mutual capacitance among interconnects, we've engineered a periodically corrugated, compact metallic structure enabling signal propagation via strongly confined spoof surface plasmon polaritons (SSPPs). By placing this engineered metal on a $50$ $\mu$m oxide layer atop Si substrate, we achieved a low insertion loss of $0.015$ dB/cm and a $10$ dB reduction in crosstalk noise within $5$ GHz, resulting in a bandwidth $2.5\times$ as high as that of a standard microstriplines of the same footprint. Furthermore, a $5$ ns input pulse showed minimal distortion and a $0.13$ ns/cm propagation delay in our proposed interconnect. Critically, the thin oxide layer minimally impacted the heat dissipation of Si substrate, demonstrating a fourfold reduction in temperature compared to an FR4 substrate. These full-wave simulation-supported findings present a viable pathway for high-density, thermally efficient interconnects in advanced packaging.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Integration of InGaN Lasers in a Foundry-Fabricated Visible-Light Photonics Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visible-spectrum photonic integrated circuits (PICs) present compact and scalable solutions for emerging technologies including quantum computing, biosensing, and virtual/augmented reality. Realizing their full potential requires the development of scalable visible-light-source integration methods compatible with high-volume manufacturing and capable of delivering high optical coupling efficiencies. Here, we demonstrate passive-alignment flip-chip bonding of 450-nm InGaN laser diodes onto a foundry-fabricated visible-light silicon (Si) photonics platform with silicon nitride (SiN) waveguides, thermo-optic (TO) devices, and photodetectors. Hybrid laser integration is realized using a sub-micron-precision die bonder equipped with a vision alignment system and a heatable pickup tool, allowing independent placement of multiple lasers onto a single Si chip. Co-design of the lasers and Si photonics, with lithographically defined alignment marks and mechanical stoppers, enables precise postbonding alignment. Efficient optical coupling between lasers and the SiN waveguides is demonstrated, with a minimum measured coupling loss of 1.1 dB. We achieve a maximum on-chip optical power of 60.7 mW and an on-chip wall-plug efficiency of 7.8%, the highest reported for hybrid-integrated visible-spectrum lasers, to our knowledge. An active PIC is also shown, integrating a bonded laser, an on-chip photodetector for power monitoring, and a thermo-optic switch for optical routing and variable attenuation. Overall, this work highlights passive-alignment flip-chip bonding as a practical, high-performance approach for integrating lasers onto visible-spectrum PICs. We envision that continued refinement of this technique within our photonics platform will support increasingly complex PICs with integrated lasers spanning the visible spectrum.</description>

      <title>Ultra High Sensitivity Soil Moisture Detection Using Photonic Crystal Cavity with SIW Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soil nutrients and water content are two crucial factors that significantly affect agricultural production yields. Hence, monitoring and measuring the water content and soil type are critical requirements. This study proposes a two-dimensional structure of photonic crystals centered around a symmetrical cross-shaped slot. The cross-slots act as resonators, and the photonic crystals surrounding the slots tune the resonance frequency of the resonators to enhance mode confinement within the resonator. The various resonant modes are located in the 2.1 GHz, 5.2 GHz, and 8.1 GHz bands, which correspond to the S band, C band, and X band, respectively. These bands are used to compare the absorption, whereas the upper resonant mode is of the order of 20 GHz. Band structure analysis was performed using the Plane Wave Method (PWM). The resonant frequency is computed using a 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulation software that utilizes the Finite Element Method (FEM) and lies in the radiation mode region of the band structure of the photonic crystal. Varying the incident angle had a negligible effect on the absorption characteristics of the sensor, allowing it to produce accurate sensing results regardless of the incident angle. The sensor's sensitivity is maximized using this design, which results in a sensitivity of 85.4 % in the 2.1 GHz resonant frequency, which is much higher than that of a single column of photonic crystal-based SIW, resulting in 50.6 % of sensitivity at 2.1 GHz, at which there is a frequency shift of the order of GHz. In contrast, in the proposed design, the frequency shift is on the order of MHz, resulting in ultra-high sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Beyond 350 GHz: Single-channel 112 Gbps photonic wireless transmission at 560 GHz using soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) back-haul links will require terahertz (THz) carriers above 350 GHz to escape the congested 300 GHz band and support &gt;100 Gbps data rates. Photonic THz transmitters have so far remained below 350 GHz because high-frequency photomixing suffers from phase noise and power limits. Here we demonstrate single-channel wireless transmission at 560 GHz using a fibre-packaged silicon-nitride soliton microcomb as a compact, low-phase-noise optical reference. A high numerical aperture, UV-bonded fibre interface sustains soliton operation for more than 24 hours with 1 W pump power. We phase-lock two distributed-feedback lasers (DFBs) to adjacent comb lines and photomix them in a high-power uni-travelling-carrier photodiode, generating a 560 GHz carrier that bears in-phase and quadrature modulation. We achieve hard-decision forward-error-correction-qualified quadrature phase-shift keying and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (16QAM) transmissions at 42 and 28 GBaud, respectively, attaining a record 112 Gbps data rate at 560 GHz. Relative to free-running DFBs, microcomb-locked photomixing cuts carrier linewidth and improves 16QAM error-vector magnitude. The results establish soliton microcombs as compact and scalable frequency references for &gt;100 Gbps sub-THz links and chart a path toward compact 6 G back-haul radios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a structurally simple yet functionally ver- satile reflective meta-array composed of phase-change Antimony trisulfide (Sb2S3) nanorods enabling broad- band and wide-angle beam deflection in near-infrared. The device achieves over 80% deflection efficiency over a 1000 nm wide passband, and covering from O-band (1260 nm-1360 nm) to U-band (1565 nm-1625 nm) in the amorphous state. Meanwhile, in its crystalline state, we see a reduction of the efficiency to 40% on average with a maximum passband of 800 nm over the C-band. Moreover, its simple architecture simultaneously en- ables spectral filtering and beam splitting, delivering a compact, multifunctional solution optimized for high power applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that a quantum well with optically excited, homogeneous oscillations of a two-dimensional (2D) electron plasma behaves as a photonic time crystal when it scatters an obliquely incident, weak probe electromagnetic wave. The hydrodynamic approximation is used to describe self-consistently the interaction between the probe wave and the 2D plasma. Such a quantum well becomes a polychromatic source and to the first order in perturbation reflected and transmitted radiation reveals as non-shifted in frequency principal components along with up- and down-shifted in frequency satellites. The downshifted satellites are backward propagating when the frequency of the probe wave is less than that of the plasma oscillations. We found the condition when the downshifted components are the surface waves. For the s-polarized probe wave, we found that the laser-driven quantum well can support propagation of TE surface wave, which would not normally be permitted to propagate freely. The amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted components are determined for the principal components and the up- and down-shifted satellites.</description>

      <title>Shifted rectangular mesh architecture for programmable photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Programmable integrated photonics has evolved into a potent platform for implementing diverse optical functions on a single chip through software-driven reconfiguration. At the core of these processors are the photonic waveguide meshes that enable flexible light routing and manipulation. However, recirculating hexagonal waveguide meshes, which currently constitute the basic component of the mesh, are essentially limited by the fixed dimensions of their elementary cells, which consist of as many as six components, limiting their spectral and temporal resolution. These limitations have a detrimental effect on the processing of broadband signals and the application of high-precision delay lines. Here, we introduce the concept of shifted rectangular waveguide mesh architecture for programmable photonics by shifting the adjacent columns or rows by a certain specific value. The operation of these shifted rectangular cells is predicated on the rectangular shape of the cell, which is associated with a smaller number of tunable basic units (TBUs), i.e., four, compared to cells based on a hexagonal mesh, i.e., six. However, at the same time, they allow the signal to be redirected to the input port, which distinguishes them from the regular square mesh-based structure. This approach unlocks new degrees of freedom in programmable photonic circuits, offering enhanced spectral and temporal tunability. Additionally, it paves the way for advanced application in topological photonics, quantum information processing, neuromorphic and high-speed optical computing. The photonic chip arranged in this architecture is capable of implementing one or multiple simultaneous photonics circuits with optical feedback paths and/or linear multiport transformations by the appropriate programming of its resources and the selection of its input and output ports.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Structures, Devices, and Integrated Applications A Patent Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review systematically analyzes patent disclosures regarding plasmonic structures, devices, and integrated applications, highlighting the technology's capability to confine and manipulate electromagnetic energy at the nanoscale. Core materials rely on highly conductive noble metals (Gold, Silver), alongside innovative alternatives like Transparent Conducting Oxides (TCOs), Graphene, and 2D materials. These materials are engineered into diverse nanostructures that exploit Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) and Localized Surface Plasmon Resonance (LSPR). LSPR generates intense electromagnetic "hot spots" necessary for signal amplification (SERS) and provides extreme refractive index sensitivity for label-free detection. Key device elements include subwavelength plasmonic waveguides (hybrid and slot types) for optical signal routing. Dynamic control is achieved through active tuning mechanisms, utilizing electrical gating of charge carrier density (e.g., TCOs, Graphene) and solid-state phase change materials (e.g., VO2).</description>

      <title>Laser written waveguides to the sample edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method is presented for fabrication of femtosecond laser written waveguides in glass to remove the need for polishing of substrates after processing. It is shown that by amplitude masking the fabrication laser beam near the sample edge and increasing the pulse energy it is possible to write waveguides that are not affected by edge aberrations and display mode profiles well matched to single mode fibre. Results are presented for different depths in fused silica and borosilicate glass substrates. The transmission from fibre to photonic circuit is significantly improved for situations where it is not possible to polish glass substrates after laser writing, creating new opportunities in photonic packaging.</description>

      <title>Controlling the centre of mass motion of levitated particles using structured wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically levitated particles have great potential to form the basis of novel quantum- enhanced sensors. These systems are very well suited for inertial sensing, as the particles are isolated from the environment when they are levitated at low pressures. However, there are many challenges in the experimental realization that may affect the performance of these systems. For example, optical aberrations in the wavefront of the trapping laser which arise from optical elements or misalignment have a great impact on the trapping potential. The detrimental effect of optical aberrations has not been thoroughly studied, and usually they are iteratively corrected, giving some conflicting results depending on the figures of merit that are used. In this work, we present a thorough study of the effects of structuring the wavefront of the trapping beams. We observe that clean beams, i.e. highly focused beams with unaberrated wavefronts, may be used to optimize the longitudinal frequencies, at the cost of the transversal ones. Our work is based in a combination of experimental studies using a complete basis of orthogonal polynomials (Zernike polynomials) to control the wavefront and a set of numerical calculations, which allow us to compare the impact of structured wavefronts on the quality of traps for optically levitated particles in vacuum. This will have direct applications in quantum sensing and fundamental studies of quantum mechanics, as it allows the reduction of optical backaction and thermal decoherence of the particles.</description>

      <title>A performance evaluation of integrating machine learning schemes utilizing fluidic lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A combination of statistical inference and machine learning (ML) schemes has been utilized to create a thorough understanding of coarse experimental data based on Zernike variables characterizing optical aberrations in fluidic lenses. A classification of surplus-response variables through tolerance manipulation was included to unravel the dimensional aspect of the data. Similarly, the impact of the exclusion of supererogatory variables through the identification of clustering movements of constituents is examined. The method of constructing a spectrum of collaborative results through the application of similar techniques has been tested. To evaluate the suitability of each statistical method before its application on a large dataset, a selection of ML schemes has been proposed. The supervised learning tools principal component analysis (PCA), factor analysis (FA), and hierarchical clustering (HC) were employed to define the elemental characteristics of Zernike variables. PCA enabled to reduce the dimensionality of the system by identifying two principal components which collectively account for 95\% of the total variance. The execution of FA indicated that a specific tolerance of independent variability of 0.005 could be used to reduce the dimensionality of the system without losing essential data information. A high cophenetic coefficient value of c=0.9629 validated an accurate clustering division of variables with similar characteristics. The current approach of mutually validating ML and statistical analysis methods will aid in laying the foundation for state-of-the-art (SOTA) analysis. The benefit of our approach can be assessed by considering that the associated SOTA will enhance the predictive accuracy between two comparable methods, in contrast to the SOTA analysis conducted between two arbitrary ML methods.</description>

      <title>Circular Huygens Dipoles: Unidirectional Spin-Angular Momentum from Achiral Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous control over the directionality and spin of light at the nanoscale is a central goal in nanophotonics with applications ranging from quantum information to advanced biosensing. We introduce the concept of the Circular Huygens Dipole and numerically demonstrate its realization in a single Si nanocuboid. We show that the polarization of an incident linear wave controls the interference between co-located circular electric and magnetic dipoles excited in phase quadrature. This enables deterministic switching of the forward-scattered radiation between purely right- and left-circularly polarized states. The system also functions as a directional spin-to-linear polarization converter. Our findings establish a robust, passive method for reconfigurable spin-directional control in a simple, monolithic silicon nanostructure, opening avenues for chip-scale spin-optics, chiral quantum interfaces, and novel sensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound for inertial confinement fusion target wall thickness measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In inertial confinement fusion experiments hollow, spherical mm-sized capsules are used as a container for nuclear fuel. To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>

      <title>Frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy for nanometric layer thickness imaging with GHz elastic plate resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanometric layer thickness imaging is crucial for fundamental research and characterization of micro fabricated devices. Here, we assess the potential of a non-contact opto-acoustic frequency domain laser ultrasound (FreDomLUS) microscopy technique for imaging nanometric thickness variations via GHz zero-group velocity (ZGV) elastic plate resonances. The method exploits the ZGV's lateral energy confinement that leads to sharp resonance peaks which can be effectively probed with the FreDomLUS technique at GHz acoustic frequencies. For demonstration purposes we introduced sub-10 nm height variation patterns in the topmost layer of solidly mounted bulk-acoustic wave resonators with a design frequency of around 1.7 GHz. They are raster-scanned to retrieve ZGV-frequencies from local acoustic spectra as a contrast quantity for imaging. We show how to retrieve quantitative height information by numerically calibrating the factor which inversely relates ZGV frequency change with the layer thickness change. Height variations in stacks with nominal thickness changes of 8 nm, 4 nm, and 1 nm can be resolved and indicate sub-nanometer depth resolution capabilities. The lateral resolution is studied by measuring the method's step edge function and it is found to be in the micrometer range. Atomic force microscopy imaging is used to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Near-Equilibrium Propagation training in nonlinear wave systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence, establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which system control is restricted to local parameters.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Antimodes in Multi-Drive Cavity Magnonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven-dissipative systems provide a natural setting for the emergence of exceptional points -- i.e. non-Hermitian degeneracies where eigenmodes coalesce. These points are important for applications such as sensing, where enhanced sensitivity is required, and exhibit interesting and useful phenomena that can be controlled with experimentally accessible parameters. In this regard a four-port, three-mode, cavity-magnonics platform is demonstrated in which two microwave excitations can be precisely phase shifted and/or attenuated relative to one another. Destructive interference between the hybridised cavity-magnon modes is shown to give rise to antimodes (antiresonances) in the transmission spectrum, enabling coherent perfect extinction of the outgoing signals at selected ports. This interference can be used to actively tune the position and properties of exceptional points, without the fine tuning conventionally required to obtain exceptional points. Such controllable, interference-based engineering of exceptional points provides a practical and flexible pathway toward next-generation, high-sensitivity sensing devices operating at microwave frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the noisy dynamics of periodically driven, discrete-step quantum walks in a one-dimensional photonic lattice. We find that in the bulk, temporal noise that is constant within a Floquet period leads to decoherence-free momentum subspaces, whereas fully random noise destroys coherence in a few time-steps. When considering topological edge states, we observe decoherence no matter the type of temporal noise. To explain these results, we derive a non-perturbative master equation to describe the system's dynamics and experimentally confirm our findings in a discrete mesh photonic lattice implemented in a double-fibre ring setup. Surprisingly, our results show that a class of bulk states can be more robust to a certain type of noise than topological edge states.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory of frequency-entangled biphoton states facilitated by cavity polaritons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum light to probe exciton properties in semiconductor and molecular nanostructures typically occurs in the low-intensity regime. A substantial enhancement of exciton-photon coupling can be achieved with photonic cavities, where excitons hybridize with cavity modes to form polariton states. To provide a theoretical framework for interpreting experimental efforts in this direction, we develop a scattering theory describing the interaction of frequency-entangled photon pairs with cavity polariton and bipolariton states under various coupling regime. Employing the Tavis-Cummings model in combination with our scattering approach, we present a quantitative analysis of how polariton/bipolariton interaction with the entangled photon pair modifies its joint spectral amplitude (JSA). Specifically, we examine the effects of the cavity-mode steady-state population, exciton-cavity coupling strength, and different forms of the input photon JSA. Our results show that the entanglement entropy of the scattered photons is highly sensitive to the interplay between the input JSA and the spectral line shapes of the polariton resonances, emphasizing the cavity filtering effects. We argue that biphoton scattering quantum light spectroscopy best serves as a sensitive probe of polariton and bipolariton states in the photon-vacuum cavity steady state.</description>

      <title>Triphoton generation near atomic resonance via SSWM: Harmonic expansion for accurate optical response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum correlations of time-frequency-entangled photon pairs generated via parametric processes are critically influenced by both the linear and nonlinear optical responses of the medium. This sensitivity is especially significant in schemes utilizing atomic ensembles with well-defined energy level structures near resonance. However, conventional theoretical approaches often fall short in accurately calculating the optical responses--particularly when a single atomic transition is simultaneously driven by multiple light fields with (significantly) different intensities. To address this limitation, we generalize the harmonic expansion method originally introduced by Wen for biphoton generation near atomic resonance. As a case study, we apply this generalized approach to the reliable direct generation of time-energy-entangled W-state triphotons via spontaneous six-wave mixing in a five-level asymmetric-M atomic system. Our results demonstrate the method's superior accuracy and self-consistency, offering clear advantages over traditional calculation techniques.</description>

      <title>High harmonic generation light source with polarization selectivity and sub-100-$\mu$m beam size for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality ultrafast light sources are critical for developing advanced time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES). While the application of high harmonic generation (HHG) light sources in TrARPES has increased significantly over the past decade, the optimization of the HHG probe beam size and selective control of the light polarization, which are important for TrARPES measurements, have been rarely explored. In this work, we report the implementation of high-quality HHG probe source with an optimum beam size down to 57 $\mu$m $\times$ 90 $\mu$m and selective light polarization control, together with mid-infrared (MIR) pumping source for TrARPES measurements using a 10 kHz amplifier laser. The selective polarization control of the HHG probe source allows to enhance bands with different orbital contributions or symmetries, as demonstrated by experimental data measured on a few representative transition metal dichalcogenide materials (TMDCs) as well as topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. Furthermore, by combining the HHG probe source with MIR pumping at 2 $\mu$m wavelength, TrARPES on a bilayer graphene shows a time resolution of 140 fs, allowing to distinguish two different relaxation processes in graphene. Such high-quality HHG probe source together with the MIR pumping expands the capability of TrARPES in revealing the ultrafast dynamics and light-induced emerging phenomena in quantum materials.</description>

      <title>High-performance quantum frequency conversion using programmable unpoled nanophotonic waveguides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum frequency conversion (QFC) is essential for interfacing quantum systems operating at different wavelengths and for realizing scalable quantum networks. Despite extensive progress, achieving QFC with simultaneous high efficiency, low pump power, minimal added noise, broad bandwidth, and pump-wavelength flexibility remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate efficient, low-noise, and bidirectional QFC between the telecom (1550-nm) and visible (780-nm) bands using unpoled indium gallium phosphide (InGaP) $\chi^{(2)}$ nanophotonic waveguides, eliminating the need for a long-wavelength pump. Leveraging the large nonlinear susceptibility of InGaP together with programmable modal-phase-matching control, we obtain record-low pump power (20 mW) -- an order of magnitude lower than that in previous demonstrations using integrated thin-film waveguides -- with record-high loss-inclusive normalized conversion efficiency among non-resonant QFC implementations. With added noise well below the single-photon level, our platform preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons. These results mark a significant advance in integrated nonlinear photonics for high-performance QFC, facilitating the development of versatile and scalable quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Long-term analysis of efficient-BB84 4-node network with optical switches in metropolitan environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a leading technology for enabling information-theoretic secure communication, with protocols such as BB84 and its variants already deployed in practical field implementations. As QKD evolves from point-to-point links to multi-node networks, scalability and cost-effectiveness become central challenges. Among the approaches to address these issues, efficient-BB84 has shown durable and reliable performances, while optical switching techniques enable flexible, scalable, and cost-efficient integration of QKD into existing infrastructures. In this work, we present an active QKD network in a production environment, employing efficient-BB84 and optical switching, orchestrated in a coordinated manner, emphasizing their potential to support robust, future-proof quantum-secure communication systems.</description>

      <title>Countermeasures for Trojan-Horse Attacks on self-compensating all-fiber polarization modulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to exchange a secret key between two parties. Unlike classical cryptographic systems, the security of QKD is not reliant on computational assumptions but is instead rooted in the fundamental laws of physics. In a QKD protocol, any attempt by an eavesdropper to intercept the key is detectable: this provides an unprecedented level of security, making QKD an attractive solution for secure communication in an era increasingly threatened by the advent of quantum computers and their potential to break classical cryptographic systems. However, QKD also faces several practical challenges such as transmission loss and noise in quantum channels, finite key size effects, and implementation flaws in QKD devices. Addressing these issues is crucial for the large-scale deployment of QKD and the realization of a global quantum internet. A whole body of research is dedicated to the hacking of the quantum states source, for example using Trojan-Horse attacks (THAs), where the eavesdropper injects light into the system and analyzes the back-reflected signal. In this paper, we study the vulnerabilities against THAs of the iPOGNAC encoder, first introduced in Avesani, Agnesi et al., to propose adapted countermeasures that can mitigate such attacks.</description>

      <title>Probing Flying-Focus Wakefields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flying-focus wakefields, which can propagate with a tunable velocity along the optical axis, are promising solutions to electron dephasing in laser-wakefield accelerators. This is accomplished by a combination of spatio-temporal couplings and focusing with an axiparabola, a specialized optical element which produces a quasi-Bessel beam. If implemented, dephasingless acceleration would allow for a hitherto unachievable mixture of high acceleration gradients and long acceleration lengths. Here, we conduct an in-depth study of the structure and behavior of such a flying-focus wakefield, through a combination of direct imaging and simulations. We show the stability of the wakefield structures, explore how the wakefield evolves with changes of density, study the effects of ionization on the wakefield structure with a variety of gases, and analyze the importance of the focusing position. These insights shed light onto this novel wakefield regime and bring understanding that is important to the realization of dephasingless acceleration.</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>The advancement of Brillouin Light Scattering with the assistance of nanoplasmonic structures. Enhancement and amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brillouin light scattering (BLS) is a key technique in studying magnonic systems, but its sensitivity is often limited. While nanoplasmonic systems can enhance BLS through near-field effects, we propose a novel approach for additional amplification. In this conceptual paper, we show how to actively supply energy to a surface collective electromagnetic resonance (SCR) supported by a sparse layer of metal nanoparticles on a magnetic film. Proposed methods are designed to significantly amplify the efficiency of surface-enhanced Brillouin light scattering without increasing the intensity of the primary excitation. In the proposed scheme, the pump extends the propagation length of the SCR, leading directly to BLS amplification. We analyze the conditions for such amplification, with numerical estimates indicating a potential gain of more than an order of magnitude in the surface-wave amplitude. This gain far surpasses the modest increase achievable through passive enhancement alone. These findings outline a practical pathway to achieving BLS amplification in integrated magnonic platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a method for controlling light scattering based on the excitation of non-radiating states in a half-space through a tailored choice of incident radiation. For a fixed particle geometry, we demonstrate that small variations in the refractive index can lead to a significant redistribution of scattered light between two half spaces while keeping the incident illumination unchanged. This effect is particularly relevant for dynamic beam shaping and optical signal routing at the microscale. Our study focuses on spherical semiconductor particles of varying radii illuminated in the visible range, with refractive index modulation achieved via charge carrier injection. Using AlGaAs and InP as model materials, we analyze the feasibility of achieving efficient directional control of scattering. These results provide insight into all-optical manipulation of light using tunable semiconductor structures.</description>

      <title>Super-efficient optical frequency division referenced to {\mu}Hz Schawlow-Townes-linewidth quantum-noise-limited lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical frequency division (OFD) implements the conversion of ultra-stable optical frequencies into microwave frequencies through an optical frequency comb flywheel, generating microwave oscillators with record-low phase noise and time jitter. However, conventional OFD systems face significant trade-off between division complexity and noise suppression due to severe thermal noise and technical noise in the optical frequency references. Here, we address this challenge by generating common-cavity bi-color Brillouin lasers as the optical frequency references, which operate at the fundamental quantum noise limit with Schawlow-Townes linewidth on the 10 {\mu}Hz level. Enabled by these ultra-coherent reference lasers, our OFD system uses a dramatically simplified comb divider with an unprecedented small division factor of 10, and generates 10 GHz microwave signal with exceptional phase noise of -65 dBc/Hz at 1Hz, -155 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz, and -172 dBc/Hz at 10 MHz offset. Moreover, to fully harness the spectral purity of the OFD technology, here we implement broadband frequency synthesis directly referenced to the OFD oscillator, covering 5 to 20 GHz with millisecond tuning time. Our work redefines the trade-off between noise suppression and division complexity in OFD, paving the way for compact, high-performance microwave synthesis for next-generation atomic clocks, quantum sensors, and low-noise radar systems.</description>

      <title>Inverse design for robust inference in integrated computational spectrometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an inverse-design approach for computational spectrometers in which the scattering media are topology-optimized to achieve better performance in inference of unknown spectra. Unlike traditional end-to-end approaches, our inverse design of the scattering media does not need a training set of spectra, a distribution of detector noise, or an inference algorithm. Our approach allows the selection of the inference algorithm to be decoupled from that of the scatterer. For smooth spectra, we additionally devise a regularized reconstruction algorithm based on Chebyshev interpolation, which yields higher accuracy compared with conventional methods in which the spectra are sampled at equally spaced frequencies or wavelengths with equal weights. Our approaches are numerically demonstrated via inverse design of integrated computational spectrometers and reconstruction of example spectra. The inverse-designed spectrometers exhibit significantly better performance in the presence of noise than their counterparts with random scatterers. Our method provides a useful complement to end-to-end co-design methods.</description>

Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multipolar order, such as octupolar order, is a key concept in condensed matter physics, particularly in light of elusive hidden orders. However, its experimental identification remains challenging due to the absence of direct coupling to conventional external stimuli. In this study, we propose that dual-circular Raman scattering serves as a probe of multipolar anisotropies. By combining symmetry analysis with microscopic calculations, we demonstrate that both time-reversal-even ($\theta$-even) and time-reversal-odd ($\theta$-odd) axial multipolar phases exhibit the Raman optical activity as a direct consequence of mirror symmetry breaking. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a multipolar phonon, a three-dimensional and alternating displacement resembling the chiral phonon, plays a vital role in the proposed optical phenomena. Our findings open a pathway for identifying multipolar orders in various materials through dual-circular Raman spectroscopy as a sensitive and versatile probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian gauge symmetries are cornerstones of modern theoretical physics, underlying fundamental interactions and the geometric structure of quantum mechanics. However, their potential to control quantum coherence, entangle- ment, and transport in engineered quantum systems remains to a large extent unexplored. In this work, we propose utilizing non-Abelian Thouless pumping to realize one-dimensional discrete-time quantum walks on topological lattices char- acterized by degenerate flat bands. Through carefully designed pumping cycles, we implement different classes of holonomic coin and shift operators. This frame- work allows for the construction of quantum walks that encode the topological and geometric properties of the underlying system. Remarkably, the resulting evolution exhibits parity symmetry breaking and gives rise to a dynamical pro- cess governed by a Weyl-like equation, highlighting the deep connection between parity and time-reversal symmetry breaking in the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary potential scattering admits a formulation in terms of the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian. We use this formulation to give a proof of the reciprocity theorem in two and three dimensions that does not rely on the properties of the scattering operator, Green's functions, or Green's identities. In particular, we identify reciprocity with an operator identity satisfied by an integral operator $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$, called the fundamental transfer matrix. This is a multi-dimensional generalization of the transfer matrix $\mathbf{M}$ of potential scattering in one dimension that stores the information about the scattering amplitude of the potential. We use the property of $\widehat{\mathbf{M}}$ that is responsible for reciprocity to identify the analog of the relation, $\det{\mathbf{M}}=1$, in two and three dimensions, and establish a generic anti-pseudo-Hermiticity of the scattering operator. Our results apply for both real and complex potentials.</description>

Abstract: We report the first characterization results of an optical time-stamping camera based on the Timepix4 chip coupled to a fully depleted optical silicon sensor and fast image intensifier, enabling sub-nanosecond scale, time-resolved imaging for single photons. The system achieves an RMS time resolution of 0.3 ns in direct detection mode without the intensifier and from 0.6 to 1.5 ns in the single-photon regime with an intensifier for different amplitude-based signal selections. This shows that Timepix4 provides a significant improvement over previous Timepix3-based cameras in terms of timing precision, and also in pixel count and data throughput. We analyze key factors that affect performance, including sensor bias and timewalk effect, and demonstrate effective correction methods to recover high temporal accuracy. The camera's temporal resolution, event-driven readout and high rate capability make it a scalable platform for a wide range of applications, including quantum optics, ultrafast imaging, and time-correlated photon counting experiments.</description>

      <title>Emulation of Coherent Absorption of Quantum Light in a Programmable Linear Photonic Circuit</title>

Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum systems, governed by nonunitary evolution, offer powerful tools for manipulating quantum states through engineered loss. A prime example is coherent absorption, where quantum states undergo phase-dependent partial or complete absorption in a lossy medium. Here, we demonstrate a fully programmable implementation of nonunitary transformations that emulate coherent absorption of quantum light using a programmable integrated linear photonic circuit, with loss introduced via coupling to an ancilla mode [Phys. Rev. X 8, 021017; 2018]. Probing the circuit with a single-photon dual-rail state reveals phase-controlled coherent tunability between perfect transmission and perfect absorption. A two-photon NOON state input, by contrast, exhibits switching between deterministic single-photon and probabilistic two-photon absorption. Across a range of input phases and circuit configurations, we observe nonclassical effects such as anti-coalescence and bunching, along with continuous and coherent tuning of output Fock state probability amplitudes. Classical Fisher information analysis reveals phase sensitivity peaks of 1 for single-photon states and 3.4 for NOON states, the latter exceeding the shot-noise limit of 2 and approaching the Heisenberg limit of 4 for two-photon states. The experiment integrates quantum state generation, programmable photonic circuitry, and photon-number-resolving detection, establishing ancilla-assisted circuits as powerful tools for programmable quantum state engineering, filtering, multiplexed sensing, and nonunitary quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical crystal in light-resilient quantum ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interaction between light and high-frequency sound is a key area in integrated photonics, quantum and nonlinear optics, and quantum science. However, the typical suspended optomechanical structures suffer from poor thermal anchoring, making them susceptible to thermal noise arising from optical absorption. Here, we demonstrate a chip-scale, release-free silicon optomechanical crystal cavity (OMC) operating cryogenically with improved resilience to laser light. Relative to a suspended nanobeam OMC, we observe an 18 dB suppression of the thermo-optic effect, and the device sustains near-unity phonon occupation at 35 dB higher intracavity optical energy. Time-resolved measurements further reveal rapid initial thermalization governed by the mechanical decay time. With further material and design improvements in sight, these results bolster release-free systems on a chip as a path for low-noise and high-power classical and quantum electro-optomechanics, such as for frequency converters between microwave and optical photons.</description>
