      <title>Search for new resonances decaying to pairs of merged diphotons in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search is presented for an extended Higgs sector with two new particles, X and $\phi$, in the process X $\to$ $\phi\phi$ $\to$ $(\gamma\gamma)(\gamma\gamma)$. Novel neural networks classify events with diphotons that are merged and determine the diphoton masses. The search uses LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected with the CMS detector, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. No evidence of such resonances is seen. Upper limits are set on the production cross section versus the resonance masses, representing the most sensitive search in this channel.</description>

      <title>Properties of Charge Recombination in Liquid Argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid argon is an excellent medium for detecting particles, given its yields and transport properties of light and charge. The technology of liquid argon time projection chambers has reached its full maturity after four decades of continuous developments and is, or will be, used in world class experiments for neutrino and dark matter searches. The collection of ionization charge in these detectors allows to perform a complete tridimensional reconstruction of the tracks of charged particles, calorimetric measurements, particle identification. This work proposes a novel approach to the problem of charge recombination in liquid argon which moves from a microscopic model and is applied to the cases of low energy electrons, alpha particles and nuclear recoils. The model is able to describe precisely several sets of experimental data available in the literature, over wide ranges of electric field strengths and kinetic energies and can be easily extended to other particles.</description>

      <title>Echo-free quality factor of a multilayer axion haloscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a methodology to determine the quality factor ($Q$) in implementations of the so-called dielectric haloscope, a new concept of wavy dark matter detector equipped with a multilayered resonator. An anechoic chamber enables the observation of the resonance frequency and its amplitude for an unlimited series of layers for the first time, which is conveniently filtered. The frequency-normalized power enhancement measured in a Dark-photons \&amp; Axion-Like particles Interferometer (DALI) prototype is a few hundred per layer over a sweep bandwidth of half a hundred MHz. In light of this result, this scaled-down prototype is sensitive to axions saturating the local dark matter density with a coupling to photons between $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim$ few $\times 10^{-14}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at frequencies of several dozens of GHz once cooled down to the different working temperatures of the experiment and immersed in magnetic fields ranging from 1 T to 10 T; while the sensitivity of the full-scale DALI is projected at $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\gtrsim\mathrm{few}\times10^{-15}$ GeV$^{-1}$ over the entire 25--250 {\mu}eV range since $Q\gtrsim10^4$ is expected.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy with L\'evy sources at NA61/SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent decades of high-energy physics research, it was demonstrated that strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) is created in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. Investigation and understanding of the properties of the hadronic matter are among the most important goals of the NA61/SHINE collaboration at CERN SPS. Mapping of the phase diagram is achieved by varying the collision energy (5 GeV $\sqrt{s_{NN}}&lt;17$ GeV) and by changing the collision system ($p$+$p$, $p$+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). Femtoscopic correlations reveal the space-time structure of the hadron emitting source.
  In this article, we report on the measurement of femtoscopic correlations in small to intermediate systems. Comparing the measurements to calculations based on symmetric L\'evy sources, we discuss the results on L\'evy source parameters as a function of average pair transverse mass. One of the physical parameters is of particular importance, the L\'evy exponent $\alpha$, which describes the shape of the source and may be related to the critical exponent $\eta$ in the proximity of the critical point. Therefore, measuring it may shed light on the location of the critical endpoint of the QCD phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Probing the structure of $X(3872)$ in photoproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the production of $X(3872)$ mesons in photon-induced nuclear reactions near the threshold within the collision model based on the nuclear spectral function. The model accounts for direct photon-nucleon $X(3872)$ production processes as well as five different scenarios for their internal structure. We calculate the absolute and relative excitation functions for $X(3872)$ production off $^{12}$C and $^{184}$W target nuclei at near-threshold incident photon energies of 8--16 GeV, the absolute differential cross sections for their production off these target nuclei at laboratory angles of 0$^{\circ}$--10$^{\circ}$ and for incident photon energy of 13 GeV as well as the A dependences of the relative (transparency ratios) cross sections for $X(3872)$ production from ${\gamma}A$ collisions at photon energies around 13 GeV within the adopted scenarios for the $X(3872)$ meson internal structure. We show that the absolute and relative observables considered reveal distinct sensitivity to these scenarios. Therefore, the measurement of such observables in a dedicated experiment at the CEBAF facility in the near-threshold energy range will allow us to get valuable information on the $X(3872)$ inner structure.</description>

      <title>The science and technology of liquid argon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquid argon detectors are ubiquitous in particle, astroparticle, and applied physics. They reached an unprecedented level of maturity thanks to more than 20 years of R&amp;D and the operation of large-scale facilities at CERN, Fermilab, and the Gran Sasso laboratories. This article reviews such an impressive advance - from the grounding of the experimental technique up to cutting-edge applications. We commence the review by describing the physical and chemical properties of liquid argon as an active and target medium for particle detection, together with advantages and limitations compared with other liquefied noble gases. We examine the opportunities and challenges of liquid argon detectors operated as calorimeters, scintillators, and time projection chambers. We then delve into the core applications of liquid argon detectors at colliders (ATLAS), accelerator neutrino beams (SBN, DUNE), and underground laboratories (DarkSide, DEAP, ICARUS) for the observation of rare events. We complete the review by looking at unconventional developments (pixelization, combined light-charge readout, Xe-doped devices, all-optical readout) and applications in medical and applied physics to extend this technology's scope toward novel research fields.</description>

      <title>Signature decay modes of the compact doubly-heavy tetraquarks $T_{bb\bar{u} \bar{d}}$ and $T_{bc\bar{u} \bar{d}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the expectations that the lowest-lying double-bottom tetraquark $T_{bb\bar u \bar d}$ ($J^P=1^+$) and the bottom-charm tetraquark $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ ($J^P=0^+$) are stable against strong and electromagnetic decays, we work out a number of semileptonic and non-leptonic weak decays of these hadrons, making use of the heavy quark symmetry. In doing this, we concentrate on the exclusive decays involving also tetraquarks in the final states, i.e., transitions such as $T_{bb\bar u \bar d} \to T_{bc\bar u \bar d} (\ell^- \nu_\ell, h^-)$ and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d} \to T_{cc\bar u \bar d} (\ell^- \nu_\ell, h^-)$, where $h^-=\pi^-,\rho^-,a_1^-$. So far, only the $J^P=1^+$ tetraquark $T_{cc\bar u \bar d}$ has been discovered, which we identify with the $I=0$ $T_{cc}^{+}$ object, compatible with $J^P=1^+$ and having the mass and decay widths $\delta m =M(T_{cc}^+) -(M(D^{*+}) - M(D^0))= -360 \pm 40 ^{+4}_{-0}$ keV and $\Gamma(T_{cc}^+)=48^{+2}_{-14}$ keV. Experimental discoveries of the transitions worked out here will go a long way in establishing the nature of these tetraquarks as (mainly) compact four-quark objects.</description>

      <title>Novel method for in-situ drift velocity measurement in large volume TPCs: the Geometry Reference Chamber of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for low maintenance, low ambiguity in-situ drift velocity monitoring in large volume Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). The method was developed and deployed for the 40m^3 TPC tracker system of the NA61/SHINE experiment at CERN, which has a one meter of drift length. The method relies on a low-cost multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) placed downstream of the TPCs to be monitored. The drift velocity is then determined by matching the reconstructed tracks in the TPC to the hits of the pertinent monitoring chamber, called Geometry Reference Chamber (GRC), which is then used as a differential length scale. An important design requirement on the GRC was minimal added complexity to the existing system, in particular, compatibility with Front-End Electronics (FEE) cards already used to read out the TPCs. Moreover, the GRC system was designed to operate both in large and small particle flux. The system is capable of monitoring the evolution of the in-situ drift velocity down to a one permil precision, with a few minutes of time sampling.</description>

      <title>Proposal for PAC 52: Measurement of $\alpha_-$ for $\Lambda\rightarrow p\pi^-$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to measure the weak decay constant $\alpha_-$ for the decay $\Lambda\rightarrow p\pi^-$ using a both circularly and linearly polarized photon beam with the GlueX spectrometer in Hall D. The measurement will take advantage of the fact that a measurement with both linear and circular photon beam polarization results in an over-constrained set of amplitudes which can be fitted to data and used to extract $\alpha_-$ which will be left as a free parameter in the fit. We expect to determine $\alpha_-$ with statistical uncertainties comparable to existing measurements and independent systematic uncertainties. This measurement can be performed alongside GlueX-II running and requires no new hardware or new beam time. The measurement requires that a sufficient fraction of the electron beam polarization be longitudinal in the Hall D tagger.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Method for Improving Momentum Measurement of Photon Conversions Reconstructed from Single Electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reconstruction of photon conversions is importantin order to improve the reconstruction efficiency of the physics measurements involving photons. However, there are significant number of conversions in which only one of the two tracks emitted electrons is reconstructed in the detector due to very asymmetric energy sharing between the electron-positron pair. The momentum determination of the parent photon can be improved by estimating the missing energy in such conversions. In this study, we propose a simple statistical method that can be used to determine the mean value of the missing energy. By using simulated minimum bias events at LHC conditions and a toy detector simulation, the performance of the method is tested for several decay channels commonly used in particle physics analyses. A considerable improvement in the mass reconstruction precision is obtained when reconstructing particles decaying to photons whose energies are less than 20 GeV.</description>

      <title>The Higgs boson as a self-similar system: Towards a new solution to the hierarchy problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.09916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new solution to the hierarchy (naturalness) problem, concerning quantum corrections of the Higgs mass. Assuming the Higgs boson as a system with a self-similar internal structure, we calculate its two-point function and find that the quadratic divergence is replaced by a logarithmic one in the mass corrections. It is shown that the partonic-like distribution follows the Tsallis statistics and also high energy physics experimental data for the Higgs transverse momentum distribution can be described by a self-similar statistical model.</description>

      <title>The Awkward World of Python and C++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are undeniable benefits of binding Python and C++ to take advantage of the best features of both languages. This is especially relevant to the HEP and other scientific communities that have invested heavily in the C++ frameworks and are rapidly moving their data analyses to Python. Version 2 of Awkward Array, a Scikit-HEP Python library, introduces a set of header-only C++ libraries that do not depend on any application binary interface. Users can directly include these libraries in their compilation instead of linking against platform-specific libraries. This new development makes the integration of Awkward Arrays into other projects easier and more portable, as the implementation is easily separable from the rest of the Awkward Array codebase. The code is minimal; it does not include all of the code needed to use Awkward Arrays in Python, nor does it include references to Python or pybind11. The C++ users can use it to make arrays and then copy them to Python without any specialized data types - only raw buffers, strings, and integers. This C++ code also simplifies the process of just-in-time (JIT) compilation in ROOT. This implementation approach solves some of the drawbacks, like packaging projects where native dependencies can be challenging. In this paper, we demonstrate the technique to integrate C++ and Python using a header-only approach. We also describe the implementation of a new LayoutBuilder and a GrowableBuffer. Furthermore, examples of wrapping the C++ data into Awkward Arrays and exposing Awkward Arrays to C++ without copying them are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03894v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AC-coupled Strip LGAD (Strip AC-LGAD) is a novel LGAD design that diminishes the density of readout electronics through the use of strip electrodes, enabling the simultaneous measurement of time and spatial information. The Institute of High Energy Physics has designed a long Strip AC-LGAD prototype with a strip electrode length of 5.7 mm and pitches of 150 $\mu m$, 200 $\mu m$, and 250 $\mu m$. Spatial and timing resolutions of the long Strip AC-LGAD are studied by pico-second laser test and beta source tests. The laser test demonstrates that spatial resolution improves as the pitch size decreases, with an optimal resolution achieved at 8.3 $\mu$m. Furthermore, the Beta source test yields a timing resolution of 37.6 ps.</description>

Abstract: Kaon physics is at a turning point -- while the rare-kaon experiments NA62 and KOTO are in full swing, the end of their lifetime is approaching and the future experimental landscape needs to be defined. With HIKE, KOTO-II and LHCb-Phase-II on the table and under scrutiny, it is a very good moment in time to take stock and contemplate about the opportunities these experiments and theoretical developments provide for particle physics in the coming decade and beyond. This paper provides a compact summary of talks and discussions from the Kaons@CERN 2023 workshop.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the role of the electromagnetic interaction in the formation and decay of the $X(3872)$. The binding properties of the $X(3872)$ are studied by assuming the molecular nature and considering the $S$-$D$ wave mixing, isospin breaking, and coupled channel effects, and in particular the correction from the electromagnetic interaction. The radiative decays can better reflect the difference between the charged and neutral $D\bar D^*$ components, since the electromagnetic interaction explicitly breaks the isospin symmetry. We further study the radiative decay widths with the obtained wave functions for different $D\bar D^*$ channels. We also explore other similar hidden-charm molecular states. The electromagnetic interaction can make the molecule tighter. Our result of the radiative decay width for $X(3872)\rightarrow \gamma J/\psi$ is in agreement with the experiment. The branching ratio $R_{\gamma\psi}$ is less than 1 in our framework, which supports the Belle and BESIII measurements.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy Scaling Functions in Heavy-Ion Collisions: Insights into the `Ultra-Central Flow Puzzle' and Constraints on Transport Coefficients and Nuclear Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropy scaling functions derived from comprehensive measurements of transverse momentum- and centrality-dependent anisotropy coefficients $v_2(p_T,\text{cent})$ and $v_3(p_T,\text{cent})$ in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 and 2.76 TeV, and Xe+Xe collisions at 5.44 TeV at the LHC, offer new insights into the `ultra-central flow puzzle'. These functions integrate diverse measurements into a single curve, clarifying anisotropy attenuation throughout the entire $p_T$ and centrality range. They reveal the influence of initial-state eccentricities ($\varepsilon_{n}$), dimensionless size ($\mathbb{R}$), radial flow, viscous correction to the thermal distribution function ($\delta_f$), the medium's stopping power ($\hat{q}$), and specific shear viscosity ($\eta/s$) on the observed anisotropies. This analysis not only enhances understanding of transport coefficients but also provides crucial constraints on nuclear deformation.</description>

      <title>Revealing the nature of $\Omega_{c}$-like states from pentaquark perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study the electromagnetic properties of controversial states whose internal structure is not elucidated and we try to offer a different point of view to unravel the internal structure of these states. Inspired by the $\Omega_c$ states observed by the LHCb Collaboration, we study the electromagnetic properties of the $\Omega_c$-like states as the compact diquark-diquark-antiquark pentaquarks with both $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$ and $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$ in the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule model. From the obtained numerical results, we conclude that the magnetic dipole moments of the $\Omega_c$-like states can reflect their inner structures, which can be used to distinguish their spin-parity quantum numbers. Measuring the magnetic moment of the $\Omega_c$-like states in future experimental facilities can be very helpful for understanding the internal organization and identifying the quantum numbers of these states.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the underlying structure of axial-vector bottom-charm tetraquarks in the light of their magnetic moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic moment yields an excellent framework to explore the inner structure of particles determined by the quark-gluon dynamics of QCD, as it is the leading-order response of a bound system to a weak external magnetic field. Motivated by this, in this study, the magnetic moments of possible axial-vector $T_{bc\bar u \bar u}$, $T_{bc\bar d \bar d}$, and $T_{bc\bar u \bar d}$ tetraquarks are obtained with the help of light-cone QCD sum rules. For this purpose, we assume that these states are represented as a diquark-antidiquark picture with different structures and interpolating currents. The magnetic moment results derived using different diquark-antidiquark configurations differ substantially from each other. This can be translated into more than one tetraquark state with the same quantum number and quark content yet possessing different magnetic moments. From the numerical results obtained, we have concluded that the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ states can project their inner structure, which can be used for their quantum numbers and quark-gluon organization. The contribution of individual quarks to the magnetic moments is also analyzed for completeness. We hope that our predictions of the magnetic moments of the $T_{bc}$ tetraquarks, together with the results of other theoretical investigations of the spectroscopic parameters and decay widths of these interesting tetraquarks, may be valuable in the search for these states in future experiments and in unraveling the internal structure of these tetraquarks.</description>

      <title>Parameters of the tensor tetraquark $bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass and width of the tensor tetraquark $T=bb\overline{c}\overline{c}$ with spin-parity $J^{\mathrm{P}}=2^{+}$ are calculated in the context of the QCD sum rule method. The tetraquark $T$ is modeled as a diquark-antidiquark state built of components $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }b$ and $\overline{c}\gamma _{\nu }C\overline{c}^{T}$ with $C$ being the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m=(12795\pm 90)~\mathrm{MeV}$ of the exotic tensor meson $T$ is found by means of the two-point sum rule approach. Its full width $\Gamma$ is evaluated by considering processes $T \to B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{-}$, $ B_{c}^{-}B_{c}^{\ast -}$, and $B_{c}^{\ast -}B_{c}^{\ast -}$. Partial widths of these decays are computed by means of the three-point sum rule approach which is used to determine the strong couplings at relevant tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Predictions obtained for the width $ \Gamma=(55.5 \pm 8.7)~\mathrm{MeV}$, as well as the mass of the tetraquark $ T $ can be useful in investigations of fully heavy four-quark mesons.</description>

      <title>Triple Higgs couplings at LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09827v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A global interpretation of several significant indications of scalar resonances observed at LHC is achieved using the Georgi Machacek model. Among many other consequences, one predicts large cross sections for the processes ggFH(320)-&gt;h(125)h(125) and A(151)A(151) and ggF-&gt;A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z, where H(320) has been observed in A(420)-&gt;H(320)Z-&gt;bbbbl+l- and where A(151) is observed into two photons accompanied by a b jet, a lepton or missing transverse energy. We predict that ggF-&gt;H(320) has a cross section of about 2000 fb with a BR into h(125)(125) of 17% and into A(151)A(151) of 45%. Henceforth we predict that ggF-&gt;H(320)-&gt;hh will dominate over the SM process h*-&gt;hh, where h is the SM h(125) scalar. One expects that H(320)-&gt;A(151)A(151) can be observed into bbbb, becoming one of the most significant BSM phenomena identified so far. Arguments in favor of a SUSY version of GM are provided.</description>
