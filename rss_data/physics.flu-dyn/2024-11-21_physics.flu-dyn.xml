      <title>Linking emitted drops to collective bursting bubbles across a wide range of bubble size distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbles entrained by breaking waves rise to the ocean surface, where they cluster before bursting and release droplets into the atmosphere. The ejected drops and dry aerosol particles, left behind after the liquid drop evaporates, affect the radiative balance of the atmosphere and can act as cloud condensation nuclei. The remaining uncertainties surrounding the sea spray emissions function motivate controlled laboratory experiments that directly measure and link collective bursting bubbles and the associated drops and sea salt aerosols. We perform experiments in artificial seawater for a wide range of bubble size distributions, measuring both bulk and surface bubble distributions (measured radii from 30 um to 5 mm), together with the associated drop size distribution (salt aerosols and drops of measured radii from 50 nm to 500 um) to quantify the link between emitted drops and bursting surface bubbles. We evaluate how well the individual bubble bursting scaling laws describe our data across all scales and demonstrate that the measured drop production by collective bubble bursting can be represented by a single framework integrating individual bubble bursting scaling laws over the various bubble sizes present in our experiments. We show that film drop production by bubbles between 100 um and 1 mm describes the submicron drop production, while jet drop production by bubbles from 30 um to 2 mm describes the production of drops larger than 1 um. Our work confirms that sea spray emissions functions based on individual bursting processes are reasonably accurate as long as the surface bursting bubble size distribution is known.</description>

      <title>Characterization of sea ice kinematics over oceanic eddies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eddies within the meso/submeso-scale range are prevalent throughout the Arctic Ocean, playing a pivotal role in regulating freshwater budget, heat transfer, and sea ice transport. While observations have suggested a strong connection between the dynamics of sea ice and the underlying turbulent flows, quantifying this relationship remains an ambitious task due to the challenges of acquiring concurrent sea ice and ocean measurements. Recently, an innovative study using a unique algorithm to track sea ice floes showed that ice floes can be used as vorticity meters of the ocean. Here, we present a numerical and analytical evaluation of this result by estimating the kinematic link between free-drifting ice floes and underlying ocean eddies using idealized vortex models. These analyses are expanded to explore local eddies in quasi-geostrophic turbulence, providing a more realistic representation of eddies in the Arctic Ocean. We find that in both flow fields, the relationship between floe rotation rates and ocean vorticity depends on the relative size of the ice floe to the eddy. As the floe size approaches and exceeds the eddy size, the floe rotation rates depart from half of the ocean vorticity. Finally, the effects of ice floe thickness, atmospheric winds, and floe-floe collisions on floe rotations are investigated. The derived relations and floe statistics set the foundation for leveraging remote sensing observations of floe motions to characterize eddy vorticity at small to moderate scales. This innovative approach opens new possibilities for quantifying Arctic Ocean eddy characteristics, providing valuable inputs for more accurate climate projections.</description>

      <title>Internal stresses in low-Reynolds-number fractal aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a numerical model of fractal-structured aggregates in low-Reynolds-number flows. Assuming that aggregates are made of cubic particles, we first use a boundary integral method to compute the stresses acting on the boundary of the aggregates. From these external stresses, we compute the stresses within the aggregates in order to gain insights on their breakup, or disaggregation. We focus on systems in which aggregates are either settling under gravity or subjected to a background shear flow and study two types of aggregates, one with fractal dimension slightly less than two and one with fractal dimension slightly above two. We partition the aggregates into multiple shells based on the distance between the individual cubes in the aggregates and their center of mass and observe the distribution of internal stresses in each shell. Our findings indicate that large stresses are least likely to occur near the far edges of the aggregates. We also find that, for settling aggregates, the maximum internal stress scales as about 7.5% of the ratio of an aggregate's apparent weight to the area of the thinnest connection, here a single square. For aggregates exposed to a shear flow, we find that the maximum internal stress scales roughly quadratically with the aggregate radius. In addition, after breaking aggregates at the face with the maximum internal stress, we compute the mass distribution of sub-aggregates and observe significant differences between the settling and shear setups for the two types of aggregates, with the low-fractal-dimension aggregates being more likely to split approximately evenly. Information obtained by our numerical model can be used to develop more refined dynamical models that incorporate disaggregation.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale simulation of red blood cell trauma in large-scale high-shear flows after Norwood operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiovascular surgeries and mechanical circulatory support devices create non-physiological blood flow conditions that can be detrimental, especially for pediatric patients. A source of complications is mechanical red blood cell (RBC) damage induced by the localized supraphysiological shear fields. To understand such complications, we introduce a multi-scale numerical model to predict the risk of hemolysis in a set of idealized anatomies. We employed our in-house CFD solver coupled with Lagrangian tracking and cell-resolved fluid-structure interaction to measure flow-induced stresses and strains on the RBC membrane. The Norwood procedure, well-known to be associated with high mortality rate, is selected for its importance in the survival of the single-ventricle population. We simulated three anatomies including 2.5mm and 4.0mm diameter modified Blalock-Taussig (BT) shunts and a 2.5mm central shunt (CS), with hundreds of RBCs in each case for statistical analysis. The results show that the conditions created by these surgeries can elongate RBCs by more than two-fold (3.1% of RBCs for 2.5mm BT shunt, 1.4% for 4mm BT shunt, and 8.8% for CS). Shear and areal strain metrics also reveal that the central shunt creates the greatest deformations on the RBCs membrane, indicating it is a more hemolytic procedure in comparison to the BT shunt. Between the two BT shunts, the smaller diameter is slightly more prone to hemolysis. These conclusions are confirmed when strain history and different damage thresholds are considered. The spatial damage maps produced based on these metrics highlighted hot zones that match the clinical images of shunt thrombosis.</description>

      <title>Far-field Boundary Conditions for Airfoil Simulation at High Incidence in Steady, Incompressible, Two-dimensional Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study concerns the far-field boundary conditions (BCs) for airfoil simulations at high incidence where the lift and drag are comparable in magnitude and the moment is significant. A NACA 0012 airfoil was simulated at high Reynolds number with the Spalart-Allmaras turbulence model in incompressible, steady flow. We use the impulse form of the lift, drag, and moment equations applied to a control volume coincident with the square computational domain, to explore the BCs. It is well known that consistency with the lift requires representing the airfoil by a point vortex, but it is largely unknown that consistency with the drag requires a point source as was first discovered by Lagally (1922) and Filon (1926). We show that having a point source in the BCs is more important at high drag than using a point vortex. The reason is that BCs without a point source cause blockage at the top and bottom sidewalls in a manner very similar to wind tunnel blockage for experiments. A simple "Lagally-Filon" correction for small levels of blockage is derived and shown to bring the results much closer to those obtained using boundary conditions including a point source. Although consistent with the lift and drag, the combined point vortex and source boundary condition is not consistent with the moment equation but the further correction for this inconsistency is shown to be very small. We speculate that the correction may be more important in cases where the moment is critical, such as vertical-axis turbines.</description>

      <title>How interfacial tension enhances drag in turbulent Taylor-Couette flow with neutrally buoyant and equally viscous droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dispersed-phase droplets can result in a notable increase in the system's drag. However, our understanding of the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains limited. In this study, we use three-dimensional direct numerical simulations with a modified multi-marker volume-of-fluid method to investigate liquid-liquid two-phase turbulence in a Taylor-Couette geometry. The dispersed phase has the same density and viscosity as the continuous phase. The Reynolds number $Re\equiv r_i\omega_i d/\nu$ is fixed at 5200, the volume fraction of the dispersed phase is up to $40\%$, and the Weber number $We\equiv \rho u^2_\tau d/\sigma$ is around 8. It is found that the increase in the system's drag originates from the contribution of interfacial tension. Specifically, droplets experience significant deformation and stretching in the streamwise direction due to shear near the inner cylinder. Consequently, the rear end of the droplets lags behind the fore head. This causes opposing interfacial tension effects on the fore head and rear end of the droplets. For the fore head of the droplets, the effect of interfacial tension appears to act against the flow direction. For the rear end, the effect appears to act in the flow direction. The increase in the system's drag is primarily attributed to the effect of interfacial tension on the fore head of the droplets which leads to the hindering effect of the droplets on the surrounding continuous phase. This hindering effect disrupts the formation of high-speed streaks, favoring the formation of low-speed ones, which are generally associated with higher viscous stress and drag of the system. This study provides new insights into the mechanism of drag enhancement reported in our previous experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we extend the Discontinuous Galerkin Spectral Element Method (DGSEM) to high-enthalpy reacting gas flows with internal degrees of freedom. An entropy- and kinetic energy-preserving flux function is proposed which allows for use of arbitrary expressions for the internal energies of the constituent gas species. The developed method is applied to simulation of several model problems and compared to the DLR TAU solver.</description>

      <title>Solver-in-the-loop approach to turbulence closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for modeling the influence of the unresolved scales of turbulence for sub-grid modeling. Our approach employs the differentiable physics paradigm in deep learning, allowing a neural network to interact with the differential equation evolution and performing an a posteriori optimization by incorporating the solver into the training iteration (an approach known as solver-in-the-loop), thus departing from the conventional a priori instantaneous training approach. Our method ensures that the model is exposed to equations-informed input distributions, accounting for prior corrections and often leading to more accurate and stable time evolution. We present results of our methodology applied to a shell model of turbulence, and we discuss further potential applications to Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Salts promote or inhibit bubbly drag reduction in turbulent Taylor-Couette flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bubbly drag reduction is considered as one of the most promising techniques to reduce the energy consumption of marine vessels. With this technique bubbles are injected under the hull where they then lubricate the hull, thus reducing the drag of the vessel. Understanding the effects of salts on bubbly drag reduction is therefore of crucial importance in the application of this technique for salt waters. In this study we investigate the effects of MgCl2, Na2SO4, substitute sea salt, and NaCH3COO on the reduction of drag by bubbles in turbulent Taylor-Couette flow. We find that MgCl2, Na2SO4, and substitute sea salt inhibit bubble coalescence, leading to smaller bubbles in the flow, which prove to be less effective for bubbly drag reduction. For these salts we find that the ionic strength is a decent indicator for the observed drag reduction and solutions of these salts with an ionic strength higher than I &gt;= 0.7 mol/l show little to no drag reduction. In contrast, NaCH3COO solutions do not inhibit bubble coalescence and for this salt we even observe an enhanced drag reduction with increasing salt concentration. Finally, for all cases we connect the observed drag reduction to the bubble Weber number and show that bubble deformability is of utmost importance for effective bubbly drag reduction.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Gas Source Localization Using Distributed IoT Sensors and Bayesian Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying a gas source in turbulent environments presents a significant challenge for critical applications such as environmental monitoring and emergency response. This issue is addressed through an approach that combines distributed IoT smart sensors with an algorithm based on Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Employing a probabilistic model of the environment, such an algorithm interprets the gas readings obtained from an array of static sensors to estimate the location of the source. The performance of our methodology is evaluated by its ability to estimate the source's location within a given time frame. To test the robustness and practical applications of the methods under real-world conditions, we deployed an advanced distributed sensors network to gather water vapor data from a controlled source. The proposed methodology performs well when using both the synthetic data generated by the model of the environment and those measured in the real experiment, with the source localization error consistently lower than the distance between one sensor and the next in the array.</description>

      <title>Extreme firebrand transport by atmospheric waves in wildfires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wildfires, burning pieces of ember-firebrands-are carried downstream by wind. At the time of landing, these firebrands can start secondary fires far away from the main burning unit. This phenomenon is called spotting and the secondary fires are referred to as spot fires. Here, we first present numerical evidence that atmospheric traveling waves can increase the spotting distance by at least an order of magnitude compared to unidirectional wind conditions. We then present theoretical results explaining this numerical observation. In particular, we show that the firebrand's motion can synchronize with the traveling wave, leading to a surf-like motion for some firebrand particles. This delays the firebrand's landing, making extreme spotting distances possible. This physical phenomena helps explain the discrepancy between previous theoretical estimates of maximum spotting distance and much larger spotting distances observed empirically. We derive new analytical expressions for the landing time and landing distance of the firebrands.</description>

      <title>The influence of free-stream turbulence on the fluctuating loads experienced by a cylinder exposed to a turbulent cross-flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of several $``\text{flavours}"$ of free-stream turbulence (FST) on the structural response of a cantilevered cylinder, subjected to a turbulent cross-flow is investigated. At high enough Reynolds numbers, the cylinder generates a spectrally rich turbulent wake which significantly contributing to the experienced loads. The presence of FST introduces additional complexity through two primary mechanisms: $\textbf{directly}$, by imposing a fluctuating velocity field on the cylinder's surface, and $\textbf{indirectly}$, by altering the vortex shedding dynamics, modifying the experienced loads. We employ concurrent temporally resolved Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and distributed strain measurements using Rayleigh backscattering fibre optic sensors (RBS) to instrument the surrounding velocity field and the structural strain respectively. By using various turbulence-generating grids, and manipulating their distance to the cylinder, we assess a broad FST parameter space allowing us to individually explore the influence of transverse integral length scale ($\mathcal{L}_{13}/D$), and turbulence intensity ($TI$) of the FST on the developing load dynamics. The presence of FST enhances the magnitude of the loads acting on the cylinder. This results from a decreased vortex formation length, increased coherence of regular vortex shedding, and energy associated with this flow structure in the near-wake. The cylinder's structural response is mainly driven by the vortex shedding dynamics, and their modification induced by the presence of FST, ie. the indirect effect outweighs the direct effect. From the explored FST parameter space, $TI$ was seen to be the main driver of enhanced loading conditions, presenting a positive correlation with the fluctuating loads magnitude at the root.</description>

      <title>Modeling the effect of hydrodynamic wakes in dynamical models of large-scale fish schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel model of the wake of swimming fish is developed and incorporated into a dynamical model of a fish school to explore the effect of hydrodynamics on the emergent behavior in schooling fish. The model incorporates well-established rules for attraction, alignment, and visual detection via a force-momentum balance in the surge, sway, and yaw directions, thereby allowing us to include the effects of body size, shape, and inertia in to the dynamics of fish motion. The key novelty of the model lies in the modeling of the hydrodynamics, which includes not only the potential flow induced by the body of the fish but also the vortex wakes generated by the fish. These hydrodynamic features, as well as the surge, sway, and yaw force coefficients, are parameterized via three-dimensional high-fidelity direct numerical simulations of a carangiform swimmer, thereby enabling a higher degree of realism in these models. The model is used to examine the effect of wake characteristics on the topology and movement of fish schools. The simulations indicate that these wake vortices lead to improved organization within the schools, especially in situations where the social forces are relatively weak.</description>

      <title>Online Optimisation of Machine Learning Collision Models to Accelerate Direct Molecular Simulation of Rarefied Gas Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an online optimisation algorithm for in situ calibration of collision models in simulations of rarefied gas flows. The online optimised collision models are able to achieve similar accuracy to Direct Molecular Simulation (DMS) at significantly reduced computational cost for 1D normal shocks in argon across a wide range of temperatures and Mach numbers. DMS is a method of simulating rarefied gases which numerically integrates the trajectories of colliding molecules. It often achieves similar fidelity to Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which fully resolve the trajectories of all particles at all times. However, DMS is substantially more computationally expensive than the popular Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method, which uses simple phenomenological models of the collisions. We aim to accelerate DMS by replacing the computationally costly Classical Trajectory Calculations (CTC) with a neural network collision model. A key feature of our approach is that the machine learning (ML) collision model is optimised online during the simulation on a small dataset of CTC trajectories generated in situ during simulations. The online Machine Learning DMS (ML-DMS) is able to reproduce the accuracy of MD and CTC-DMS for 1D normal shocks in argon at a significantly lower computational cost (by a factor of $\sim5$--$15$), at a wide range of physical conditions (Mach numbers $1.55\leq \text{Ma}\leq 50 $, densities $\sim 10^{-4}\text{kg}\text{m}^{-3}$ to $1\text{kg}\text{m}^{-3}$, and temperatures 16K to 300K). We also derive an online optimisation method for calibration of DSMC collision models given a model of the interatomic forces. In our numerical evaluations for 1D normal shocks, the online optimisation method matches or significantly improves the accuracy of VHS (Variable Hard Sphere) DSMC with respect to CTC-DMS (with a $\sim20 \times$ lower computational cost).</description>

      <title>CFD-based design optimization of a 5 kW ducted hydrokinetic turbine with practical constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ducted hydrokinetic turbines enhance energy-harvesting efficiency by better conditioning the flow to the blades, which may yield higher power output than conventional freestream turbines for the same reference area. In this work, we present a ducted hydrokinetic turbine design obtained by simultaneously optimizing the duct, blade, and hub geometries. Our optimization framework combines a CFD solver, an adjoint solver, and a gradient-based optimizer to efficiently explore a large design space, together with a feature-based parameterization method to handle the complex geometry. Practical geometrical constraints ensure the manufacturability of the duct in terms of a minimum thickness and the housing of a 5 kW generator within the hub. The optimization converges to a short, thin duct with a rounded leading edge and an elongated hub protruding the duct inlet. The optimized ducted turbine achieves up to 50% efficiency when evaluated by RANS/URANS solvers despite a bulky hub, outperforming the 45% efficiency of the freestream Bahaj turbine featuring the same hub. This work showcases the effectiveness of CFD-based optimization in advancing ducted turbine designs and demonstrates the hydrodynamic benefits of a ducted configuration, paving the way for future research and real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Second-Order Transport Models for Transition-Continuum Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling transition-continuum hypersonic flows poses significant challenges due to thermodynamic nonequilibrium and the associated breakdown of the continuum assumption. Standard continuum models such as the Navier-Stokes equations are inaccurate for these flows, and molecular models can be inefficient due to the large number of computational particles required at moderately high densities. We explore computational modeling of transition-continuum flows using a second-order constitutive theory that provides closures for the terms representing the molecular transport of momentum and energy. We optimize the second-order model parameters for one-dimensional viscous shocks using an adjoint-based optimization method, with the objective function comprising the primitive flow variables. Target data is obtained from moments of distribution functions obtained by solving the Boltzmann equation. We compare results using optimized second-order models, the unoptimized second-order model, and the first-order Navier-Stokes model for Mach numbers $M\in[1.1,10]$ and observe improvements to the shock profiles and shock thickness calculations. We validate the optimized models by comparing the predicted viscous stress and heat flux, which are not included in the objective function, to those obtained by integrating the distribution function. The close match to these moments indicates that the satisfactory performance of the optimized second-order models is consistent with the nonequilibrium flow physics.</description>

      <title>Single-fluid simulation of partially-ionized, non-ideal plasma facilitated by a tabulated equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a single-fluid approach for the simulation of partially-ionized plasmas (PIPs) which is designed to capture the non-ideal effects introduced by neutrals while remaining close in computational efficiency to single-fluid MHD. This is achieved using a model which treats the entire partially-ionized plasma as a single mixture, which renders internal ionization/recombination source terms unnecessary as both the charged and neutral species are part of the mixture's conservative system. Instead, the effects of ionization and the differing physics of the species are encapsulated as material properties of the mixture. Furthermore, the differing dynamics between the charged and neutral species is captured using a relative-velocity quantity, which impacts the bulk behavior of the mixture in a manner similar to the treatment of the ion-electron relative-velocity as current in MHD. Unlike fully-ionized plasmas, the species composition of a PIP changes rapidly with its thermodynamic state. This is captured through a look-up table referred to as the tabulated equation of state (TabEoS), which is constructed prior to runtime using empirical physicochemical databases and efficiently provides the ionization fraction and other material properties of the PIP specific to the thermodynamic state of each computational cell. Crucially, the use of TabEoS also allows our approach to self-consistently capture the non-linear feedback cycle between the PIP's macroscopic behavior and the microscopic physics of its internal particles, which is neglected in many fluid simulations of plasmas today.</description>

      <title>Degradation of performance in ICF implosions due to Rayleigh--Taylor instabilities: a Hamiltonian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rayleigh--Taylor instability (RTI) is an ubiquitous phenomenon that occurs in inertial-confinement-fusion (ICF) implosions and is recognized as an important limiting factor of ICF performance. To analytically understand the RTI dynamics and its impact on ICF capsule implosions, we develop a first-principle variational theory that describes an imploding spherical shell undergoing RTI. The model is based on a thin-shell approximation and includes the dynamical coupling between the imploding spherical shell and an adiabatically compressed fluid within its interior. Using a quasilinear analysis, we study the degradation trends of key ICF performance metrics (e.g., stagnation pressure, residual kinetic energy, and aerial density) as functions of initial RTI parameters (e.g., the initial amplitude and Legendre mode), as well as the 1D implosion characteristics (e.g., the convergence ratio). We compare analytical results from the theory against nonlinear results obtained by numerically integrating the governing equations of this reduced model. Our findings emphasize the need to incorporate polar flows in the calculation of residual kinetic energy and demonstrate that higher convergence ratios in ICF implosions lead to significantly greater degradation of key performance metrics.</description>

      <title>Machine learned reconstruction of tsunami dynamics from sparse observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the use of the Senseiver, a transformer neural network designed for sparse sensing applications, to estimate full-field surface height measurements of tsunami waves from sparse observations. The model is trained on a large ensemble of simulated data generated via a shallow water equations solver, which we show to be a faithful reproduction for the underlying dynamics by comparison to historical events. We train the model on a dataset consisting of 8 tsunami simulations whose epicenters correspond to historical USGS earthquake records, and where the model inputs are restricted to measurements obtained at actively deployed buoy locations. We test the Senseiver on a dataset consisting of 8 simulations not included in training, demonstrating its capability for extrapolation. The results show remarkable resolution of fine scale phase and amplitude features from the true field, provided that at least a few of the sensors have obtained a non-zero signal. Throughout, we discuss which forecasting techniques can be improved by this method, and suggest ways in which the flexibility of the architecture can be leveraged to incorporate arbitrary remote sensing data (eg. HF Radar and satellite measurements) as well as investigate optimal sensor placements.</description>

      <title>Dense Suspensions in Rotary Shear</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel unsteady shear protocol, which we name Rotary Shear (RS), where the flow and vorticity directions are continuously rotated around the velocity gradient direction by imposing two out-of-phase oscillatory shear (OS) in orthogonal directions. We perform numerical simulations of dense suspensions of rigid non-Brownian spherical particles at volume fractions ($\phi$) between 0.40 and 0.55 subject to this new RS protocol and compare to the classical OS protocol. We find that the suspension viscosity displays a similar non-monotonic response as the strain amplitude ($\gamma_0$) is increased: a minimum viscosity is found at an intermediate, volume-fraction dependent strain amplitude. However, the suspension dynamics is different in the new protocol. Unlike the OS protocol, suspensions under RS do not show self-adsorbing states at any $\gamma_0$ and do not undergo the reversible-irreversible transition: the stroboscropic particle dynamics are always diffusive, which we attribute to the fact that the RS protocol is irreversible. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce a reversible-RS (RRS) protocol, a combination of RS and OS, where we rotate the shear direction (as in RS) until it is instantaneously reversed (as in OS), and find the resulting rheology and dynamics to be closer to OS. Detailed microstructure analysis shows that both the OS and RRS protocols result in a contact-free, isotropic to an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure at the dynamically reversible-to-irreversible transition. The RS protocol does not render such a transition, and the dynamics remain diffusive with an in-contact, anisotropic microstructure for all strain amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Space-time model reduction in the frequency domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most model reduction methods are space-only in that they reduce the spatial dimension of the solution but not the temporal one. These methods integrate an encoding of the state of the nonlinear dynamical system forward in time. We propose a space-time method -- one that solves a system of algebraic equations for the encoding of the trajectory, i.e., the solution on a time interval $[0,T]$. The benefit of this approach is that with the same total number of degrees of freedom, a space-time encoding can leverage spatiotemporal correlations to represent the trajectory far more accurately than a space-only one. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, a spatial basis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that frequency, to represent the trajectory. These modes have a number of properties that make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction. We derive an algebraic system involving the SPOD coefficients that represent the solution, as well as the initial condition and the forcing. The online phase of the method consists of solving this system for the SPOD coefficients given the initial condition and forcing. We test the model on a Ginzburg-Landau system, a $1 + 1$ dimensional nonlinear PDE. We find that the proposed method is $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude more accurate than POD-Galerkin at the same number of modes and CPU time for all of our tests. In fact, the method is substantially more accurate even than the projection of the solution onto the POD modes, which is a lower bound for the error of any space-only Petrov-Galerkin method.</description>

Abstract: Prandtl's secondary flows of the second kind generated by laterally-varying roughness are studied using the linearised Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes approach proposed in Zampino et al (2022). The momentum equations are coupled to the Spalart-Allmaras model while the roughness is captured by adapting established strategies for homogeneous roughness to heterogeneous surfaces. Linearisation of the governing equations yields a framework that enables a rapid exploration of the parameter space associated with heterogeneous surfaces, in the limiting case of small spanwise variations of the roughness properties. Channel flow is considered, with longitudinal high and low roughness strips arranged symmetrically. By varying the strip width, it is found that linear mechanisms play a dominant role in determining the size and intensity of secondary flows. In this setting, secondary flows may be interpreted as the time-averaged output response of the turbulent mean flow subjected to a steady forcing produced by the wall heterogeneity. In fact, the linear model predicts that secondary flows are most intense when the strip width is about 0.7 times the half-channel height, in excellent agreement with available data. Furthermore, a unified framework to analyse combinations of heterogeneous roughness properties and laterally-varying topographies, common in applications, is discussed. Noting that the framework assumes small spanwise variations of the surface properties, two separate secondary-flow inducing source mechanisms are identified, i.e. the lateral variation of the virtual origin from which the turbulent structure develops and the lateral variation of the streamwise velocity slip, capturing the acceleration/deceleration perceived by the bulk flow over troughs and crests of non-planar topographies.</description>

      <title>A note on the amplitude modulation phenomenon in non-canonical wall-bounded flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The amplitude modulation phenomena, defined originally by Mathis et al. (J. Fluid Mech., 628, 311-337; 2009), corresponds to a unique non-linear interaction between Reynolds number ($Re_{\tau}$) dependent large-scale motions and $Re_{\tau}$-invariant inner-scale motions observed in canonical wall-bounded flows. While similar non-linear interactions have been quantified previously in non-canonical wall-bounded flows, linking them solely to amplitude modulation is questionable due to the fact that each non-canonical effect is associated with distinct variations in the energies of both the large and inner scaled motions. This study revisits analysis of non-linear triadic interactions, with consideration to various non-canonical effects, by analyzing published hot-wire datasets acquired in the large Melbourne wind tunnel. It is found that triadic interactions, across the entire turbulence scale hierarchy, may become statistically significant with increasing intensity of non-canonical effects such as wall roughness, pressure gradients, and spanwise or wall-normal forcing (when compared relative to their respective canonical baseline cases at matched $Re_{\tau}$). This stands in contrast to previous observations made in canonical flows, where only the interaction between inner scales and inertia-dominated large scales was considered dynamically significant for increasing $Re_{\tau}$. The implications of these findings are discussed for near-wall flow prediction models in non-canonical flows, which should take into account \emph{all} non-linear interactions coexisting in wall-bounded flows.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Conservative Radially Symmetric Fluid Simulations and Stellar Winds -- jf1uids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present jf1uids, a one-dimensional fluid solver that can, by virtue of a geometric formulation of the Euler equations, model radially symmetric fluid problems in a conservative manner, i.e., without losing mass or energy. For spherical problems, such as ideal supernova explosions or stellar wind-blown bubble expansions, simulating only along a radial dimension drastically reduces compute and memory demands compared to a full three-dimensional method. This simplification also alleviates constraints on backpropagation through the solver. Written in JAX, jf1uids is a GPU-compatible and fully differentiable simulator. We demonstrate the advantages of this differentiable physics simulator by retrieving the wind's parameters for an adiabatic stellar wind expansion from the final fluid state using gradient descent. As part of a larger "stellar winds, cosmic rays and machine learning" research track, jf1uids serves as a solid foundation to be extended with additional physics modules, foremost cosmic rays and a neural-net powered gas-cooling surrogate and improved by higher order and more accurate numerical schemes. All code is available under https://github.com/leo1200/jf1uids/.</description>

      <title>LES-FGM modelling of non-premixed auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen flames including preferential diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tabulated chemistry methods are a well-known strategy to efficiently store the flows thermochemical properties. In particular, the Flamelet-Generated Manifold (FGM) is a widely used technique that generates the database with a small number of control variables. In order to build such a manifold, these coordinates must be monotonic in space and time. However, the high diffusivity of hydrogen can prevent such requisite.
  To avoid the non-monotonicity of control variables (the progress variable, in particular), one practical workaround is to perform the tabulation on zero-dimensional (0D) reactors rather than on one-dimensional (1D) flamelets. Various works already implemented and tested such 0D-based manifold, but mainly in the context of spray engines, where most of the composition is lean and information past the flammability limit is not relevant. The present work aims at investigating, for the first time, the applicability of a tabulation based on homogeneous reactors to study auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen jets.
  It is shown that a combined use of homogeneous reactors at the lean side and an extrapolation with 1D flamelets on the richer side is required to capture both chemistry and diffusive effects accurately in pure hydrogen flames. Then, this manifold is coupled to Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) of three-dimensional turbulent mixing layers and evaluated against direct numerical simulation with detailed chemistry. Good agreement is found, in terms of both ignition delay and the following steady-state burning process. Further analyses are carried out on statistics and modelling. In particular, the sensitivity of the LES solution to filter width, turbulence-chemistry interaction and multidimensional flame effects is investigated to provide new relevant insights on modelling non-premixed auto-igniting turbulent hydrogen flames.</description>

Abstract: Energy transfer across scales is fundamental in fluid dynamics, linking large-scale flow motions to small-scale turbulent structures in engineering and natural environments. Triadic interactions among three wave components form complex networks across scales, challenging understanding and model reduction. We introduce Triadic Orthogonal Decomposition (TOD), a method that identifies coherent flow structures optimally capturing spectral momentum transfer, quantifies their coupling and energy exchange in an energy budget bispectrum, and reveals the regions where they interact. TOD distinguishes three components--a momentum recipient, donor, and catalyst--and recovers laws governing pairwise, six-triad, and global triad conservation. Applied to unsteady cylinder wake and wind turbine wake data, TOD reveals networks of triadic interactions with forward and backward energy transfer across frequencies and scales.</description>

Abstract: The behavior of non-spherical particles in a shear-flow is of significant practical and theoretical interest. These systems have been the object of numerous investigations since the pioneering work of Jeffery a century ago. His eponymous orbits describe the deterministic motion of an isolated, rod-like particle in a shear flow. Subsequently, the effect of adding noise was investigated. The theory has been applied to colloidal particles, macromolecules, anisometric granular particles and most recently to microswimmers, for example bacteria. We study the Jeffery orbits of elongated particles subject to noise using Langevin simulations and a Fokker-Planck equation. We extend the analytical solution for infinitely thin needles ($\beta=1$) obtained by Doi and Edwards to particles with arbitrary shape factor ($0\le \beta\le 1$) and validate the theory by comparing it with simulations. We examine the rotation of the particle around the vorticity axis and study the orientational order matrix. We use the latter to obtain scalar order parameters $s$ and $r$ describing nematic ordering and biaxiality from the orientational distribution function. The value of $s$ (nematic ordering) increases monotonically with increasing P\'eclet number, while $r$ (measure of biaxiality) displays a maximum value. From perturbation theory we obtain simple expressions that provide accurate descriptions at low noise (or large P\'eclet numbers). We also examine the orientational distribution in the v-grad v plane and in the perpendicular direction. Finally we present the solution of the Fokker-Planck equation for a strictly two-dimensional (2D) system. For the same noise amplitude the average rotation speed of the particle in 3D is larger than in 2D.</description>
