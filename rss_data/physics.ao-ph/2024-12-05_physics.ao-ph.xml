      <title>Coupling hotspots: distinguishing between positive and negative land-atmosphere interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex interactions between land surface and atmosphere is essential to improve weather and climate predictions. Various numerical experiments have suggested that regions of strong coupling strength (hotspots) are located in the transitional climate zones. However, atmospheric processes in these hotspots are found to have different responses to the perturbation of surface properties. Here we establish analytical relationships to identify key role of soil moisture variances in controlling the coupling hotspots. Using the most recent numerical experiments, we find different signs of feedback in two such hotspots, suggesting the coupling can either reinforce or attenuate persistent extreme climates. We further uncover new coupling hotspots in regions where precipitation is highly sensitive to soil moisture perturbation. Our results highlight the importance of both signs and magnitudes of land-atmosphere interactions over extensive regions, where the ecosystems and communities are particularly vulnerable to the extreme climate events.</description>

      <title>Characterization of local energy transfer in large-scale intermittent stratified geophysical flows via space filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies based on simulations of the Boussinesq equations indicate that stratified turbulent flows can develop large-scale intermittency in the velocity and temperature fields, as detected in the atmosphere and in the oceans. In particular, emerging powerful vertical drafts were found to generate local turbulence, proving necessary for stratified flows to dissipate the energy as efficiently as homogeneous isotropic turbulent flows. The existence of regions characterized by enhanced turbulence and dissipation, as observed, for instance, in the ocean, requires appropriate tools to assess how energy is transferred across the scales and at the same time locally in the physical space. After refining a classical space-filtering procedure, here we investigate the feedback of extreme vertical velocity drafts on energy transfer and exchanges in subdomains of simulations of stably stratified flows of geophysical interest. Our analysis shows that vertical drafts are indeed able to trigger upscale and downscale energy transfers, strengthening the coupling between kinetic and potential energies at certain scales, depending on the intensity of the local vertical velocity.</description>

      <title>Early-time small-scale structures in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the critical influence of small-scale flow structures (e.g., fronts, vortices, and waves) that immediately arise in hot-exoplanet atmosphere simulations initialized with a resting state. A hot, 1:1 spin-orbit synchronized Jupiter is used here as a clear example; but, the phenomenon is generic and important for any type of a hot synchronized planet -- gaseous, oceanic, or telluric. When the early-time structures are not captured in simulations (due to, e.g., poor resolution and/or too much dissipation), the flow behavior is markedly different at later times -- in an observationally significant way; for example, the flow at large-scale is smoother and much less dynamic. This results in the temperature field, and its corresponding thermal flux, to be incorrectly predicted in numerical simulations, even when the quantities are spatially averaged.</description>
