      <title>Control VAR: a counterfactual based approach to inference in macroeconomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of giving a causal interpretation to vector autoregressions (VARs). I show that under independence assumptions VARs can identify average treatment effects, average causal responses, or a mix of the two, depending on the distribution of the policy. But what about situations in which the economist cannot rely on independence assumptions? I propose an alternative method, defined as control-VAR, which uses control variables to estimate causal effects. Control-VAR can estimate average treatment effects on the treated for dummy policies or average causal responses over time for continuous policies.
  The advantages of control-based approaches are demonstrated by examining the impact of natural disasters on the US economy, using Germany as a control. Contrary to previous literature, the results indicate that natural disasters have a negative economic impact without any cyclical positive effect. These findings suggest that control-VARs provide a viable alternative to strict independence assumptions, offering more credible causal estimates and significant implications for policy design in response to natural disasters.</description>

      <title>Nearest Neighbor Matching as Least Squares Density Ratio Estimation and Riesz Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proves that Nearest Neighbor (NN) matching can be interpreted as an instance of Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning. Lin et al. (2023) shows that NN matching is an instance of density-ratio estimation with their new density-ratio estimator. Chernozhukov et al. (2024) develops Riesz regression for automatic debiased machine learning, which directly estimates the Riesz representer (or equivalently, the bias-correction term) by minimizing the mean squared error. In this study, we first prove that the density-ratio estimation method proposed in Lin et al. (2023) is essentially equivalent to Least-Squares Importance Fitting (LSIF) proposed in Kanamori et al. (2009) for direct density-ratio estimation. Furthermore, we derive Riesz regression using the LSIF framework. Based on these results, we derive NN matching from Riesz regression. This study is based on our work Kato (2025a) and Kato (2025b).</description>

      <title>Panel data models with randomly generated groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a structural framework for modeling and inferring unobserved heterogeneity in dynamic panel-data models. Unlike methods treating clustering as a descriptive device, we model heterogeneity as arising from a latent clustering mechanism, where the number of clusters is unknown and estimated. Building on the mixture of finite mixtures (MFM) approach, our method avoids the clustering inconsistency issues of Dirichlet process mixtures and provides an interpretable representation of the population clustering structure. We extend the Telescoping Sampler of Fruhwirth-Schnatter et al. (2021) to dynamic panels with covariates, yielding an efficient MCMC algorithm that delivers full Bayesian inference and credible sets. We show that asymptotically the posterior distribution of the mixing measure contracts around the truth at parametric rates in Wasserstein distance, ensuring recovery of clustering and structural parameters. Simulations demonstrate strong finite-sample performance. Finally, an application to the income-democracy relationship reveals latent heterogeneity only when controlling for additional covariates.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Assisted Comparison of Regression Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of comparing regression functions, a fundamental question in statistical inference with broad relevance to modern applications such as data integration, transfer learning, and causal inference. Existing approaches typically rely on smoothing techniques and are thus hindered by the curse of dimensionality. We propose a generalized notion of kernel-based conditional mean dependence that provides a new characterization of the null hypothesis of equal regression functions. Building on this reformulation, we develop two novel tests that leverage modern machine learning methods for flexible estimation. We establish the asymptotic properties of the test statistics, which hold under both fixed- and high-dimensional regimes. Unlike existing methods that often require restrictive distributional assumptions, our framework only imposes mild moment conditions. The efficacy of the proposed tests is demonstrated through extensive numerical studies.</description>

      <title>Conditional Rank-Rank Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06387v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rank-rank regression is commonly employed in economic research as a way of capturing the relationship between two economic variables. The slope of this regression is the Spearman rank correlation, a classical measure of association. However, in many applications it is common practice to include covariates to account for differences in association levels between groups as defined by the values of these covariates. This is either done by including the covariates or by modeling the residuals obtained after partialing out the impact of the covariates. In each of these instances the resulting rank-rank regression coefficients can be difficult to interpret. We propose the conditional rank-rank regression, which uses conditional ranks instead of unconditional ranks, to measure average within-group persistence. The coefficient of this new regression corresponds to the average Spearman rank correlation conditional on the covariates, a natural summary measure of within-group association. We develop a flexible estimation approach using distribution regression and establish a theoretical framework for large sample inference. An empirical study on intergenerational income mobility in Switzerland demonstrates the advantages of this approach. The study reveals stronger intergenerational persistence between fathers and sons compared to fathers and daughters, with the within-group persistence explaining 62% of the overall income persistence for sons and 52% for daughters. Smaller families and those with highly educated fathers exhibit greater persistence in economic status.</description>

      <title>Lee Bounds with a Continuous Treatment in Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04312v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study causal inference in sample selection models where a continuous or multivalued treatment affects both outcome and their observability (eg., employment or survey response). We generalized the widely used Lee (2009)'s bounds for binary treatment effects. Our key innovation is a sufficient treatment value assumption that imposes weak restrictions on selection heterogeneity and is implicit in separable threshold-crossing models, including monotone effects on selection. Our double debiased machine learning estimator enables nonparametric and high-dimensional methods, using covariates to tighten the bounds and capture heterogeneity. Applications to Job Corps and Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) program evaluations reinforce prior findings under weaker assumptions.</description>

      <title>Program Evaluation with Remotely Sensed Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economists often estimate treatment effects in experiments using remotely sensed variables (RSVs), e.g., satellite images or mobile phone activity, in place of directly measured economic outcomes. A common practice is to use an observational sample to train a predictor of the economic outcome from the RSV, and then use these predictions as the outcomes in the experiment. We show that this method is biased whenever the RSV is a post-outcome variable, meaning that variation in the economic outcome causes variation in the RSV. For example, changes in poverty or environmental quality cause changes in satellite images, but not vice versa. As our main result, we nonparametrically identify the treatment effect by formalizing the intuition underlying common practice: the conditional distribution of the RSV given the outcome and treatment is stable across samples. Our identifying formula reveals that efficient inference requires predictions of three quantities from the RSV -- the outcome, treatment, and sample indicator -- whereas common practice only predicts the outcome. Valid inference does not require any rate conditions on RSV predictions, justifying the use of complex deep learning algorithms with unknown statistical properties. We reanalyze the effect of an anti-poverty program in India using satellite images.</description>

      <title>Untestability of Average Slutsky Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Slutsky symmetry and negative semidefiniteness are necessary and sufficient conditions for the rationality of demand functions. While the empirical implications of Slutsky negative semidefiniteness in repeated cross-sectional demand data are well understood, the empirical content of Slutsky symmetry remains largely unexplored. This paper takes an important first step toward addressing this gap. We show that the average Slutsky matrix is not identified and that its identified set always contains a symmetric matrix, implying that the symmetry of the average Slutsky matrix is untestable and that individual Slutsky symmetry cannot be tested through the average. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that, by imposing bounds on the income elasticity of demand, Slutsky symmetry implies a set of functional inequality constraints that are testable.</description>

      <title>Cluster-Randomized Trials with Cross-Cluster Interference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18836v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The literature on cluster-randomized trials typically allows for interference within but not across clusters. This may be implausible when units are irregularly distributed across space without well-separated communities, as clusters in such cases may not align with significant geographic, social, or economic divisions. This paper develops methods for reducing bias due to cross-cluster interference. We first propose an estimation strategy that excludes units not surrounded by clusters assigned to the same treatment arm. We show that this substantially reduces bias relative to conventional difference-in-means estimators without significant cost to variance. Second, we formally establish a bias-variance trade-off in the choice of clusters: constructing fewer, larger clusters reduces bias due to interference but increases variance. We provide a rule for choosing the number of clusters to balance the asymptotic orders of the bias and variance of our estimator. Finally, we consider unsupervised learning for cluster construction and provide theoretical guarantees for $k$-medoids.</description>

      <title>Filtering amplitude dependence of correlation dynamics in complex systems: application to the cryptocurrency market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the cryptocurrency market dynamics, this study presents a general methodology for analyzing evolving correlation structures in complex systems using the $q$-dependent detrended cross-correlation coefficient \rho(q,s). By extending traditional metrics, this approach captures correlations at varying fluctuation amplitudes and time scales. The method employs $q$-dependent minimum spanning trees ($q$MSTs) to visualize evolving network structures. Using minute-by-minute exchange rate data for 140 cryptocurrencies on Binance (Jan 2021-Oct 2024), a rolling window analysis reveals significant shifts in $q$MSTs, notably around April 2022 during the Terra/Luna crash. Initially centralized around Bitcoin (BTC), the network later decentralized, with Ethereum (ETH) and others gaining prominence. Spectral analysis confirms BTC's declining dominance and increased diversification among assets. A key finding is that medium-scale fluctuations exhibit stronger correlations than large-scale ones, with $q$MSTs based on the latter being more decentralized. Properly exploiting such facts may offer the possibility of a more flexible optimal portfolio construction. Distance metrics highlight that major disruptions amplify correlation differences, leading to fully decentralized structures during crashes. These results demonstrate $q$MSTs' effectiveness in uncovering fluctuation-dependent correlations, with potential applications beyond finance, including biology, social and other complex systems.</description>
