      <title>Restricted Marstrand's projection theorem for general families of linear subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a refinement of Marstrand's projection theorem; more specifically, let $\Pi_t, t\in[0,1]$ be a family of $m$ dimensional subspaces of the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $P_t:\mathbb{R}^4\mapsto \Pi_t$ be the orthogonal projections onto $\Pi_t$. We hope to determine the conditions on $\Pi_t$ under which, for any Borel $A\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $\dim_H P_t(A)=\min(m,\dim_H A)$ holds for almost every $t$. We propose a conjectured condition on $\Pi_t$ and provide partial progress towards its resolution. We first establish a version of the polynomial Wolff axiom, and then apply polynomial partitioning to derive a version of the $L^p$ Kakeya inequality. Finally, we use a discretization procedure to obtain the desired bound.</description>

      <title>Biorthogonal polynomials related to quantum transport theory of disordered wires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03720v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Plancherel-Rotach type asymptotics of the biorthogonal polynomials associated to the biorthogonal ensemble with the joint probability density function \begin{equation*}
  \frac{1}{C} \prod_{1 \leq i &lt; j \leq n} (\lambda_j -\lambda_i)(f(\lambda_j) - f(\lambda_i)) \prod^n_{j = 1} W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(\lambda_j) d\lambda_j, \end{equation*} where \begin{align*} f(x) = {}&amp; \sinh^2(\sqrt{x}), &amp; W^{(n)}_{\alpha}(x) = {}&amp; x^{\alpha} h(x) e^{-nV(x)}. \end{align*} In the special case that the potential function $V$ is linear, this biorthogonal ensemble arises in the quantum transport theory of disordered wires. We analyze the asymptotic problem via $2$-component vector-valued Riemann-Hilbert problems, and solve it under the one-cut regular with a hard edge condition. We use the asymptotics of biorthogonal polynomials to establish sine universality for the correlation kernel in the bulk, and provide a central limit theorem with a specific variance for holomorphic linear statistics.
  As an application of our theories, we establish the Ohm's law (1.12) and universal conductance fluctuation (1.13) for the disordered wire model, thereby rigorously confirming predictions from experimental physics [Washburn-Webb86].</description>

      <title>Mahler's problem and Turyn polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mahler's problem asks for the largest possible value of the Mahler measure, normalized by the $L_2$ norm, of a polynomial with $\pm1$ coefficients and large degree. We establish a new record value in this problem exceeding $0.95$ by analyzing certain Turyn polynomials, which are defined by cyclically shifting the coefficients of a Fekete polynomial by a prescribed amount. It was recently established that the distribution of values over the unit circle of Fekete polynomials of large degree is effectively modeled by a particular random point process. We extend this analysis to the Turyn polynomials, and determine expressions for the asymptotic normalized Mahler measure of these polynomials, as well as for their normalized $L_q$ norms. We also describe a number of calculations on the corresponding random processes, which indicate that the Turyn polynomials where the shift is approximately $1/4$ of the length have Mahler measure exceeding $95\%$ of their $L_2$ norm. Further, we show that these asymptotic values are not disturbed by a small change to make polynomials having entirely $\pm1$ coefficients, which establishes the result on Mahler's problem. We also estimate that the limiting value of the normalized $L_1$ norm of these polynomials exceeds $0.977$, in connection with a question of Newman.</description>

      <title>Dynamical localization and eigenvalue asymptotics: long-range hopping lattice operators with electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove power-law dynamical localization for polynomial long-range hopping lattice operators with uniform electric field under any bounded perturbation. Actually, we introduce new arguments in the study of dynamical localization for long-range models with unbounded potentials, involving the Min-Max Principle and a notion of Power-Law ULE. Unlike existing results in the literature, our approach does not rely on KAM techniques or on Green's function estimates, but rather on the asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and the potential. It is worth underlining that our general results can be applied to other models, such as Maryland-type potentials.</description>
