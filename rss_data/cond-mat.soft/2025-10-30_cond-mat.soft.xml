      <title>Melting line of silicon modelled with a machine-learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study we investigate the phase diagram of silicon within the framework of SNAP machine learning potential model. We show that the melting line of diamond phase of silicon is a linear function of pressure, which is in good agreement with experimental data. At the same time the melting temperature is strongly underestimated. Also, this model fails to predict the high pressure phases of silicon.</description>

      <title>Numerical Investigation of Single-Core to Split-Core Transitions in Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze single-core and split-core defect structures in nematic liquid crystals within the Landau-de Gennes framework by studying minimizers of the associated energy functional. A bifurcation occurs at a critical temperature threshold, below which both split-core and single-core configurations are solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equation, with the split-core defect possessing lower energy. Above the threshold, the split-core configuration vanishes, leaving the single-core defect as the only stable solution. We analyze the dependence of such temperature threshold on the domain size and characterize the nature of the transition between the two defect types. We carry out a quantitative study of defect core sizes as functions of temperature and domain size for both single and split core defects.</description>

      <title>Large electrocaloric strength in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals with a tuneable operational temperature range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrocaloric (EC) effect offers a promising energy-efficient and clean cooling technology. We present the first direct measurements of EC temperature change in a new family of EC fluids, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals (FNLCs), demonstrating in two such materials temperature jumps of $|{\Delta}T_j|$ ~ 0.2 K for field changes as low as ${\Delta}E$ ~ 0.1 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$. Indirect measurements of adiabatic temperature change $|{\Delta}T|$ confirm that these direct measurements are an underestimate and that ${\Delta}E$ = 2 $V {\mu}m^{-1}$ can induce up to $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1.6 K, yielding EC strengths $|{\Delta}T/{\Delta}E|$ up to 100% higher than incumbent materials. For temperature spans of 5-10 K, we predict a coefficient of performance of ~21-40. We find $|{\Delta}T|$ ~ 1 K for &gt;100 FNLCs that collectively span all temperatures between $0{^\circ}$C and $100{^\circ}$C. This, together with the new device concepts conceivable with fluid EC materials, offers huge potential for cooling applications.</description>

      <title>Active chain spirograph: Dynamic patterns formed in extensible chains due to follower activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Follower activity results in a large variety of conformational and dynamical states in active chains and filaments. These states are formed due to the coupling between chain geometry and the local activity. We study the origin and emergence of such patterns in noiseless, flexible active chains. In the overdamped limit, we observed a range of dynamical steady states for different chain lengths ($N$). The steady-state planar trajectories of the centre-of-mass of the chain include circles, periodic waves, and quasiperiodic, bound trajectories resembling spirographic patterns. In addition, out-of-plane initial configuration also leads to the formation of 3D structures, including globular and supercoiled helical structures. For the shortest chain with three segments $(N=3)$, the chain always moves in a circular trajectory. Such circular trajectories are also observed in the limit of large chain lengths $(N \gg 1)$. We analytically study the dynamical patterns in these two limiting cases, which show quantitative and qualitative matches with numerical simulations. Our analytical study also provides an estimate of the limiting $N$ where the large chain length behaviour is expected. These analyses reveal the existence of such intricately periodic patterns in active chains, arising due to the follower activity.</description>

      <title>Enzyme Active Bath Affects Protein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how an active bath of enzymes influences the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of a non-interacting condensing protein. The enzyme we choose to use as the active driver is urease, an enzyme that has been shown by several groups to exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of its substrate. The non-interacting LLPS protein is ubiquilin-2, a protein that condenses with increasing temperature and salt. Using a microfluidic device with semipermeable membranes, we create a chemostatic environment to maintain the substrate content to feed the enzymatic bath and remove the products of the chemical reaction. Thus, we isolate the physical enhanced fluctuations from the chemical changes of the enzyme activity. We also compare the results to controls without activity or in the presence of the products of the reaction. We find that the active bath is able to enhance droplet size, density, and concentration, implying that more ubiquilin-2 is in condensed form. This result is consistent with an interpretation that the active bath acts as an effective temperature. Simulations provide an underlying interpretation for our experimental results. Together, these findings provide the first demonstration that physical enzymatic activity can act as an effective temperature to modify LLPS behavior, with implications for intracellular organization in the enzymatically active cellular environment.</description>

      <title>Capillarity Reveals the Role of Capsid Geometry in HIV Nuclear Translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The protective capsid encasing the genetic material of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been shown to traverse the nuclear pore complex (NPC) intact, despite exceeding the passive diffusion threshold by over three orders of magnitude. This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid surface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated, condensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of wetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and diffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical underpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key phenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from asymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid penetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to changes in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous) rotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to depend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's characteristic capsid shape.</description>

      <title>Understanding the swelling behavior of P(DMAA-co-MABP) copolymer in paper-based actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As interest in sustainable materials grows, paper is being reimagined as a multifunctional substrate with significant potential for future technologies for innovative, environmentally friendly solutions. This study investigates the swelling behavior and environmental responsiveness of a copolymer, poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide-co-4-methacryloyloxybenzophenone) (P(DMAA-co-MABP)), when applied to cellulosic paper for use in humidity-sensitive actuators. The copolymer's swelling behavior was characterized using dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) and in-situ atomic force microscopy (AFM). DVS measurements demonstrated that the polymer coating significantly enhances the hygroscopic properties of the paper, while AFM revealed the polymer's fast response to relative humidity (RH) changes, shown by immediate height adjustments, increased adhesion, and decreased stiffness at higher RH levels.Studies on polymer-modified paper-based bilayer actuators demonstrate that incorporating the hydrophilic P(DMAA-co-MABP) results in actuation in response to relative humidity variations between 10% and 90% RH. From these findings, two models were proposed to assess key mechanisms in the swelling behavior: the correlation between the heterogeneity in crosslinking and the polymer swelling behavior, and the correlation between polymer-paper interactions and the hygro-responsive bending behavior. Additionally, thermal analysis was performed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), providing a comprehensive profile of the copolymer's behavior.</description>

      <title>Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12956v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</description>

      <title>Metamaterials that learn to change shape</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning to change shape is a fundamental strategy of adaptation and evolution of living organisms, from bacteria and cells to tissues and animals. Human-made materials can also exhibit advanced shape morphing capabilities, but lack the ability to learn. Here, we build metamaterials that can learn complex shape-changing responses using a contrastive learning scheme. By being shown examples of the target shape changes, our metamaterials are able to learn those shape changes by progressively updating internal learning degrees of freedom -- the local stiffnesses. Unlike traditional materials that are designed once and for all, our metamaterials have the ability to forget and learn new shape changes in sequence, to learn multiple shape changes that break reciprocity, and to learn multistable shape changes, which in turn allows them to perform reflex gripping actions and locomotion. Our findings establish metamaterials as an exciting platform for physical learning, which in turn opens avenues for the use of physical learning to design adaptive materials and robots.</description>

      <title>Rheological response of soft Solid/Liquid Composites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion or fracture resistance. In dispersions, the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials. In conjugation with superposition methods, they allow to better capture the behavior of materials of complex rheology. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition in the continuous-phase-dominated region. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, independently of the frequency, whereas the elastic response is almost unchanged.</description>

      <title>Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07050v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent collective motion is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. Here, we report a flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the global polar order are excluded volume repulsions and long-ranged repulsive torques. This mechanism requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically respond to chemical gradients, or equivalently, pair colloids sliding together a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating away from each other. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. Furthermore, liquid flocks are observed for a range of chemo-attractive inter-particle forces. Various properties of these two distinct flocking phases are contrasted and discussed. We complement these results with stability analysis of a hydrodynamic model, which admits the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state observed in particle-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Cooperative ligand-mediated transitions in simple macromolecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biology, ligand mediated transitions (LMT), where the binding of a molecular ligand onto the binding site of a receptor molecule leads to a well-defined change in the conformation of the receptor, are often referred to as 'the second secret of life'. Sharp, cooperative transitions arise in many biological cases, while examples of synthetic cooperative systems are rare. This is because well-defined conformational states are hard to 'program' into a molecular design. Here, we impose an external constraint in the form of two immiscible liquids that effectively define and limit the available conformational states of two different synthetic and relatively simple macromolecules. We show that the mechanism of the observed cooperative transitions with ligand concentration is the coupling of ligand binding and conformation, similar to more complex biological systems. The systems studied are: (1) Hydrophobic polyelectrolytes (HPE), which are (bio) polymers that consist of hydrophobic as well as ionizable (proton and hydroxyl ligand-binding) functional groups. (2) Oligomeric metal chelators (OMC), which are oligomers composed of metal ion chelating repeating groups that are able to bind metal ions (considered as the 'ligands'), resulting in gel-like networks of oligomers crosslinked by coordinated metal ions. We find that in HPE, interactions between ligands and individual macromolecules explain the observed cooperative transitions. For OMC, coordinated bonds significantly enhance the degree of cooperativity, compared to HPE.</description>

      <title>A physics-informed neural network for modeling fracture without gradient damage: formulation, application, and assessment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate computational modeling of damage and fracture remains a central challenge in solid mechanics. The finite element method (FEM) is widely used for numerical modeling of fracture problems; however, classical damage models without gradient regularization yield mesh-dependent and usually inaccurate predictions. The use of gradient damage with FEM improves numerical robustness but introduces significant mathematical and numerical implementation complexities. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can encode the governing partial differential equations, boundary conditions, and constitutive models into the loss functions, offering a new method for fracture modeling. Prior applications of PINNs have been limited to small-strain problems and have incorporated gradient damage formulation without a critical evaluation of its necessity. Since PINNs in their basic form are meshless, this work presents a PINN framework for modeling fracture in elastomers undergoing large deformation without the gradient damage formulation. The PINN implementation here does not require training data and utilizes the collocation method to formulate physics-informed loss functions. We have validated the PINN's predictions for various defect configurations using benchmark solutions obtained from FEM with gradient damage formulation. The crack paths obtained using the PINN are approximately insensitive to the collocation point distribution. This study offers new insights into the feasibility of using PINNs without gradient damage and suggests a simplified and efficient computational modeling strategy for fracture problems. The PINN's performance has been evaluated through systematic variations in key neural network parameters to provide an assessment and guidance for future applications. The results motivate the extension of PINN-based approaches to a broader class of materials and damage models in mechanics.</description>

      <title>Light-scattering reconstruction of transparent shapes using neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02970v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of the 3D deformations of slender fibres and thin sheets in flow, is a key experimental challenge in the study of particle-laden flows. We propose a high-resolution, single-camera method to visualise non-intrusively the shape of a transparent crumpled sheet, as it translates, rotates and deforms. We perform periodic scans of the crumpled shape by illuminating it with a sequence of stacked light sheets at a rate much faster than its deformation and image the scattered light signal in a plane near-orthogonal to the plane of lighting. Processing of the data using a pinhole camera model yields a noisy spatio-temporal dataset of the strongly deformed time-evolving surface of the sheet, which we reconstruct in 3D using a neural autoencoder. We validate the robustness of the shape reconstruction algorithm to noise using synthetic data sets, and demonstrate the accurate reconstruction of laboratory sedimentation experiments with elastic disks. We find that the inclusion of isometricity-enforcing penalties into the cost function of the autoencoder enables us to robustly reconstruct highly folded shapes, where different regions of the sheet overlap.</description>

Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Growth Kinetics of Model Biomolecular Condensates Under Passive and Active Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16398</link>

Abstract: Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistent with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.</description>
