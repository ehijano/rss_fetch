      <title>Nonlinear Dielectric Decrement of Electrolyte Solutions: an Effective Medium Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypothesis. The dielectric constant of an electrolyte solution, which determines electrostatic interactions between colloids and interfaces, depends nonlinearly on the salinity and also on the type of salt. The linear decrement at dilute solutions is due to the reduced polarizability in the hydration shell around an ion. However, the full hydration volume cannot explain the experimental solubility, which indicates the hydration volume should decrease at high salinity. Volume reduction of the hydration shell is supposed to weaken dielectric decrement and thus should be relevant to the nonlinear decrement. Simulations. According to the effective medium theory for the permittivity of heterogeneous media, we derive an equation which relates the dielectric constant with the dielectric cavities created by the hydrated cations and anions, and the effect of partial dehydration at high salinity is taken into account. Findings. Analysis of experiments on monovalent electrolytes suggests that weakened dielectric decrement at high salinity originates primarily from the partial dehydration. Furthermore, the onset volume fraction of the partial dehydration is found to be salt-specific, and is correlated with the solvation free energy. Our results suggest that while the reduced polarizability of the hydration shell determines the linear dielectric decrement at low salinity, ion-specific tendency of dehydration is responsible for nonlinear dielectric decrement at high salinity.</description>

      <title>Re-experiment Smart: a Novel Method to Enhance Data-driven Prediction of Mechanical Properties of Epoxy Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of polymer material properties through data-driven approaches greatly accelerates novel material development by reducing redundant experiments and trial-and-error processes. However, inevitable outliers in empirical measurements can severely skew machine learning results, leading to erroneous prediction models and suboptimal material designs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach to enhance dataset quality efficiently by integrating multi-algorithm outlier detection with selective re-experimentation of unreliable outlier cases. To validate the empirical effectiveness of the approach, we systematically construct a new dataset containing 701 measurements of three key mechanical properties: glass transition temperature ($T_g$), tan $\delta$ peak, and crosslinking density ($v_{c}$). To demonstrate its general applicability, we report the performance improvements across multiple machine learning models, including Elastic Net, SVR, Random Forest, and TPOT, to predict the three key properties. Our method reliably reduces prediction error (RMSE) and significantly improves accuracy with minimal additional experimental work, requiring only about 5% of the dataset to be re-measured.These findings highlight the importance of data quality enhancement in achieving reliable machine learning applications in polymer science and present a scalable strategy for improving predictive reliability in materials science.</description>

      <title>Cell-Scale Dynamic Modeling of Membrane Interactions with Arbitrarily Shaped Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling membrane interactions with arbitrarily shaped colloidal particles, such as environmental micro- and nanoplastics, at the cell scale remains particularly challenging, owing to the complexity of particle geometries and the need to resolve fully coupled translational and rotational dynamics. Here, we present a force-based computational framework capable of capturing dynamic interactions between deformable lipid vesicles and rigid particles of irregular shapes. Both vesicle and particle surfaces are represented using triangulated meshes, and Langevin dynamics resolves membrane deformation alongside rigid-body particle motion. Adhesive interactions between the particle and membrane surfaces are modeled using two numerical schemes: a vertex-to-vertex mapping and a vertex-to-surface projection. The latter yields more accurate wrapping energetics, as demonstrated by benchmark comparisons against ideal spheres. The dynamic simulations reveal that lower particle-to-vesicle mass ratios facilitate frequent particle reorientation and complete membrane wrapping, while higher mass ratios limit orientation changes and stabilize partial wrapping. To illustrate the framework's versatility, we simulate interactions involving cubical, rod-like, bowl-shaped, and tetrahedral particles with spherical, cigar-shaped, or biconcave vesicles. This generalizable modeling approach enables predictive, cell-scale studies of membrane-particle interactions across a wide range of geometries, with applications in environmental biophysics and nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Sequential binding-unbinding based specific interactions highlight exchange dynamics and size distribution of condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms of formation of organelles and biomolecular condensates via liquid-liquid phase separation is a topic of great interest. It is reasonable to assume that the formation of protein-specific condensates inside a crowded, multicomponent cellular environment requires specific protein-protein interactions with lifetimes longer than non-specific protein-protein interactions. These longer-lived, specific interactions can arise through complex protein binding and unbinding pathways. In this work, we investigate single-step and sequential multi-step mechanisms for protein binding-unbinding interactions and model the lifetimes of such interactions in a heuristic manner. We show that while similar average interaction lifetimes can be achieved when binding-unbinding follows a single-step or a sequential multi-step process, the two processes result in two distinct lifetime distributions: exponential and truncated power-law, respectively. We then combine this model with Brownian dynamics simulations to elucidate the impact of these distinct lifetime distributions on condensate dynamics. Our model qualitatively captures important features of condensates, such as their fluidic nature, aging in protein interactions and its impact on the exchange dynamics, and the size distribution of condensates. In a nutshell, our model unravels how specificity in protein binding-unbinding interaction pathways, resulting in unique interaction lifetime distributions, is a key factor shaping the physical properties of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Emergent rigidity percolation of five-fold aggregates enables controllable glass properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic glasses possess outstanding mechanical and physical properties, making them promising candidates for advanced structural and functional applications; however, the lack of understanding and control over their glass transition and solidification processes remains a significant barrier to practical design. The glass transition from liquid to amorphous solid has remained an open problem in physics despite many theories and recent advances in computational efforts. The question of identifying a clear and well-defined diverging length scale accompanying the glass transition has remained unanswered, as has the nature of the transition and, indeed, the presence of a transition at all, as opposed to a mere dynamical crossover. Here we answer these questions using numerical results and theoretical analysis showing that, in atomic (metallic) glass formers, the glass transition coincides with, and is caused by, a continuous rigidity percolation transition from a liquid-like to a solid-like material. The transition occurs as five-fold symmetric atomic clusters progressively aggregate, forming a system-spanning rigid network that marks the onset of mechanical stability. This percolation-driven rigidity growth is accompanied by a sharp increase in the shear modulus G', indicating the emergence of macroscopic solid-like behavior. Beyond this point, which coincides with the Maxwell isostatic point of the percolating structure, dynamical arrest or "freezing-in" prevents further evolution. The long-sought diverging length scale is thus identified as the percolation-driven growth of rigid five-fold clusters, providing a direct link between local structural motifs and macroscopic mechanical properties at the glass transition. These insights offer practical routes to rationally engineer metallic glasses with targeted mechanical stiffness, hardness, and toughness.</description>

      <title>Inertia-driven propulsion of asymmetric spinner-dimers at moderate Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the translational motion of rotating colloidal systems at moderate Reynolds numbers (Re), focusing on particle dimers in snowman-like configurations under three scenarios: (i) two co-rotating spheres driven by an external field, (ii) two counter-rotating spheres driven by an internal torque as a swimmer, and (iii) a single rotating spinner with a passive sphere for cargo delivery, using hydrodynamic simulations. In all the three cases, the particles are bound together hydrodynamically, and the purely rotational motion of the spinners produces a net propulsion of the dimers along the axis of rotation due to a symmetry breaking. We demonstrate tunable dynamics, where the propulsion direction of the co-rotating dimer can be reversed by tuning the aspect ratio and Reynolds number, as well as cargo transport where a dimer consisting of a single spinner and a passive cargo particle can have a sustained locomotion due to broken head-to-tail symmetry of the overall flow fields. These findings highlight the critical role of inertia in creating locomotion from rotational motion and offer new avenues for controlling and optimizing translational motion in colloidal assemblies through rotational degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Subdiffusion from competition between multi-exponential friction memory and energy barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subdiffusion is a hallmark of complex systems, ranging from protein folding to transport in viscoelastic media. However, despite its pervasiveness, the mechanistic origins of subdiffusion remain contested. Here, we analyze both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics, in the presence and absence of energy barriers, in order to disentangle the distinct contributions of memory-dependent friction and energy barriers to the emergence of subdiffusive behavior. Focusing on the mean squared displacement (MSD), we develop an analytical framework that connects subdiffusion to multiscale memory effects in the generalized Langevin equation (GLE), and derive the subdiffusive scaling behavior of the MSD for systems governed by multi-exponential memory kernels. We identify persistence and relaxation timescales that delineate dynamical regimes in which subdiffusion arises from either memory or energy barrier effects. By comparing analytical predictions with simulations, we confirm that memory dominates the overdamped dynamics for barrier heights up to approximately $2\,k_BT$, a regime recently shown to be relevant for protein folding. Overall, our results advance the theoretical understanding of anomalous diffusion and provide practical tools that are broadly applicable to fields as diverse as molecular biophysics, polymer physics, and active matter systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Bohr and van Leeuwen guarantees that a classical charged system cannot have a magnetization in thermal equilibrium. Quantum mechanically, however, a diamagnetic response is obtained. In contrast, we show here that a classical charged active system, consisting of a motile particle confined to the surface of a sphere, has a nonzero magnetization and a paramagnetic response. We numerically sample Langevin trajectories of this system and compare with limiting analytical solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, at small and large temperatures, to find excellent agreement in the magnetic response. Our Letter suggests experimental routes to controlling and extracting work from charged active matter.</description>

      <title>Analysis of in-vivo skin anisotropy using elastic wave measurements and Bayesian modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In vivo skin exhibits viscoelastic, hyper-elastic and non-linear characteristics. It is under a constant non-equibiaxial tension in its natural configuration and is reinforced with oriented collagen fibers, giving rise to anisotropic behaviour. Understanding the complex mechanical behaviour of skin has relevance across many sectors including pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and surgery. However, there is a dearth of quality data characterizing human skin anisotropy in vivo. The available data is usually confined to limited population groups and/or limited angular resolution. Here, we use elastic waves travelling through the skin to obtain measurements from 78 volunteers from 3 to 93 years old. Using a Bayesian framework, we analyse the effect that age, gender and level of skin tension have on the skin anisotropy and stiffness. First, we propose a new measurement of anisotropy based on the eccentricity of angular data and conclude that it is a more robust measurement compared to the classic ``anisotropic ratio". We then find that in vivo skin anisotropy increases logarithmically with age, while the skin stiffness increases linearly along the direction of Langer Lines. We also conclude that gender does not significantly affect the skin anisotropy level, but does affect the overall stiffness, with males having stiffer skin on average. Finally, we find that skin tension significantly affects both the anisotropy and stiffness measurements, indicating that elastic wave measurements have promising applications in determining in vivo skin tension. In contrast to earlier studies, these results represent a comprehensive assessment of the variation of skin anisotropy with age and gender using a sizeable dataset and robust modern statistical analysis. This data has implications for the planning of surgical procedures and the adoption of universal cosmetic surgery practices for young or elderly patients.</description>

      <title>Steady state and relaxation dynamics of run and tumble particles in contact with a heat bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation dynamics of a run and tumble particle in a one-dimensional piecewise linear potential $U(x)=b|x|$, from delta-function initial conditions at $x=0$ to steady state. In addition to experiencing active telegraphic noise, the particle is in contact with a heat bath at temperature $T$ that applies white thermal noise. We find that the position distribution of the RTP is described by a sum of two distributions ("modes"), each of which of the form $P(x,t\to\infty)\sim e^{-\lambda_i|x|}$ ($i=1,2$) at steady state. The two modes are dynamically coupled: At very short times ($t\to 0$), each mode stores half of the probability, and exhibits thermal diffusive spreading with a Gaussian profile. With progressing time and evolution toward steady state, the partition of probability between the modes becomes increasingly uneven and, depending on the model parameters, the mode with the smaller value of $\lambda_i$ may carry an overwhelming majority of the probability. Moreover, we identify that the characteristic relaxation time of each mode is $\tau_i=(\lambda_i^2T)^{-1}$, which implies that the minority mode also relaxes much faster than the dominant one. A more detailed analysis reveals that $\tau_i$ is characteristic of the mode relaxation only close to the origin at the core of the distribution, while further away it increases linearly with $|x|$ as if a relaxation front is propagating at constant speed $v_i^*=2\sqrt{T/\tau_i}$ in the system. The rate of non-equilibrium entropy production can be related to the two-mode splitting of the probability distribution and be expressed in terms of their correlation-lengths $\lambda_i$ and their contributions to the steady state distribution.</description>

      <title>Enhanced zeta potentials caused by surface ion mobilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.</description>

      <title>Poisson-Nernst-Planck charging dynamics of an electric double layer capacitor: symmetric and asymmetric binary electrolytes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.07859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A parallel plate capacitor containing an electrolytic solution is the simplest model of a supercapacitor, or electric double layer capacitor. Using both analytical and numerical techniques, we solve the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for such a system, describing the mean-field charging dynamics of the capacitor, when a constant potential difference is abruptly applied to its plates. Working at constant total number of ions, we focus on the physical processes involved in the relaxation and, whenever possible, give its functional shape and exact time constants. We first review and study the case of a symmetric binary electrolyte, where we assume the two ionic species to have the same charges and diffusivities. We then relax these assumptions and present results for a generic strong (i.e. fully dissociated) binary electrolyte. At low electrolyte concentration, the relaxation is simple to understand, as the dynamics of positive and negative ions appear decoupled. At higher electrolyte concentration, we distinguish several regimes. In the linear regime (low voltages), relaxation is multi-exponential, it starts by the build-up of the equilibrium charge profile and continues with neutral mass diffusion, and the relevant time scales feature both the average and the Nernst-Hartley diffusion coefficients. In the purely nonlinear regime (intermediate voltages), the initial relaxation is slowed down exponentially due to increased capacitance, while bulk effects become more and more evident. In the fully nonlinear regime (high voltages), the dynamics of charge and mass are completely entangled and, asymptotically, the relaxation is linear in time. We finally discuss non-ideal behavior in real capacitors and provide conditions for which mean-field is expected to hold.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Epithelial Tissues as a Double Optimization Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11683v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do cells tune emergent properties at the scale of tissues? One class of such emergent behaviors are rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a solid-like to a fluid-like state or vice versa. Here, we introduce a new way for a tissue described by a vertex model to tune its rigidity, by using ``tunable degrees of freedom." We use the vertex model elastic energy as a cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as different sets of degrees of freedom describing cell-cell interactions that can be tuned to minimize the cost function. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as tunable degrees of freedom. When preferred shapes or areas are treated as tunable degrees of freedom, however, induced spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas shift the rigidity transition. These observations suggest that tissues can coordinate changes in cell-scale properties, treated here as tunable degrees of freedom, to achieve desired tissue-scale behaviors.</description>

      <title>Active nematic liquid crystals under a quenched random field</title>

Abstract: Coupling between flow and orientation is a central issue in understanding the collective dynamics of active biofilaments and cells. Active stresses generated by motor activity destroy (quasi-)long-range orientational order and induce chaotic flows with many vortices. In cellular and subcellular environment, alignment is also hindered by heterogeneous filamentous structures in extracellular matrix and various intracellular organelles. Here we address the effects of a quenched random field on the flow patterns and orientational order in two-dimensional active nematic liquid crystals. We find that the director dynamics becomes frozen above a critical disorder strength. For sufficiently strong randomness, the orientational correlation function decays exponentially with distance, reproducing the behavior of passive random-field nematics. In contrast, the flow velocity decreases only gradually with increasing disorder, and exhibits a logarithmic spatial correlation under strong randomness. We identify the threshold between the activity- and disorder-dominated regimes and examine its dependence on the activity parameter.</description>

      <title>Universal limiting behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems with conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Making sense of complex inhomogeneous systems composed of many interacting species is a grand challenge that pervades basically all natural sciences. Phase separation and pattern formation in reaction-diffusion systems have been largely studied as two separate paradigms. Here we show that in reaction-diffusion systems composed of many species, the presence of a conservation law constrains the evolution of the conserved quantity to be governed by a Cahn-Hilliard-like equation. This establishes a direct link with the paradigm of coexistence and recent "active" field theories. Hence, even for complex many-species systems a dramatically simplified but accurate description emerges over coarse spatio-temporal scales. Using the nullcline (the line of homogeneous steady states) as the central motif, we develop a geometrical framework which endows chemical space with a basis and suitable coordinates. This framework allows us to capture and understand the effect of eliminating fast non-conserved degrees of freedom, and to explicitly construct coefficients of the coarse field theory. We expect that the theory we develop here will be particularly relevant to advance our understanding of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Effect of particle and substrate wettability on evaporation-driven assembly of colloidal monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05088v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assembled monolayers of colloidal particles are crucial for various applications, including opto-electronics, surface engineering, as well as light harvesting, and catalysis. A common approach for self-assembly is the drying of a colloidal suspension film on a solid substrate using technologies such as printing and coating. However, this approach often presents challenges such as low surface coverage, stacking faults, and the formation of multiple layers. We numerically investigate the influence of substrate and particle wettability on the deposited pattern. Higher substrate wettability results in a monolayer with a hexagonal arrangement of deposited particles on the substrate. Conversely, lower substrate wettability leads to droplet formation after the film ruptures, leading to the formation of particle clusters. Furthermore, we reveal that higher particle wettability can mitigate the impact of the substrate wettability and facilitate the formation of highly ordered monolayers. We propose theoretical models predicting the surface coverage fraction dependent on particle volume fraction, initial film thickness, particle radius, as well as substrate and particle wettability, and validate these models with simulations. Our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing the deposition process in the creation of assembled monolayers of colloidal particles.</description>

      <title>The Free-Energy Barrier of Precritical Nuclei in Hard Spheres is Consistent with Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17270v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting crystal nucleation is among the most significant long--standing challenges in condensed matter. In the system most studied (hard sphere colloids), the comparison between experiments performed using static light scattering and computer simulations is woeful, with a discrepancy of over 10 orders of magnitude. The situation with other well-studied materials (such as water and sodium chloride) is no better. It has thus far proven impossible to access the regime of this discrepancy with particle-resolved techniques which might shed light on its origins, due to the relatively sluggish dynamics of the larger colloids required for confocal microscopy.
  Here we address this challenge with two developments. Our work is a marked improvement in the precision of mapping the state point of experiments to simulation. For this, we employed a combination of novel machine-learning methods for particle tracking and higher-order correlation functions. Our second innovation is to consider the free energy of pre-critical nuclei which can be detected in the discrepancy regime. These are in agreement with computer simulation. This is the first time that such free energies have been successfully compared between experiment and simulation in any material as far as we are aware. The agreement provides important validation of rare event sampling techniques which are used very widely in simulation, but which can seldom be directly compared with experiment.</description>

      <title>Charging dynamics of electric double layer nanocapacitors in mean-field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.00610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An electric double layer capacitor (EDLC) stores energy by modulating the spatial distribution of ions in the electrolytic solution that it contains. We determine the mean-field time scales for planar EDLC relaxation to equilibrium, after a potential difference is applied. We tackle first the fully symmetric case, where positive and negative ionic species have same valence and diffusivity, and then the general, more complex, asymmetric case. Depending on applied voltage and salt concentration, different regimes appear, revealing a remarkably rich phenomenology relevant for nanocapacitors.</description>

      <title>Quasi-electrostatic eigenmode analysis of anisotropic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anisotropic subwavelength particles combine the strong response and tunability of nanostructures with the exotic properties of anisotropic materials. Here we derive closed-form expressions for the quasielectrostatic eigenmodes and eigenpermittivity relations of uniaxial and biaxial spheres and ellipsoids. We show that such particles exhibit novel radiation patterns and axial-eigenpermittivity sum rules, resulting in resonance splitting and eigenvalue degeneracy. Finally, we analytically predict the Q-factors of the resonance peaks. Our results pave the way for a new generation of directional and multispectral detectors and biomarkers and apply to other fields of physics.</description>
