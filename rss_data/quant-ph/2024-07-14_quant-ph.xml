      <title>A Quantum Computing Approach for Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper tackles the multi-vehicle Coverage Path Planning (CPP) problem, crucial for applications like search and rescue or environmental monitoring. Due to its NP-hard nature, finding optimal solutions becomes infeasible with larger problem sizes. This motivates the development of heuristic approaches that enhance efficiency even marginally. We propose a novel approach for exploring paths in a 2D grid, specifically designed for easy integration with the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA), a powerful quantum heuristic. Our contribution includes: 1) An objective function tailored to solve the multi-vehicle CPP using QAOA. 2) Theoretical proofs guaranteeing the validity of the proposed approach. 3) Efficient construction of QAOA operators for practical implementation. 4) Resource estimation to assess the feasibility of QAOA execution. 5) Performance comparison against established algorithms like the Depth First Search. This work paves the way for leveraging quantum computing in optimizing multi-vehicle path planning, potentially leading to real-world advancements in various applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of stickiness on the quantum states of strongly chaotic open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of classical stickiness (orbits temporarily confined to a region of the chaotic phase space) to the structures of the quantum states of an open system. We consider the standard map of the kicked rotor and verify that regions of stickiness survive in the strong chaotic regime of the closed classical map. By scanning the system's phase space with a leak, we analyze how stickiness affects the degree of localization of the states of the quantum system. We find an excellent correspondence between the classical dwell time and finite-time Lyapunov exponents with the quantum dwell time and Wehrl entropy of the quantum states. Our approach suggests that knowledge of the structure of the classically chaotic trajectories can be used to determine where to place the leak to enhance or decrease the degree of delocalization of the quantum states.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Translation-Invariant Bell Inequalities using Tropical Algebra and Graph Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlocality is one of the key features of quantum physics, which is revealed through the violation of a Bell inequality. In large multipartite systems, nonlocality characterization quickly becomes a challenging task. A common practice is to make use of symmetries, low-order correlators, or exploiting local geometries, to restrict the class of inequalities. In this paper, we characterize translation-invariant (TI) Bell inequalities with finite-range correlators in one-dimensional geometries. We introduce a novel methodology based on tropical algebra tensor networks and highlight its connection to graph theory. Surprisingly, we find that the TI Bell polytope has a number of extremal points that can be uniformly upper-bounded with respect to the system size. We give an efficient method to list all vertices of the polytope for a particular system size, and characterize the tightness of a given TI Bell inequality. The connections highlighted in our work allow us to re-interpret concepts developed in the fields of tropical algebra and graph theory in the context of Bell nonlocality, and vice-versa. This work extends a parallel article [M. Hu \textit{et al.}, arXiv: 2208.02798 (2022)] on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-state SPT from modulated symmetries and hierarchical structure of anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of intrinsic symmetry-protected topological mixed-state(mSPT) in open quantum systems that feature modulated symmetries, such as dipole and subsystem symmetries. Intriguingly, these mSPT phases cannot be realized as the ground states of a gapped Hamiltonian under thermal equilibrium. The microscopic form of the density matrix characterizing these intrinsic mixed-state SPT ensembles is constructed using solvable coupled-wire models that incorporate quenched disorder or quantum channels. A detailed comparison of the hierarchical structure of boundary anomalies in both pure and mixed states is presented, utilizing flux insertion and Laughlin's charge pumping arguments. Finally, we explore the salient features of boundary anomalies in the mixed-state ensemble, which can be detected through the Renyi-N correlation function of charged observables.</description>

      <title>Purifying quantum-dot light in a coherent frequency interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks typically operate in the telecom wavelengths to take advantage of low-loss transmission in optical fibres. However, bright quantum dots (QDs) emitting highly indistinguishable quantum states of light, such as InGaAs QDs, often emit photons in the near infrared thus necessitating frequency conversion (FC) to the telecom band. Furthermore, the signal quality of quantum emissions is crucial for the effective performance of these networks. In this work we report a method for simultaneously implementing spectral purification and frequency shifting of single photons from QD sources to the C-band in a periodically poled Lithium Niobate waveguide. We consider difference frequency generation in the counter-propagating configuration to implement FC with the output emission bandwidth in units of GHz. Our approach establishes a clear path to integrating high-performance single-emitter sources in a hybrid quantum network.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid pace of development in quantum computing technology has sparked a proliferation of benchmarks for assessing the performance of quantum computing hardware and software. Good benchmarks empower scientists, engineers, programmers, and users to understand a computing system's power, but bad benchmarks can misdirect research and inhibit progress. In this Perspective, we survey the science of quantum computer benchmarking. We discuss the role of benchmarks and benchmarking, and how good benchmarks can drive and measure progress towards the long-term goal of useful quantum computations, i.e., "quantum utility". We explain how different kinds of benchmark quantify the performance of different parts of a quantum computer, we survey existing benchmarks, critically discuss recent trends in benchmarking, and highlight important open research questions in this field.</description>

      <title>Predicting properties of quantum systems by regression on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers can be considered as a natural means for performing machine learning tasks for labeled data which are inherently quantum. Many quantum machine learning techniques have been developed for solving classification problems, such as distinguishing between phases of matter or quantum processes. Similarly, one can consider a more general problem of regression, when the task is to predict continuous labels quantifying some property of quantum states, such as purity or entanglement. In this work, we propose a data-agnostic method for predicting such properties. The method is based on the notion of parametrized quantum circuits, and it seeks to find an observable the expectation of which gives the estimation of the property of interest with presumably low variance. We numerically test our approach in learning to predict (i) the parameter of a parametrized channel given its output state, (ii) entanglement of two-qubit states, and (iii) the parameter of a parametrized Hamiltonian given its ground state. The results show that the proposed method is able to find observables such that they provide highly accurate predictions of the considered properties, and in some cases even saturate the Cramer-Rao bound, which characterizes the prediction error.</description>

      <title>Scalable microwave-to-optical transducers at single photon level with spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave-to-optical transduction of single photons will play an essential role in interconnecting future superconducting quantum devices, with applications in distributed quantum computing and secure communications. Various transducers that couple microwave and optical modes via an optical drive have been developed, utilizing nonlinear phenomena such as the Pockels effect and a combination of electromechanical, piezoelectric, and optomechanical couplings. However, the limited strength of these nonlinearities, set by bulk material properties, requires the use of high quality factor resonators, often in conjunction with sophisticated nano-fabrication of suspended structures. Thus, an efficient and scalable transduction technology is still an outstanding goal. Rare-earth ion (REI) doped crystals provide high-quality atomic resonances that result in effective second-order nonlinearities stronger by many orders of magnitude compared to conventional materials. Here, we use ytterbium-171 ions doped in a YVO$_4$ crystal at 340 ppm with an effective resonant $\chi^{(2)}$ nonlinearity of ~ 10$^7$ pm/V to implement an on-chip microwave-to-optical transducer. Without an engineered optical cavity, we achieve percent-level efficiencies with an added noise as low as 1.24(9) photons. To showcase scalability, we demonstrate the interference of photons originating from two simultaneously operated transducers, enabled by the inherent absolute frequencies of the atomic transitions. These results establish REI-based transducers as a highly competitive transduction platform, provide existing REI-based quantum technologies a native link to various leading quantum microwave platforms, and pave the way toward remote transducer-assisted entanglement of superconducting quantum machines.</description>

      <title>Lorentz covariant physical Brownian motion: Classical and quantum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we re-examine the Goldstein-Ka\c{c} velocity switching model from two points of view. On the one hand, we prove that the forward and backward Chapman-Kolmogorov equations of the stochastic process are Lorentz covariant when the trajectories are parameterized by their proper time. On the other hand, to recast the model as a quantum random evolution, we consider restating the Goldstein-Ka\c{c} model as a Hamiltonian system, which can then be quantized using the standard correspondence rules. It turns out that the density for the random quantum evolution satisfies a Chapman-Kolmogorov equation similar to that of the classical case, and therefore, it is also Lorentz covariant. We compute the average quantum variance. To finish, we verify that the quantum model is also consistent with special relativity and that transitions outside the light cone, that is, transitions between states with disjoint supports in space-time, cannot occur.</description>

      <title>Resource-aware scheduling of multiple quantum circuits on a hardware device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent quantum technologies and quantum error-correcting codes emphasize the requirement for arranging interacting qubits in a nearest-neighbor (NN) configuration while mapping a quantum circuit onto a given hardware device, in order to avoid undesirable noise. It is equally important to minimize the wastage of qubits in a quantum hardware device with m qubits while running circuits of n qubits in total, with n &lt; m. In order to prevent cross-talk between two circuits, a buffer distance between their layouts is needed. Furthermore, not all the qubits and all the two-qubit interactions are at the same noise-level. Scheduling multiple circuits on the same hardware may create a possibility that some circuits are executed on a noisier layout than the others. In this paper, we consider an optimization problem which schedules as many circuits as possible for execution in parallel on the hardware, while maintaining a pre-defined layout quality for each. An integer linear programming formulation to ensure maximum fidelity while preserving the nearest neighbor arrangement among interacting qubits is presented. Our assertion is supported by comprehensive investigations involving various well-known quantum circuit benchmarks. As this scheduling problem is shown to be NP Hard, we also propose a greedy heuristic method which provides 2x and 3x better utilization for 27-qubit and 127-qubit hardware devices respectively in terms of qubits and time.</description>

      <title>A Deployable Quantum Access Points Selection Algorithm for Large-Scale Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective access points (APs) selection is a crucial step in localization systems. It directly affects both localization accuracy and computational efficiency. Classical APs selection algorithms are usually computationally expensive, hindering the deployment of localization systems in a large worldwide scale.
  In this paper, we introduce a quantum APs selection algorithm for large-scale localization systems. The proposed algorithm leverages quantum annealing to eliminate redundant and noisy APs. We explain how to formulate the APs selection problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, suitable for quantum annealing, and how to select the minimum number of APs that maintain the same overall localization system accuracy as the complete APs set. Based on this, we further propose a logarithmic-complexity algorithm to select the optimal number of APs.
  We implement our quantum algorithm on a real D-Wave Systems quantum machine and assess its performance in a real test environment for a floor localization problem. Our findings reveal that by selecting fewer than 14% of the available APs in the environment, our quantum algorithm achieves the same floor localization accuracy as utilizing the entire set of APs and a superior accuracy over utilizing the reduced dataset by classical APs selection counterparts. Moreover, the proposed quantum algorithm achieves more than an order of magnitude speedup over the corresponding classical APs selection algorithms, emphasizing the efficiency of the proposed quantum algorithm for large-scale localization systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of criticality in the quantum Otto cycle fueled by the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum heat machines, encompassing heat engines, refrigerators, heaters, and accelerators, represent the forefront of quantum thermodynamics, offering a novel paradigm for converting heat energy into useful mechanical work. Leveraging quantum mechanical principles, these machines promise superior efficiency and performance compared to classical counterparts, with potential applications in renewable energy and quantum computing. This paper investigates a quantum Otto engine operating in both ideal and finite-time scenarios, employing a two-level system interacting with a harmonic oscillator within the framework of the anisotropic quantum Rabi-Stark model (AQRSM) as the working medium. This model is notable for exhibiting both first-order and continuous quantum phase transitions. By focusing on quantum heat engines, our study reveals that these phase transitions critically modulate the efficiency and power of AQRSM-based engines, outperforming quantum engines fueled by working medium with harmonic spectrum. Additionally, we explore the impacts of quantum friction and conduct limit cycle analysis in finite-time operations, providing insights into optimizing quantum heat engines for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>A Novel Quantum Realization of Jet Clustering in High-Energy Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring the application of quantum technologies to fundamental sciences holds the key to fostering innovation for both sides. In high-energy particle collisions, quarks and gluons are produced and immediately form collimated particle sprays known as jets. Accurate jet clustering is crucial as it retains the information of the originating quark or gluon and forms the basis for studying properties of the Higgs boson, which underlies teh mechanism of mass generation for subatomic particles. For the first time, by mapping collision events into graphs--with particles as nodes and their angular separations as edges--we realize jet clustering using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for addressing classical combinatorial optimization problems with available quantum resources. Our results, derived from 30 qubits on quantum computer simulator and 6 qubits on quantum computer hardware, demonstrate that jet clustering performance with QAOA is comparable with or even better than classical algorithms for a small-sized problem. This study highlights the feasibility of quantum computing to revolutionize jet clustering, bringing the practical application of quantum computing in high-energy physics experiments one step closer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation and quantum communication are expected to provide users with capabilities inaccessible by classical physics. However, scalability to larger systems with many qubits is challenging. One solution is to develop a quantum network consisting of small-scale quantum registers containing computation qubits that are reversibly interfaced to communication qubits. Here we report on a register that uses both optical tweezers and optical lattices to deterministically assemble a two-dimensional array of atoms in an optical cavity. Harnessing a single-atom addressing beam, we stimulate the emission of a photon from each atom and demonstrate multiplexed atom-photon entanglement with a generation-to-detection efficiency approaching 90$\%$. Combined with cavity-mediated quantum logic, our approach provides a possible route to distributed quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many experimental platforms for quantum science depend on state control via laser fields. Frequently, however, the control fidelity is limited by optical phase noise. This is exacerbated in stabilized laser systems where high-frequency phase noise is an unavoidable consequence of feedback. Here we implement an optical feedforward technique to suppress laser phase noise in the STIRAP state transfer of ultracold RbCs molecules, across 114 THz, from a weakly bound Feshbach state to the rovibrational ground state. By performing over 100 state transfers on single molecules, we measure a significantly enhanced transfer efficiency of 98.7(1)% limited only by available laser intensity.</description>

      <title>The generalized uncertainty principle within the ordinary framework of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proper deformation of the underlying coordinate and momentum commutation relations in quantum mechanics provides a phenomenological approach to account for the influence of gravity on small scales. Introducing the squared momentum term results in a generalized uncertainty principle, which limits the minimum uncertainty in particle position to the Planck length. However, such a deformation of the commutator significantly changes the formalism, making it separate from the canonical formalism of quantum mechanics. In this study, it is shown that the deformed algebra of position and momentum operators can be incorporated into the framework of ordinary quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of entanglement distribution in terms of maximizing a utility function that captures the total fidelity of end-to-end entanglements in a two-link linear quantum network with a source, a repeater, and a destination. The nodes have several quantum memories, and the problem is how to coordinate entanglement purification in each of the links, and entanglement swapping across links, so as to achieve the goal above. We show that entanglement swapping (i.e, deciding on the pair of qubits from each link to perform swapping on) is equivalent to finding a max-weight matching on a bipartite graph. Further, entanglement purification (i.e, deciding which pairs of qubits in a link will undergo purification) is equivalent to finding a max-weight matching on a non-bipartite graph. We propose two polynomial algorithms, the Purify-then-Swap (PtS) and the Swap-then-Purify (StP) ones, where the decisions about purification and swapping are taken with different order. Numerical results show that PtS performs better than StP, and also that the omission of purification in StP gives substantial benefits.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Coherence as an Indicator of Quantum Entanglement of Hawking Radiation in Moving-Mirror Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-order coherence of light is a widely recognized physical quantity used to assess the quantum characteristics of light, and its properties have been extensively investigated in the field of quantum optics. Recently, it has been proposed that second-order coherence can be utilized as an indicator of quantum entanglement. In this study, we evaluated the second-order coherence in the context of the moving-mirror model, which serves as an analog model for Hawking radiation from a black hole. We discuss the relation between entanglement and the second-order coherence of Hawking radiation paying attention to the noise effect due to the thermality of Hawking radiation, which reduces the quantum correlation in the entanglement-harvesting protocol with two-qubit detectors.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Aspects of Quantum Communications: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum communication systems support unique applications in the form of distributed quantum computing, distributed quantum sensing, and several cryptographic protocols. The main enabler in these communication systems is an efficient infrastructure that is capable to transport unknown quantum states with high rate and fidelity. This feat requires a new approach to communication system design which efficiently exploits the available physical layer resources, while respecting the limitations and principles of quantum information. Despite the fundamental differences between the classic and quantum worlds, there exist universal communication concepts that may proven beneficial in quantum communication systems as well. In this survey, the distinctive aspects of physical layer quantum communications are highlighted in a attempt to draw commonalities and divergences between classic and quantum communications. More specifically, we begin by overviewing the quantum channels and use cases over diverse optical propagation media, shedding light on the concepts of crosstalk and interference. Subsequently, we survey quantum sources, detectors, channels and modulation techniques. More importantly, we discuss and analyze spatial multiplexing techniques, such as coherent control, multiplexing, diversity and MIMO. Finally, we identify synergies between the two communication technologies and grand open challenges that can be pivotal in the development of next-generation quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental photon addition and subtraction in multi-mode and entangled optical fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple photon addition and subtraction applied to multi-mode thermal and sub-Poissonian fields as well as twin beams is mutually compared using one experimental setup. Twin beams with tight spatial correlations detected by an intensified CCD camera with high spatial resolution are used to prepare the initial fields. Up to three photons are added or subtracted to arrive at the nonclassical and non-Gaussian states. Only the photon-subtracted thermal states remain classical. In general, the experimental photon-added states exhibit greater nonclassicality and non-Gaussianity than the comparable photon-subtracted states. Once photons are added or subtracted in twin beams, both processes result in comparable properties of the obtained states owing to twin-beam photon pairing.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of wave function by coherent ensembles of trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-use some original ideas of de~Broglie, Schr\"odiger, Dirac and Feynman to revise the ensemble interpretation of wave function in quantum mechanics. To this end we introduce coherence (auto-concordance) of ensembles of quantum trajectories in the space-time. The coherence condition accounts phases proportional to classical action, which are in foundation of the Feynman path integral technique. Therefore, our interpretation is entirely based on well-known and tested concepts and methods of wave mechanics. Similarly to other ensemble interpretations our approach allows us to avoid all problems and paradoxes related to wave function collapse during a measurement process. Another consequence is that no quantum computation or quantum cryptography method will ever work if it assumes that a particular q-bit represents the entire wave function.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional maximally entangled photon pairs in parametric down-conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon pairs generated from spontaneous parametric down-conversion are a well-established method to realize entangled bipartite photonic systems. Laguerre-Gaussian modes, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), are commonly exploited to engineer high-dimensional entangled quantum states experimentally. For Hilbert spaces with dimension d&gt;2, maximally entangled states (MES) help to improve the capacity and security of quantum communication protocols, among several other promising features. However, the direct generation of MES in well-defined high-dimensional subspaces of the infinite OAM basis has remained a challenge. Here, we formalize how the spatial distribution of the pump beam and the nonlinear profile of the crystal can be utilized to generate MES without additional spatial filtering of OAM modes within a subspace. We illustrate our approach with maximally entangled qutrits (d=3) and ququints (d=5).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models, which are phenomenological mechanisms introduced and designed to account for dynamical wavepacket reduction, are attracting a growing interest from the community interested in the characterisation of the quantum-to-classical transition. Here, we introduce a {\it quantum-probing} approach to the quest of deriving metrological upper bounds on the free parameters of such empirical models. To illustrate our approach, we consider an extended quantum Ising chain whose elements are -- either individually or collectively -- affected by a mechanism responsible for spontaneous collapse. We explore configurations involving out-of-equilibrium states of the chain, which allows us to infer information about the collapse mechanism before it is completely scrambled from the state of the system. Moreover, we investigate potential amplification effects on the probing performance based on the exploitation of quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Angular Momentum of a Neutron Using Earth's Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coupling between Earths rotation and orbital angular momentum (OAM), known as the Sagnac effect, is observed in entangled neutrons produced using a spin echo interferometer. After correction for instrument systematics the measured coupling is within 5% of theory, with an uncertainty of 7.2%. The OAM in our setup is transverse to the propagation direction and scales linearly with wavelength (4 A - 12.75 A), hence the coupling can be varied, without mechanically rotating the device. Therefore, the systematic error is lower than in previous experiments. The detected transverse OAM of our beam corresponds to 4098 +- 295 hbar A-1, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous neutron experiments, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of using the Sagnac effect to definitively measure neutron OAM and paving the way towards observations of the quantum Sagnac effect</description>

      <title>A digital-analog quantum genetic algorithm using Rydberg atom arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) combines digital gates with analog operations, offering an alternative paradigm for universal quantum computation. This approach leverages the higher fidelities of analog operations and the flexibility of local single-qubit gates. In this work, we propose a quantum genetic algorithm within the DAQC framework using a Rydberg atom emulator. The algorithm employs single-qubit operations in the digital domain and a global driving interaction based on the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog domain. We evaluate the algorithm performance by estimating the ground-state energy of Hamiltonians, with a focus on molecules such as $\rm H_2$, $\rm LiH$ and $\rm BeH_2$. Our results show energy estimations with less than 1% error and state overlaps nearing 1, with computation times ranging from a few minutes for $\rm H_2$ (2-qubit circuits) to one to two days for $\rm LiH$ and $\rm BeH_2$ (6-qubit circuits). The gate fidelities of global analog operations further underscore DAQC as a promising quantum computing strategy in the NISQ era.</description>

      <title>Experimental verifiable multi-client blind quantum computing on a Qline architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploitation of certification tools by end users represents a fundamental aspect of the development of quantum technologies as the hardware scales up beyond the regime of classical simulatability. Certifying quantum networks becomes even more crucial when the privacy of their users is exposed to malicious quantum nodes or servers as in the case of multi-client distributed blind quantum computing, where several clients delegate a joint private computation to remote quantum servers, e.g. federated quantum machine learning. In such protocols, security must be provided not only by keeping data hidden but also by verifying that the server is correctly performing the requested computation while minimizing the hardware assumptions on the employed devices. Notably, standard verification techniques fail in scenarios where the clients receive quantum states from untrusted sources such as, for example, in a recently demonstrated linear quantum network performing multi-client blind quantum computation. However, recent theoretical results provide techniques to verify blind quantum computations even in the case of untrusted state preparation. Equipped with such theoretical tools, in this work, we provide the first experimental implementation of a two-client verifiable blind quantum computing protocol in a distributed architecture. The obtained results represent novel perspectives for the verification of multi-tenant distributed quantum computation in large-scale networks.</description>

      <title>Annealing Dynamics of Regular Rotor Networks: Universality and Its Breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-vector Monte Carlo model is widely used as a benchmark for the classicality of quantum annealers but severely restricts the time evolution. The spin-vector Langevin (SVL) model has been proposed and tested as an alternative, closely reproducing the real-time dynamics of physical quantum annealers such as D-Wave machines in the dissipative regime. We investigate the SVL annealing dynamics of classical O(2) rotors on regular graphs, identifying universal features in the nonequilibrium dynamics when changing the range of interactions and the topology of the graph. Regular graphs with low connectance or edge density exhibit universal scaling dynamics consistent with the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which leads to a power-law dependence of the density of defects and the residual energy as a function of the annealing time. As the interaction range is increased, the power-law scaling is suppressed, and an exponential scaling with the annealing time sets in. Our results establish a universal breakdown of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in classical systems characterized by long-range interactions, in sharp contrast with previous findings in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Suppression of quantum dissipation: A cooperative effect of quantum squeezing and quantum measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to isolate a quantum system from its environment is of fundamental interest and importance in optical quantum science and technology. Here we propose an experimentally feasible scheme for beating environment-induced dissipation in an open two-level system coupled to a parametrically driven cavity. The mechanism relies on a novel cooperation between light-matter coupling enhancement and frequent measurements. We demonstrate that, in the presence of the cooperation, the system dynamics can be completely dominated by the effective system-cavity interaction and the dissipative effects from the system-environment coupling can be surprisingly ignored. This work provides a generic method of dissipation suppression in a variety of quantum mechanical platforms, including natural atoms and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analytically solve a model for light scattering in Ising dynamics of metastable atomic qubits, generalizing the approach of Foss-Feig {\it et al.}~[Phys.~Rev.~A {\bf 87}, 042101 (2013)] to include leakage outside the qubit manifold. We analyze the influence of these fundamental errors in simulations of proposed experiments with metastable levels of $^{40}$Ca$^+$ ions. We find that ``effective magnetic fields" generated by leaked qubits have significant impacts on spin-spin correlation functions for Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation or for quantum simulations with strong coupling, while spin squeezing uses a much weaker coupling and is largely insensitive to the simulated leakage errors, even with a few hundred ions. Our theory and results are expected to be useful in modeling a variety of metastable qubit experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Controlization Schemes Based on Orthogonal Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing controlled operations is fundamental to the design and execution of quantum algorithms. In quantum simulation and learning of quantum many-body systems, an important subroutine consists of implementing a controlled Hamiltonian time-evolution. Given only black-box access to the uncontrolled evolution $e^{-iHt}$, controlizing it, i.e., implementing $\mathrm{ctrl}(e^{-iHt}) = |0\rangle\langle 0|\otimes I + |1\rangle\langle 1 |\otimes e^{-iHt}$ is non-trivial. A recent paper introduced a controlization scheme in the context of designing algorithms for transforming unknown Hamiltonian dynamics [OKTM24]. The main idea behind the scheme is to intersperse the uncontrolled evolution with suitable operations such that the overall dynamics approximates the desired controlled evolution. The scheme in Ref. [OKTM24], although efficient, uses operations randomly sampled from an exponentially large set. In the present work, we show that more efficient controlization schemes can be constructed with the help of orthogonal arrays for unknown 2-local Hamiltonians. This construction can also be generalized to $k$-local Hamiltonians. Moreover, our controlization schemes based on orthogonal arrays can take advantage of the interaction graph's structure and be made more efficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of Bi-entangled hidden Markov processes. These are hidden quantum processes where the hidden processes themselves exhibit entangled Markov process, and the observable processes also exhibit entanglement. We present a specific formula for the joint expectation of these processes. Furthermore, we discuss the recurrence of the underlying quantum Markov processes associated to the Bi-entangled hidden Markov processes and we establish that, by restricting them within suitable commutative subalgebras (diagonal subalgebras) leads to the recovery of Markov processes defined by the hidden stochastic matrix. In this paper we only deal with processes with an at most countable state space.</description>

      <title>Ambiguous Resonances in Multipulse Quantum Sensing with Nitrogen Vacancy Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling multipulse sequences can be applied to solid state spins for sensing weak oscillating fields from nearby single nuclear spins. By periodically reversing the probing system's evolution, other noises are counteracted and filtered out over the total evolution. However, the technique is subject to intricate interactions resulting in additional resonant responses, which can be misinterpreted with the actual signal intended to be measured. We experimentally characterized three of these effects present in single nitrogen vacancy centers in diamond, where we also developed a numerical simulations model without rotating wave approximations, showing robust correlation to the experimental data. Regarding centers with the $^{15}$N nitrogen isotope, we observed that a small misalignment in the bias magnetic field causes the precession of the nitrogen nuclear spin to be sensed by the electronic spin of the center. Another studied case of ambiguous resonances comes from the coupling with lattice $^{13}$C nuclei, where we reconstructed the interaction Hamiltonian based on echo modulation frequencies and used this Hamiltonian to simulate multipulse sequences. Finally, we also measured and simulated the effects from the free evolution of the quantum system during finite pulse durations. Due to the large data volume and the strong dependency of these ambiguous resonances with specific experimental parameters, we provide a simulations dataset with a user-friendly graphical interface, where users can compare simulations with their own experimental data for spectral disambiguation. Although focused with nitrogen vacancy centers and dynamical decoupling sequences, these results and the developed model can potentially be applied to other solid state spins and quantum sensing techniques.</description>

      <title>SSIP: automated surgery with quantum LDPC codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Safe Surgery by Identifying Pushouts (SSIP), an open-source lightweight Python package for automating surgery between qubit CSS codes. SSIP is flexible: it is capable of performing both external surgery, that is surgery between two codeblocks, and internal surgery, that is surgery within the same codeblock. Under the hood, it performs linear algebra over $\mathbb{F}_2$ governed by universal constructions in the category of chain complexes. We demonstrate on quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, which are not topological codes in general, and are of interest for near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing. Such qLDPC codes include lift-connected surface codes, generalised bicycle codes and bivariate bicycle codes. We show that various logical measurements can be performed cheaply by surgery without sacrificing the high code distance. For example, half of the single-qubit logical measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the $[[ 144 ,12, 12 ]]$ gross code require only 30 total additional qubits each, assuming the upper bound on distance given by QDistRnd is tight. This is two orders of magnitude lower than the additional qubit count of 1380 initially predicted by Bravyi et al.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of Microwave Loss in Nb Films for Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Niobium films are a key component in modern two-dimensional superconducting qubits, yet their contribution to the total qubit decay rate is not fully understood. The presence of different layers of materials and interfaces makes it difficult to identify the dominant loss channels in present two-dimensional qubit designs. In this paper we present the first study which directly correlates measurements of RF losses in such films to material parameters by investigating a high-power impulse magnetron sputtered (HiPIMS) film atop a three-dimensional niobium superconducting radiofrequency (SRF) resonator. By using a 3D SRF structure, we are able to isolate the niobium film loss from other contributions. Our findings indicate that microwave dissipation in the HiPIMS-prepared niobium films, within the quantum regime, resembles that of record-high intrinsic quality factor of bulk niobium SRF cavities, with lifetimes extending into seconds. Microstructure and impurity level of the niobium film do not significantly affect the losses. These results set the scale of microwave losses in niobium films and show that niobium losses do not dominate the observed coherence times in present two-dimensional superconducting qubit designs, instead highlighting the dominant role of the dielectric oxide in limiting the performance. We can also set a bound for when niobium film losses will become a limitation for qubit lifetimes.</description>

Abstract: We perform readout of a quantum-dot hybrid qubit coupled to a superconducting resonator through a parametric, longitudinal interaction mechanism. Our experiments are performed with the qubit and resonator frequencies detuned by $\sim$10 GHz, demonstrating that longitudinal coupling can facilitate semiconductor qubit operation in the 'ultra-dispersive' regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a well-known phenomenon in open topological systems that causes a large number of eigenstates to become localized at the boundary. Although many aspects of its theory have been investigated in linear systems, this phenomenon remains novel in nonlinear models. In the first step of this paper, we look at the conditions for the presence of quasi-skin modes in a semi-infinite, one-dimensional, nonlinear, nonreciprocal lattice. In the following phase, we explore the survival time of the quasi-skin mode in a finite nonlinear lattice with open edges. We study the dependency of the survival time on the system's parameters and demonstrate how the nonreciprocity of the system affects the survival time. This study introduces a method for achieving a stable localized state in a nonlinear finite lattice.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine-to-rotational energy transfer in ultracold atom-molecule collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy transfer between different mechanical degrees of freedom in atom-molecule collisions has been widely studied and largely understood. However, systems involving spins remain less explored, especially with a state-to-state precision. Here, we directly observed the energy transfer from atomic hyperfine to molecular rotation in the $^{87}$Rb ($|F_a,M_{F_a}\rangle = |2,2\rangle$) + $^{40}$K$^{87}$Rb (in the rovibronic ground state $N=0$) $\longrightarrow$ Rb ($ |1,1\rangle$) + KRb ($N=0,1,2$) exothermic collision. We probed the quantum states of the collision products using resonance-enhanced multi-photon ionization followed by time-of-flight mass spectrometry. We also carried out state-of-the-art quantum scattering calculations, which rigorously take into account the coupling between the spin and rotational degrees of freedom at short range, and assume that the KRb monomer can be treated as a rigid rotor moving on a single potential energy surface. The calculated product rotational state distribution deviates from the observations even after extensive tuning of the atom-molecule potential energy surface, suggesting that vibrational degrees of freedom and conical intersections play an important part in ultracold Rb + KRb collisions. Additionally, our ab initio calculations indicate that spin-rotation coupling is dramatically enhanced near a conical intersection, which is energetically accessible at short range. The observations confirm that spin is coupled to mechanical rotation at short range and establish a benchmark for future theoretical studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a non-relativistic fluid analogue model for a scalar field coupled to a classical source. The generic analogue gravity model involves the phonon field which is coupled to the acoustic metric. We work in the special relativity limit of the acoustic analogue. By assuming a time dependent external potential on the fluid system, we are able to model a source term for the scalar field. Upon quantisation, phonon creation due to the source is studied.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing quantum transport from wave function snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of spin chains by employing principal component analysis (PCA) on data sets of wave function snapshots and examine how information propagates within these data sets. The quantities we employ are derived from the spectrum of the sample second moment matrix, built directly from data sets. Our investigations on several interacting spin chains featuring distinct spin or energy transport reveal that the growth of data information spreading follows the same dynamical exponents as that of the underlying quantum transport of spin or energy. Specifically, our approach enables an easy, data-driven, and importantly interpretable diagnostic to track energy transport with a limited number of samples, which is usually challenging without any assumption on the Hamiltonian form. These observations are obtained at a modest finite size and evolution time, which aligns with experimental and numerical constraints. Our framework directly applies to experimental quantum simulator data sets of dynamics in higher-dimensional systems, where classical simulation methods usually face significant limitations and apply equally to both near- and far-from-equilibrium quenches.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of Single CdSe Magic-Sized Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chemical syntheses that provide nanocrystals (NCs) with narrow distributions in size and shape are critical for NC research. This has led to the investigation of magic-sized NCs (MSNCs), a class of semiconductor crystallites that grow in discrete steps, potentially offering a single size and shape (i.e., monodispersity). However, the photoluminescence (PL) spectra of CdSe MSNCs measured at room temperature have been reported to be broader than those of state-of-the-art quantum dots. This difference could be due to the smaller size of MSNCs, which broadens their line widths, or due to their residual size dispersity. To better understand the optical performance of MSNCs, here we perform single-particle spectroscopy. Our results show that, while CdSe MSNCs do exhibit particle-to-particle variations that lead to modest broadening of their ensemble emission spectra, the largest contribution comes from the single-particle line width. By examining MSNCs with different sizes and shells, we conclude that this single-particle broadening is consistent with exciton coupling to acoustic phonons from the NC surface. Because of their small size, this coupling and the role of residual size dispersity have a larger impact on the ensemble emission line widths. Notably, when small (&lt;2.7 nm diameter) MSNCs and quantum dots are compared, the ensemble PL line widths of MSNCs are actually sharper. Due to their small size, MSNCs also exhibit strong anti-bunching $[g^{(2)}(0) \sim 0.05]$ at room temperature. Thus, MSNCs represent a bright, spectrally pure class of quantum emitter, useful for applications in optoelectronic and quantum-information technologies where strong three-dimensional confinement is required.</description>

      <title>On the Problem of Defining Charge Operators for the Dirac Quantum Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known how to define the operator $Q$ for the total charge (i.e., positron number minus electron number) on the standard Hilbert space of the second-quantized Dirac equation. Here we ask about operators $Q_A$ representing the charge content of a region $A\subseteq \mathbb{R}^3$ in 3d physical space. There is a natural formula for $Q_A$ but, as we explain, there are difficulties about turning it into a mathematically precise definition. First, $Q_A$ can be written as a series but its convergence seems hopeless. Second, we show for some choices of $A$ that if $Q_A$ could be defined then its domain could not contain either the vacuum vector or any vector obtained from the vacuum by applying a polynomial in creation and annihilation operators. Both observations speak against the existence of $Q_A$ for generic $A$.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks enable the calculation of turbulence probability distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting the dynamics of turbulent fluid flows has long been a central goal of science and engineering. Yet, even with modern computing technology, accurate simulation of all but the simplest turbulent flow-fields remains impossible: the fields are too chaotic and multi-scaled to directly store them in memory and perform time-evolution. An alternative is to treat turbulence $\textit{probabilistically}$, viewing flow properties as random variables distributed according to joint probability density functions (PDFs). Turbulence PDFs are neither chaotic nor multi-scale, but are still challenging to simulate due to their high dimensionality. Here we show how to overcome the dimensionality problem by parameterising turbulence PDFs into an extremely compressed format known as a "tensor network" (TN). The TN paradigm enables simulations on single CPU cores that would otherwise be impractical even with supercomputers: for a $5+1$ dimensional PDF of a chemically reactive turbulent flow, we achieve reductions in memory and computational costs by factors of $\mathcal{O}(10^6)$ and $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$, respectively, compared to standard finite difference algorithms. A future path is opened towards something heretofore regarded as infeasible: directly simulating high-dimensional PDFs of both turbulent flows and other chaotic systems that are useful to describe probabilistically.</description>

      <title>Quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains: Majorana quality measures and scaling with increasing chain length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing Majorana bound states (MBSs) in short, well-controllable chains of coupled quantum dots sidesteps the problem of disorder, but requires fine-tuning and does not give the true topological protection inherent to long chains. Here, we introduce a new quality measure that is applicable also in the presence of strong electron-electron interactions and that quantifies the closeness to topological protection of finetuned MBSs in short quantum-dot chains. We call this measure local distinguishability because it puts a bound to the degree an arbitrary local measurement can distinguish between two states. We study the local distinguishability for quantum-dot chains of different length. The three-dot chain is studied in detail, and we find that it may not always be an improvement over the two-dot case, a fact that can be understood within an effective model derived from perturbation theory. For longer chains, the local distinguishability vanishes exponentially, signalling a transition to a topological phase with two ground states that cannot be distinguished by any local measurement.</description>

Abstract: We argue the feasibility to study the phase structure of a quantum physical system on quantum devices via adiabatic preparation of states. We introduce a novel method and successfully test it in application to the Schwinger model in the presence of a topological $\theta$-term. We explore the first-order-phase-transition and the no-transition regions of the corresponding phase diagram. The core idea of the method is to separately evolve the ground and the first excited states with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the time-dependence of which interpolates between different values of $\theta$. Despite our approach being a direct application of the adiabatic theorem, in some cases we are able to demonstrate its advantages in comparison to a different method from the literature that also employs adiabatic state preparation.</description>

      <title>Stability and decay of subradiant patterns in a quantum gas with photon-mediated interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of subradiance, marked by its surprising suppression of spontaneous emission, challenges conventional expectations of the collective behavior of scatterers. We study subradiance in the experimental setting of a Bose-Einstein condensate positioned at the mode crossing of two optical cavities. In this setup, subradiance manifests in the form of metastable density structures that suppress emission into one cavity mode, thereby preventing relaxation to the stationary, superradiant grating that minimizes the system's energy. We observe lifetimes of the subradiant states exceeding hundred milliseconds, far surpassing any characteristic dynamic time scale of the system. Eventually, an instability triggers a rapid transition to the superradiant stationary pattern. We reproduce these dynamics by a quantum mean field model, suggesting that subradiance shares characteristics with quasi-stationary states predicted in other long-range interacting systems such as astrophysical clusters and plasmas. This behavior highlights the potential of photon-mediated long-range forces as controllable and exploitable quantum cooperative phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: Future quantum networks will rely on the ability to coherently transfer optically encoded quantum information between different wavelength bands. Bragg-scattering four-wave mixing in optical fiber is a promising route to achieving this, but requires fibers with precise dispersion control and broadband transmission at signal, target and pump wavelengths. Here we introduce a photonic crystal fiber with a germanium-doped core featuring group velocity matching at 1550 nm, the telecoms C-band, and 920 nm, within the emission range of efficient single photon sources based on InAs quantum dots. With low chromatic walk-off and good optical guidance even at long wavelengths, large lengths of this fiber are used to achieve nanometer-scale frequency shifts between wavelengths around 920 nm with up to 79.4\% internal conversion efficiency, allowing dissimilar InAs dots to be interfaced. We also show how cascading this frequency conversion can be used to generate a frequency comb away from telecoms wavelengths. Finally, we use the fiber to demonstrate tunable frequency conversion of weak classical signals around 918 nm to the telecoms C-band.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Origin of Wannier Localizability and Detachable Topological Boundary States</title>

Abstract: While topology can impose obstructions to exponentially localized Wannier functions, certain topological insulators are exempt from such Wannier obstructions. The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany topological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we elucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary states and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as non-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology leads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic non-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states and clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on this connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of Wannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.</description>

      <title>A realistic model for completing Quantum Mechanics</title>

Abstract: In the well known Copenhagen interpretation of Quantum mechanics, advocated by N. Bohr, the physical objects and the experimental results can be described only in a macroscopic language, leaving any possible microscopic description as unspeakable. This point of view has been deepened by C. Rovelli in the relational interpretation of Quantum mechanics. Most of the alternative interpretations, which try a detailed microscopic description of physical phenomena and of their evolution, have in common the explicit introduction of the wave function as the basic element of the theory. These interpretations require the notion of quantum state as the fundamental concept of the theory, which is the typical unspeakable physical element according to the Copenhagen interpretation. The two basic physical entities are intimately bound together by the integrity of the wave function. These interpretations are usually indicated as realistic. It is well known that the use of the wave function and its time evolution in the description of the physical processes leads unavoidably to some difficulties or so-called paradoxes. The measurement problem is at the center of these difficulties, mainly because it requires the introduction of the reduction process of the wave function, which is not included explicitly within the mathematical formalism of Quantum Mechanics. In this paper we build up and propose a model which goes beyond the standard formalism and which is able to solve the measurement problem and all the other difficulties which, in a way or in another, are related to it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.05576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the RF Quantum Upconverter (RQU) and describe its application to quantum metrology of electromagnetic modes between dc and the Very High Frequency band (VHF) ($\lesssim$300MHz). The RQU uses a Josephson interferometer made up of superconducting loops and Josephson junctions to implement a parametric interaction between a low-frequency electromagnetic mode (between dc and VHF) and a mode in the microwave C Band ($\sim$ 5GHz), analogous to the radiation pressure interaction between electromagnetic and mechanical modes in cavity optomechanics. We analyze RQU performance with quantum amplifier theory, and show that the RQU can operate as a quantum-limited op-amp in this frequency range. It can also use non-classical measurement protocols equivalent to those used in cavity optomechanics, including back-action evading (BAE) measurements, sideband cooling, and two-mode squeezing. These protocols enable experiments using dc--VHF electromagnetic modes as quantum sensors with sensitivity better than the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). We demonstrate signal upconversion from low frequencies to microwave C band using an RQU and show a phase-sensitive gain (extinction ratio) of $46.9$\;dB, which is a necessary step towards the realization of full BAE.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks with multiple sources allow the observation of quantum nonlocality without inputs. Consequently, the incompatibility of measurements is not a necessity for observing quantum nonlocality when one has access to multiple quantum sources. Here we investigate the minimal scenario without inputs where one can observe any form of quantum nonlocality. We show that even two parties with two sources that might be classically correlated can witness a form of quantum nonlocality, in particular quantum steering, in networks without inputs if one of the parties is trusted, that is, performs a fixed known measurement. We term this effect as swap-steering. The scenario presented in this work is minimal to observe such an effect. Consequently, a scenario exists where one can observe quantum steering but not Bell non-locality. We further construct a linear witness to observe swap-steering. Interestingly, this witness enables self-testing of the quantum states generated by the sources and the local measurement of the untrusted party. This in turn allows certifying two bits of randomness that can be obtained from the measurement outcomes of the untrusted device without the requirement of initially feeding the device with randomness.</description>

      <title>DISQ: Dynamic Iteration Skipping for Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes DISQ to craft a stable landscape for VQA training and tackle the noise drift challenge. DISQ adopts a "drift detector" with a reference circuit to identify and skip iterations that are severely affected by noise drift errors. Specifically, the circuits from the previous training iteration are re-executed as a reference circuit in the current iteration to estimate noise drift impacts. The iteration is deemed compromised by noise drift errors and thus skipped if noise drift flips the direction of the ideal optimization gradient. To enhance noise drift detection reliability, we further propose to leverage multiple reference circuits from previous iterations to provide a well founded judge of current noise drift. Nevertheless, multiple reference circuits also introduce considerable execution overhead. To mitigate extra overhead, we propose Pauli-term subsetting (prime and minor subsets) to execute only observable circuits with large coefficient magnitudes (prime subset) during drift detection. Only this minor subset is executed when the current iteration is drift-free. Evaluations across various applications and QPUs demonstrate that DISQ can mitigate a significant portion of the noise drift impact on VQAs and achieve 1.51-2.24x fidelity improvement over the traditional baseline. DISQ's benefit is 1.1-1.9x over the best alternative approach while boosting average noise detection speed by 2.07x</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general construction of a geometric notion of circuit complexity for Gaussian states (both bosonic and fermionic) in terms of Riemannian geometry. We lay out general conditions that a Riemannian metric function on the space of Gaussian states should satisfy in order for it to yield a physically reasonable measure of complexity. This general formalism can naturally accommodate modifications to complexity geometries that arise from cost functions that depend nontrivially on the instantaneous state and on the direction on circuit space at each point. We explore these modifications and, as a particular case, we show how to account for time-reversal symmetry breaking in measures of complexity, which is often natural from an experimental (and thermodynamical) perspective, but is absent in commonly studied complexity measures. This establishes a first step towards building a quantitative, geometric notion of complexity that faithfully mimics what is experienced as "easy" or "hard" to implement in a lab from a physically motivated point of view.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state purification is the task of recovering a nearly pure copy of an unknown pure quantum state using multiple noisy copies of the state. This basic task has applications to quantum communication over noisy channels and quantum computation with imperfect devices, but has only been studied previously for the case of qubits. We derive an efficient purification procedure based on the swap test for qudits of any dimension, starting with any initial error parameter. Treating the initial error parameter and the dimension as constants, we show that our procedure has sample complexity asymptotically optimal in the final error parameter. Our protocol has a simple recursive structure that can be applied when the states are provided one at a time in a streaming fashion, requiring only a small quantum memory to implement.</description>

Abstract: We introduce an adaptable and modular hybrid architecture designed for fault-tolerant quantum computing. It combines quantum emitters and linear-optical entangling gates to leverage the strength of both matter-based and photonic-based approaches. A key feature of the architecture is its practicality, grounded in the utilisation of experimentally proven optical components. Our framework enables the execution of any quantum error correcting code, but in particular maintains scalability for low-density parity check codes by exploiting built-in non-local connectivity through distant optical links. To gauge its efficiency, we evaluated the architecture using a physically motivated error model. It exhibits loss tolerance comparable to existing all-photonic architecture but without the need for intricate linear-optical resource-state-generation modules that conventionally rely on resource-intensive multiplexing. The versatility of the architecture also offers uncharted avenues for further advancing performance standards.</description>

Abstract: Assessment of practical quantum information processing (QIP) remains partial without understanding limits imposed by noise. Unfortunately, mere description of noise grows exponentially with system size, becoming cumbersome even for modest sized systems of imminent practical interest. We fulfill the need for estimates on performing noisy quantum state preparation, verification, and observation. To do the estimation we propose fast numerical algorithms to maximize the expectation value of any $d$-dimensional observable over states of bounded purity. This bound on purity factors in noise in a measurable way. Our fastest algorithm takes $O(d)$ steps if the eigendecomposition of the observable is known, otherwise takes $O(d^3)$ steps at worst. The algorithms also solve maximum likelihood estimation for quantum state tomography with convex and even non-convex purity constraints. Numerics show performance of our key sub-routine (it finds in linear time a probability vector with bounded norm that most overlaps with a fixed vector) can be several orders of magnitude faster than a common state-of-the-art convex optimization solver. Our work fosters a practical way forward to asses limitations on QIP imposed by quantum noise. Along the way, we also give a simple but fundamental insight, noisy systems (equivalently noisy Hamiltonians) always give higher ground-state energy than their noiseless counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Digital quantum simulation has broad applications in approximating unitary evolution of Hamiltonians. In practice, many simulation tasks for quantum systems focus on quantum states in the low-energy subspace instead of the entire Hilbert space. In this paper, we systematically investigate the complexity of digital quantum simulation based on product formulas in the low-energy subspace. We show that the simulation error depends on the effective low-energy norm of the Hamiltonian for a variety of digital quantum simulation algorithms and quantum systems, allowing improvements over the previous complexities for full unitary simulations even for imperfect state preparations due to thermalization. In particular, for simulating spin models in the low-energy subspace, we prove that randomized product formulas such as qDRIFT and random permutation require smaller Trotter numbers. Such improvement also persists in symmetry-protected digital quantum simulations. We prove a similar improvement in simulating the dynamics of power-law quantum interactions. We also provide a query lower bound for general digital quantum simulations in the low-energy subspace.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically formulate and experimentally demonstrate a secure scheme for semi-device-independent quantum random number generation by utilizing Leggett-Garg inequality violations, within a loophole-free photonic architecture. The quantification of the generated randomness is rigorously estimated by analytical as well as numerical approaches, both of which are in perfect agreement. We securely generate $9,19,118$ truly unpredictable bits. This opens up an unexplored avenue towards an empirically convenient class of reliable random number generators harnessing the quantumness of single systems.</description>

Abstract: We provide a quantum protocol to perform topological data analysis (TDA) via the distillation of quantum thermal states. Recent developments of quantum thermal state preparation algorithms reveal their characteristic scaling defined by properties of dissipative Lindbladians. This contrasts with protocols based on unitary evolution which have a scaling depending on the properties of the combinatorial Laplacian. To leverage quantum thermal state preparation algorithms, we translate quantum TDA from a real-time to an imaginary-time picture, shifting the paradigm from a unitary approach to a dissipative one. Starting from an initial state overlapping with the ground state of the system, one can dissipate its energy via channels unique to the dataset, naturally distilling its information. Therefore calculating Betti numbers translates into a purity estimation. Alternatively, this can be interpreted as the evaluation of the R\'{e}nyi 2-entropy, Uhlmann fidelity or Hilbert-Schmidt distance relative to thermal states with the embedded topology of simplicial complexes. Our work opens the field of TDA toward a more physical interpretation of the topology of data.</description>

This article presents a generalized approach and outlines a deterministic algorithm making possible the implementation of this theoretical concept on scalable fault-tolerant qubit-based quantum computers.

      <description>arXiv:2405.00968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in reconstructing the density matrix of photoelectron wavepackets, in particular in complex systems where decoherence can be introduced either by a partial measurement of the system or through coupling with a stochastic environment. To this end, several methods to reconstruct the density matrix, quantum state tomography protocols, have been developed and tested on photoelectrons ejected from noble gases following absorption of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) photons from attosecond pulses. It remains a challenge to obtain model-free, single scan protocols that can reconstruct the density matrix with high fidelities. Current methods require extensive measurements or involve complex fitting of the signal. Efficient single-scan reconstructions would be of great help to increase the number of systems that can be studied. We propose a new and more efficient protocol that is able to reconstruct the continuous variable density matrix of a photoelectron in a single time delay scan. It is based on measuring the coherences of a photoelectron created by absorption of an XUV pulse using a broadband infrared (IR) probe that is scanned in time and a narrowband IR reference that is temporally fixed to the XUV pulse. We illustrate its performance for a Fano resonance in He as well as mixed states in Ar arising from spin-orbit splitting. We show that the protocol results in excellent fidelities and near-perfect estimation of the purity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the quantum Zeno effect as a framework for designing and analyzing quantum algorithms for Hamiltonian simulation. We show that frequent projective measurements of an ancilla qubit register can be used to simulate quantum dynamics on a target qubit register with a circuit complexity similar to randomized approaches. The classical sampling overhead in the latter approaches is traded for ancilla qubit overhead in Zeno-based approaches. A second-order Zeno sequence is developed to improve scaling and implementations through unitary kicks are discussed. We show that the circuits over the combined register can be identified as a subroutine commonly used in post-Trotter Hamiltonian simulation methods. We build on this observation to reveal connections between different Hamiltonian simulation algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness or `magic' is a key resource for quantum computing and a necessary condition for quantum advantage. Non-Clifford operations turn stabilizer states into resourceful states, where the amount of nonstabilizerness is quantified by resource measures such as stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs). Here, we show that SREs saturate their maximum value at a critical number of non-Clifford operations. Close to the critical point SREs show universal behavior. Remarkably, the derivative of the SRE crosses at the same point independent of the number of qubits and can be rescaled onto a single curve. We find that the critical point depends non-trivially on R\'enyi index $\alpha$. For random Clifford circuits doped with T-gates, the critical T-gate density scales independently of $\alpha$. In contrast, for random Hamiltonian evolution, the critical time scales linearly with qubit number for $\alpha&gt;1$, while is a constant for $\alpha&lt;1$. This highlights that $\alpha$-SREs reveal fundamentally different aspects of nonstabilizerness depending on $\alpha$: $\alpha$-SREs with $\alpha&lt;1$ relate to Clifford simulation complexity, while $\alpha&gt;1$ probe the distance to the closest stabilizer state and approximate state certification cost via Pauli measurements. As technical contributions, we observe that the Pauli spectrum of random evolution can be approximated by two highly concentrated peaks which allows us to compute its SRE. Further, we introduce a class of random evolution that can be expressed as random Clifford circuits and rotations, where we provide its exact SRE. Our results opens up new approaches to characterize the complexity of quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Topological Transitions in a Kerr Nonlinear Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Kerr nonlinear oscillator (KNO) supports a pair of steady eigenstates, coherent states with opposite phases, that are good for the encoding of continuous variable qubit basis states. Arbitrary control of the KNO confined within the steady state subspace allows extraction of the Berry curvature through the linear response of the physical observable to the quench velocity of the system, providing an effective method for the characterization of topology in the KNO. As an alternative, the control adopting the "shortcut to adiabaticity" to the KNO enables the exploration of the topology through accelerated adiabatic eigenstate evolution to measure all three physical observables. Topological transitions are revealed by the jump of the first Chern number, obtained respectively from the integral of the Berry curvature and of the new polar angle relation, over the whole parameter space. Our strategy paves the way for measuring topological transitions in continuous variable systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating (2+1)D SU(2) Yang-Mills Lattice Gauge Theory at finite density with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09396v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically simulate a non-Abelian lattice gauge theory in two spatial dimensions, with tensor networks (TN), up to intermediate sizes (&gt;30 matter sites) well beyond exact diagonalization. We focus on the SU(2) Yang-Mills model in Hamiltonian formulation, with dynamical matter and minimally truncated gauge field (hardcore gluon). Thanks to the TN sign-problem-free approach, we characterize the phase diagram of the model at zero and finite baryon number as a function of the quark bare mass and color charge. At intermediate system sizes, we detect a liquid phase of quark-pair bound-state quasiparticles (baryons), whose mass is finite towards the continuum limit. Interesting phenomena arise at the transition boundary where color-electric and color-magnetic terms are maximally frustrated: For low quark masses, we see traces of potential deconfinement, while for high masses, signatures of a possible topological order.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of elementary excitations from quench dynamics in a dipolar XY Rydberg simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a Rydberg quantum simulator to demonstrate a new form of spectroscopy, called quench spectroscopy, which probes the low-energy excitations of a many-body system. We illustrate the method on a two-dimensional simulation of the spin-1/2 dipolar XY model. Through microscopic measurements of the spatial spin correlation dynamics following a quench, we extract the dispersion relation of the elementary excitations for both ferro- and anti-ferromagnetic couplings. We observe qualitatively different behaviors between the two cases that result from the long-range nature of the interactions, and the frustration inherent in the antiferromagnet. In particular, the ferromagnet exhibits elementary excitations behaving as linear spin waves. In the anti-ferromagnet, spin waves appear to decay, suggesting the presence of strong nonlinearities. Our demonstration highlights the importance of power-law interactions on the excitation spectrum of a many-body system.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models: Integrability and Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce two disorder-free variants of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, demonstrate their integrability, and study their static and dynamical properties. Unlike diagrammatic techniques, the integrability of these models allows us to obtain dynamical correlation functions even when the number of Majorana fermions is finite. From the solutions, we find that out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in these models exhibit exponential growth at early times, resembling that of quantum chaotic systems such as those with disorder or external kick terms. Conversely, our analysis shows no evidence of random-matrix behavior in level statistics or the spectral form factor. Our findings illustrate that the clean versions of the SYK models represent simple but nontrivial examples of disorder-free quantum many-body systems displaying chaos-like behavior of OTOCs.</description>

      <title>Traffic signal optimization in large-scale urban road networks: an adaptive-predictive controller using Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Realizing smooth traffic flow is important for achieving carbon neutrality. Adaptive traffic signal control, which considers traffic conditions, has thus attracted attention. However, it is difficult to ensure optimal vehicle flow throughout a large city using existing control methods because of their heavy computational load. Here, we propose a control method called AMPIC (Adaptive Model Predictive Ising Controller) that guarantees both scalability and optimality. The proposed method employs model predictive control to solve an optimal control problem at each control interval with explicit consideration of a predictive model of vehicle flow. This optimal control problem is transformed into a combinatorial optimization problem with binary variables that is equivalent to the so-called Ising problem. This transformation allows us to use an Ising solver, which has been widely studied and is expected to have fast and efficient optimization performance. We performed numerical experiments using a microscopic traffic simulator for a realistic city road network. The results show that AMPIC enables faster vehicle cruising speed with less waiting time than that achieved by classical control methods, resulting in lower CO2 emissions. The model predictive approach with a long prediction horizon thus effectively improves control performance. Systematic parametric studies on model cities indicate that the proposed method realizes smoother traffic flows for large city road networks. Among Ising solvers, D-Wave's quantum annealing is shown to find near-optimal solutions at a reasonable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Tensor networks for black hole interiors: non-isometries, quantum extremal surfaces, and wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use hyperbolic tensor networks to construct a holographic map for black hole interiors that adds a notion of locality to the non-isometric codes proposed by Akers, Engelhardt, Harlow, Penington, and Vardhan. We use tools provided by these networks to study the relationship between non-isometries and quantum extremal surfaces behind the horizon. Furthermore, we introduce a limited notion of dynamics for these interior tensor networks based on the qudit models introduced by Akers et al., and study the evolution of quantum extremal surfaces in an evaporating black hole. We also find a tensor network description of a wormhole connecting the black hole interior to the radiation, providing a mechanism for interior states and operators to be encoded in the radiation after the Page time. As a particular case, we construct a tensor network realization of the backwards-forwards maps recently proposed to incorporate non-trivial effective dynamics in dynamical constructions of these non-isometric black hole codes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability for Foundations of Statistical Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the Carath\'eodory principle of the Second Law to quantum thermodynamics with energy levels depending on macroscopic variables, such as volume and magnetic field. This extension introduces the concept of Quantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation for statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of work and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by energy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework, temperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the derivation of both canonical and non-canonical distributions from the Entropy Integrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which become particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the existence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.</description>
