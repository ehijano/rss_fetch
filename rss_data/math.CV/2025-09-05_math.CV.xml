      <description>arXiv:2509.03532v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). We obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing these from their respective quadrature functions as well. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Macaulay representation of the prolongation matrix and the SOS conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $z \in \mathbb{C}^n$, and let $A(z,\bar{z})$ be a real valued diagonal bihomogeneous Hermitian polynomial such that $A(z,\bar{z})\|z\|^2$ is a sum of squares, where $\|z\|$ denotes the Euclidean norm of $z$. In this paper, we provide an estimate for the rank of the sum of squares $A(z,\bar{z})\|z\|^2$ when $A(z,\bar{z})$ is not semipositive definite. As a consequence, we confirm the SOS conjecture proposed by Ebenfelt for $2 \leq n \leq 6$ when $A(z,\bar{z})$ is a real valued diagonal (not necessarily bihomogeneous) Hermitian polynomial, and we also give partial answers to the SOS conjecture for $n\geq 7$.</description>

Abstract: In this note we provide a sufficient condition on when the composition operator $C_{\Phi}:A^2_{a}(\mathbb{D}^2)\to A^2_{\beta}(\mathbb{D}^2)$ is bounded, whenever $a\ge-1$ and $\beta$ is positive, with the assumption that $\Phi$ is induced by non-smooth Rational Inner Functions.</description>

      <title>Energy, equilibrium measure and entropy for toric surface maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the ergodic theory of plane rational maps that preserve the natural holomorphic volume form on the algebraic torus. Specifically we construct natural invariant probability measures for a large class of such maps by intersecting the equilibrium currents we constructed in our previous work [DR]. We show further that these measures are mixing and that each admits an underlying geometric product structure. The main result of [DDG3] then implies that the topological entropy of each map covered by our results is the log of its first dynamical degree. In light of examples presented in [BDJ], this implies in particular that the entropy of a rational map can equal the log of a transcendental number.</description>

      <title>Entire conformal curves are affine or have super-Euclidean energy growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that entire conformal curves $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ fall into two classes: either the curve is affine or the average energy in a ball is strictly increasing for large radii and diverges to infinity. This rigidity follows from a blow-down argument and the strong interaction of the generalized Cauchy--Riemann equations with calibrated geometries and the sharp isoperimetric inequality for integral currents due to Almgren. As an application, we prove that every entire Lipschitz conformal curve is affine. This can be considered a higher-dimensional analog of the statement that an entire holomorphic function with a bounded complex differential is affine.
  We also recall that a certain punctured cone over a Legendrian torus provides a submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for $n \geq 3$, for which an entire conformal curve yields a conformal covering map. As a related result, we prove that if a non-constant entire conformal curve factors through an $n$-dimensional submanifold, then the submanifold is calibrated and conformally equivalent to a flat non-compact quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>On extension of closed complex (basic) differential forms: (basic) Hodge numbers and (transversely) $p$-K\"ahler structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.06870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.06870v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a recent work of D. Wei--S. Zhu on the extension of closed complex differential forms and Voisin's usage of the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-lemma, we obtain several new theorems of deformation invariance of Hodge numbers and reprove the local stabilities of $p$-K\"ahler structures with the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-property. Our approach is more concerned with the $d$-closed extension by means of the exponential operator $e^{\iota_\varphi}$.
  Furthermore, we prove the local stabilities of transversely $p$-K\"ahler structures with mild $\partial\bar{\partial}$-property by adapting the power series method to the foliated case, which strengthens the works of A. El Kacimi Alaoui--B. Gmira and P. Ra\'zny on that of the transversely K\"ahler foliations with homologically orientability. We observe that a transversely K\"ahler foliation, even without homologically orientability, also satisfies the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-property. So even when $p=1$ (transversely K\"ahler), our results are new as we can drop the assumption in question on the initial foliation. Several theorems on the deformation invariance of basic Hodge/Bott--Chern numbers with mild $\partial\bar{\partial}$-properties are also presented.</description>

      <title>On Koebe's theorem for mappings with integral constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mappings that satisfy the inverse modulus inequality of Poletsky type with respect to $p$-modulus. Given $n-1&lt;p\leqslant n,$ we show that, the image of some ball contains a fixed ball under mappings mentioned above. This statement can be interpreted as the well-known analogue of Koebe's theorem for analytic functions. As a consequence, we obtain the openness and discreteness of the limit mapping in the class under study. The paper also studies mappings of the Orlicz-Sobolev classes, for which an analogue of the Koebe one-quarter theorem is obtained as a consequence of the main results</description>

      <title>The toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.08380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pair of commuting Hilbert space contractions $(T_1,T_2)$ is said to be toral if there is a polynomial $p \in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ such that its zero set $Z(p)$ defines a distinguished variety in the bidisc $\mathbb D^2$ and $p(T_1,T_2)=0$. A pair of commuting Hilbert space operators $(S,P)$ is said to be a $\Gamma$-contraction if the closed symmetrized bidisc \[ \Gamma=\{ (z_1+z_2,z_1z_2)\,:\, |z_1|, \, |z_2| \leq 1 \} \] is a spectral set for $(S,P)$. A $\Gamma$-contraction $(S,P)$ is called $\Gamma$-distinguished if $q(S,P)=0$ for some polynomial $q\in \mathbb C[z_1,z_2]$ whose zero set $Z(q)$ gives rise to a distinguished variety in the symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb G_2$. We find necessary and sufficient conditions such that a toral pair of contractions dilates to a toral pair of isometries. In the same spirit, we characterize all $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions that admit dilation to $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-isometries. The distinguished boundary of a distinguished variety in $\mathbb D^2$ and $\mathbb G_2$ is determined. Examples are provided at places to show the contrasts between the theory of toral contractions and $\Gamma$-distinguished $\Gamma$-contractions.</description>
