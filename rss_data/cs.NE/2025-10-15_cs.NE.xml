      <title>From Minimal Existence to Human Definition: The CES-IMU-HSG Theoretical Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an inter-universal mathematical-logical framework constructed upon the minimal axiom Cogito, ergo sum (CES), integrating the Intermediate Meta-Universe (IMU) and the Hierarchical State Grid (HSG). The CES defines existence as a reflexive correspondence --'to be' and 'to be sayable'--and positions any formal system, including ZFC or HoTT, as an attachable extension atop this minimal structure. The IMU functions as a registry of axiomatic dependencies that connect heterogeneous theories, employing the Institution-theoretic framework to ensure coherent inter-theoretical linkages. The HSG concretizes these ideas through categorical construction, defined by three orthogonal axes: the state-depth axis, the mapping-hierarchy axis, and the temporal axis incorporating the principle of 'no future reference.' Through these, the identity of 'definition = state' is formally established as a categorical property. Extending this structure to biological systems, the neural system is implemented as a 0-3D complex of neuron-function fields on the HSG, while its categorical extensions via fiberization over the material base enable the parallel integration of multiple physiological universes-neural, endocrine, learning, genetic, and input/output systems-into a coherent adjoint ensemble. Within this framework, human behavior and cognition emerge as temporal compositions of inter-universal algorithms constrained by the material base. Finally, by contrasting human cognition, which relies on external CES, with machine existence, this study introduces the concept of internal CES, wherein a machine grounds its own logic upon the factuality of its operation. This internal self-axiomatization establishes a continuous bridge between philosophical ontology and engineering implementation, providing a new foundation for the autonomous and self-defining existence of artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>A Complete Pipeline for deploying SNNs with Synaptic Delays on Loihi 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks are attracting increased attention as a more energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks for edge computing. Neuromorphic computing can significantly reduce energy requirements. Here, we present a complete pipeline: efficient event-based training of SNNs with synaptic delays on GPUs and deployment on Intel's Loihi 2 neuromorphic chip. We evaluate our approach on keyword recognition tasks using the Spiking Heidelberg Digits and Spiking Speech Commands datasets, demonstrating that our algorithm can enhance classification accuracy compared to architectures without delays. Our benchmarking indicates almost no accuracy loss between GPU and Loihi 2 implementations, while classification on Loihi 2 is up to 18x faster and uses 250x less energy than on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano.</description>

      <title>Semantic knowledge guides innovation and drives cultural evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cumulative cultural evolution enables human societies to generate increasingly complex knowledge and technology over generations. While social learning transmits innovations between individuals and generations, the cognitive processes that generate these innovations remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that semantic knowledge-structured associations between concepts and their functions-provides cognitive scaffolding for cumulative innovation by guiding exploration toward plausible and meaningful actions. We tested this hypothesis using a cultural evolutionary agent-based model and a large-scale behavioural experiment (N = 1,243), in which individuals performed a task requiring the combination of items into novel innovations. Across both approaches, semantic knowledge and social learning interact synergistically to enhance innovation. Behaviorally, participants without access to semantic knowledge performed no better than chance, even when social learning was available, and relied on shallow exploration strategies. These findings suggest that semantic knowledge is a key cognitive process enabling human cumulative culture.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP): A Unified Approach to Investigate Syntactic Structure Representations in Large Language Models and the Human Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-level or even superior language abilities, effectively modeling syntactic structures, yet the specific computational modules responsible remain unclear. A key question is whether LLM behavioral capabilities stem from mechanisms akin to those in the human brain. To address these questions, we introduce the Hierarchical Frequency Tagging Probe (HFTP), a tool that utilizes frequency-domain analysis to identify neuron-wise components of LLMs (e.g., individual Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neurons) and cortical regions (via intracranial recordings) encoding syntactic structures. Our results show that models such as GPT-2, Gemma, Gemma 2, Llama 2, Llama 3.1, and GLM-4 process syntax in analogous layers, while the human brain relies on distinct cortical regions for different syntactic levels. Representational similarity analysis reveals a stronger alignment between LLM representations and the left hemisphere of the brain (dominant in language processing). Notably, upgraded models exhibit divergent trends: Gemma 2 shows greater brain similarity than Gemma, while Llama 3.1 shows less alignment with the brain compared to Llama 2. These findings offer new insights into the interpretability of LLM behavioral improvements, raising questions about whether these advancements are driven by human-like or non-human-like mechanisms, and establish HFTP as a valuable tool bridging computational linguistics and cognitive neuroscience.

      <title>APRIL: Auxiliary Physically-Redundant Information in Loss - A physics-informed framework for parameter estimation with a gravitational-wave case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the system under study directly into the training of Neural Networks, ensuring solutions that respect physical laws. While effective for single-system problems, standard PINNs scale poorly to datasets containing many realizations of the same underlying physics with varying parameters. To address this limitation, we present a complementary approach by including auxiliary physically-redundant information in loss (APRIL), i.e. augment the standard supervised output-target loss with auxiliary terms which exploit exact physical redundancy relations among outputs. We mathematically demonstrate that these terms preserve the true physical minimum while reshaping the loss landscape, improving convergence toward physically consistent solutions. As a proof-of-concept, we benchmark APRIL on a fully-connected neural network for gravitational wave (GW) parameter estimation (PE). We use simulated, noise-free compact binary coalescence (CBC) signals, focusing on inspiral-frequency waveforms to recover the chirp mass $\mathcal{M}$, the total mass $M_\mathrm{tot}$, and symmetric mass ratio $\eta$ of the binary. In this controlled setting, we show that APRIL achieves up to an order-of-magnitude improvement in test accuracy, especially for parameters that are otherwise difficult to learn. This method provides physically consistent learning for large multi-system datasets and is well suited for future GW analyses involving realistic noise and broader parameter ranges.</description>

      <title>DelRec: learning delays in recurrent spiking neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a bio-inspired alternative to conventional real-valued deep learning models, with the potential for substantially higher energy efficiency. Interest in SNNs has recently exploded due to a major breakthrough: surrogate gradient learning (SGL), which allows training SNNs with backpropagation, strongly outperforming other approaches. In SNNs, each synapse is characterized not only by a weight but also by a transmission delay. While theoretical works have long suggested that trainable delays significantly enhance expressivity, practical methods for learning them have only recently emerged. Here, we introduce ``DelRec'', the first SGL-based method to train axonal or synaptic delays in recurrent spiking layers, compatible with any spiking neuron model. DelRec leverages a differentiable interpolation technique to handle non-integer delays with well-defined gradients at training time. We show that SNNs with trainable recurrent delays outperform feedforward ones, leading to new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on two challenging temporal datasets (Spiking Speech Command, an audio dataset, and Permuted Sequential MNIST, a vision one), and match the SOTA on the now saturated Spiking Heidelberg Digit dataset using only vanilla Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire neurons with stateless (instantaneous) synapses. Our results demonstrate that recurrent delays are critical for temporal processing in SNNs and can be effectively optimized with DelRec, paving the way for efficient deployment on neuromorphic hardware with programmable delays. Our code is available at https://github.com/alexmaxad/DelRec.</description>

      <title>Improving Planning with Large Language Models: A Modular Agentic Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00194v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance on a wide variety of tasks, but they often struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning or goal-directed planning. Both cognitive neuroscience and reinforcement learning (RL) have proposed a number of interacting functional components that together implement search and evaluation in multi-step decision making. These components include conflict monitoring, state prediction, state evaluation, task decomposition, and orchestration. To improve planning with LLMs, we propose an agentic architecture, the Modular Agentic Planner (MAP), in which planning is accomplished via the recurrent interaction of the specialized modules mentioned above, each implemented using an LLM. MAP improves planning through the interaction of specialized modules that break down a larger problem into multiple brief automated calls to the LLM. We evaluate MAP on three challenging planning tasks -- graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi, and the PlanBench benchmark -- as well as an NLP task requiring multi-step reasoning (strategyQA). We find that MAP yields significant improvements over both standard LLM methods (zero-shot prompting, in-context learning) and competitive baselines (chain-of-thought, multi-agent debate, and tree-of-thought), can be effectively combined with smaller and more cost-efficient LLMs (Llama3-70B), and displays superior transfer across tasks. These results suggest the benefit of a modular and multi-agent approach to planning with LLMs.</description>

      <title>Tensor Logic: The Language of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Progress in AI is hindered by the lack of a programming language with all the requisite features. Libraries like PyTorch and TensorFlow provide automatic differentiation and efficient GPU implementation, but are additions to Python, which was never intended for AI. Their lack of support for automated reasoning and knowledge acquisition has led to a long and costly series of hacky attempts to tack them on. On the other hand, AI languages like LISP an Prolog lack scalability and support for learning. This paper proposes tensor logic, a language that solves these problems by unifying neural and symbolic AI at a fundamental level. The sole construct in tensor logic is the tensor equation, based on the observation that logical rules and Einstein summation are essentially the same operation, and all else can be reduced to them. I show how to elegantly implement key forms of neural, symbolic and statistical AI in tensor logic, including transformers, formal reasoning, kernel machines and graphical models. Most importantly, tensor logic makes new directions possible, such as sound reasoning in embedding space. This combines the scalability and learnability of neural networks with the reliability and transparency of symbolic reasoning, and is potentially a basis for the wider adoption of AI.</description>
