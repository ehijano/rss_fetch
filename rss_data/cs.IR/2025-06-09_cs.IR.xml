      <title>Heterogeneous Sequel-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph-based recommendation systems use higher-order user and item embeddings for next-item predictions. Dynamically adding collaborative signals from neighbors helps to use similar users' preferences during learning. While item-item correlations and their impact on recommendations have been studied, the efficacy of temporal item sequences for recommendations is much less explored. In this paper, we examine temporal item sequence (sequel-aware) embeddings along with higher-order user embeddings and show that sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks have better (or comparable) recommendation performance than graph-based recommendation systems that do not consider sequel information. Extensive empirical results comparing Heterogeneous Sequel-aware Graph Neural Networks (HSAL-GNNs) to other algorithms for sequential learning (such as transformers, graph neural networks, auto-encoders) are presented on three synthetic and three real-world datasets. Our results indicate that the incorporation of sequence information from items greatly enhances recommendations.</description>

      <title>NGA: Non-autoregressive Generative Auction with Global Externalities for Advertising Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertising auctions are fundamental to internet commerce, demanding solutions that not only maximize revenue but also ensure incentive compatibility, high-quality user experience, and real-time efficiency. While recent learning-based auction frameworks have improved context modeling by capturing intra-list dependencies among ads, they remain limited in addressing global externalities and often suffer from inefficiencies caused by sequential processing. In this work, we introduce the Non-autoregressive Generative Auction with global externalities (NGA), a novel end-to-end framework designed for industrial online advertising. NGA explicitly models global externalities by jointly capturing the relationships among ads as well as the effects of adjacent organic content. To further enhance efficiency, NGA utilizes a non-autoregressive, constraint-based decoding strategy and a parallel multi-tower evaluator for unified list-wise reward and payment computation. Extensive offline experiments and large-scale online A/B testing on commercial advertising platforms demonstrate that NGA consistently outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generating Long Semantic IDs in Parallel for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic ID-based recommendation models tokenize each item into a small number of discrete tokens that preserve specific semantics, leading to better performance, scalability, and memory efficiency. While recent models adopt a generative approach, they often suffer from inefficient inference due to the reliance on resource-intensive beam search and multiple forward passes through the neural sequence model. As a result, the length of semantic IDs is typically restricted (e.g. to just 4 tokens), limiting their expressiveness. To address these challenges, we propose RPG, a lightweight framework for semantic ID-based recommendation. The key idea is to produce unordered, long semantic IDs, allowing the model to predict all tokens in parallel. We train the model to predict each token independently using a multi-token prediction loss, directly integrating semantics into the learning objective. During inference, we construct a graph connecting similar semantic IDs and guide decoding to avoid generating invalid IDs. Experiments show that scaling up semantic ID length to 64 enables RPG to outperform generative baselines by an average of 12.6% on the NDCG@10, while also improving inference efficiency.

      <title>Research on Personalized Financial Product Recommendation by Integrating Large Language Models and Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of fintech, personalized financial product recommendations have become increasingly important. Traditional methods like collaborative filtering or content-based models often fail to capture users' latent preferences and complex relationships. We propose a hybrid framework integrating large language models (LLMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). A pre-trained LLM encodes text data (e.g., user reviews) into rich feature vectors, while a heterogeneous user-product graph models interactions and social ties. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, text and graph information are fused within the GNN to jointly optimize embeddings. Experiments on public and real-world financial datasets show our model outperforms standalone LLM or GNN in accuracy, recall, and NDCG, with strong interpretability. This work offers new insights for personalized financial recommendations and cross-modal fusion in broader recommendation tasks.</description>

      <title>Respecting Temporal-Causal Consistency: Entity-Event Knowledge Graphs for Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based on large language models often falters on narrative documents with inherent temporal structures. Standard unstructured RAG methods rely solely on embedding-similarity matching and lack any general mechanism to encode or exploit chronological information, while knowledge graph RAG (KG-RAG) frameworks collapse every mention of an entity into a single node, erasing the evolving context that drives many queries. To formalize this challenge and draw the community's attention, we construct ChronoQA, a robust and discriminative QA benchmark that measures temporal, causal, and character consistency understanding in narrative documents (e.g., novels) under the RAG setting. We then introduce Entity-Event RAG (E^2RAG), a dual-graph framework that keeps separate entity and event subgraphs linked by a bipartite mapping, thereby preserving the temporal and causal facets needed for fine-grained reasoning. Across ChronoQA, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unstructured and KG-based RAG baselines, with notable gains on causal and character consistency queries. E^2RAG therefore offers a practical path to more context-aware retrieval for tasks that require precise answers grounded in chronological information.</description>

      <title>On the Merits of LLM-Based Corpus Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI (genAI) technologies -- specifically, large language models (LLMs) -- and search have evolving relations. We argue for a novel perspective: using genAI to enrich a document corpus so as to improve query-based retrieval effectiveness. The enrichment is based on modifying existing documents or generating new ones. As an empirical proof of concept, we use LLMs to generate documents relevant to a topic which are more retrievable than existing ones. In addition, we demonstrate the potential merits of using corpus enrichment for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and answer attribution in question answering.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Recall or Relevance? A Multi-Task Multi-Head Approach for Item-to-Item Retrieval in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of item-to-item (I2I) retrieval is to identify a set of relevant and highly engaging items based on a given trigger item. It is a crucial component in modern recommendation systems, where users' previously engaged items serve as trigger items to retrieve relevant content for future engagement. However, existing I2I retrieval models in industry are primarily built on co-engagement data and optimized using the recall measure, which overly emphasizes co-engagement patterns while failing to capture semantic relevance. This often leads to overfitting short-term co-engagement trends at the expense of long-term benefits such as discovering novel interests and promoting content diversity. To address this challenge, we propose MTMH, a Multi-Task and Multi-Head I2I retrieval model that achieves both high recall and semantic relevance. Our model consists of two key components: 1) a multi-task learning loss for formally optimizing the trade-off between recall and semantic relevance, and 2) a multi-head I2I retrieval architecture for retrieving both highly co-engaged and semantically relevant items. We evaluate MTMH using proprietary data from a commercial platform serving billions of users and demonstrate that it can improve recall by up to 14.4% and semantic relevance by up to 56.6% compared with prior state-of-the-art models. We also conduct live experiments to verify that MTMH can enhance both short-term consumption metrics and long-term user-experience-related metrics. Our work provides a principled approach for jointly optimizing I2I recall and semantic relevance, which has significant implications for improving the overall performance of recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>RecGPT: A Foundation Model for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses a fundamental barrier in recommender systems: the inability to generalize across domains without extensive retraining. Traditional ID-based approaches fail entirely in cold-start and cross-domain scenarios where new users or items lack sufficient interaction history. Inspired by foundation models' cross-domain success, we develop a foundation model for sequential recommendation that achieves genuine zero-shot generalization capabilities. Our approach fundamentally departs from existing ID-based methods by deriving item representations exclusively from textual features. This enables immediate embedding of any new item without model retraining. We introduce unified item tokenization with Finite Scalar Quantization that transforms heterogeneous textual descriptions into standardized discrete tokens. This eliminates domain barriers that plague existing systems. Additionally, the framework features hybrid bidirectional-causal attention that captures both intra-item token coherence and inter-item sequential dependencies. An efficient catalog-aware beam search decoder enables real-time token-to-item mapping. Unlike conventional approaches confined to their training domains, RecGPT naturally bridges diverse recommendation contexts through its domain-invariant tokenization mechanism. Comprehensive evaluations across six datasets and industrial scenarios demonstrate consistent performance advantages.</description>

      <title>TriPSS: A Tri-Modal Keyframe Extraction Framework Using Perceptual, Structural, and Semantic Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient keyframe extraction is critical for effective video summarization and retrieval, yet capturing the complete richness of video content remains challenging. In this work, we present TriPSS, a novel tri-modal framework that effectively integrates perceptual cues from color features in the CIELAB space, deep structural embeddings derived from ResNet-50, and semantic context from frame-level captions generated by Llama-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct. By fusing these diverse modalities using principal component analysis, TriPSS constructs robust multi-modal embeddings that enable adaptive segmentation of video content via HDBSCAN clustering. A subsequent refinement stage incorporating quality assessment and duplicate filtering ensures that the final keyframe set is both concise and semantically rich. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets TVSum20 and SumMe demonstrate that TriPSS achieves state-of-the-art performance, substantially outperforming traditional unimodal and previous multi-modal methods. These results underscore TriPSS's ability to capture nuanced visual and semantic information, thereby setting a new benchmark for video content understanding in large-scale retrieval scenarios.</description>

      <title>The NetMob25 Dataset: A High-resolution Multi-layered View of Individual Mobility in Greater Paris Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality mobility data remains scarce despite growing interest from researchers and urban stakeholders in understanding individual-level movement patterns. The Netmob25 Data Challenge addresses this gap by releasing a unique GPS-based mobility dataset derived from the EMG 2023 GNSS-based mobility survey conducted in the Ile-de-France region (Greater Paris area), France. This dataset captures detailed daily mobility over a full week for 3,337 volunteer residents aged 16 to 80, collected between October 2022 and May 2023. Each participant was equipped with a dedicated GPS tracking device configured to record location points every 2-3 seconds and was asked to maintain a digital or paper logbook of their trips. All inferred mobility traces were algorithmically processed and validated through follow-up phone interviews.
  The dataset includes three components: (i) an Individuals database describing demographic, socioeconomic, and household characteristics; (ii) a Trips database with over 80,000 annotated displacements including timestamps, transport modes, and trip purposes; and (iii) a Raw GPS Traces database comprising about 500 million high-frequency points. A statistical weighting mechanism is provided to support population-level estimates. An extensive anonymization pipeline was applied to the GPS traces to ensure GDPR compliance while preserving analytical value. Access to the dataset requires acceptance of the challenge's Terms and Conditions and signing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. This paper describes the survey design, collection protocol, processing methodology, and characteristics of the released dataset.</description>

      <title>A Novel, Human-in-the-Loop Computational Grounded Theory Framework for Big Social Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The availability of big data has significantly influenced the possibilities and methodological choices for conducting large-scale behavioural and social science research. In the context of qualitative data analysis, a major challenge is that conventional methods require intensive manual labour and are often impractical to apply to large datasets. One effective way to address this issue is by integrating emerging computational methods to overcome scalability limitations. However, a critical concern for researchers is the trustworthiness of results when Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools are used to analyse such data. We argue that confidence in the credibility and robustness of results depends on adopting a 'human-in-the-loop' methodology that is able to provide researchers with control over the analytical process, while retaining the benefits of using ML and NLP. With this in mind, we propose a novel methodological framework for Computational Grounded Theory (CGT) that supports the analysis of large qualitative datasets, while maintaining the rigour of established Grounded Theory (GT) methodologies. To illustrate the framework's value, we present the results of testing it on a dataset collected from Reddit in a study aimed at understanding tutors' experiences in the gig economy.</description>

      <title>Phonetically-Augmented Discriminative Rescoring for Voice Search Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models are trained using paired audio-text samples that are expensive to obtain, since high-quality ground-truth data requires human annotators. Voice search applications, such as digital media players, leverage ASR to allow users to search by voice as opposed to an on-screen keyboard. However, recent or infrequent movie titles may not be sufficiently represented in the E2E ASR system's training data, and hence, may suffer poor recognition.
  In this paper, we propose a phonetic correction system that consists of (a) a phonetic search based on the ASR model's output that generates phonetic alternatives that may not be considered by the E2E system, and (b) a rescorer component that combines the ASR model recognition and the phonetic alternatives, and select a final system output.
  We find that our approach improves word error rate between 4.4 and 7.6% relative on benchmarks of popular movie titles over a series of competitive baselines.</description>

      <title>CLaMR: Contextualized Late-Interaction for Multimodal Content Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online video web content is richly multimodal: a single video blends vision, speech, ambient audio, and on-screen text. Retrieval systems typically treat these modalities as independent retrieval sources, which can lead to noisy and subpar retrieval. We explore multimodal video content retrieval, where relevance can be scored from one particular modality or jointly across multiple modalities simultaneously. Consequently, an effective retriever must dynamically choose which modality (or set of modalities) best addresses the query. We introduce CLaMR, a multimodal, late-interaction retriever that jointly indexes 4 modalities: video frames, transcribed speech, on-screen text, and metadata. CLaMR jointly encodes all modalities with a unified multimodal backbone for improved contextualization and is trained to enhance dynamic modality selection via two key innovations. First, given the lack of training data for multimodal retrieval, we introduce MultiVENT 2.0++, a large-scale synthetic training dataset built on MultiVENT 2.0 (event-centric videos in various languages paired with queries) with modality-targeted queries. Next, we propose a modality-aware loss that jointly trains according to a standard contrastive objective alongside an objective for learning correct modality usage. On the test sets of MultiVENT 2.0++ and MSRVTT, conventional aggregation strategies, such as averaging similarities for baseline retrievers, degrade performance by introducing noise from irrelevant modalities. In contrast, CLaMR consistently outperforms existing retrievers: on MultiVENT 2.0++, CLaMR improves nDCG@10 by 25.6 over the best single-modality retriever and by 35.4 over the best multi-modality retriever. We illustrate CLaMR's downstream utility on long-video QA, retrieving relevant frames and obtaining a 3.50% boost over LanguageBind on Video-MME and 1.42% over dense sampling on LongVideoBench.</description>

      <title>Recommender systems, stigmergy, and the tyranny of popularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific recommender systems, such as Google Scholar and Web of Science, are essential tools for discovery. Search algorithms that power work through stigmergy, a collective intelligence mechanism that surfaces useful paths through repeated engagement. While generally effective, this ``rich-get-richer'' dynamic results in a small number of high-profile papers that dominate visibility. This essay argues argue that these algorithm over-reliance on popularity fosters intellectual homogeneity and exacerbates structural inequities, stifling innovative and diverse perspectives critical for scientific progress. We propose an overhaul of search platforms to incorporate user-specific calibration, allowing researchers to manually adjust the weights of factors like popularity, recency, and relevance. We also advise platform developers on how word embeddings and LLMs could be implemented in ways that increase user autonomy. While our suggestions are particularly pertinent to aligning recommender systems with scientific values, these ideas are broadly applicable to information access systems in general.

      <title>CoIR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Code Information Retrieval Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the substantial success of Information Retrieval (IR) in various NLP tasks, most IR systems predominantly handle queries and corpora in natural language, neglecting the domain of code retrieval. Code retrieval is critically important yet remains under-explored, with existing methods and benchmarks inadequately representing the diversity of code in various domains and tasks. Addressing this gap, we present COIR (Code Information Retrieval Benchmark), a robust and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess code retrieval capabilities. COIR comprises ten meticulously curated code datasets, spanning eight distinctive retrieval tasks across seven diverse domains. We first discuss the construction of COIR and its diverse dataset composition. Further, we evaluate nine widely used retrieval models using COIR, uncovering significant difficulties in performing code retrieval tasks even with state-of-the-art systems. To facilitate easy adoption and integration within existing research workflows, COIR has been developed as a user-friendly Python framework, readily installable via pip. It shares same data schema as other popular benchmarks like MTEB and BEIR, enabling seamless cross-benchmark evaluations. Through COIR, we aim to invigorate research in the code retrieval domain, providing a versatile benchmarking tool that encourages further development and exploration of code retrieval systems. https://github.com/CoIR-team/coir.</description>

      <title>LLM-based relevance assessment still can't replace human relevance assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for relevance assessment in information retrieval has gained significant attention, with recent studies suggesting that LLM-based judgments provide comparable evaluations to human judgments. Notably, based on TREC 2024 data, Upadhyay et al. make a bold claim that LLM-based relevance assessments, such as those generated by the UMBRELA system, can fully replace traditional human relevance assessments in TREC-style evaluations. This paper critically examines this claim, highlighting practical and theoretical limitations that undermine the validity of this conclusion. First, we question whether the evidence provided by Upadhyay et al. really supports their claim, particularly if a test collection is used asa benchmark for future improvements. Second, through a submission deliberately intended to do so, we demonstrate the ease with which automatic evaluation metrics can be subverted, showing that systems designed to exploit these evaluations can achieve artificially high scores. Theoretical challenges -- such as the inherent narcissism of LLMs, the risk of overfitting to LLM-based metrics, and the potential degradation of future LLM performance -- must be addressed before LLM-based relevance assessments can be considered a viable replacement for human judgments.</description>

      <title>ActionPiece: Contextually Tokenizing Action Sequences for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative recommendation (GR) is an emerging paradigm where user actions are tokenized into discrete token patterns and autoregressively generated as predictions. However, existing GR models tokenize each action independently, assigning the same fixed tokens to identical actions across all sequences without considering contextual relationships. This lack of context-awareness can lead to suboptimal performance, as the same action may hold different meanings depending on its surrounding context. To address this issue, we propose ActionPiece to explicitly incorporate context when tokenizing action sequences. In ActionPiece, each action is represented as a set of item features. Given the action sequence corpora, we construct the vocabulary by merging feature patterns as new tokens, based on their co-occurrence frequency both within individual sets and across adjacent sets. Considering the unordered nature of feature sets, we further introduce set permutation regularization, which produces multiple segmentations of action sequences with the same semantics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/google-deepmind/action_piece.</description>

      <title>Pseudo Relevance Feedback is Enough to Close the Gap Between Small and Large Dense Retrieval Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling dense retrievers to larger large language model (LLM) backbones has been a dominant strategy for improving their retrieval effectiveness. However, this has substantial cost implications: larger backbones require more expensive hardware (e.g. GPUs with more memory) and lead to higher indexing and querying costs (latency, energy consumption). In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by introducing PromptPRF, a feature-based pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) framework that enables small LLM-based dense retrievers to achieve effectiveness comparable to much larger models.
  PromptPRF uses LLMs to extract query-independent, structured and unstructured features (e.g., entities, summaries, chain-of-thought keywords, essay) from top-ranked documents. These features are generated offline and integrated into dense query representations via prompting, enabling efficient retrieval without additional training. Unlike prior methods such as GRF, which rely on online, query-specific generation and sparse retrieval, PromptPRF decouples feedback generation from query processing and supports dense retrievers in a fully zero-shot setting.
  Experiments on TREC DL and BEIR benchmarks demonstrate that PromptPRF consistently improves retrieval effectiveness and offers favourable cost-effectiveness trade-offs. We further present ablation studies to understand the role of positional feedback and analyse the interplay between feature extractor size, PRF depth, and model performance. Our findings demonstrate that with effective PRF design, scaling the retriever is not always necessary, narrowing the gap between small and large models while reducing inference cost.</description>

      <title>GENIUS: A Generative Framework for Universal Multimodal Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval is an emerging approach in information retrieval that generates identifiers (IDs) of target data based on a query, providing an efficient alternative to traditional embedding-based retrieval methods. However, existing models are task-specific and fall short of embedding-based retrieval in performance. This paper proposes GENIUS, a universal generative retrieval framework supporting diverse tasks across multiple modalities and domains. At its core, GENIUS introduces modality-decoupled semantic quantization, transforming multimodal data into discrete IDs encoding both modality and semantics. Moreover, to enhance generalization, we propose a query augmentation that interpolates between a query and its target, allowing GENIUS to adapt to varied query forms. Evaluated on the M-BEIR benchmark, it surpasses prior generative methods by a clear margin. Unlike embedding-based retrieval, GENIUS consistently maintains high retrieval speed across database size, with competitive performance across multiple benchmarks. With additional re-ranking, GENIUS often achieves results close to those of embedding-based methods while preserving efficiency.</description>

      <title>FinSage: A Multi-aspect RAG System for Financial Filings Question Answering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging large language models in real-world settings often entails a need to utilize domain-specific data and tools in order to follow the complex regulations that need to be followed for acceptable use. Within financial sectors, modern enterprises increasingly rely on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems to address complex compliance requirements in financial document workflows. However, existing solutions struggle to account for the inherent heterogeneity of data (e.g., text, tables, diagrams) and evolving nature of regulatory standards used in financial filings, leading to compromised accuracy in critical information extraction. We propose the FinSage framework as a solution, utilizing a multi-aspect RAG framework tailored for regulatory compliance analysis in multi-modal financial documents. FinSage introduces three innovative components: (1) a multi-modal pre-processing pipeline that unifies diverse data formats and generates chunk-level metadata summaries, (2) a multi-path sparse-dense retrieval system augmented with query expansion (HyDE) and metadata-aware semantic search, and (3) a domain-specialized re-ranking module fine-tuned via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to prioritize compliance-critical content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinSage achieves an impressive recall of 92.51% on 75 expert-curated questions derived from surpasses the best baseline method on the FinanceBench question answering datasets by 24.06% in accuracy. Moreover, FinSage has been successfully deployed as financial question-answering agent in online meetings, where it has already served more than 1,200 people.</description>

      <title>Context is Gold to find the Gold Passage: Evaluating and Training Contextual Document Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A limitation of modern document retrieval embedding methods is that they typically encode passages (chunks) from the same documents independently, often overlooking crucial contextual information from the rest of the document that could greatly improve individual chunk representations.
  In this work, we introduce ConTEB (Context-aware Text Embedding Benchmark), a benchmark designed to evaluate retrieval models on their ability to leverage document-wide context. Our results show that state-of-the-art embedding models struggle in retrieval scenarios where context is required. To address this limitation, we propose InSeNT (In-sequence Negative Training), a novel contrastive post-training approach which combined with late chunking pooling enhances contextual representation learning while preserving computational efficiency. Our method significantly improves retrieval quality on ConTEB without sacrificing base model performance. We further find chunks embedded with our method are more robust to suboptimal chunking strategies and larger retrieval corpus sizes. We open-source all artifacts at https://github.com/illuin-tech/contextual-embeddings.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Financial Equity Research Reports -- Identification of the Most Frequently Asked Questions in Financial Analyst Reports to Automate Equity Research Using Llama 3 and GPT-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research dissects financial equity research reports (ERRs) by mapping their content into categories. There is insufficient empirical analysis of the questions answered in ERRs. In particular, it is not understood how frequently certain information appears, what information is considered essential, and what information requires human judgment to distill into an ERR. The study analyzes 72 ERRs sentence-by-sentence, classifying their 4940 sentences into 169 unique question archetypes. We did not predefine the questions but derived them solely from the statements in the ERRs. This approach provides an unbiased view of the content of the observed ERRs. Subsequently, we used public corporate reports to classify the questions' potential for automation. Answers were labeled "text-extractable" if the answers to the question were accessible in corporate reports. 78.7% of the questions in ERRs can be automated. Those automatable question consist of 48.2% text-extractable (suited to processing by large language models, LLMs) and 30.5% database-extractable questions. Only 21.3% of questions require human judgment to answer. We empirically validate using Llama-3-70B and GPT-4-turbo-2024-04-09 that recent advances in language generation and information extraction enable the automation of approximately 80% of the statements in ERRs. Surprisingly, the models complement each other's strengths and weaknesses well. The research confirms that the current writing process of ERRs can likely benefit from additional automation, improving quality and efficiency. The research thus allows us to quantify the potential impacts of introducing large language models in the ERR writing process. The full question list, including the archetypes and their frequency, will be made available online after peer review.</description>

      <title>SAGE: A Framework of Precise Retrieval for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01713v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated significant proficiency in conducting question-answering (QA) tasks within a specified corpus. Nonetheless, numerous failure instances of RAG in QA still exist. These failures are not solely attributable to the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs); instead, they predominantly arise from the retrieval of inaccurate information for LLMs due to two limitations: (1) Current RAG methods segment the corpus without considering semantics, making it difficult to find relevant context due to impaired correlation between questions and the segments. (2) There is a trade-off between missing essential context with fewer context retrieved and getting irrelevant context with more context retrieved.
  In this paper, we introduce a RAG framework (SAGE), to overcome these limitations. First, to address the segmentation issue without considering semantics, we propose to train a semantic segmentation model. This model is trained to segment the corpus into semantically complete chunks. Second, to ensure that only the most relevant chunks are retrieved while the irrelevant ones are ignored, we design a chunk selection algorithm to dynamically select chunks based on the decreasing speed of the relevance score, leading to a more relevant selection. Third, to further ensure the precision of the retrieved chunks, we propose letting LLMs assess whether retrieved chunks are excessive or lacking and then adjust the amount of context accordingly. Experiments show that SAGE outperforms baselines by 61.25% in the quality of QA on average. Moreover, by avoiding retrieving noisy context, SAGE lowers the cost of the tokens consumed in LLM inference and achieves a 49.41% enhancement in cost efficiency on average. Additionally, our work offers valuable insights for boosting RAG.</description>

      <title>User Altruism in Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Users of social media platforms based on recommendation systems (RecSys) (e.g. TikTok, X, YouTube) strategically interact with platform content to influence future recommendations. On some such platforms, users have been documented to form large-scale grassroots movements encouraging others to purposefully interact with algorithmically suppressed content in order to "boost" its recommendation; we term this behavior user altruism. To capture this behavior, we study a game between users and a RecSys, where users provide the RecSys (potentially manipulated) preferences over the contents available to them, and the RecSys -- limited by data and computation constraints -- creates a low-rank approximation preference matrix, and ultimately provides each user her (approximately) most-preferred item. We compare the users' social welfare under truthful preference reporting and under a class of strategies capturing user altruism. In our theoretical analysis, we provide sufficient conditions to ensure strict increases in user social welfare under user altruism, and provide an algorithm to find an effective altruistic strategy. Interestingly, we show that for commonly assumed recommender utility functions, effectively altruistic strategies also improve the utility of the RecSys! We show that our results are robust to several model misspecifications, thus strengthening our conclusions. Our theoretical analysis is complemented by empirical results of effective altruistic strategies on the GoodReads dataset, and an online survey on how real-world users behave altruistically in RecSys. Overall, our findings serve as a proof-of-concept of the reasons why traditional RecSys may incentivize users to form collectives and/or follow altruistic strategies when interacting with them.</description>

      <title>ECoRAG: Evidentiality-guided Compression for Long Context RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in Open-Domain Question Answering (ODQA) by leveraging external documents through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). To reduce RAG overhead, from longer context, context compression is necessary. However, prior compression methods do not focus on filtering out non-evidential information, which limit the performance in LLM-based RAG. We thus propose Evidentiality-guided RAG, or ECoRAG framework. ECoRAG improves LLM performance by compressing retrieved documents based on evidentiality, ensuring whether answer generation is supported by the correct evidence. As an additional step, ECoRAG reflects whether the compressed content provides sufficient evidence, and if not, retrieves more until sufficient. Experiments show that ECoRAG improves LLM performance on ODQA tasks, outperforming existing compression methods. Furthermore, ECoRAG is highly cost-efficient, as it not only reduces latency but also minimizes token usage by retaining only the necessary information to generate the correct answer. Code is available at https://github.com/ldilab/ECoRAG.</description>
