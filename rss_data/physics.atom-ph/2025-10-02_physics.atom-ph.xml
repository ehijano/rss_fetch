      <title>Anisotropic and non-additive interactions of a Rydberg impurity in a quantum bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for treating anisotropic and non-additive impurity-bath interactions - features that are ubiquitous in realistic quantum impurity problems, but are often neglected in conventional approaches relying on additive, spherically symmetric pseudopotentials. To illustrate this, we focus on a Rydberg atom immersed in a Bose-Einstein condensate, where the internal-state degeneracy of the Rydberg impurity gives rise to configuration-dependent non-additive potentials. With increasing interaction strength, anisotropy-induced partial-wave mixing generates distinct polaron and molaron resonances, allowing for radially and angularly excited bound states to become accessible. This approach captures the anisotropy and non-additivity characteristic of a Rydberg impurity immersed in a quantum bath, and provides broad applicability to a host of quantum impurity problems beyond the Fr\"ohlich paradigm.</description>

      <title>Robust Rydberg facilitation via rapid adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a robust implementation of Rydberg antiblockade based on rapid adiabatic passage. Although Rydberg antiblockade offers key opportunities in quantum information processing and sensing, its sensitivity to position disorder and parameter imperfections has posed a central roadblock. By adiabatically sweeping across the interaction-shifted resonance, our approach is unaffected by realistic levels of disorder and parameter variations. As a straightforward application case, we show that it naturally gives rise to avalanche excitation growth in both one- and two-dimensional arrays. This avalanche process yields high gain with exceptionally low background, making it promising for rare-event detection. These results establish a practical route to robust Rydberg antiblockade dynamics, paving the way for future experimental and technological applications.</description>

      <title>Temporal Pulse Origins in Atom Interferometric Quantum Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors based upon atom interferometry typically rely on radio-frequency or optical pulses to coherently manipulate atomic states and make precise measurements of inertial and gravitational effects. An advantage of these sensors over their classical counterparts is often said to be that their measurement scale factor is precisely known and highly stable. However, in practice the finite pulse duration makes the sensor scale factor dependent upon the pulse shape and sensitive to variations in control field intensity, frequency, and atomic velocity. Here, we explore the concept of a temporal pulse origin in atom interferometry, where the inertial phase response of any pulse can be parameterized using a single point in time. We show that the temporal origin permits a simple determination of the measurement scale factor and its stability against environmental perturbations. Moreover, the temporal origin can be treated as a tunable parameter in the design of tailored sequences of shaped pulses to enhance scale factor stability and minimize systematic errors. We demonstrate through simulations that this approach to pulse design can reduce overall sequence durations while increasing robustness to realistic fluctuations in control field amplitude. Our results show that the temporal pulse origin explains a broad class of systematic errors in existing devices and enables the design of short, robust pulses which we expect will improve the performance of current and next-generation interferometric quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Quantum Many-body Chaos in Non-Hermitian Quantum Spin Chain via Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase transitions from chaotic to nonchaotic dynamics in a quantum spin chain with a local non-Hermitian disorder, which can be realized with a Rydberg atom array setting. As the disorder strength increases, the emergence of nonchaotic dynamics is qualitatively captured through the suppressed growth of Krylov complexity, and quantitatively identified through the reciprocity breaking of Krylov space. We further find that the localization in Krylov space generates another transition in the weak disorder regime, suggesting a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results closely align with conventional methods, such as the entanglement entropy and complex level spacing statistics, and pave the way to explore non-Hermitian phase transitions using Krylov complexity and associated metrics.</description>

      <title>Hyperspherical Analysis of Dimer-Dimer Scattering in One-Dimensional Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Attosecond-resolved probing of recolliding electron wave packets in liquids and aqueous solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy (HHS) in liquids promises real-time access to ultrafast electronic dynamics in the native environment of chemical and biological processes. While electron recollision has been established as the dominant mechanism of high-harmonic generation (HHG) in liquids, resolving the underlying electron dynamics has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate attosecond-resolved measurements of recolliding electron wave packets, extending HHS from neat liquids to aqueous solutions. Using phase-controlled two-colour fields, we observe a linear scaling of the two-colour delay that maximizes even-harmonic emission with photon energy, yielding slopes of 208+/-55 as/eV in ethanol and 124+/-42 as/eV in water, the latter matching ab initio simulations (125+/-48 as/eV). In aqueous salt solutions, we uncover interference minima whose appearance depends on solute type and concentration, arising from destructive interference between solute and solvent emission. By measuring the relative phase of solvent and solute HHG, we retrieve a variation of electron transit time by 113+/-32 as/eV, consistent with our neat-liquid results. These findings establish HHS as a powerful attosecond-resolved probe of electron dynamics in disordered media, opening transformative opportunities for studying ultrafast processes such as energy transfer, charge migration, and proton dynamics in liquids and solutions.</description>
