      <title>Stationary distribution approximations of Two-island Wright-Fisher and seed-bank models using Stein's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two finite population Markov chain models, the two-island Wright-Fisher model with mutation, and the seed-bank model with mutation. Despite the relatively simple descriptions of the two processes, the the exact form of their stationary distributions is in general intractable. For each of the two models we provide two approximation theorems with explicit upper bounds on the distance between the stationary distributions of the finite population Markov chains, and either the stationary distribution of a two-island diffusion model, or the beta distribution. We show that the order of the bounds, and correspondingly the appropriate choice of approximation, depends upon the relative sizes of mutation and migration. In the case where migration and mutation are of the same order, the suitable approximation is the two-island diffusion model, and if migration dominates mutation, then the weighted average of both islands is well approximated by a beta random variable. Our results are derived from a new development of Stein's method for the stationary distribution of the two-island diffusion model for the weak migration results, and utilising the existing framework for Stein's method for the Dirichlet distribution.</description>

      <title>Dynamics-based Feature Augmentation of Graph Neural Networks for Variant Emergence Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a major driver of new surges has been the emergence of new variants. When a new variant emerges in one or more countries, other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The impact of the new variant and the timings of epidemic peaks in a country highly depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest and has a significant prevalence. Can we predict when a variant existing elsewhere will arrive in a given region? To address this question, we propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach. First, we derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across pairs of regions (countries) that apply to a large class of epidemic models. The dynamics motivate the introduction of certain features in the GNN. We demonstrate that our proposed dynamics-informed GNN outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). To advance research in this area, we introduce a benchmarking tool to assess a user-defined model's prediction performance across 87 countries and 36 variants.</description>
