      <title>Enhancing the Practical Reliability of Shor's Quantum Algorithm via Generalized Period Decomposition: Theory and Large-Scale Empirical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a generalized period decomposition approach, significantly improving the practical reliability of Shor's quantum factoring algorithm. Although Shor's algorithm theoretically enables polynomial-time integer factorization, its real-world performance heavily depends on stringent conditions related to the period obtained via quantum phase estimation. Our generalized decomposition method relaxes these conditions by systematically exploiting arbitrary divisors of the obtained period, effectively broadening the applicability of each quantum execution. Extensive classical simulations were performed to empirically validate our approach, involving over one million test cases across integers ranging from 2 to 8 digits. The proposed method achieved near-perfect success rates, exceeding 99.998% for 7-digit numbers and 99.999% for 8-digit numbers, significantly surpassing traditional and recently improved variants of Shor's algorithm. Crucially, this improvement is achieved without compromising the algorithm's polynomial-time complexity and integrates seamlessly with existing quantum computational frameworks. Moreover, our method enhances the efficiency of quantum resource usage by minimizing unnecessary repetitions, making it particularly relevant for quantum cryptanalysis with noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. This study thus provides both theoretical advancements and substantial practical benefits, contributing meaningfully to the field of quantum algorithm research and the broader field of quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of the Unitary Hitting Time Problem: No Universal Time-Step Selector and an Operational No-Go for Finite-Time Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Unitary Hitting Time Problem (UHTP) in quantum dynamics. Given computably described pure states |a&gt;, |b&gt; and a time-dependent unitary U(t), define the hitting time as the infimum of t &gt; 0 such that the fidelity between U(t)|a&gt; and |b&gt; reaches a fixed threshold (with infinity if the threshold is never reached). We prove that there is no total algorithm that outputs this hitting time for all inputs; equivalently, the total UHTP is undecidable via a reduction from the halting problem. Operationally, we show a no-go theorem: for any fixed accuracy parameters, there is no universal finite-resource protocol that, for all computably described inputs, correctly outputs the hitting time while obeying uniform finite upper bounds on observation time and on dissipation/work. The proofs use reversible computation embedded into unitary dynamics, a fixed-target beacon construction, and a continuous-time lifting via piecewise-constant Hamiltonians. Our results target systems capable of embedding universal computation and complement prior undecidability results such as spectral-gap and quantum-control reachability. We distinguish logical time (inside the equations) from physical/operational time (of preparation, evolution, measurement), and show that universal time-step selection is impossible in both senses.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum Kolmogorov-Arnold Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks is a novel multilayer neuromorphic network that can exhibit higher accuracy than a neural network. It can learn and predict more accurately than neural networks with a smaller number of parameters, and many research groups worldwide have adopted it. As a result, many types of applications have been proposed. This network can be used as a generator solely or with a Generative Adversarial Network; however, KAN has a slower speed of learning than neural networks for the number of parameters. Hence,it has not been researched as a generator. Therefore, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network called Generative Adversarial Variational Quantum KAN that uses Variational Quantum KAN as a generator. This method enables efficient learning with significantly fewer parameters by leveraging the computational advantages of quantum circuits and their output distributions. We performed the training and generation task on MNIST and CIFAR10, and revealed that our method can achieve higher accuracy than neural networks and Quantum Generative Adversarial Network with less data.</description>

      <title>Choi echo: dynamical irreversibility and local decoherence in quantum many-body chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying intrinsic irreversibility in open quantum dynamics is central to understanding decoherence and information loss in many-body systems. In this work, we introduce the Choi echo, which provides an operational interpretation of the purity of the Choi state, the state representation of a quantum channel, as a quantifier of the robustness of quantum correlations against local information erasure. We employ this framework to analyze the reduced dynamics of a subsystem and to test whether local decoherence probes quantum chaos in many-body systems. Across paradigmatic spin chain models, we show that while the Choi echo captures key dynamical features, it also exhibits intrinsic limitations that, in certain regions of parameter space, restrict its ability to resolve the integrable-to-chaos transition at the level of spectral correlations. In particular, we demonstrate that local decoherence can spuriously signal quantum chaos in integrable regimes, tracing them to the inability of a strictly local probe to distinguish efficient coherent transport from genuinely scrambling dynamics. Our results show that local decoherence signals are controlled by the entanglement generated between the probe and its environment during the dynamics, rather than by spectral correlations, clarifying the practical scope of local dynamical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic and Operational Measures of Quantum Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an information -- theoretic framework for quantifying Kochen-Specker contextuality. Two complementary measures are introduced: the mutual information energy, a state-independent quantity inspired by Onicescu's information energy that captures the geometric overlap between joint eigenspaces within a context; and an operational measure based on commutator expectation values that reflects contextual behavior at the level of measurement outcomes. We establish a hierarchy of bounds connecting these measures to the Robertson uncertainty relation, including spectral, purity-corrected, and operator norm estimates. The framework is applied to the Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) scenario for spin-1 systems, where all quantities admit closed-form expressions. The Majorana-stellar representation furnishes a common geometric platform on which both the operational measure and the uncertainty products can be analyzed. For spin-1, this representation yields a three-dimensional Euclidean-like visualization of the Hilbert space in which, states lying on a plane exhibit maximum uncertainty for the observable along the perpendicular direction; simultaneous optimization across all KCBS contexts singles out a unique state on the symmetry axis. Notably, states achieving the optimal sum of uncertainty products exhibit vanishing operational contextuality, while states with substantial operational contextuality satisfy a nontrivial Robertson bound -- the two extremes are achieved by distinct quantum states.</description>

      <title>Crystalline Spectral Form Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate crystalline-like behavior of the spectral form factor (SFF) in unitary quantum systems with extremely strong eigenvalue repulsion. Using a low-temperature Coulomb gas as a model of repulsive eigenvalues, we derive the Debye-Waller factor suppressing periodic oscillations of the SFF and estimate the order of its singularities at multiples of the Heisenberg time. We also reproduce this crystalline-like behavior using perturbed permutation circuits and random matrix ensembles associated with Lax matrices. Our results lay a foundation for future studies of quantum systems that exhibit intermediate level statistics between standard random matrix ensembles and permutation circuits.</description>

      <title>Correlation and Entanglement partners in Gaussian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to identify where the total correlations and entanglement with a chosen degree of freedom reside within the rest of a system, in the context of bosonic many-body Gaussian quantum systems. Our results are organized into two main propositions. First, for pure Gaussian states, we show that every correlated mode possesses a unique single-degree-of-freedom partner that fully captures its correlations (consisting of entanglement), and we provide an explicit construction of this partner from the complex structure of the system's state. Second, for mixed Gaussian states, we constructively demonstrate that the notion of a partner subsystem splits into two: a correlation partner, which contains all classical and quantum correlations and need not correspond to a single degree of freedom, and an entanglement partner, which is always at most single-mode. Finally, we extend the construction of partners to multi-mode subsystems. Together, these results provide conceptual practical tools to study how bipartite correlations and entanglement are structured and where they can be found in complex Gaussian many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Equations for Feedback Control of Open Quantum Systems III: Full counting statistics for jump-based feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general feedback protocol based on quantum-jump detections, where the last detected jump channel is stored in a memory and subsequently used to implement a feedback action, such as modifying the system Hamiltonian conditioned on the last jump. We show that the time evolution of this general protocol can be described by a Lindblad master equation defined in a hybrid classical-quantum space, where the classical part encodes the stored measurement record (memory) and the quantum part represents the monitored system. Moreover, we show that this new representation can be used to fully characterize the counting statistics of a system subject to a general jump-based feedback protocol. We apply the formalism to a three-level system coupled to two thermal baths operating as a thermal machine, and we show that jump-based feedback can be used to convert the information obtained from the jump detections into work. Our framework provides analytical tools that enable the characterization of key statistical properties of any counting observable under jump-based feedback, such as the average current, noise, correlation functions, and power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Universal and non-universal facets of quantum critical phenomena unveiled along the Schmidt decomposition theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the spin magnitude $S$ on the quantum Gr\"uneisen parameter $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ right at critical points (CPs) for the 1D Ising model under a transverse magnetic field. Our findings are fourfold: $\textit{i)}$ for higher $S$, $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ is increased, but remains finite, reflecting the enhancement of the Hilbert space dimensionality; $\textit{ii)}$ the Schmidt decomposition theorem recovers the extensivity of the nonadditive $q$-entropy $S_q$ only for a $\textit{special}$ value of the entropic index $q$; $\textit{iii)}$ the universality class in the frame of $S_q$ depends only on the symmetry of the system; $\textit{iv)}$ we propose an experimental setup to explore finite size effects in connection with the Hilbert space occupation at CPs. Our findings unveil both universal and non-universal aspects of quantum criticality in terms of $\Gamma^{0\text{K}}_q$ and $S_q$.</description>

      <title>Digital Coherent-State QRNG Using System-Jitter Entropy via Random Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully digital framework that replicates the statistical behavior of coherent-state quantum random number generation (QRNG) by harnessing system timing jitter through random permutation processes. Our approach transforms computational timing variations from hardware and operating system sources into permutation dynamics that generate Poisson-distributed numbers, accurately reproducing the photon statistics of optical coherent states. The theoretical foundation is established by the Uniform Convergence Theorem, which provides exponential convergence to uniformity under modular projection with rigorous error bounds. Extensive experimental validation across multiple parameter regimes and sample sizes up to $10^8$ bytes demonstrates exceptional performance: Shannon entropy approaching 7.999998 bits/byte and min-entropy exceeding 7.99 bits/byte, outperforming theoretical bounds at scale. The architecture inherently resists side-channel attacks through compound timing distributions and adaptive permutation behavior, while operating without classical cryptographic post-processing. Our results establish that coherent-state QRNG functionality can be entirely realized through classical computational processes, delivering mathematically provable uniformity and practical cryptographic security without quantum photonic hardware.</description>

      <title>Network-Irreducible Multiparty Entanglement in Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the standard approach to characterize collective entanglement via genuine multiparty entanglement (GME) leads to an area law in ground and thermal Gibbs states of local Hamiltonians. To capture the truly collective part one needs to go beyond this short-range contribution tied to interfaces between subregions. Genuine network multiparty entanglement (GNME) achieves a systematic resolution of this goal by analyzing whether a $k$-party state can be prepared by a quantum network consisting of $(k-1)$-partite resources. We develop tools to certify and quantify GNME, and benchmark them for GHZ, W and Dicke states. We then study the 1d transverse field Ising model, where we find a sharp peak of GNME near the critical phase transition, and rapid suppression elsewhere. Finite temperature leads to a faster death of GNME compared to GME. Furthermore, certain 2d quantum spin liquids do not have GNME in microscopic subregions while possessing strong GME. This approach will allow to chart truly collective entanglement in quantum matter both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Solutions of Koopman-von Neumann equations, their superpositions, orthogonality and uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formulation brings classical mechanics to Hilbert space, but many techniques familiar from quantum mechanics remain missing. One would hope to solve eigenvalue problems, obtain orthonormal eigenstates of Hermitian operators and ascribe meaning to a coherent superposition of states, among other things. Here we consider the general KvN equation for a classical probability amplitude and show that its so-called gauge freedom allows the separation of variables. The amenability to Hilbert-space methods of the resulting KvN solutions is investigated. We construct superpositions from differently-gauged Liouvillian eigenstates, and find an orthonormal set among them. We find that some separable solutions describe the canonical ensemble with temperature related to the separation constant. Classical uncertainty relations arise naturally in the KvN formalism. We discuss one between the dynamical time and the Liouvillian in terms of the statistical description of classical systems.</description>

      <title>Investigating Different Barren Plateaus Mitigation Strategies in Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms suffer from barren plateaus, where gradients vanish with system size and circuit depth. Although many mitigation strategies exist, their connection to convergence performance under different iteration budgets remains unclear. Moreover, a systematic analysis identifying which state-of-the-art mitigation techniques perform best under specific scenarios is also lacking. We benchmark four approaches, Local-Global, Adiabatic, State Efficient Ansatz (SEA), and Pretrained VQE, against standard VQE on molecular systems from 4 to 14 qubits, analyzing gradient variance up to 50 layers and convergence over 1000 iterations. Our results show that the impact of gradient preservation is iteration-dependent. In the 14-qubit BeH2 system, Pretrained VQE outperforms SEA at 100 iterations despite lower gradient variance, but SEA becomes 2.2x more accurate at 1000 iterations. For smaller systems, SEA achieves near-exact energies (H2: 10^-5 Ha, LiH: 2x10^-4 Ha) with fidelities 0.999, while standard methods plateau early. The results demonstrate that robust barren plateau mitigation depends on aligning the chosen strategy with both system size and available computational budget, rather than treating gradient variance as the sole predictor of performance.</description>

      <title>Negative Marginal Densities in Mixed Quantum-Classical Liouville Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixed quantum-classical Liouville equation (QCLE) provides an approximate perturbative framework for describing the dynamics of systems with coupled quantum and classical degrees of freedom of disparate thermal wavelengths. The evolution governed by the Liouville operator preserves many properties of full quantum dynamics, including the conservation of total population, energy, and purity, and has shown quantitative agreement with exact quantum results for the expectation values of many observables where direct comparisons are feasible. However, since the QCLE density matrix operator is obtained from the partial Wigner transform of the full quantum density matrix, its matrix elements can have negative values, implying that the diagonal matrix elements behave as pseudo-densities rather than densities of classical phase space. Here, we compare phase-space distributions generated by exact quantum dynamics with those produced by QCLE evolution from pure quantum initial states. We show that resonance effects in the off-diagonal matrix elements differ qualitatively, particularly for low-energy states. Furthermore, numerical and analytical results for low-dimensional models reveal that the QCLE can violate the positivity of marginal phase-space densities, a property that should hold at all times for any physical system. A perturbative analysis of a model system confirms that such violations arise generically. We also show that the violations of positivity of the marginal densities vanish as the initial energy of the system increases relative to the energy gap between subsystem states. These findings suggest that a negativity index, quantifying deviations from positivity, may provide a useful metric for assessing the validity of mixed quantum\textendash{}classical descriptions.</description>

Abstract: Noiseless linear amplifiers (NLAs) serve as an effective means to enable long-distance continuous-variable (CV) quantum key distribution (QKD), even under realistic conditions with non-unit reconciliation efficiency. Separately, unitary averaging has been suggested to mitigate some stochastic noise, including phase noise in continuous-variable states. In this work, we combine these two protocols to simultaneously compensate for thermal-loss effects and suppress phase noise, thereby enabling long-distance CV QKD that surpasses the repeaterless bound, the fundamental rate-distance limit, for repeaterless quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>On Shor's conjecture on the accessible information of quantum dichotomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around the turn of the century, Shor formulated his well-known and still-open conjecture stating that the accessible information of any quantum dichotomy, that is the maximum amount of classical information that can be decoded from a binary quantum encoding, is attained by a von Neumann measurement. A quarter of a century later, new developments on the Lorenz curves of quantum dichotomies in the field of quantum majorization and statistical comparison may provide the key to unlock such a longstanding open problem. Here, we first investigate the tradeoff relations between accessible information and guessing probability in the binary case, thus disproving the claimed monotonicity of the former quantity in the latter that, if true, would have settled Shor's problem in the qubit case. Our second result is to provide a state-dependent generalization of extremality for quantum measurements, to characterize state-dependent extremality for qubit dichotomies, and to apply such results to tighten previous results on the accessible information of qubit dichotomies.</description>

      <title>Creation of Depth-Confined, Shallow Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond With Tunable Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond holds the key to unlocking new advances in nanoscale quantum sensing. We find that the creation of near-surface NVs through delta doping during diamond growth allows for tunable control over both NV depth confinement (with a twofold improvement relative to low-energy ion implantation) and NV density, ultimately resulting in highly-sensitive single defects and ensembles with coherence limited by NV-NV interactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility of our shallow delta-doped NVs by imaging magnetism in few-layer CrSBr, a two-dimensional magnet. We anticipate that the control afforded by near-surface delta doping will enable new developments in NV quantum sensing from nanoscale NMR to entanglement-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional quantum key distribution (HD-QKD) enhances information efficiency and noise tolerance by encoding data in large Hilbert spaces. The orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light provides a scalable basis for such encoding and supports high-dimensional photonic communication. Practical OAM-based implementations remain constrained by challenges in state generation, transmission, and detection. This survey offers a consolidated overview of OAM-encoded HD-QKD, outlining fundamental principles, representative experiments, and system-level limitations. Recent progress in hybrid encodings, mode sorting, adaptive optics, and TF, CV, MDI, and DI frameworks is summarized with emphasis on practical feasibility.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Magnetic Sensing for Infrastructure-free Geo-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern navigation systems rely heavily on Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), whose weak spaceborne signals are vulnerable to jamming, spoofing, and line-of-sight blockage. As an alternative, the Earth's magnetic field entails location information and is found critical to many animals' cognitive and navigation behavior. However, the practical use of the Earth's magnetic field for geo-localization hinges on an ultra-sensitive magnetometer. This work investigates how quantum magnetic sensing can be used for this purpose. We theoretically derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for the estimation error of quantum sensing when using a nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center and prove the quantum advantage over classical magnetometers. Moreover, we employ a practical distributed quantum sensing protocol to saturate CRLB. Based on the estimated magnetic field and the earth's magnetic field map, we formulate geo-localization as a map-matching problem and introduce a coarse-to-fine Mahalanobis distance search in both gradient space (local field derivatives) and corner space (raw field samples). We simulate the proposed quantum sensing-based geo-localization framework over four cities in the United States and Canada. The results report that in high-gradient regions, gradient-space Mahalanobis search achieves sub-kilometer median localization error; while in magnetically smoother areas, corner-space search provides better accuracy and a $4-8\times$ reduction in runtime.</description>

      <title>Why cut-and-choose quantum state verification cannot be both efficient and secure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state verification plays a vital role in many quantum cryptographic protocols, as it allows the use of quantum states from untrusted sources. While some progress has been made in this direction, the question of whether the most prevalent type of quantum state verification, namely cut-and-choose verification, can be efficient and secure, is still not answered in full generality. In this work, we show a fundamental limit for quantum state verification for all cut-and-choose approaches used to verify arbitrary quantum states. We provide a no-go result showing that the cut-and-choose techniques cannot lead to quantum state verification protocols that are both efficient in the number of rounds and secure. We show this trade-off for stand-alone and composable security, where the scaling of the lower bound for the security parameters renders cut-and-choose quantum state verification effectively unusable.</description>

      <title>Maritime object classification with SAR imagery using quantum kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing causes global economic losses of \$10-25 billion annually and undermines marine sustainability and governance. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) provides reliable maritime surveillance under all weather and lighting conditions, but classifying small maritime objects in SAR imagery remains challenging. We investigate quantum machine learning for this task, focusing on Quantum Kernel Methods (QKMs) applied to real and complex SAR chips extracted from the SARFish dataset. We tackle two binary classification problems, the first for distinguishing vessels from non-vessels, and the second for distinguishing fishing vessels from other types of vessels. We compare QKMs applied to real and complex SAR chips against classical Laplacian, RBF, and linear kernels applied to real SAR chips. Using noiseless numerical simulations of the quantum kernels, we find that QKMs are capable of obtaining equal or better performance than the classical kernel on these tasks in the best case, but do not demonstrate a clear advantage for the complex SAR data. This work presents the first application of QKMs to maritime classification in SAR imagery and offers insight into the potential and current limitations of quantum-enhanced learning for maritime surveillance.</description>

      <title>Quantum limits of a space-time reference frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the limitations for defining spatial and temporal intervals when the only available reference frame is a single composite quantum system, whose internal degrees of freedom serve as a temporal reference, a clock, and whose center of mass degrees of freedom act as a spatial reference, a rod. By combining quantum speed limits with the mass energy equivalence of special relativity, we show that spatial localizability and temporal resolution are not independent: sharpening one inevitably blurs the other. Specifically, the internal energy coherence needed for precise timekeeping affects the center of mass dynamics, enhancing position spreading during free evolution. As a result, a single composite system cannot act as a perfect quantum reference frame for both space and time, leading to a Heisenberg like uncertainty relation between spatial and temporal intervals. After analyzing this trade off from an external perspective, we formulate it in a purely relational manner, by means of covariant observables relative to the space time quantum reference frame, uncovering an additional intrinsic uncertainty of order the Compton wavelength of the frame.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer-based quantum simulation of fermion dynamics with local qubit encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamical properties of large-scale many-fermion systems is a longstanding goal of quantum chemistry, material science and condensed matter. Local fermion-to-qubit encodings have opened a new path for practical fermionic simulations on digital quantum hardware where fermionic statistics are not enforced at the hardware level. In this paper, we explore these local encodings from the perspective of the corresponding time-evolution unitaries. Specifically, we propose a new framework for digital implementations of these qubit-encoded fermionic time-evolution unitaries based on \emph{flow sets}, which are one-dimensional subsets of the directed fermionic interaction graph. We find that any local fermionic encoding, when restricted to a given flow set, adopts a simple structure that we can classify systematically. For each categorized flow-set form, we propose a low-depth qubit quantum circuit that implements the time evolution unitary using the stabilizer formalism. As an application of our construction, we introduce novel flow-based decompositions for known two-dimensional encodings, leading to efficient circuit decompositions of time-evolution unitaries. We generally observe a space-time trade-off, where mappings with larger qubit-to-fermion ratios yield shallower time-evolution quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal flow of fluctuations, populations and correlations between doubly coupled bosonic modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interesting new correlation and unidirectional properties of two bosonic modes under the influence of environment appear when the modes are mutually coupled through the simultaneously applied linear mode-hopping and nonlinear squeezing interactions. Under such double coupling, it is found that while the Hamiltonian of the system is clearly Hermitian the dynamics of the quadrature components of the field operators can be attributed to non-Hermicity of the system. It is manifested in an asymmetric coupling between the quadrature components which then leads to a variety of remarkable features. In particular, we identify how the emerging exceptional point controls the conversion of thermal states of the modes into single-mode classically or quantum squeezed states. Furthermore, for reservoirs being in squeezed states, we find that the two-photon correlations present in these reservoirs are responsible for unidirectional flow of populations and correlations among the modes and the flow can be controlled by appropriate tuning of the mutual orientation of the squeezed noise ellipses. In the course of analyzing these effects we find that the flow of the population creates the first-order coherence between the modes which, on the other hand rules out an enhancement of the two photon correlations responsible for entanglement between the modes. These results suggest new alternatives for the creation of single mode squeezed fields and the potential applications for controlled unidirectional transfer of population and correlations in bosonic chains.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Contextuality and quantum discord"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper, Al-Qasimi [Physics Letters A 449 (2022) 128347] studied contextuality of two-qubit states using an argument by Peres [Phys. Lett. A 151 (1990) 107]. For two-qubit system in the Werner state, Al-Qasimi argued that only when discord is zero, the system is noncontextual. Here I point out that this argument is false and the related work in C. Jebarathinam and R. Srikanth [Int. J. Quantum Inf. https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219749925500376 (arXiv:2403.01762v2)].</description>

      <title>Processing through encoding: Quantum circuit approaches for point-wise multiplication and convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces quantum circuit methodologies for pointwise multiplication and convolution of complex functions, conceptualized as "processing through encoding". Leveraging known techniques, we describe an approach where multiple complex functions are encoded onto auxiliary qubits. Applying the proposed scheme for two functions $f$ and $g$, their pointwise product $f(x)g(x)$ is shown to naturally form as the coefficients of part of the resulting quantum state. Adhering to the convolution theorem, we then demonstrate how the convolution $f*g$ can be constructed. Similarly to related work, this involves the encoding of the Fourier coefficients $\mathcal{F}[f]$ and $\mathcal{F}[g]$, which facilitates their pointwise multiplication, followed by the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform. We discuss the simulation of these techniques, their integration into an extended \verb|quantumaudio| package for audio signal processing, and present initial experimental validations. This work offers a promising avenue for quantum signal processing, with potential applications in areas such as quantum-enhanced audio manipulation and synthesis.</description>

      <title>Bell, Spinors, and the Impossibility of a Classical Spin-Vector Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Bell--CHSH scenario for two spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) particles and isolate the precise algebraic origin of the Bell contradiction. On the quantum side, spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) is described by a noncommutative spinor (Clifford) algebra acting on the Hilbert space of two spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) particles, with the singlet state yielding the usual correlation \(E(a,b) = -\,a\cdot b\) and Tsirelson's bound \(2\sqrt{2}\). On the classical side, the standard Bell assumptions amount to describing all measurement outcomes as \(\{\pm1\}\)-valued random variables on a single Kolmogorov probability space, i.e.\ elements of a commutative algebra \(\mathcal{C}(\Lambda)\).
  We show that there is no representation of the spinor algebra of spin-\(\tfrac{1}{2}\) (with its singlet state and locality structure) into any such commutative Kolmogorov algebra that preserves the \(\{\pm1\}\) spectra of local spin components and the singlet correlations entering the CHSH expression, under the standard Bell assumptions of locality (factorization) and measurement independence. In this sense, the Bell--CHSH contradiction is exhibited as an algebraic mismatch between a noncommutative spinor/Clifford description of spin and the classical assumption of a single global Kolmogorov space supporting all outcomes. In the language of quantum probability, this is a C\(^*\)-algebraic reformulation of the known fact that the singlet correlations admit no local hidden-variable model with jointly distributed outcomes on one probability space.
  We also give an explicit realization of the same spinor structure within the author's Quantum Index Algebra (QIA) framework, where locality appears as disjoint index slots and the singlet state as a simple index cocycle.</description>

      <title>NetQMPI: An MPI-Inspired software for programming Distributed Quantum Applications over Quantum Networks using NetQASM SDK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC) is essential for scaling quantum algorithms beyond the limitations of monolithic NISQ devices. However, the current software ecosystem forces developers to manually orchestrate low-level network resources, such as entanglement generation (EPR pairs) and classical synchronization, leading to verbose, error-prone, and non-scalable code. This paper introduces \textbf{NetQMPI}, a high-level Python framework that adapts the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard to the quantum domain using the Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm. Built as a middleware over the NetQASM SDK, NetQMPI abstracts the underlying physical topology, automating network initialization and resource management through a unified Communicator interface. We propose semantic point-to-point primitives and novel collective operations--such as expose and unexpose--that address the constraints of the No-Cloning Theorem by leveraging multipartite entanglement for data distribution. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that NetQMPI decouples algorithmic logic from network size, reducing the code complexity for generating an $N$-node GHZ state from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to constant complexity $\mathcal{O}(1)$. Furthermore, the framework ensures backend agnosticism, enabling the seamless execution of high-level applications on rigorous physical simulators like NetSquid (via SquidASM) and future quantum hardware adhering to the NetQASM standard.</description>

      <title>Irreducibility of Quantum Markov Semigroups, uniqueness of invariant states and related properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present different characterizations of the notion of irreducibility for Quantum Markov Semigroups (QMSs) and investigate its relationship with other relevant features of the dynamics, such as primitivity, positivity improvement and relaxation; in particular, we show that irreducibility, primitivity and relaxation towards a faithful invariant density are equivalent when the semigroup admits an invariant density. Moreover, in the case of uniformly continuous QMSs, we present several useful ways of checking irreducibility in terms of the operators appearing in the generator in GKLS form. Our exposition is as much self-contained as possible, we present some well known results with elementary proofs (collecting all the relevant literature) and we derive new ones. We study both finite and infinite dimensional evolutions and we remark that many results only require the QMS to be made of Schwarz maps.</description>

      <title>Equilibration and the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis as Limits to Observing Macroscopic Quantum Superpositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Macroscopic quantum superpositions are widely believed to be unobservable because large systems cannot be perfectly isolated from their environments. Here, we show that even under perfect isolation, intrinsic unitary dynamics with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis suppress the observable signatures of macroscopic coherence. Using the GHZ state as a representative example, we demonstrate that while fully correlated measurements can initially distinguish a macroscopic superposition from its corresponding classical mixture, generic many-body evolution renders them operationally indistinguishable for most times during the evolution. By analyzing both distinguishability measures and established quantifiers of macroscopic quantumness, we find that equilibration not only hides coherence from accessible observables but also suppresses macroscopic superpositions themselves. These results identify unitary thermalization, independent of environmental decoherence, as a fundamental mechanism that limits the emergence of macroscopic quantum effects.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter we review results on the lattice Schwinger model. In par-ticular, we show how the effect of the anomaly is reproduced on the lattice. We connect these results to recent developments in the field of quantum simulation of interacting field theories.

      <title>A slightly improved upper bound for quantum statistical zero-knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity class Quantum Statistical Zero-Knowledge ($\mathsf{QSZK}$), introduced by Watrous (FOCS 2002) and later refined in Watrous (SICOMP, 2009), has the best known upper bound $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$, which was simplified following the inclusion $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \subseteq \mathsf{PSPACE}$ established in Jain, Upadhyay, and Watrous (FOCS 2009). Here, $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the class of promise problems that admit two-message quantum interactive proof systems in which the honest prover is typically \textit{computationally unbounded}, and $\text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the complement of $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$.
  We slightly improve this upper bound to $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ with a quantum linear-space honest prover. A similar improvement also applies to the upper bound for the non-interactive variant $\mathsf{NIQSZK}$. Our main techniques are an algorithmic version of the Holevo-Helstrom measurement and the Uhlmann transform, both implementable in quantum linear space, implying polynomial-time complexity in the state dimension, using the recent space-efficient quantum singular value transformation of Le Gall, Liu, and Wang (CC, to appear).</description>

      <title>The Casimir-Polder interaction between atoms and hollow-core fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Casimir-Polder force acts on polarizable particles due to quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field that are modified by the presence of material bodies. We investigate the Casimir-Polder interaction for atoms near cylindrical fibers with hollow cores. This geometry represents one of the archetypal configurations encountered in numerous experimental setups designed to control and manipulate atoms in fundamental and quantum technological applications. Specifically, we analyze how the interplay of both geometrical and material-related length scales characterize the interaction, emphasizing the impact of the shell thickness. We develop a flexible and fast-converging numerical scheme for evaluating the interaction over a wide range of atom-cylinder separations at both zero and finite temperature. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analytical investigation of how various material properties modify the Casimir-Polder potential. Finally, we analyze and discuss a number of limiting cases and compare numerical computations with corresponding analytical asymptotic expressions. In particular, in this geometry the Casimir-Polder potential is able to distinguish between an ohmic and non-ohmic description of conductors. One of the most significant outcomes of our work is that the shell thickness emerges as a useful parameter for controlling the interaction, opening avenues for both fundamental physics and applications in quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Tailoring quantum walks in integrated photonic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike discrete photonic circuits, which manipulate photons step-by-step using a series of optical elements, arrays of coupled waveguides enable photons to interfere continuously across the entire structure. When composed of a nonlinear material, such arrays can also directly generate quantum states of light within the circuit. To clarify the similarities and distinctions between these two approaches of quantum walks, we conduct here a systematic comparison between linear waveguide arrays, injected with photons produced externally, and nonlinear arrays, where photon pairs are continuously generated via parametric down-conversion. We experimentally validate these predictions using III-V semiconductor nonlinear waveguide lattices with varied geometries, enabling us to tune the depth of the quantum walks over an order of magnitude and reveal the gradual emergence of non-classicality in the output state. Finally, we demonstrate an inverse-design approach to engineer \textit{aperiodic} waveguide arrays, whose optimized coupling profiles generate maximally entangled states such as the biphoton W-state. These results highlight the potential of continuously-coupled photonic systems to harness high-dimensional entanglement within compact architectures.</description>

      <title>Boltzmann to Lindblad: Classical and Quantum Approaches to Out-of-Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open quantum systems play a central role in contemporary nanoscale technologies, including molecular electronics, quantum heat engines, quantum computation and information processing. A major theoretical challenge is to construct dynamical models that are simultaneously consistent with classical thermodynamics and complete positivity. In this work, we develop a framework that addresses this issue by extending classical stochastic dynamics to the quantum domain. We begin by formulating a generalized Langevin equation in which both friction and noise act symmetrically on the two Hamiltonian equations. From this, we derive a generalized Klein-Kramers equation expressed in terms of Poisson brackets, and we show that it admits the Boltzmann distribution as its stationary solution while satisfying the first and second laws of thermodynamics along individual trajectories. Applying canonical quantization to this classical framework yields two distinct quantum master equations, depending on whether the friction operators are taken to be Hermitian or non-Hermitian. By analyzing the dynamics of a harmonic oscillator, we determine the conditions under which these equations reduce to a Lindblad-type generator. Our results demonstrate that complete positivity is ensured only when friction and noise are included in both Hamiltonian equations, thus fully justifying the classical construction. Moreover, we find that the friction coefficients must satisfy the same positivity condition in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian formulations, revealing a form of universality that transcends the specific operator representation. The formalism offers a versatile tool for deriving quantum versions of the thermodynamic laws and is directly applicable to a wide class of nonequilibrium nanoscale systems.</description>

      <title>Tight bound for the total time in digital-analog quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing (DAQC) is a universal computational paradigm that combines the evolution under an entangling Hamiltonian with the application of single-qubit gates. Since any unitary operation can be decomposed into a sequence of evolutions generated by two-body Hamiltonians, DAQC is inherently well-suited for realizing such operations. Suboptimal upper bounds for the total time required to perform these evolutions have been previously proposed. Here, we improve these limits by providing a tight bound for this crucial parameter, which shows a linear dependence with the number of couplings. This result enables a precise estimation of the time resources needed for quantum simulations and quantum algorithms implemented within the DAQC framework, facilitating a rigorous comparison with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Polarization Entanglement in Atomic Biphotons via OAM-to-Spin Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate polarization-entangled biphotons in a cold-atom double-$\Lambda$ system, overcoming atomic selection rules that suppress polarization correlations and favor orbital angular momentum (OAM) entanglement. Using spatial light modulators, we coherently map a selected two-dimensional OAM subspace onto the polarization basis and thereby open an otherwise inaccessible polarization channel. Quantum-state tomography confirms that the mapping preserves the biphoton coherence. The four polarization Bell states are generated with fidelities of $92\text{-}94\%$ with few-percent statistical uncertainties, and an average Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt parameter of $S=2.44$ verifies the survival of nonlocal correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first demonstration of OAM-to-polarization entanglement transfer in a cold-atom spontaneous four-wave mixing platform and establishes a practical interface for integrating atomic OAM resources with polarization-based quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Highly Nondegenerate Entangled Photon Source for Fiber-Based Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entangled photon sources (EPSs) are essential building blocks for scalable quantum communication and quantum key distribution (QKD). We present a stable, highly nondegenerate EPS based on type-0 spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) in a crossed-crystal configuration, generating photon pairs at 680~nm and 1550~nm when pumped by a 473~nm laser. This wavelength combination, reported here for the first time, simultaneously benefits from the peak detection efficiency of the most of the Si-SPADs in the visible/near-infrared spectral range and the low-loss fiber transmission of the telecom C-band. This configuration provides the most favorable balance between performance and cost for detection using Si-SPADs and InGaAs detectors. The source exhibits a measured spectral bandwidth of 300~GHz, corresponding to a spectral brightness of up to $1.9\times 10^3$~pairs~s$^{-1}$~mW$^{-1}$~GHz$^{-1}$. Heralding efficiencies reach 18~\% (signal) and 34~\% (idler) with Si-SPAD and superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPD) detection. The entangled state achieves visibilities of $(97.3\pm 1.0)\,\%$ in the H/V basis and $(94.9\pm1.6)\,\%$ in the D/A basis, yielding a fidelity of $\geq(96.1\pm1.3)\,\%$. These results establish the presented EPS as a practical wavelength-hybrid platform for fiber-based QKD and emerging long-haul quantum network architectures.</description>

      <title>Basis dependence of Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically levitated nanoparticles are promising candidates for the generation of macroscopic quantum states of mechanical motion. Protocols to generate such states expose the particle to a succession of different potentials. Limited reproducibility of the alignment of these potentials across experimental realizations introduces additional noise. Here, we experimentally investigate and model how such shot-to-shot noise limits the coherence length of a levitated nanoparticle during a state-expansion protocol using a dark, inverted electrical potential. We identify electric stray fields and mechanical instabilities as major sources of shot-to-shot fluctuations. We discuss the resulting experimental requirements for state expansion protocols exploiting inverted potentials.</description>

      <title>Nuclear magnetic resonance on a single atom with a local probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nuclear spin is a prime candidate for quantum information applications due to its weak coupling to the environment and inherently long coherence times. However, this weak coupling also challenges the addressability of the nuclear spin. Here we demonstrate nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) on a single on-surface atom using a local scanning probe. We employ an electron-nuclear double resonance measurement scheme and resolve nuclear spin transitions of a single 47Ti isotope with a nuclear spin of I = 5/2. The quadrupole interaction enables to resolve multiple NMR transitions, which are consistent with our eigenenergy calculations. Our experimental results indicate that the nuclear spin can be driven efficiently irrespective of its hybridization with the electron spin, which is required for direct control of the nuclear spin in the long-lifetime regime. This investigation of NMR on a single atom in a platform with atomic-scale control is a valuable development for other platforms deploying nuclear spins for characterization techniques or quantum information technology.</description>

      <title>Tailored Error Mitigation for Single-Qubit Magnetometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing is an emerging field with the potential to outperform classical methods in both precision and spatial resolution. However, the sensitivity of the underlying quantum platform also makes the sensors highly susceptible to their environmental noise. To address this issue, techniques from the field of quantum error mitigation use information about the noise to improve measurement results. We present a novel mitigation technique for quantum sensors to efficiently reverse the effects of any noise that can be described by a completely positive trace preserving map. The method leverages the knowledge acquired by a pre-characterization step of the device to automatically adapt to the complexity of the dissipative evolution and to indicate optimal sensing times $\tau$ to achieve the most accurate results. We demonstrate that our method reaches the best achievable sensitivity in noisy single-NV-center magnetometry.
  This work marks a further step toward more resilient quantum sensors with the smallest scale of resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kernel trick is a widely applicable technique in machine learning domains that maps datasets that are difficult to classify into a computationally friendly feature space. As the dimension of the dataset scales, these kernel calculations can quickly become computationally intractable or data inefficient. In this work, we extend prior efforts in quantum kernel design for Kerr nonlinear devices by implementing time-dependent simulations of a Kerr-qubit coupled to acoustic resonators. For experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that the Kerr nonlinearity directly induces non-classical behavior in the multimode system, which we use to define and analyze a quantum-enhanced kernel. Finally, we present a brief scaling characterization that demonstrates the computational intractability of classically simulating the kernel as the number of resonators scales.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Coupled Sensor-Ancilla Qubits for Multiparameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing optimal control for multiparameter quantum sensing is essential for approaching the ultimate precision limits. However, analytical solutions are generally available only for simple systems, while realistic scenarios often involve coupled qubits and time-dependent Hamiltonians. Here we numerically investigate optimal control of a two-qubit sensor-ancilla system coupled via an Ising term using Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering (GRAPE) to minimize the objective function. By seeding the optimization recursively with solutions obtained for smaller coupling strengths and selecting a suitable initial guess, we achieve robust convergence and high precision across a wide range of interaction strengths and field configurations. The proposed approach offers a practical route toward high-sensitivity, robust multiparameter magnetometry and it is applicable to solid-state quantum sensors such as nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in realistic experimental settings.</description>

Both Hermitian ($J_1 = J_2$) and non-Hermitian ($J_1 \neq J_2$) hopping regimes are analyzed. Within the framework of Floquet theory, the time-dependent Hamiltonian is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian, enabling a detailed study of the quasi-energy spectrum and eigenstate localization as function of the driving frequency $\omega$. We identify critical frequencies $\omega_c$ at which nearly equidistant quasi-energy ladders emerge, characterized by a pronounced minimum in the normalized variance of level spacings. This spectral regularity, which coincides with a peak in the mean inverse participation ratio (\textrm{MIPR}), leads to robust periodic revivals and Bloch-like oscillations in the time evolution. Numerical simulations confirm that such coherent oscillations persist even in the non-Hermitian regime, where the periodic driving stabilizes an almost real and uniformly spaced quasi-energy ladder.</description>

      <title>Spectral side channels in quantum key distribution under laser damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the transmitter of a quantum key distribution (QKD) system, a dense wavelength-division multiplexer (DWDM) is typically used to combine quantum and synchronization signals and is directly connected to the quantum channel. As a result, it becomes the first optical component exposed to laser-injection attacks. Therefore, understanding the behavior of DWDMs under such attacks is essential for assessing the practical security of QKD systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the characteristics of DWDMs under high-power laser illumination. Our experimental results show that certain DWDM samples exhibit pronounced changes in their spectral features once the injected laser power surpasses a specific threshold. Taking the Trojan-horse attack as an illustrative example, we further perform a theoretical analysis of the resulting spectral side channel and show that it can reduce the maximum secure transmission distance to below 66.9% of its original value. By combining experimental observations with theoretical modeling, this study advances the understanding of the influence of DWDMs on the practical security of QKD systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interaction-free ghost imaging scheme based on a thermal light source. By utilizing the quantum Zeno-like effect, our approach significantly reduces the light dose absorbed by the sample, thereby effectively preventing sample damage induced by light-matter interactions. Combined with the elimination of entangled photon sources and single-photon detectors, our approach enables significantly more photons to be utilized for image reconstruction, thereby markedly enhancing image quality compared to conventional ghost imaging. We further demonstrate active suppression of background noise via controllable photon loss. Our work offers a practical and cost-effective route to non-destructive, high-quality imaging for light-sensitive samples in fields such as life sciences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization instability is a critical challenge for polarization-entangled satellite quantum key distribution (QKD), where atmospheric effects and platform motion continuously distort photon polarization. To maintain entanglement fidelity, these transformations must be precisely identified and compensated before detection. The channel-induced polarization rotation of a classical reference signal (beacon) is characterized using liquidcrystal variable retarders as a compact and fast polarizationcompensation approach, enabling real-time polarization tracking for satellite QKD links.</description>

      <title>Qubits in second quantisation in fermionic simulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating many-body fermionic systems in conventional qubit-based quantum computers poses significant challenges due to the overheads associated with the encoding of fermionic statistics in qubits, leading to the proposal of native fermionic simulators as an alternative. While allowing for fermionic problems to be simulated efficiently, this class of fermionic simulators carries also specific constraints with them and poses other challenges unfamiliar to qubit systems. Here, we propose to pair fermionic modes to form a so-called qubit in second quantisation representation. This allows fermionic gates to be represented as rotations of these second quantised qubits, enabling adaptation of methods for qubit systems. As an application, we use this pairing scheme to represent the measurement of two- and four-point correlators in fermionic simulators with its native gates as a graph problem. Optimising measurement settings is then analysed with various analytical and algorithmic methods.</description>

      <title>Entanglement generation in qubit-ADAPT-VQE through four-qubit algebraic classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, their scalability is often hindered by the barren plateau problem. Among the proposals that have demonstrated robustness against this issue, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm stands out for ground state estimation, primarily due to its iterative ansatz construction. Although ADAPT-VQE has been extensively benchmarked on molecular Hamiltonians, where the ground states typically exhibit low entanglement, its performance for highly entangled ground states remains largely unexplored. In this work, we explore a variant of this algorithm known as qubit-ADAPT-VQE, assessing its ability to achieve ground states with substantial entanglement in spin models. We focus on four-qubit systems and employ an algebraic entanglement classification to identify distinct entanglement classes among ground states, and consider a representative of each class as an initial state to evaluate the performance of the algorithm. Our findings highlight the versatility of qubit-ADAPT-VQE, demonstrating that it accurately reaches the ground state across all entanglement classes and initial energy values.</description>

      <title>CNOT gates in inductively coupled multi-fluxonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity two-qubit gates have been demonstrated in systems of two fluxonium qubits; however, the realization of scalable quantum processors requires maintaining low error rates in substantially larger architectures. In this work, we analyze a system of four inductively coupled fluxonium qubits to determine the impact of spectator qubits on the performance of a \textsc{cnot} gate. Our results show that spectator-induced errors are strongly suppressed when the transition frequencies of the spectator qubits are sufficiently detuned from those of the active qubits. We identify favorable frequency configurations for the four-qubit chain that yield \textsc{cnot} gate errors below $10^{-4}$ for gate times shorter than 100 ns. Leveraging the locality of the nearest-neighbor coupling, we extrapolate our findings to longer fluxonium chains, suggesting a viable path toward scalable, low-error quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Computing the molecular ground state energy in a restricted active space using quantum annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Calculating the molecular ground-state energy is a central challenge in computational chemistry. Conventional methods such as the Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction scale exponentially with molecular size, limiting their applicability to large molecules. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by mapping molecular Hamiltonians by qubits, enabling cheaper computational scaling. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to formulate molecular ground state calculations as discrete optimization problems, addressable by quantum annealing. However, these efforts have been limited by previous generations of hardware and suboptimal annealing techniques. Here, the $H_{2}O$ ground-state problem is mapped to an Ising Hamiltonian using the Xian-Bias-Kas (XBK) method. By taking advantage of enhanced qubit connectivity and shorter embedding chains, it is solved with a more than doubled probability of achieving Hartree-Fock-level solutions with respect to the most advanced predecessor. Advanced annealing strategies extend Hartree-Fock-level accuracy to significantly larger problem instances, enabling solutions that use nearly 2.5 times more physically embedded qubits than the largest cases previously reported and allowing to improve annealing results by two orders of magnitude, reaching an energy difference of 0.120~Hartree relative to Hartree-Fock. These results show tangible progress toward practical quantum annealing applications in NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an unsupervised machine-learning framework that discovers optimally compressed representations of quantum many-body ground states. Using an autoencoder neural network architecture on data from $L$-site Fermi-Hubbard models, we identify minimal latent spaces with a sharp reconstruction quality threshold at $L-1$ latent dimensions, matching the system's intrinsic degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the use of the trained decoder as a differentiable variational ansatz to minimize energy directly within the latent space. Crucially, this approach circumvents the $N$-representability problem, as the learned manifold implicitly restricts the optimization to physically valid quantum states.</description>

      <title>A Vlasov-Bohm approach to Quantum Mechanics for statistical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory to describe microscopic phenomena. It was derived in different ways over the past 100 years by Heisenberg, Schr\"{o}dinger, and Feynman. At the same time, other interpretations have been suggested, including the Bohm-De Broglie interpretation and the so-called Bohmian mechanics. Here, we show that Bohmian mechanics, which utilizes the concept of the Bohm quantum potential, can also serve as a starting point for quantizing classical non-relativistic systems. By incorporating the Bohm quantum potential into the Vlasov framework, we obtain a mean-field theory that captures the corpuscular nature of matter, in agreement with quantum mechanics within the Random Phase Approximation (RPA).</description>

      <title>Quantum Krylov algorithm using unitary decomposition for exact eigenstates of fermionic systems using quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Krylov algorithms have emerged as a useful framework for quantum simulations in quantum chemistry and many-body physics, offering a favorable trade-off between potential quantum speedups and practical resource demands. However, the current primary approach to building Krylov vectors in these algorithms is to use real or imaginary-time evolution, which is not exact, require an arbitrary time-step parameter ($\Delta t$), and degrade the Krylov vectors quickly with increasing $\Delta t$. In this paper, we develop a quantum Krylov algorithm without time evolution and with an exact formulation of the Krylov subspace, named ``Quantum Krylov using Unitary Decomposition'' (QKUD), along with implementation proposals for quantum computers. Not only is this algorithm exact in the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ of the error parameter $\epsilon$, but it also produces more accurate Krylov vectors at $\epsilon \neq 0$ than conventional time evolution due to more favorable error scaling (O($\epsilon^2$) vs O($\Delta t$)). Through simulations, we demonstrate that these theoretical benefits yield numerical advantages: (i) QKUD provides numerically exact results at small $\epsilon$, (ii) it remains stable across a broad range of $\epsilon$ values, indicating low parameter sensitivity, and (iii) it can solve problems unreachable by conventional time evolution. This development resolves a central limitation of quantum Krylov algorithms, namely their inexactness and sensitivity to the time-step parameter, and paves the way for new and powerful quantum Krylov algorithms for quantum computers with a stronger promise of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>A Room-Temperature Extreme High Vacuum System for Trapped-Ion Quantum Information Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a room-temperature Extreme High Vacuum (XHV) system engineered to support the long-duration operation of a trapped-ion quantum processor. Background-gas collisions impose limitations on trapped-ion performance and scalability by interrupting algorithmic execution and, in some cases, ejecting ions from the trap. Using molecular-flow simulations, we optimize the chamber geometry, conductance pathways, and pumping configuration to maximize the effective pumping speed at the ion location. We perform high-temperature heat treatment of stainless steel vacuum components to achieve the desired outgassing rate, guided by quantitative relations of bulk diffusive processes, allowing us to reduce the \(\mathrm{H_2}\) outgassing load to the \(10^{-15}\,\mathrm{mbar\,l\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}\) level. The final pressure in our chamber, measured by a hot cathode gauge, is \(1.5\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{mbar}\), corresponding to the gauge's measurement limit. We measure the local pressure at the ion location by observing collision-induced reordering events in a long ion chain of mixed-isotope Yb\(^+\). From the observed reordering frequency, we extract the average interval between collisions to be \((1.9 \pm 0.1)\,\mathrm{hrs/ion}\). This corresponds to a local pressure of \((3.9 \pm 0.3)\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{mbar}\) at the ion location, assuming that all collisions arise from background H\(_2\) molecules at room temperature. Our demonstration extends the continuous operation time of a quantum processor while maintaining the simplicity of a room-temperature system that does not require cryogenic apparatus.</description>

      <title>Andreev spin qubits bound to Josephson vortices in spin-orbit coupled planar Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a variant of Andreev spin qubits (ASQs) defined in planar Josephson junctions based on spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in a weak out-of-plane magnetic field. The magnetic field induces a linear phase gradient across the junction, generating Josephson vortices that can host low-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs). We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the combined effect of the phase gradient and spin-orbit coupling stabilizes an odd-fermion parity ground state, where a single Josephson vortex binds a spinful low-energy degree of freedom that is energetically separated from the other ABSs. This low-energy degree of freedom can be exploited to define a special type of ASQ, which we dub the vortex spin qubit (VSQ). We show that single-qubit gates for VSQs can be performed via flux driving, while readout can be achieved by adapting standard circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) techniques developed for conventional ASQs. We further outline how an entangling two-qubit gate can be performed using an ac current drive. We argue that VSQs offer prospects for a substantial reduction in device complexity and hardware overhead compared to conventional ASQ implementations, while preserving key advantages such as supercurrent-based readout, single-qubit gates, and long-range two-qubit gates.</description>

Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.1763(5)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Q-BAR: Blogger Anomaly Recognition via Quantum-enhanced Manifold Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recommendation-driven online media, creators increasingly suffer from semantic mutation, where malicious secondary edits preserve visual fidelity while altering the intended meaning. Detecting these mutations requires modeling a creator's unique semantic manifold. However, training robust detector models for individual creators is challenged by data scarcity, as a distinct blogger may typically have fewer than 50 representative samples available for training. We propose quantum-enhanced blogger anomaly recognition (Q-BAR), a hybrid quantum-classical framework that leverages the high expressivity and parameter efficiency of variational quantum circuits to detect semantic anomalies in low-data regimes. Unlike classical deep anomaly detectors that often struggle to generalize from sparse data, our method employs a parameter-efficient quantum anomaly detection strategy to map multimodal features into a Hilbert space hypersphere. On a curated dataset of 100 creators, our quantum-enhanced approach achieves robust detection performance with significantly fewer trainable parameters compared to classical baselines. By utilizing only hundreds of quantum parameters, the model effectively mitigates overfitting, demonstrating the potential of quantum machine learning for personalized media forensics.</description>

      <title>Topological Order and Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in Generalized Ideal Chern Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractionalization in ideal Chern bands and non-Hermitian topological physics are two active but so far separate research directions. Merging these, we generalize the notion of ideal Chern bands to the non-Hermitian realm and uncover several striking consequences both on the level of band theory and in the strongly interacting regime. Specifically, we show that the lowest band of a Kapit--Mueller lattice model with an imaginary gauge potential satisfies a generalized ideal condition with complex Berry curvature in sync with a complex quantum metric. The ideal band remains purely real and exactly flat yet all right and left eigenstates accumulate at the boundaries on a cylinder, implying a non-Hermitian skin effect without an accompanying spectral winding. The skin effect is inherited by the many-body zero modes, yielding skin-Laughlin states with an exponential profile on the lattice. Moreover, at a critical strength of non-Hermiticity there is an unconventional phase transition on the torus, which is absent on the cylinder. Our findings lead to an extension of topological order in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Microgravity and Near-Absolute Zero: A New Frontier in Quantum Computing Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing qubits are notoriously fragile, requiring extreme isolation from environmental disturbances. This paper advances the hypothesis that a combination of microgravity and ultra-low temperature (near absolute zero) provides an almost "ideal" operating environment for quantum hardware. Under such conditions, gravitational perturbations, thermal noise, and vibrational disturbances are minimized, thereby significantly extending qubit coherence times and reducing error rates. We survey four leading qubit platforms - superconducting circuits, trapped ions, ultracold neutral atoms, and photonic qubits - and explain how each can benefit from a weightless, cryogenic setting. Recent experiments support this vision: Bose-Einstein condensates on the International Space Station (ISS) maintained matter-wave coherence far longer than on Earth, atomic clocks in orbit achieved record stability, and a photonic quantum computer deployed in space is demonstrating robust operation. Finally, we outline a proposed side-by-side experiment comparing identical quantum processors on the ground and in microgravity. Such a test would directly measure improvements in qubit coherence (T1, T2), gate fidelity, and readout accuracy when the influence of gravity is removed.</description>

      <title>Theory of Out-of-Time-Ordered Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective field theory (EFT) that captures the universal behavior of out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) at late times in generic quantum many-body systems with conservation laws. The EFT hinges on a generalization of the strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking pattern adapted to out-of-time-order observables, and reduces to conventional fluctuating hydrodynamics when time-ordered observables are probed. We use the EFT to explain different power-law behavior observed in OTOCs at late times, and show that many OTOCs are entirely fixed by conventional transport data. Nevertheless, we show that a specific combination of OTOCs is sensitive to novel transport parameters, not visible in regular time-ordered correlators. We test our predictions in Hamiltonian and Floquet spin chains in one dimension.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological scar subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework that extends the notion of symmetry-protected topological properties beyond the ground-state paradigm to dynamically isolated subspaces formed by exceptional non-thermal energy eigenstates of non-integrable systems, known as quantum many-body scars (QMBS). We introduce the concept of a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) scar subspace -- a Hilbert subspace stabilized by a restricted spectrum-generating algebra (rSGA) while being protected by on-site, inversion, and time-reversal symmetries. QMBS often admit a non-interacting quasiparticle description, which enables matrix-product representations with small bond dimension. Although individual QMBS do not necessarily retain the protecting symmetries of the Hamiltonian, we show that the subspace formed by the symmetry-connected QMBS does retain them, giving rise to consistently emerging topological properties across the entire scar subspace. Using the spin-$1$ Affleck--Kennedy--Lieb--Tasaki (AKLT) model, we demonstrate that its bimagnon scar subspace reflects the topological properties of the SPT ground state, as evidenced by the appropriate bond-space symmetry representations, the expected topological response, and the numerically verified long-range string order. Our findings indicate that scar subspaces can inherit -- and in inhomogeneous cases systematically modify -- the topological character of the SPT ground state, offering a new and experimentally accessible platform for probing symmetry-protected topology beyond the ground-state regime.</description>

      <title>QGEC : Quantum Golay Code Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers have the possibility of a much reduced calculation load compared with classical computers in specific problems. Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum systems perturbed by noise in the form of repeated interactions between the system and the environment. As the number of interactions (aka time steps) tends to infinity, we show, following the works by Pellegrini, that this system converges to the solution of a Volterra stochastic differential equation. This development sets interesting future research paths at the intersection of quantum algorithms, stochastic differential equations, weak convergence and large deviations.</description>

      <title>Spin-correlation dynamics: A semiclassical framework for nonlinear quantum magnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical nonlinear theories are highly successful in describing far-from-equilibrium dynamics of magnets, encompassing phenomena such as parametric resonance, ultrafast switching, and even chaos. However, at ultrashort length and time scales, where quantum correlations become significant, these models inevitably break down. While numerous methods exist to simulate quantum many-body spin systems, they are often limited to near-equilibrium conditions, capture only short-time dynamics, or obscure the intuitive connection between nonlinear behavior and its geometric origin in the su(2) spin algebra. To advance nonlinear magnetism into the quantum regime, we develop a theory in which semiclassical spin correlations, rather than individual spins, serve as the fundamental dynamical variables. Defined on the bonds of a bipartite lattice, these correlations are inherently nonlocal, with dynamics following through a semiclassical mapping that preserves the original spin algebra. The resulting semiclassical theory captures nonlinear dynamics that are entirely nonclassical and naturally accommodates phenomenological damping at the level of correlations, which is typically challenging to include in quantum methods. As an application, we focus on Heisenberg antiferromagnets, which feature significant quantum effects. We predict nonlinear scaling of the mean frequency of quantum oscillations in the N\'eel state with the spin quantum number S. These have no classical analog and exhibit features reminiscent of nonlinear parametric resonance, fully confirmed by exact diagonalization. The predicted dynamical features are embedded in the geometric structure of the semiclassical phase space of spin correlations, making their physical origin much more transparent than in full quantum methods. With this, semiclassical spin-correlation dynamics provide a foundation for exploring nonlinear quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>High magnetic field response of superconductivity dome in quantum artificial High Tc superlattices with variable geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that cuprate artificial high temperature superlattices (AHTS) with period d, composed of quantum wells confining interface space charge in stoichiometric Mott insulator layers (S), with thickness L, at the interface with overdoped normal metallic cuprate layers (N) show a superconducting dome by tuning the geometric L over d ratio of the SNSN superlattice with the top predicted by quantum material design engineering quantum size effects. Here we report high-field magneto transport measurements up to 41 Tesla of AHTS across the entire superconducting dome. The results show the universal upward-concave behavior of the temperature dependent upper critical magnetic field in low critical temperature samples at rising edge and drop edge of the dome providing compelling evidence for two-band superconductivity in agreement with multigap theory used for quantum design of the SNSN superlattices. The measured superconducting coherence length demonstrates that atomic-scale engineering controls not only the critical temperature but also the intrinsic pair size at Fano-Feshbach resonances physics paving the way toward next generation quantum devices and shedding light on unconventional superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: We present substantially generalized and improved quantum algorithms over prior work for inhomogeneous linear and nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODE). Specifically, we show how the norm of the matrix exponential characterizes the run time of quantum algorithms for linear ODEs opening the door to an application to a wider class of linear and nonlinear ODEs. In Berry et al., (2017), a quantum algorithm for a certain class of linear ODEs is given, where the matrix involved needs to be diagonalizable. The quantum algorithm for linear ODEs presented here extends to many classes of non-diagonalizable matrices. The algorithm here is also exponentially faster than the bounds derived in Berry et al., (2017) for certain classes of diagonalizable matrices. Our linear ODE algorithm is then applied to nonlinear differential equations using Carleman linearization (an approach taken recently by us in Liu et al., (2021)). The improvement over that result is two-fold. First, we obtain an exponentially better dependence on error. This kind of logarithmic dependence on error has also been achieved by Xue et al., (2021), but only for homogeneous nonlinear equations. Second, the present algorithm can handle any sparse, invertible matrix (that models dissipation) if it has a negative log-norm (including non-diagonalizable matrices), whereas Liu et al., (2021) and Xue et al., (2021) additionally require normality.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for Quantum Phase Estimation and Related Problems</title>

Abstract: Phase estimation, due to Kitaev [arXiv'95], is one of the most fundamental subroutines in quantum computing. In the basic scenario, one is given black-box access to a unitary $U$, and an eigenstate $\lvert \psi \rangle$ of $U$ with unknown eigenvalue $e^{i\theta}$, and the task is to estimate the eigenphase $\theta$ within $\pm\delta$, with high probability. The cost of an algorithm for us is the number of applications of $U$ and $U^{-1}$.
  We tightly characterize the cost of several variants of phase estimation where we are no longer given an eigenstate, but are required to estimate the maximum eigenphase of $U$, aided by advice in the form of states (or a unitary preparing those states) which are promised to have at least a certain overlap $\gamma$ with the top eigenspace.
  We give algorithms and nearly matching lower bounds for all ranges of parameters.
  We show that a small number of copies of the advice state (or of an advice-preparing unitary) are not significantly better than having no advice at all. We also show that having lots of advice (applications of the advice-preparing unitary) does not significantly reduce cost, and neither does knowledge of the eigenbasis of $U$. We immediately obtain a lower bound on the complexity of the Unitary recurrence time problem, resolving an open question of She and Yuen~[ITCS'23].
  Lastly, we study how efficiently one can reduce the error probability in the basic phase-estimation scenario. We show that a phase-estimation algorithm with precision $\delta$ and error probability $\epsilon$ has cost $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{\delta}\log\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)$, matching an easy upper bound. This contrasts with some other scenarios in quantum computing (e.g., search) where error-probability reduction costs only a factor $O(\sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})$. Our lower bound uses a variant of the polynomial method with trigonometric polynomials.</description>

Abstract: Current quantum technologies are at the cusp of becoming useful, but still face formidable obstacles such as noise. Noise severely limits the ability to scale quantum devices to the point that they would offer an advantage over classical devices. To understand the sources of noise it is necessary to fully characterise the quantum processes occurring across many time steps; only this would reveal any time-correlated noise called non-Markovian. Previous efforts have attempted such a characterisation but obtained only a limited reconstruction of such multi-time processes. In this work, we fully characterise a multi-time quantum process on superconducting hardware using in-house and cloud-based quantum processors. We achieve this by employing sequential measure-and-prepare operations combined with post-processing. Employing a recently developed formalism for multi-time processes, we detect general multi-time correlated noise. We also detect quantum correlated noise which demonstrates that part of the noise originates from quantum sources, such as physically nearby qubits on the chip.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum metrology robust against dissipation and non-adiabaticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Critical systems near quantum phase transitions were predicted to be useful for improvement of metrological precision, thanks to their ultra-sensitive response to a tiny variation of the control Hamiltonian. Despite the promising perspective, realization of criticality-enhanced quantum metrology is an experimentally challenging task, mainly owing to the extremely long time needed to encode the signal to some physical quantity of a critical system. We here circumvent this problem by making use of the critical behaviors in the Jaynes-Cummings model, comprising a single qubit and a photonic resonator, to which the signal field is coupled. The information about the field amplitude is encoded in the qubit's excitation number in the dark state, which displays a divergent changing rate at the critical point. The most remarkable feature of this critical sensor is that the performance is insensitive to the leakage to bright eigenstates, caused by decoherence and non-adiabatic effects. We demonstrate such a metrological protocol in a superconducting circuit, where an Xmon qubit, interacting with a resonator, is used as a probe for estimating the amplitude of a microwave field coupled to the resonator. The measured quantum Fisher information exhibits a critical quantum enhancement, confirming the potential of this system for quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>The genuinely multipartite nonlocality of graph states is model-dependent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bell's theorem proves that some quantum state correlations can only be explained by bipartite non-classical resources. The notion of genuinely multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) was later introduced to conceptualize the fact that nonclassical resources involving more than two parties in a nontrivial way may be needed to account for some quantum correlations. In this letter, we first recall the contradictions inherent to the historical definition of GMNL. Second, we turn to one of its redefinitions, called Local-Operations-and-Shared-Randomness GMNL (LOSR-GMNL), proving that all caterpillar graph states (including cluster states) have this second property. Finally, we conceptualize a third, alternative definition, which we call Local-Operations-and-Neighbour-Communication GMNL (LONC-GMNL), that is adapted to situations in which short-range communication between some parties might occur. We show that cluster states do not have this third property, while GHZ states do. Beyond its technical content, our letter illustrates that rigorous conceptual work is needed before applying the concepts of genuinely multipartite nonlocality, genuine multipartite entanglement or entanglement depth to benchmark the nonclassicality of some experimentally-produced quantum system. We note that most experimental works still use witnesses based on the historical definitions of these notions, which fail to reject models based on bipartite resources.</description>

Abstract: A difficulty in quantum logic is the well-known arbitrariness in choosing a binary operation for conditional among three principal candidates called the Sasaki, the contrapositive Sasaki, and the relevance conditional, mainly chosen from syntactical grounds. A fundamental problem remains to clarify their semantical differences manifest in operational concepts in quantum theory. Here, we attempt such an analysis through quantum set theory, developing models of quantum set theory built upon quantum logics with those three conditionals, each of which defines different quantum logical truth-value assignment for set theoretical statements. We show that each of them satisfies the transfer principle to determine the truth values of theorems of the ZFC set theory and defines the internal reals bijectively corresponding to the observables of the quantum system under consideration. Then, the truth values of their equality relations are identical irrespective of the chosen conditionals. Interestingly, however, their order relations exhibit a strong dependence on the specific conditional employed, while the order relation attains full truth value if and only if Olson's spectral order relation holds. We further characterize the order relation in terms of experimentally accessible relations for outcomes of successive projective measurements of the corresponding observables, showing that each choice has its own operational meaning with symmetry between the Sasaki and the contrapositive Sasaki conditionals, in contrast to the majority view that favors the Sasaki conditional. Our findings reveal that quantum set theory yields empirically testable predictions concerning state-dependent binary relations between quantum observables, thereby extending Born's probabilistic interpretation from propositions to relations.</description>

Abstract: We propose a device-independent null witness dimensionality test with bipartite measurements and input from two separate parties. The dimension is determined from the rank of the matrix of measurements for pairs of states prepared by the parties. We have applied the test to various IBM Quantum devices. The results demonstrate extreme precision of the test, which is able to detect disagreements with the qubit (two-level) space of bipartite measurement even in the presence of technical imperfections. The deviations beyond 6 standard deviations have no simple origin and need urgent explanations to unblock progress in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Ladder Operator Block-Encoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11641v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe and analyze LOBE (Ladder Operator Block-Encoding), a framework for block-encoding ladder operators that act upon fermionic and bosonic modes. In this framework, we achieve efficient block-encodings by applying the desired action of the operator onto the quantum state and pushing any undesired effects outside of the encoded subspace. This direct approach avoids any overhead caused by expanding the operators in another basis. We numerically benchmark these constructions using models arising in quantum field theories including the quartic harmonic oscillator, and $\phi^4$ and Yukawa Hamiltonians on the light front. These benchmarks show that LOBE often produces block-encodings with fewer non-Clifford operations, fewer block-encoding ancillae and overall number of qubits, and lower rescaling factors for various operators as compared to frameworks that expand the ladder operators in the Pauli basis. LOBE constructions also demonstrate favorable scaling with respect to key parameters, including the maximum occupation of bosonic modes, the total number of fermionic and bosonic modes, and the locality of the operators. LOBE is implemented as an open-source python package to enable further applications.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of a nuclear spin qubit register in silicon photonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Color centers provide an optical interface to quantum registers based on electron and nuclear spin qubits in solids. The T center in silicon is an emerging spin-photon interface that combines telecom O-band optical transitions and an electron spin in a scalable photonics platform. In this work, we demonstrate the initialization, coherent control, and state readout of a three-qubit register based on the electron spin of a T center coupled to a hydrogen and a silicon nuclear spin. The spin register exhibits spin echo coherence times of $0.41(2)$~ms for the electron spin, $112(12)$~ms for the hydrogen nuclear spin, and $67(7)$~ms for the silicon nuclear spin. We use nuclear-nuclear two-qubit gates to generate entanglement between the two nuclear spins with a fidelity of $F=0.77(3)$ and a coherence time of $T^*_2=2.60(8)$~ms. Our results show that a T center in silicon photonics can realize a multi-qubit register with an optical interface for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum Support Vector Regression for Robust Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01012v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomaly Detection (AD) is critical in data analysis, particularly within the domain of IT security. In this study, we explore the potential of Quantum Machine Learning for application to AD with special focus on the robustness to noise and adversarial attacks. We build upon previous work on Quantum Support Vector Regression (QSVR) for semisupervised AD by conducting a comprehensive benchmark on IBM quantum hardware using eleven datasets. Our results demonstrate that QSVR achieves strong classification performance and even outperforms the noiseless simulation on two of these datasets. Moreover, we investigate the influence of - in the NISQ-era inevitable - quantum noise on the performance of the QSVR. Our findings reveal that the model exhibits robustness to depolarizing, phase damping, phase flip, and bit flip noise, while amplitude damping and miscalibration noise prove to be more disruptive. Finally, we explore the domain of Quantum Adversarial Machine Learning by demonstrating that QSVR is highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with neither quantum noise nor adversarial training improving the model's robustness against such attacks.</description>

      <title>Composable framework for device-independent state certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying a quantum state in a device-independent (DI) manner, in which no trust is placed on the internal workings of any physical components, is a fundamental task bearing various applications in quantum information theory. The composability of a state certification protocol is key to its integration as a subroutine within information-theoretic protocols. In this work, we present a composable certification of quantum states in a DI manner under the assumption that a source prepares a finite sequence of independent quantum states that are not necessarily identical. We show that the security relies on the DI analog of the fidelity, called the extractability. We develop methods to compute this quantity under local operations and classical communication in certain Bell scenarios that self-test the singlet state, which may also be of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate our framework by certifying the singlet state in a composable and DI manner using the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum optical coherence tomography (QOCT) offers a simple way to cancel dispersion broadening in a sample while also providing twice the resolution compared to classical OCT. However, to achieve these advantages, a bright and broadband source of entangled photon pairs is required. A simple implementation uses collinear spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Michelson interferometer (MI), yet this autocorrelation scheme suffers from parasitic terms and sensitivity to phase noise. Here, we introduce a cross-correlation MI-based QOCT that overcomes these drawbacks, significantly advancing QOCT toward practical applications.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling for data-driven decoding of quantum error-correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Data-driven decoding (DDD) - learning to decode syndromes of (quantum) error-correcting codes by learning from data - can be a difficult problem due to several atypical and poorly understood properties of the training data. We introduce a theory of example importance that clarifies these unusual aspects of DDD: For instance, we show that DDD of a simple error-correcting code is equivalent to a noisy, imbalanced binary classification problem. We show that an existing importance sampling technique of training neural decoders on data generated with higher error rates introduces a tradeoff between class imbalance and label noise. We apply this technique to show robust improvements in the accuracy of neural network decoders trained on syndromes sampled at higher error rates, and provide heuristic arguments for finding an optimal error rate for training data. We extend these analyses to decoding quantum codes involving multiple rounds of syndrome measurements, suggesting broad applicability of both example importance and turning the knob for improving experimentally relevant data-driven decoders.</description>

      <title>High-Precision Measurement of Time Delay with Frequency-Resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel Interference of Weak Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a scheme for high-precision measurements of time delay based on frequency-resolved Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference. Our approach is applied to weak coherent states and exploits an array of single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs). Unlike conventional HOM experiments, our setup enables high-precision measurements producing an uncertainty per coincidence of about $\sim 10$ ps even for photons separated by delays up to $\sim 4$ ps so much greater than their coherence time where ordinary non-resolved HOM fails. This result confirms our newly developed theoretical predictions that consider, differently from previous theoretical results, a finite frequency resolution in the detection. We compare the performance of this scheme against the conventional non-resolved case. Experimental data align well with the predictions of quantum estimation theory, demonstrating a significant reduction in the uncertainty. Due to the physics of the frequency-resolved HOM effect, the gain in precision is particularly high when the estimated time delay is much longer than the coherence time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05732v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We improve Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) circuits by integrating the unitary averaging (UA) protocol, previously demonstrated to protect unknown Gaussian states from phase errors [Phys. Rev. A 110, 032622]. Our work extends the applicability of UA to mitigate arbitrary interferometric noise, including beam-splitter and phase-shifter imperfections. Through comprehensive numerical analysis, we demonstrate that UA consistently achieves higher fidelity and success probability compared to unprotected circuits, establishing its robustness in noisy conditions. Remarkably, enhancement is maintained across varying numbers of modes with respect to the noise. We further derive a power-law formula predicting performance gains in large-scale systems, including 100-mode and 216-mode configurations. A detailed step-by-step algorithm for implementing the UA protocol is also provided, offering a practical roadmap for advancing near-term quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The effect of partial post-selection on quantum discrimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discrimination of quantum states is a central problem in quantum information science and technology. Meanwhile, partial post-selection has emerged as a valuable tool for quantum state engineering. In this work, we bring these two areas together and ask whether partial measurements can enhance the discrimination performance between two unknown and non-orthogonal pure states. Our framework is general: the two unknown states interact with the same environment-set in a pure state-via an arbitrary unitary transformation. A partial measurement is then performed on one of the output modes, modeled by an arbitrary positive operator-valued measure (POVM). We then allow classical communication to inform the unmeasured mode of the outcome of the partial measurement on the other mode, which is subsequently measured by a POVM that is optimal in the sense that the probability of error is minimized. The two POVMs act locally and classical information is exchanged between the two modes, representing a single-round (feed-forward) form of local operations with classical communication. Under these considerations, we first show that the minimum error probability, averaged over all possible post-selected branches, cannot be reduced below the minimum error probability of discriminating the original input states. Then, we identify using specific example that specific post-selection outcomes under which the conditional discrimination can achieve strictly lower error probabilities than the original optimal measurement, illustrating that while post-selection does not improve average performance, it can enable better discrimination in certain branches of the post-selected ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01361v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filtering is an important technique in quantum computing used for isolating or enhancing some specific states of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we analyze the performance of filters based on the quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm, in which filtering removes states associated with bitstrings in the ancilla register above a given threshold. We show that when the conventional rectangular window function is used for the QPE input state, the resulting filter function exhibits an oscillating behavior known as the Gibbs phenomenon. We also show that in the case of the sine and Kaiser windows, this phenomenon is suppressed. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to compare the number of necessary queries to the Hamiltonian time evolution operation of for the QPE-based filtering algorithm and the quantum eigenvalue transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU). We find that the number of queries required for Kaiser window-based filtering is comparable to that for QETU with optimized phase angles. As an application of the QPE-based filter, we also study a two-step algorithm for low-energy spectral simulations, composed of a coarse grid for filtering and a fine grid for obtaining final high-resolution spectra. As a benchmark of the proposed scheme for realistic continuous spectra, we present the density-of-states (DOS) calculation of antiferromagnetic type-II MnO in a one-particle approximation.</description>

      <title>Low-depth quantum error correction via three-qubit gates in Rydberg atom arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires the execution of deep quantum circuits with large numbers of physical qubits to protect information against errors. Designing protocols that can reduce gate and space-time overheads of QEC is therefore crucial to enable more efficient QEC in near-term experiments. Multiqubit gates offer a natural path towards fast and low-depth stabilizer measurement circuits. However, they typically introduce high-weight correlated errors that can degrade the circuit-level distance, leading to slower scalings of the logical error probabilities. In this work, we show how to realize fast and efficient surface code stabilizer readout using only two singly-controlled $Z$ gates acting simultaneously on two target qubits, i.e. two $CZ_2$ gates -- instead of four $CZ$. We show that this scheme is fault-tolerant, and provide a blueprint for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays. We derive the time-optimal pulses implementing the gates and perform extensive QEC numerical simulations with Rydberg decay errors. Compared to the standard protocol using four $CZ$ gates, our scheme is faster, uses fewer gates and crucially maintains fault tolerance with comparable logical error probabilities. Fault-tolerant generalizations of this scheme to biased and erasure-dominant noise models, as well as to other QEC codes, such as quantum Low-Density Parity-Check codes, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Stability of Continuous Time Quantum Walks in Complex Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) in a range of network topologies under different decoherence mechanisms, defining stability as the system's ability to preserve quantum properties over time. The networks studied range from homogeneous to heterogeneous structures, including cycle, complete, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, small-world, scale-free, and star topologies. The decoherence models considered are energy-based intrinsic decoherence, node-based Haken-Strobl noise, and edge-based quantum stochastic walks (QSWs). To assess quantum stability, we employ several metrics: node occupation probabilities, $\ell_1$-norm of coherence fidelity with the initial state, quantum-classical distance, and von Neumann entropy. The stability ranking among network topologies varies depending on the decoherence model and the quantifier used. For example, we show that for Haken-Strobl noise, topologies like complete, star and scale-free with high degree nodes are most stable. Conversely, under the QSW decoherence, these same networks with initialization on high degree node becomes uniquely fragile, exhibiting rapid coherence loss. In general, networks such as star and scale-free networks, exhibit the highest stability in all cases except for QSW. However, these same networks, due to their high degree of localization, also show lower values of coherence even in the noiseless case, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between localization and coherence. Furthermore, in heterogenous networks, the centrality (degree or closeness) of the initialized node has a pronounced impact on stability, underscoring the critical role of local topological features in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is demonstrated that identifying information-theoretic limitations of quantum Bell nonlocality alone cannot completely distinguish quantum theory from generalized nonsignaling theories. To this end, an information-theoretic concept of certifying nonobjective information by the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction is employed. Furthermore, in the aforementioned demonstration, a partial answer to the question of what distinguishes quantum theory from generalized nonsignaling theories emerges beyond the one provided by the principle of information causality alone. This is accomplished by demonstrating that postquantum models identified by the information causality are isolated by the emergence of the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction of nonobjective information in Bell-local boxes of a nonsignaling model, over the other nonsignaling models.</description>

Our scheme extends the operative range of Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry beyond its intrinsic constraints due to photons indistinguishability, paving the way to applications in high-resolution imaging. We assess the experimental results against the ultimate precision bounds as determined by quantum estimation theory. Our experiment ultimately proves that transverse-momentum resolved measurements of fourth-order correlations in the fields can be employed to overcome spatial distinguishability between independent photons. The relevance of our results extends beyond sensing and imaging towards quantum information processing, as we show that partial photon distinguishability and entanglement impurity are not necessarily a nuisance in a technique that relies on two-photon interference.</description>

      <title>Qubit Mapping and Routing tailored to Advanced Quantum ISAs: Not as Costly as You Think</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Qubit mapping/routing is a critical stage in compilation for both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum computers, yet existing scalable methods typically impose several times the routing overhead in terms of circuit depth or duration. This inefficiency stems from a fundamental disconnect: compilers rely on an abstract routing model (e.g., three-CX-unrolled SWAP insertion) that completely ignores the idiosyncrasies of native gates supported by physical devices.
  Recent hardware breakthroughs have enabled high-precision implementations of diverse instruction set architectures (ISAs) beyond standard CX-based gates. Advanced ISAs involving gates such as $\mathrm{\sqrt{iSWAP}}$ and $\mathrm{ZZ}(\theta)$ gates offer superior circuit synthesis capabilities and can be realized with higher fidelities. However, systematic compiler optimization strategies tailored to these advanced ISAs are lacking.
  To address this, we propose Canopus, a unified qubit mapping/routing framework applicable to diverse quantum ISAs. Built upon the canonical representation of two-qubit gates, Canopus centers on qubit routing to perform deep co-optimization in an ISA-aware approach. Canopus leverages the two-qubit canonical representation and the monodromy polytope theory to model the synthesis cost for more intelligent SWAP insertion during qubit routing. We also formalize the commutation relations between two-qubit gates through the canonical form, providing a generalized approach to commutativity-based optimization. Experiments show that Canopus consistently reduces routing overhead by 15%-35% compared to state-of-the-art methods across various backend ISAs and device topologies. More broadly, this work establishes a coherent method for co-exploration of program patterns, quantum ISAs, and hardware topologies, yielding concrete guidelines for hardware-software co-design.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Reversible BCD Adder Architectures with Enhanced Speed and Reduced Quantum Cost for Next-Generation Computing</title>

Abstract: The quantum and reversible paradigm merges the principles of quantum mechanics and reversible computation to enable information-preserving processing. It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations.</description>

      <title>Fully quantum theory of strong-field driven tunable entangled multi-photon states in HHG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum high-harmonic generation (HHG) is a growing field of research with capabilities of providing high photon-number entangled states of light. However, there is an open debate regarding the theory level required for correctly describing the quantum aspects of HHG emission, such as squeezing or entanglement. Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems.</description>

      <title>A Grover-compatible manifold optimization algorithm for quantum search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grover's algorithm is a fundamental quantum algorithm that offers a quadratic speedup for the unstructured search problem by alternately applying physically implementable oracle and diffusion operators. In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $\mu$-Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $\mu = \tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - \kappa^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $\kappa = L_{\mathrm{Rie}} / \mu$, where $L_{\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient. Taking into account both the geometry of the unitary manifold and the special structure of the cost function, we show that $L_{\mathrm{Rie}} = O(\sqrt{N})$ for problem size $N = 2^n$. Consequently, the resulting iteration complexity is $O(\sqrt{N} \log(1/\varepsilon))$ for attaining an $\varepsilon$-accurate solution, which matches the quadratic speedup of $O(\sqrt{N})$ achieved by Grover's algorithm. These results demonstrate that an optimization-based viewpoint can offer fresh conceptual insights and lead to new advances in the design of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Pinball: A Cryogenic Predecoder for Surface Code Decoding Under Circuit-Level Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems based on the surface code, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key hurdle is the design of real-time quantum error correction (QEC) decoders, which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below useful levels in practical scenarios. Moreover, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization.
  To address these limitations, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder for the surface code tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to SOTA RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22nm FDSOI technology, we achieve peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 1.5 W 4 K power budget, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper unites two research lines. The first involves finding categorical models of quantum programming languages and their type systems. The second line concerns the program of quantization of mathematical structures, which amounts to finding noncommutative generalizations (also called quantum generalizations) of these structures. Using a quantization method called discrete quantization, which essentially amounts to the internalization of structures in a category of von Neumann algebras and quantum relations, we find a noncommutative generalization of $\omega$-complete partial orders (cpos), called quantum cpos. Cpos are central in domain theory, and are widely used to construct categorical models of programming languages. We show that quantum cpos have similar categorical properties to cpos and are therefore suitable for the construction of categorical models for quantum programming languages, which is illustrated with some examples. For this reason, quantum cpos may form the backbone of a future quantum domain theory.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Strongly anharmonic flux-tunable transmon based on InAs-Al 2D heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gatemon qubits, made of transparent superconducting-semiconducting Josephson junctions, typically have even weaker anharmonicity than the opaque AlOx-junction transmons. However, flux-frustrated gatemons can acquire a much stronger anharmonicity, originating from the interference of the higher-order harmonics of the supercurrent. Here we investigate this effect of enhanced anharmonicity in split-junction gatemon devices based on InAs-Al 2D heterostructure. We find that anharmonicity in excess of 100% can be routinely achieved at the half-integer flux sweet-spot without any need for electrical gating or excessive sensitivity to the offset charge noise. We verified that such intrinsically large anharmonicity enables our devices to be driven coherently with raw Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz, without any pulse shaping, simplifying implementation and control compared to traditional gatemons and transmons. Furthermore, by analyzing a relatively high-resolution spectroscopy of the device transitions as a function of flux, we were able to extract fine details of the current-phase relation, to which transport measurements would hardly be sensitive. The strong anharmonicity of our anharmonic tunable transmons, along with their bare-bones design, can prove to be a precious resource that transparent superconducting-semiconducting junctions bring to quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

Abstract: We propose the use of transition-edge sensor (TES) single-photon detectors as a simultaneous target and sensor for direct dark matter searches, and report results from the first search of this kind. We perform a 489 h science run with a TES device optimized for the detection of 1064 nm photons, with a mass of ~0.2 ng and an energy threshold of ~0.3 eV, and set new limits on dark matter interactions with both electrons and nucleons for dark matter with mass below the MeV scale. With their excellent energy resolution, TESs enable search strategies that are complementary to recent results from superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors and kinetic inductance detectors. We show that next-generation TES arrays hold promise to probe new regions of light dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01654v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By exciting the transverse breathing mode of an elongated Bose-Einstein condensate, we parametrically produce longitudinal collective excitations in a pairwise manner. This process also referred to as Faraday wave generation, can be seen as an analog to cosmological particle production. Building upon single particle detection, we investigate the early time dynamics of the exponential growth and compare our observations with a Bogoliubov description. The growth rate we observe experimentally is in very good agreement with theoretical predictions, demonstrating the validity of the Bogoliubov description and thereby confirming the smallness of quasiparticle interactions in such an elongated gas. We also discuss the presence of oscillations in the atom number, which are due to pair correlations and to the rate at which interactions are switched off.</description>

      <title>A Further Comparison of MPS and TTNS for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks, such as matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS), are powerful ans\"atze for simulating quantum dynamics. While both ans\"atze are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2024, 20, 8767-8781] reported a non-negligible discrepancy in its calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for MPS and TTNS. By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we reduce the relative difference in occupancy for weakly populated electronic states from up to 60% towards the end of the simulation to less than 10% and the absolute difference from 0.05 to 0.005. We also discuss the impact of tensor network structures on accuracy and efficiency, with the difference further reduced by an optimized TTNS structure. Our results confirm that both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.</description>

A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Electron Transfer in the Barrierless and Marcus-Inverted Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01909v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here it is shown that in the adiabatic limit of condensed-phase electron transfer, the onset of barrierless transition occurs at a lower driving force than predicted by the non-adiabatic Marcus formulation. Furthermore, in the adiabatic limit of the Marcus-inverted region, the standard mechanism of electron transfer becomes topologically forbidden. This behavior arises from a topological change in the mapping between the adiabatic and diabatic electronic surfaces, emerging precisely at the onset of the Marcus-inverted region. In this case, alternative mechanisms such as tunneling and non-radiative decay may dominate the rate, typically orders of magnitude slower than the rate calculated from Marcus theory.</description>

      <title>Anyon Quasilocalization in a Quasicrystalline Toric Code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exactly solvable model of a quantum spin liquid on a quasicrystal, akin to Kitaev's honeycomb model, was introduced in Kim \textit{et al.}, \href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.110.214438}{\text{Phys. Rev. B} \textbf{110}, 214438 (2024)}. It was shown that in contrast to the translationally invariant models, such a spin liquid stabilizes a gapped ground state with a finite irrational flux density. In this work, we analyze the strong bond-anisotropic limit of the model and demonstrate that the aperiodic lattice geometry naturally generates a hierarchy of exponentially separated coupling constants in the resulting toric code Hamiltonian. Furthermore, a perturbative magnetic field leads to anomalous localization properties where an anyonic excitation sequentially delocalizes over subsets of sites forming equipotential contours in the quasicrystal. In addition, certain background flux configurations, together with the underlying geometry, give rise to strictly localized eigenstates that remain decoupled from the rest of the spectrum. Using numerical studies, we uncover the key mechanisms responsible for this unconventional localization behavior. Our study highlights that topologically ordered phases, in the presence of geometrical constraints can lead to highly anomalous localization properties of fractionalized charges.</description>

      <title>A Lifting Theorem for Hybrid Classical-Quantum Communication Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigates a model of hybrid classical-quantum communication complexity, in which two parties first exchange classical messages and subsequently communicate using quantum messages. We study the trade-off between the classical and quantum communication for composed functions of the form $f\circ G^n$, where $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{\pm1\}$ and $G$ is an inner product function of $\Theta(\log n)$ bits. To prove the trade-off, we establish a novel lifting theorem for hybrid communication complexity. This theorem unifies two previously separate lifting paradigms: the query-to-communication lifting framework for classical communication complexity and the approximate-degree-to-generalized-discrepancy lifting methods for quantum communication complexity. Our hybrid lifting theorem therefore offers a new framework for proving lower bounds in hybrid classical-quantum communication models.
  As a corollary, we show that any hybrid protocol communicating $c$ classical bits followed by $q$ qubits to compute $f\circ G^n$ must satisfy $c+q^2=\Omega\big(\max\{\mathrm{deg}(f),\mathrm{bs}(f)\}\cdot\log n\big)$, where $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is the degree of $f$ and $\mathrm{bs}(f)$ is the block sensitivity of $f$. For read-once formula $f$, this yields an almost tight trade-off: either they have to exchange $\Theta\big(n\cdot\log n\big)$ classical bits or $\widetilde\Theta\big(\sqrt n\cdot\log n\big)$ qubits, showing that classical pre-processing cannot significantly reduce the quantum communication required. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first non-trivial trade-off between classical and quantum communication in hybrid two-way communication complexity.</description>

      <title>Escaping AB caging via Floquet engineering: photo-induced long-range interference in an all-band-flat model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flat-band lattices hosting compact localized states are highly sensitive to external modulation, and the tailored design of a perturbation to imprint specific features becomes relevant. Here we show that periodic driving in the high-frequency regime transforms the all-flat-band diamond chain into one featuring two tunable quasi-flat bands and a residual flat band pinned at $E=0$. The interplay between lattice geometry and the symmetries of the driven system gives rise to drive-induced tunneling processes that redefine the interference conditions and open a controllable route to escaping Aharonov-Bohm caging. Under driving, the diamond chain effectively acquires the geometry of a dimerized lattice, exhibiting charge oscillations between opposite boundaries. This feature can be exploited to generate two-particle entanglement that is directly accessible experimentally. The resulting drive-engineered quasi-flat bands thus provide a versatile platform for manipulating quantum correlations, revealing a direct link between spectral fine structure and dynamical entanglement.</description>
