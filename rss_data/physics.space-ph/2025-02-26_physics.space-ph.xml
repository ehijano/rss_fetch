      <title>Debye-scale electrostatic waves across quasi-perpendicular shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of the properties of short-scale electrostatic waves across collisionless shocks remains an open question. We use a method based on the interferometry of the electric field measured aboard the magnetospheric multiscale spacecraft to analyze the evolution of the properties of electrostatic waves across four quasi-perpendicular shocks, with $1.4 \leq M_A \leq 4.2$ and $66^\circ \leq \theta_{Bn} \leq 87^\circ$. Most of the analyzed wave bursts across all four shocks have a frequency in the plasma frame $f_{pl}$ lower than the ion plasma frequency $f_{pi}$ and a wavelength on the order of 20 Debye lengths $\lambda_D$. Their direction of propagation is predominantly field-aligned upstream and downstream of the bow shock, while it is highly oblique within the shock transition region, which might indicate a shift in their generation mechanism. The similarity in wave properties between the analyzed shocks, despite their different shock parameters, indicates the fundamental nature of electrostatic waves for the dynamics of collisionless shocks.</description>

      <title>Measurement of energy reduction by inertial Alfv\'en waves propagating through parallel gradients in the Alfv\'en speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have studied the propagation of inertial Alfv\'en waves through parallel gradients in the Alfv\'en speed using the Large Plasma Device at the University of California, Los Angeles. The reflection and transmission of Alfv\'en waves through inhomogeneities in the background plasma is important for understanding wave propagation, turbulence, and heating in space, laboratory, and astrophysical plasmas. Here we \rev{present inertial Alfv\'en waves, under conditions relevant to solar flares and the solar corona. We find} that the transmission of the inertial Alfv\'en waves is reduced as the sharpness of the gradient is increased. Any reflected waves were below the detection limit of our experiment and reflection cannot account for all of the energy not transmitted through the gradient. Our findings indicate that, for both kinetic and inertial Alfv\'en waves, the controlling parameter for the transmission of the waves through an Alfv\'en speed gradient is the ratio of the Alfv\'en wavelength along the gradient divided by the scale length of the gradient. Furthermore, our results suggest that an as-yet-unidentified damping process occurs in the gradient.</description>

      <title>Radial dependence of ion fluences in the 2023 July 17 SEP event from Parker Solar Probe to STEREO and ACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the latter moments of 17 July 2023, the solar active region 13363, near the southwestern face of the Sun, was undergoing considerable evolution, which resulted in a significant solar energetic particle (SEP) event measured by Parker Solar Probe's Integrated Science Investigation of the Sun (ISOIS) and near-Earth spacecraft. Remote observations from GOES and CHASE captured two M5.0+ solar flares that peaked at 23:34 and 00:06 UT from the source region. In tandem, STEREO COR2 first recorded a small, narrow coronal mass ejection (CME) emerging at 22:54 UT and then saw a major halo CME emerge at 23:43 UT with a bright, rapidly expanding core and CME-driven magnetic shock with an estimated speed of $\sim$1400 $kms^{-1}$. Parker Solar Probe was positioned at 0.65 au, near-perfectly on the nominal Parker spiral magnetic field line which connected Earth and the active region for a 537 $kms^{-1}$ ambient solar wind speed at L1. This fortuitous alignment provided the opportunity to examine how the SEP velocity dispersion, energy spectra, elemental composition, and fluence varied from 0.65 to 1 au along a shared magnetic connection to the Sun. We find a strong radial gradient, which is best characterized for H and He as $r^{-4.0}$ and most surprisingly is stronger for O and Fe which is better described by $r^{-5.7}$.</description>

      <title>Statistical Analyses of Solar Active Region in SDO/HMI Magnetograms detected by Unsupervised Machine Learning Method DSARD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) are the places hosting the majority of solar eruptions. Studying the evolution and morphological features of ARs is not only of great significance to the understanding of the physical mechanisms of solar eruptions, but also beneficial for the hazardous space weather forecast. An automated DBSCAN-based Solar Active Regions Detection (DSARD) method for solar ARs observed in magnetograms is developed in this work, which is based on an unsupervised machine learning algorithm called Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). The method is then employed to identify ARs on the magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) during solar cycle 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25. The distributions of the number, area, magnetic flux, and the tilt angle of bipolar of ARs in latitudes and time intervals during solar cycle 24, as well as the butterfly diagram and drift velocities are obtained. Most of these statistical results based on our method are in agreement with previous studies, which also guarantees the validity of the method. In particular, the dipole tilt angles in ARs in solar cycle 24 and the rising phase of solar cycle 25 are analyzed which reveal that 13% and 16% of ARs, respectively, violate Hale's law.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Space Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article describes experiments in space which measure charged cosmic ray particles in the range from $10\,\mathrm{GV}$ to $10^5\,\mathrm{GV}$ of magnetic rigidity $p/(Ze)$. In this energy range, cosmic rays are expected to originate from sources in the Milky Way and be confined to our galaxy. Spectra of nuclei and their chemical composition are discussed. The spectrum of antiprotons and the search for heavier anti-nuclei are covered. All spectra and especially those of electrons and positrons are analysed for indications of unconventional particle sources, acceleration or transport mechanisms.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Model of Solar Wind Acceleration Driven by Ambipolar Electric Potential and Velocity-Space Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations revealed that most of the solar wind acceleration occurs very close to the Sun. This acceleration is partly due to the global electric potential originating from the mass disparity between electrons and protons, coupled with the constraints of charge quasi-neutrality and zero-current conditions in the solar wind plasma. However, the exact mechanism that accounts for the remaining acceleration is still not identified. We aim to provide a framework incorporating the electric field-driven component of the acceleration while also introducing an additional acceleration mechanism via velocity-space diffusion of the particles. This will help us determine the extent of extra acceleration, beyond the electric field-driven component, required to fully reproduce the acceleration of the solar wind in theoretical models. We modified an existing kinetic exospheric model to account for the unexplained solar wind acceleration by including velocity-space diffusion. We compared the electric field derived from the sunward deficit of velocity distribution functions observed by PSP between 13.3 and 50 solar radii ($R_s$) with the electric field found self-consistently by the kinetic exospheric model. The effect of velocity-space diffusion is found to reduce the temperature anisotropy and impact the solar wind acceleration while maintaining the electric potential unchanged. Our approach allows for adjusting the diffusion to effectively reduce or increase the solar wind acceleration, providing a way to account for the unexplained acceleration within the kinetic exospheric framework. It is found that, even without diffusion, the model can reproduce the anticorrelation between the electric potential and the solar wind terminal velocity found by PSP. This suggests that the electric potential might still be of major importance in explaining the solar wind acceleration.</description>

      <title>Eulerian and Lagrangian electron energization during magnetic reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron energization by magnetic reconnection has historically been studied in the Lagrangian guiding-center framework. Insights from such studies include that Fermi acceleration in magnetic islands can accelerate electrons to high energies. An alternative Eulerian fluid formulation of electron energization was recently used to study electron energization during magnetic reconnection in the absence of magnetic islands. Here, we use particle-in-cell simulations to compare the Eulerian and Lagrangian models of electron energization in a setup where reconnection leads to magnetic island formation. We find the largest energization at the edges of magnetic islands. There, energization related to the diamagnetic drift dominates in the Eulerian model, while the Fermi related term dominates in the Lagrangian model. The models predict significantly different energization rates locally. A better agreement is found after integrating over the simulation domain. We show that strong magnetic curvature can break the magnetic moment conservation assumed by the Lagrangian model, leading to erroneous results. The Eulerian fluid model is a complete fluid description and accurately models bulk energization. However, local measurements of its constituent energization terms need not reflect locations where plasma is heated or accelerated. The Lagrangian guiding center model can accurately describe the energization of particles, but it cannot describe the evolution of the fluid energy. We conclude that while both models can be valid, they describe two fundamentally different quantities, and care should be taken when choosing which model to use.</description>
